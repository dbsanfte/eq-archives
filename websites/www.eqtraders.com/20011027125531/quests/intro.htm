            <h3> Introduction to the Thurgadin Shawl Quests </h3>
            <p> Welcome to the wonderful world of the shawls! The most exciting, 
              entertaining, and action-packed quests ever seen in the land of 
              Norrath! 
            <p> Weeell, not exactly.... 
            <p> Most people who have gotten very far with the shawl quest find 
              themselves in a Love/Hate relationship. The thing about the shawls 
              is that they require a LOT of work. Ok, here, take the amount of 
              work that you are right now envisioning you will need to put into 
              the whole thing, getting from nothing to the seventh shawl. Now, 
              if you are a pessimist by nature, multiply that amount by ten. If 
              you are an optimist by nature, multiply it by a hundred. 
            <p> That is how much effort will go into just getting your tailoring 
              where it needs to be to complete the sixth shawl. 
            <p> You also need to get your baking, brewing, fletching, jewelcraft 
              and pottery all up to similar levels. You need to get items off 
              of creatures in Iceclad, East Wastes, Kael Drakkel, Cobalt Scar, 
              Great Divide, Siren's Grotto, and Velketor's Labyrinth, among others. 
              Some of these critters cannot be soloed by a single person of any 
              level or class. Unless your trade skills are all already where they 
              need to be, you WILL NOT have this shawl with only a week of work...and 
              even if your skills are all up there, you'll need a lot, a lot lot 
              lot of time and help to get it that fast. I think of this as the 
              Epic Quest for tradeskillers. With all the time required to get 
              my skills up and do some research and collect obscure stuff, I know 
              I have easily spent as much time on this thing as I did on my shaman 
              epic weapon...and while I have my sparkly spear, I am still wearing 
              my fifth shawl since I can't get a success on the sixth. 
            <p> My point is that you should not take this quest lightly. I cannot 
              describe the woe in an experienced shawl quester's heart when they 
              talk to someone who is collecting components for the fifth shawl 
              even though their tailoring is at 30. 
            <p> <i>Verdandi sighs and fingers her fifth shawl.</i> 
            <p> Now, that said...I obviously love this quest and love trade skills 
              or else I would not have taken the time to compile walkthroughs 
              like this to help others through it. I just want you to realize 
              with crystal clear understanding the magnitude of what you are undertaking 
              before you make yourself and the rest of Norrath miserable. 
            <p> The demands of the shawl are great. So are the rewards. And the 
              headaches in between the two. 
            <p> One note for the faction-conscious: this quest will require the 
              deaths of quite a few giants and their wolves. If you are aligned 
              with the giants and Coldain against the dragons, you will want to 
              make sure you are willing to sacrifice some giant faction (or the 
              time to repair it), or have friends willing to invest a LOT of time 
              helping you collect things. In some cases you can buy what you need 
              from others, but you'll still have to be extra careful if you want 
              to maintain giant faction. 
            <p> Still with me? Alright, let's get to work! 
            <p> 
            <h4> How to Use this Guide </h4>
            <p> I tried to make this as useful as possible to as wide an audience 
              as possible, with an emphasis on the trade skills required. I know 
              that some people just want the npc text and want to figure out the 
              rest for themselves. Some people couldn't care less about the npcs 
              and their plot and just want the freakin shawl already. So I have 
              separated out the two sets of information, except for the page for 
              the first two shawls since there is so little to say about them. 
            <p> Suggestions for ways to improve are always welcome. Eventually 
              I will add in more frills like complete stats and screenshots of 
              the various shawls and items made in the process. 
            <p> 
            <h4> "What is the quickest way to raise Xxxxxx skill?" </h4>
            <p> There is a good guide to raising skills for the shawl quests at 
              <a href="http://portnoy.uninterruptible.com/~cpaul/shawl.html">This 
              Link</a>. If you want someone to do the thinking for you try this 
              first. 
            <p> However, EQ Traders is a comprehensive site that tries to offer 
              every conceivable tidbit of information that may be useful to a 
              tradesperson. Therefore, if you have any specific questions or want 
              to do the thinking for yourself (hurray!), then I suggest you take 
              the following steps, either to find your particular answer or just 
              to familiarize yourself with the site: 
            <p> First, go to the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes.htm">EQ 
              Traders Recipes</a> page. Select the skill you would like to improve. 
              Print that page. Then go to <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/supplies.htm#skill">Supplies 
              sorted by Skill</a> and again select the skill you want to improve. 
              Print that page. 
            <p> To figure out how to raise your skill to the level you desire, 
              look over both pages that you just printed. Specifically, look for 
              recipes that require ingredients that you know you can find easily 
              and/or that are listed on the supplies page as available somewhere 
              within reason. For some skills like jewelcraft, fletching, or pottery, 
              just about everything will be on vendors if you find a good city 
              in which to work. For other skills you may have to do a bit of newbie 
              vendor farming or auctioning or even rolling up of your sleeves 
              and killing. 
            <p> Once you get a feel for which recipes are feasible and which are 
              not, look at where they become trivial and plan out an order to 
              do them from easiest to hardest. It is possible to go from 0 to 
              130 on a single recipe that trivials at 130, if you wish. But it 
              is probably faster and definitely less tedious if you use at least 
              a few different recipes that trivial at gradually higher levels. 
              Unless you are dealing with some really expensive stuff, like in 
              jewelcraft, aim for things that are trivial 10-20 points of skill 
              above where you are. This isn't always possible, but many folks 
              report that this is roughly where you will improve the fastest. 
            <p> If you want to give this trade skill stuff an honest try, look 
              for a few recipes that sound fun (Gnome Kabobs!) and throw them 
              in for the heck of it. When working up your skill, keep in mind 
              that just because something is trivial does not mean that you are 
              <i>guaranteed</i> to succeed. Depending on the value of your ingredients 
              and the cost and trouble of increasing your skill, it may be worth 
              it to get 10-20 points of skill beyond where the item trivials. 
              Likewise, if a skill is very hard to raise and your quest ingredients 
              are easier to get, you might be better off making several attempts 
              at a skill below trivial than to try to get to trivial skill first. 
            <p> If you still have problems or questions, make sure that you have 
              read *everything* on the pages you already printed, and then go 
              to <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/learn.htm">Learn a Skill</a> 
              and select the relevant skill and read all of that. Question not 
              yet answered? Try the <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm61">FAQ</a>. 
              They are called frequently asked questions because many people ask 
              them. If many people ask them then you might well be asking the 
              same thing. Answer still not there? Ok now, go to the <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/beqtraderscorner">Message 
              Boards</a> and select your skill. Post your specific question. Depending 
              on the time of day and week of your post, answers will appear within 
              minutes or hours. When you have made it to the level you desire 
              in your current trade skill, pat yourself on the back! You are that 
              much closer to your shawl. 
            <p> Do <b>NOT</b> under any circumstances go straight to the message 
              boards without first checking all of the existing resources. Especially 
              do NOT post "What's the quickest way to improve Xxxxxx skill?". 
              There are at least twenty posts on that very same topic on the boards 
              for every single skill, so if you insist you can go there and look 
              for them and see what has been posted in response. All of the answers 
              to those posts are based on people looking at the links I've given 
              you above and regurgitating it for you. That level of helplessness 
              is annoying. The EZ Board search engine is lousy at best, but it 
              won't kill you to flip back through the pages of posts and skim 
              the titles. You're not the first person to work on your skill, so 
              chances are very slim that you have a question that has not yet 
              been answered. Folks on the boards love helping with honest questions 
              and problems and dilemmas, but do not appreciate being treated like 
              personal researchers when the answer is just a few clicks away on 
              the very same site. If you've looked and just can't find it, then 
              by all means post. Sometimes it's right there and you just miss 
              it, no sweat. But just make an attempt to look through what has 
              been created here for you first, k? 
            <p> 
            <h4> Suggestions, Corrections, and Updates </h4>
            <p> Please post any feedback about the shawl quest pages <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm11">here</a>. 
              I read the boards religiously and will get it updated much more 
              quickly if it's here and not buried in email. We will also get feedback 
              from the rest of the tradeskill community this way. Note: If you 
              hunt me down in Norrath for any purpose other than to offer me gifts 
              of great value, I will growl fiercely in your general direction 
              and be grumpy and uncooperative. You will get much better results 
              if you pursue your questions here on EQ Traders! 
            <p> In many places I do not have precise trivial levels, but instead 
              have a range (160-165) or a maximum (<140) or minimum (>132). Please 
              post if you can narrow the ranges down at all for those, or have 
              corrections to trivials that you found to be incorrect. 
            <p> 
            <h4> Credits </h4>
            <p> Not much of what is on these pages is fresh from my own brain. 
              The vast majority of it is information that I gathered from sites 
              all over the place, including our own <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com">EQ 
              Traders</a>, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com">Allakhazam</a>, 
              <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com">Illia's Bestiary</a>, 
              <a href="http://www.geocities.com/dragonslayers_eq">The Dragonslayers 
              Guild</a>, <a href="http://portnoy.uninterruptible.com/~cpaul/shawl.html">Xilith 
              Tvyn's Coldain Prayer Shawl Quest summary</a>, and all the folks 
              who posted their findings on these sites to make things easier for 
              the rest of us. And last but most certainly not least, I owe thanks 
              to my friends and family on the Karana server who have helped me 
              along in the quest with their various skills, including Sumamael 
              and Cantatus (editors extraordinaire), Wathakhorforpyne (for a looong 
              evening of griffon tracking), Xlint (efficiently killing sirens 
              when not charmed and blasting me to bits), Kyren (for the many gifts 
              of foraged food), Savant (for countless acts of enchanterly generosity 
              to an impatient tailor), and Calandria, Ganelon, and Dano for all 
              around support. I owe a great debt to these and all my other faithful 
              friends who listened patiently to my ranting and then quietly hauled 
              me off to take out my frustrations on unsuspecting mobs.
