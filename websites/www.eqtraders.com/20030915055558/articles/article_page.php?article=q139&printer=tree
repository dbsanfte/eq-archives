<span class="headers">Seru Bane Weapons</span>
<p>
<p>
Weapons with the Seru Bane attribute are needed to be able to damage Lord Inquisitor Seru through normal melee. Procs on non bane weapons will land on him, but to keep up a continuous run of ‘normal’ melee damage, you need a Seru weapon with Bane DMG: Seru +# to be able to hit him. 
</p> 
<p>
Lord Inquisitor Seru is located in Sanctus Seru, and all of the items needed to make Seru Bane weapons are located in various zones of the SoL expansion. You will be traveling around and camping various things to make these weapons, so do not expect it to be as simple as making things such as normal forged weapons. 
</p> 
<p>
<strong>The original text for making the Seru Bane weapons: </strong>
</p> 
<p>
Book 1: <br />
 <u>Day 1</u><br />
 Today is a great day, so I shall begin this journal. The High Inquisitor has called for my skilled hand to create for him a set of armor, which cannot be pierced by any weapon. This is to be my last chance to be in good grace with Lord Seru, though I have denounced Katta I assume they can still sense that I miss my family. Regardless, I shall begin working with the materials that were supplied to me in the morning. 
</p> 
<p>
<u>Day 2</u><br />
 Creation is going steady; the ore is melting to my expectations. This metal, which I have named Yttrium, should not be able to be pierced. I have sent for items to help tint the armor as Lord Seru requests. 
</p> 
<p>
<u>Day 10</u><br />
 With the greaves complete I begin working on the Breastplate soon. I have discovered how to make perfect Yttrium Sheets so production should go faster. Mixing two bricks of Yttruim ore, with one Vial of Quicksilver Temper creates the perfect sheet. The Quicksilver Temper is a harder mixture though, I must request ingredients be brought to me often, they seem to be hard to come by. For the perfect hue I have been brewing one part Fungoid Sap, one part Meteor Dust, one part Shissar Blood, and one part Shiknar Ichor. I do not know where the Consillium of the Hand is acquiring these ingredients, nor do I care, as long as I can present Lord Seru with a fine set of armor. 
</p> 
<p>
<u>Day 18</u><br />
 I have finished Lord Seru's Breastplate and just returned from presenting the Praesertum with it. They shall take it to him soon, so I should get word in a week. I shall wait to see if this is enough to please Lord Seru. I shall begin work on weapons that can match the armor, in the case that it doesn't. 
</p> 
<p>
<br />
 Book 2: <br />
<u>Day 22</u><br />
 Success! I have created an entire arsenal that should be able to strike through his armor. I had the most success using the following: A Pommel Mold, Hilt Mold, one Vial of Quicksilver Temper, one Yttrium Steel Sheet, and either a Dagger, Short, Curved, or Long Blade mold created a fine blade. An Oak Shaft, one Vial of Quicksilver Temper, one Yttrium Steel Sheet, and either a Mace, Hammer, or Axe Head Mold created heavier, powerful weapons. For a powerful set of gloves, I used two High Quality Rockhopper Pelts, one Vial of Quicksilver Temper, and one Yttrium Steel Sheet. A bow made with an Oak Bow Staff, a Silk String, a Planing Tool, one Yttrium Sheet Metal, and one Vial of Quicksilver Temper imbues any arrow shot from it with the same properties. Should I be banished, I will create these weapons for Recuso to destroy Seru. 
</p> 
<p>
<u>Day 25</u><br />
 The inevitable has happened. My time for the question has arisen, even though too soon. I failed because of my longing for my family Katta. I know their ways are wrong but I of course still love them. I write into this log from a land of destitution, I have been named a Recuso. 
</p> 
<p>
<u>Day 49</u><br />
 A few days ago in search of shelter from the rain I stumbled inside this place. What is this place... my nightmares become reality. I feel as though I am being watched with every step. I can not remember the way out, I can not remember... anything. 
</p> 
<p>
Quicksilver Temper is brewed and trivial below 180. The Yttrium Steel Sheet has a high trivial somewhere above 250. Both of these items are droppable. The final combines' trivial levels are in the mid to upper 100s. The final weapons are no drop, so you have to produce them yourself. 
</p> 
<p>
<strong>Combines in brief: </strong><br />
 A VIAL OF QUICKSILVER TEMPER: shissar blood + shiknar ichor + fungoid sap + meteor dust <br />
 YTTRIUM SHEET METAL: 2 small bricks of yttrium ore + quicksilver temper 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Shissar blood can be found on the snake-type shissar mobs in Luclin, mainly in Ssra. temple, and also available in the grey. </li> 
<li> Fungoid sap is only dropped off An Ancient Shrieker, which resides in the Deep. There are a couple of camps of them on the far side of the invisible bridge. They are not KoS and do not assist each other. Drop rate is said to be uncommon-rare. </li> 
<li> Meteor dust is found mainly in the Grey, from Shattered golems, shissar style mobs, and rarely from the skeleton version of the sun revenants. </li> 
<li> Shiknar ichor is found on the Shik'nar bug type mobs in Fungus grove. Any form of Shik'nar insect can drop it. 
</ul> <hr>
