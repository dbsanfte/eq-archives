                  you who have been with EQTC since the launch of Luclin (or before), 
                  know that things are about to get VERY busy around here. The 
                  site <i>will</i> load more slowly as thousands of eager folks 
                  try to get the most up-to-date information on the new recipes, 
                  vendors, etc. The boards will also be hit <i>extremely</i> hard. 
                  I, and the rest of the EQTC staff, will be sifting through tons 
                  of posts, trying to cobble together complete and accurate recipe 
                  listings and vendor listings, (as well as dealing with any of 
                  the curve balls that real life seems to like throwing at times 
                  like this).</font>

                  the rest of you do to help as Planes of Power launches tomorrow?

                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Be patient 
                    - the site and boards will likely load more slowly, as you 
                    won't be the only one eager for information. Excited folks 
                    will likely be mis-posting anywhere and everywhere in their 
                    desire to be &quot;first&quot; to report in information, and 
                    tempers will get quickly frayed. It <i>will</i> take time 
                    for information to be processed from the boards and put on 
                    the site. Reloading 10 times in half an hour won't change 
                    that fact, and likely will make updates even slower, as we 
                    have to wade through that same slow loading time to read the 
                    information and push updates to the site.</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Be complete 
                    and accurate - if you don't provide all the necessary information 
                    in your post, you can't expect the information on the site 
                    to be correct. You're also likely making more work for the 
                    staff as we respond to your post asking for clarification 
                    (vendor name, loc, exact inventory, etc., etc.) </font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Watch 
                    where you're posting - I'm setting up two temporary forums, 
                    much like we did for Luclin. One forum will be for general 
                    questions, comments, and conversation. A second forum is ONLY 
                    for recipes, trivials and vendor data. Any stray conversation 
                    in the recipes foum WILL be deleted. As with any &quot;data 
                    only&quot; sticky threads in the various forums, we will be 
                    actively enforcing this, as it speeds up the process of getting 
                    information from the message boards onto the main site.</font></li>

                    Yes, this bears repeating ... and repeating ... and repeating. 
                    If you're relatively new to the site, you may be surprised 
                    at what happens on the site and the boards in the next week 
                    or so. If you've been with EQTC for a year or more, you likely 
                    can guess how crazed it's about to be around here.</font></li>

                  to be a horrifically busy time for the site, but with the help 
                  of the community, it will hopefully be one of the smoother expansions 
                  with regards to the level of chaos it brings to the site.</font> 
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For those 
                  who hadn't noticed, the Oct. 16 patch had a stealth &quot;gift&quot; 
                  for tradeskillers with regards to a new general AA ability. 
                  Those tradeskillers that are level 51 or higher, are allowed 
                  to spend 3 AA points to train in New Tanaan Crafting Mastery. 
                  This allows them to bring a <i>second</i> main tradeskill (baking, 
                  smithing, brewing, fletching, jewelcraft, pottery, tailoring) 
                  above the 200 cap. With the expenditure of more points, GM tradeskillers 
                  can bring others of these skills above the 200 mark as well.</font>

                  is going to put a HUGE stress on the site, on the boards, and 
                  on the staff. Please do your part to look for sticky topics

                  I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate the aid that Rory 
                  gave us in our time of need. It is very likely that EQTC would 
                  have had to close it's doors (or be merged into one of the fee-based

                  costs, and costs will continue to grow, especially once PoP 
                  launches in another month and a half (Luclin more than doubled 
                  our site traffice for a while, and increased message board traffic 
                  10-fold.) However, we <i>hope</i> to continue managing to tread 
                  water financially, thanks to those of you that are clicking 
                  on that PayPal icon over to the left, and making donations. 
                  Time will tell. In the meantime, we will continue our struggle

                  going to think on it a bit longer before we make a decision. 
                  Given the hassles inherent with the second option, we may end

                  to see a few other item tweaks next patch, such as to the stats 
                  of the Cazic Thule armor and weapons, stackability of Tae Ew

                  all the armors (I'm about a third of the way through the cultural 
                  sets now), I'll tackle the smithed weapons. Those of you with

                  dual-wielding computers for quite a while now, as it allows 
                  me to work on site updates at the same time I am performing 
                  research in-game, wield both my accounts at once to have easier

                  made arrangements to have both my office and Ngreth's office 
                  redone, with setups that should make them much more comfortable 
                  workplaces. We've been planning this for a couple months, and 
                  yesterday the movers arrived to box up everything in my office, 
                  so the folks could come in today with the custom setup for my 
                  office. Ngreth's office was to follow next Tuesday. Unfortunately, 
                  some wires were crossed somewhere (I blame Bristlebane, may 
                  all his toe fur fall off!), and the installers showed up today 
                  with <i>Ngreth's</i> office setup, not mine. They're not even 
                  done building mine. Soooo ... Ngreth and two installers are

                  am working off a card table set up in my almost-empty office. 
                  I'll be working off this setup until Tuesday morning, at which 
                  time I re-disassemble everything and pray there are no more

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I have 
                  several things to highlight today:</font></p>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The new 
                    smithing recipes and trivials are slowly trickling in, and 
                    I have some requests to make, based on the first day's worth 
                    of data. Please be sure that when you're reporting on stats 
                    for new items, that you're including race/class/weight information. 
                    I know it takes a few extra moments to scribble it all down, 
                    but it really makes a difference on the completeness of information 
                    for the site. Please make sure you're clearly stating trivials 
                    - there's a difference between &quot;trivial 222&quot; and 
                    &quot;trivial &lt;=222&quot;. Make sure you're being fully 
                    clear if you know the <i>exact</i> trivial vs. it being trivial 
                    at that point or some point below. Please be sure that when 
                    you're reporting new trivials on old cultural items that you 
                    are explicitly stating whether you're working in racial chain 
                    or plate for things like dark elven and high elven armors. 
                    It may seem like a little thing, but when we're already dealing 
                    with normal, enchanted, and imbued/enchanted armor, I refuse 
                    to &quot;assume&quot; that I know which set you're talking 
                    about.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">That 
                    having been said, there is a lot of data already on the appropriate 
                    smithing pages. If you find a smithing page that does <i>not</i> 
                    include two trivial colums (old &amp; new), then I have not 
                    yet processed any new information for that specific group 
                    of items. This may mean that nobody has submitted any new 
                    information, or it may just mean that I've not reached that 
                    part of the huge pile of updates that have been dropped in 
                    my lap.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yes, 
                    I'm aware that pretty much every smithing guide in the Learn 
                    Smithing section is now totally outdated. This situation isn't 
                    likely to change until new trivials are more fully nailed 
                    down and folks start submitting new guides based on that information.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've 
                    managed to verifiy race changes to halfling cultural tailored 
                    armor, but folks are slow in reporting in whether <i>other</i> 
                    of the new cultural items that were added on May 5 have had 
                    stats changed based on yesterday's patch. Wood elves, especially, 
                    please check all those lovely tailored armors of yours, and 
                    report in if anything has changed with your armor. (I'm hoping 
                    half elf was added to the sets.)</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Contrary 
                    to yesterday's patch message, enchanted clay is still not 
                    stacking. Whoops! </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">More 
                    updates have been done to the <a href="quests/potc_intro.htm">PoTC 
                    quest writeup</a>, including the addition of the non-tradeskill 
                    spell-only version of the quest. It still needs a lot of fleshing 
                    out, but that's going to take more time than I currently have.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The mailbox 
                    to which all my private EZBoard messages are sent is beyond 
                    overflowing with viruses, trojan horses, spam, unwanted trash 
                    as well as various stray emails from folks who need my attention. 
                    I'm afraid to say that I'm beyond behind responding to any 
                    real mail that might be lurking in that mailbox, and it's 
                    not likely to change any time in the near future. In some 
                    cases, I <i>cannot</i> respond as the people in question have 
                    not included any email address in their message (EZBoards 
                    doesn't include your email addy on private messages). Additionally, 
                    I'm having problems with my ISP that I use for <i>the rest</i> 
                    of my email, and it's been timing out left, right, sideways 
                    and diagonally for the last several days. For the dozen or 
                    so of you offering to take over the fashion section, however, 
                    I'm going to close down that section of the site. Due to a 
                    horde of problems, as well as system load, it's not feasible 
                    for this site to track every single new/old set of player-made 
                    armor and track two versions of the graphics for them (with 
                    and without Luclin models).</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Folks 
                    have started emailing moderators when they have problems registering 
                    an EZBoard account. Unfortunately, we don't own EZBoards, 
                    so it's rather hard for us to troubleshoot these. You'll want 
                    to report such problems in directly to the EZBoard <a href="http://pub121.ezboard.com/fezboardaccountproblemsfrm1" target="_new">Login/Support 
                    Forum</a> and see if they can help. (You don't need to be 
                    registered/logged in to post to that forum.)</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've 
                    developed zero tolerance for certain antics on the message 
                    boards. Please remember that the Primal Scream Forum, as is 
                    mentioned on the banner text when you enter that forum does 
                    <i>not</i> allow personal attacks (name-calling, slander, 
                    etc.), and yes, saying &quot;I hope you @#$^'ing die&quot; 
                    is WELL beyond acceptable behavior and is subject to immediate 
                    banning. We also ask, rather clearly, that you &quot;keep 
                    it clean&quot;. Unmasked swearing in subject lines, as well 
                    as swearing (however masked) <i>at specific people</i> are 
                    also not acceptable. For those that are unaware of the history 
                    of that forum, it was originally meant as a spot where people 
                    could rant and rave out their tradeskill frustrations after 
                    a horrible run of luck, etc., while still keeping it within 
                    the realms of polite public behavior. While we've allowed 
                    some leeway on what's allowed in there, it is still not a 
                    place to come in and spew filth. There are plenty of other 
                    message boards in the world where you can spew that trash 
                    if you <i>really</i> need to, but we don't need it in our 
                    community.</font></p>

                    to watch your manners when posting on the message boards. 
                    A LOT of folks have been less-than-mannered lately, and have 
                    found themselves in the doghouse. The posting and conduct 
                    rules are there for a reason, and we are very actively enforcing 
                    them. This goes especially for those of you wanting to let 
                    off some steam. Even in the Primal Scream Forum, remember 
                    that the rules apply. Keep it family-rated, and remember NO 
                    personal attacks. We understand that when tradeskills change, 
                    folks tend to get a tad ... excited ... but this message board 
                    community really does NOT appreciate some of the foaming at 
                    the mouth we've seen lately. Such antics only distract us

                <p>The following is <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1638.topic" target="_new">a 
                  post</a> from Rich Waters, one of the Lead Designers for EQ: 
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>If you are not a Druid and you've completed <a href="quests/potc_intro.htm">the 
                    PoTC quest</a>, go and speak with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove 
                    - She's more than happy to give you something you'll be able 
                    to use instead of Xanthe's Earring.</p>
                  <p>If you're one of the few people who did the quest twice and 
                    lost an earring due to it being made lore, petition in game 
                    and a GM will reimburse you with the nine ingredients needed 
                    to make another earring after verifying your loss.</p>
                  <p>If your Xanthe's Earring is out of charges, trade it in with 
                    Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove, and she'll give you one 
                    that has charges. When items that didn't have an effect are 
                    retroactively changed, it sometimes causes the &quot;out of 
                    charges&quot; bug. </p>
                  <p>To trade the earring in with Rebecca, give her your Xanthe's 
                    Earring and she'll give you an alternate kind of earring. 
                    Give her back the alternate earring, and she'll give you a 
                    fully charged Xanthe's earring back.</p>
                  <p>Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you, this should 
                    solve any difficulties anyone's had with the earring.</p>
                  <p>Thanks,</p>

                  to clean up everything. In the meantime, you'll want to watch 
                  the message boards (as always), as well as bookmark the following:

                  to their own page for easier sorting out, and then later merge 
                  them with their other cultural recipes, but I keep getting sidetracked 
                  by new recipe updates. It'll get there.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've been 
                  agonizing for over a day now what to mention in a front page 
                  update, as so much of it is newsworthy to varying parts of the 
                  tradeskill community, and I know, no matter what I highlight, 
                  someone will feel left out. Some posts late last night/early 
                  this morning decided me on what would be highlighted ...</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Druids 
                  and tradeskillers from all across Norrath have been hard at 
                  work, deciphering the Liber Brassica Felix books, in search 
                  of the Protection of the Cabbage spell (a single-target PoTG). 
                  It's been a monumental undertaking, and I'd like to thank the 
                  EQTC community and the folks over at the Druid Grove for sharing 
                  information and ideas enough to get this sorted out quickly. 
                  The quest has been gargantuan, to say the least. And it's now 
                  over. The lovely Lady Xanthe Ravenwolf of Bertoxx exhaustedly 
                  reported in last night that she had completed the quest, and 
                  was kind enough to provide us with information on the reward 
                  (the spell and a nice earring), and a run-down of the quest. 
                  (I'll be working on webbing it after the caffeine kicks in.) 
                  We then received a visit from Rich Waters, one of the Lead Designers 
                  from EQ (I swear, he's got to be getting as little sleep as 
                  I am right now, from the looks of his posts on the boards!)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Rich said</font></p>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>Congratulations, Xanthe!</p>
                  <p>With the first completion of this quest, a new spell was 
                    brought into the world, and I'd like to thank the many druids 
                    and tradesfolk who participated in this event. </p>
                  <p>This quest is unusual in EverQuest, as it was intended to 
                    be done once and then change after it was solved. In the next 
                    patch, Xanthe will reap the rewards of finishing the quest 
                    first, and all druids will find the scroll much easier to 
                    attain now that the quest has been completed.</p>
                  <p>The quest will stay in game, for people who enjoy tradeskills 
                    and anyone who completes the full quest will find the final 
                    reward is quite suitable for the effort.</p>
                  <p>Thanks for playing,</p>

                <p>In other words, folks, if you wait until the next patch, the 
                  spell <i>will</i> be easier to obtain. The quest will stay in 
                  game for those of us who enjoy playing with such stuff <i>{curls 
                  protectively around her fishing pole and her Misty Thicket Picnic}</i>, 
                  but for those who don't have a tradeskill junkie's patience 
                  with such quests, find enough patience to wait for the next 
                  patch. ;D</p>
                <p>I'm back to practicing my dual-wielding skills - foraging for 
                  tufts of dire wolf fur on one machine while tackling site updates 
                  on the other ... have fun with all the new recipes, everyone!</p>

                  8 , 2002 - The Patch Message</span></b> </font><br>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I won't 
                  repeat the entire patch message, but here are the parts that 
                  are relevant to tradeskills, along with some commentary:</font></p>
                <ul>
                  <li> <b><font color="#400000">Added over 1,000 new tradeskill 
                    recipes for all levels of skill,</font></b> along with many 
                    recipe books. A few of the vendors of Norrath might be able 
                    to get you started on your way <i>(of course, we'll be scrambling 
                    here to get the information online for all of you, but expect 
                    things to be a tad ... hectic ... for a while)</i></li>
                  <li> Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant <i>(this 
                    should make poisonmaking, dyemaking, pottery idols, and a 
                    few other things a bit easier for those who have chosen to 
                    live mostly in Velious)</i></li>
                  <li> Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin 
                    <i>(happy shawl questing! No more running to Cabilis!)</i><br>
                  </li>
                  <li> Hit point bonuses on food items should be working<i> (centi 
                    steaks and centi toe stew, anyone?)</i></li>
                  <li> Characters can no longer scribe a scroll that they can't 
                    cast due to deity restrictions <i>(imbue gem spells were bugged 
                    for a while so anyone of the proper level/class could scribe 
                    them, now you should be able to only scribe the spell for 
                    your deity)</i><br>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your best bet for the first 24 hours is to keep an eye on the 
                  message boards for the new recipes. It's going to take some 
                  time to get these things webbed, especially with the server 
                  lag I'm already seeing this morning from eager folks at w*rk 
                  hitting the site, trying to see if anything's been found yet. 
                <p><b><i><font color="#400000">Addendum - </font></i></b> 
                <p>Erm, um ... if you tried to access the message boards earlier, 
                  and were timing out all over the place, you weren't alone. I 
                  feel sort of bad for the folks at EZBoard when they saw the 
                  load hit today. We've now been moved to a server of our very 
                  own (I'll be sending them a very heartfelt thank you to them 
                  for their fast work). The reroute to the new message board server 
                  is automagic, but please DO change your bookmarks when you have 
                  a chance, to cut down on their load.. It will take me days before 
                  I can change all the links on all the pages other than the front 
                  page, as the recipes that everyone's trying to get information 
                  on are the priority right now. <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/beqtraderscorner" target="_new">New 
                  message board link</a> 
                <p>It's going to take a while to get recipes into their proper 
                  places, and stuff tested out. There's a <a href="secrets/recipes_may8.htm">temporary 
                  recipe page found here</a>, and as things there get verified, 
                  tested, etc., I'll get them onto the normal recipe pages as 
                  well.
