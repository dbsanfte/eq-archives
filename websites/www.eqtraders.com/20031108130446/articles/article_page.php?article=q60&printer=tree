<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Felwithe. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, HIE,WIZ/MAG/ENC only. They are no-fail tailoring combines. The armor is green (varying shades) in color. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
