<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="-1">A wee halfling lady 
  stands atop an overturned vegetable crate, lecturing to a small cooking class. 
  She wields a large wooden meat tenderizer as if it was a weapon, occasionally 
  waving it at a student for emphasis. </font></font>
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"So, ye want tae be cooks, 
  lads and lasses? &nbsp;Cooks are the unsung heroes of any great war, as without 
  food and drink, those brawny warriors cannae keep up their fighting strength." 
  She smiles impishly up at a large barbarian warrior as she says this, her brown 
  eyes glinting with merriment. </font>
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"What do ye need to bake? 
  &nbsp;For the simplest of recipes, nothing more than body parts off a couple 
  critters that are found in many low-level hunting areas ... and an oven. (Most 
  every city has one or two ovens, if not more.) &nbsp;For more complex things, 
  you'll actually need to buy some added ingredients, invest in some cookbooks, 
  and mayhaps some cooking pans." </font>
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"I warn ye now, lads and 
  lasses, that cooking is nae a&nbsp;fast road to riches." She waggles the meat 
  tenderizer at a daydreaming student. "Rather, your rewards come in more intangible 
  ways. &nbsp;Ye can feed yourselves, your family, and your friends off items 
  that, without your expert touch, would be totally inedible. Ye can also add 
  some extra flair to events such as weddings and the like with some sweet treat 
  they'd be unable tae find in any shop ... and guarantee it's freshness as well. 
  Most importantly, ye can rescue folks from the dire tedium of eating rations 
  day in and day out." She shudders expressively at this last. </font>
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Until I can be certain 
  if certain foods are better for ye, and therefore last longer, than other foods, 
  I cannae give ye proper recommendations on marketing. &nbsp;Such wonders as 
  'edible goo' sell for less to a normal &nbsp;(NPC) merchant than that same merchant 
  would pay for the individual components. &nbsp;Other foods, such as 'fish rolls', 
  can be sold to that merchant for more than ye'd pay for a normal food ration, 
  and as such, ye can make a small profit. I've nae found the rhyme nor reason 
  tae it ... yet." </font>
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Now, ye bought yourself 
  a cookbook, did ye lass?" Niami peers quizzically at a young elf holding a large 
  cookbook in her arms. "I hope ye study that well and take careful notes on it. 
  &nbsp;Once ye've scribed the recipes contained in it (4 recipes - 8 pages - 
  per book, at the current time), ye no longer need the book. &nbsp;Ye can locker 
  it, sell it back, or whatever ye wish with it." </font>
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Mind ye, there are a 
  LOT of recipe books available, and ye'll rapidly eat away at your savings ... 
  no pun intended ... if ye buy all the books yuirself. Find a couple other would-be 
  cooks and share the expense of the books, and the recipes! &nbsp;But if ye're 
  not one of those large folks (ogres, trolls) who eat other (player) races for 
  dinner, then stay away from any recipe books written by that 'Ghumin' feller."&nbsp;Niami 
  mutters something nearly inaudible and incomprehensible about programmers and 
  Hot &amp; Spicy Toelings and then continues the lesson. (Note also that some 
  of the recipes contained in the books have errors. Attempts have been made to 
  make sure that this site's <a href="../secrets/baking.html">recipes</a> page 
  contains working recipes, not just reprints of the recipe book information.)</font> 
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"The main things to remember 
  with the recipes are the ingredients and the cooking implements needed. When 
  in doubt, use an oven, but if it says to do it over a roasting spit, mayhaps 
  ye'll hae better luck than I at finding one." </font>
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Ye <B>do</B> know how 
  tae use an oven, don't ye?" &nbsp;One timid student shakes their head and blushes.&nbsp;"Good 
  grief, were ye orphaned at birth?" At the small affirmative nod, the tiny halfling 
  turns on the motherly charm. "Ye poor lad, I be sorry. Forgive me runaway tongue. 
  Ye'll see brick ovens, with windows in the front door of them and flames dancing 
  inside of them hiding in odd spots in town. But for the untrained, it is sometimes 
  hard tae tell an oven from a kiln . When in doubt, open it (stand in front of 
  it and left click on the flames) and inhale. Ye'll be able tae tell verra quickly 
  if it be used for baking food, clay or metals.&nbsp;Then ye just put the proper 
  ingredients inside, pray tae your favorite deity, and bake. (press that 'combine' 
  button.) Ye'll also find spits being sold in various spots, an' they can be 
  used tae bake as well. Think of them as yuir own personal portable oven." </font> 
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"Oh, and make sure that 
  when they ask for a flask of water that ye use an actual flask of water, not 
  one of those magical globes of water." </font>
<P> 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">"That's all for this class, 
  but feel free tae contact me if ye need extra tutoring." </font>
<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> She notes one student 
  lagging behind. &nbsp;"What, ye want me tae give ye all the recipes, too? &nbsp;Pshaw, 
  lad, any good cook can tell ye that experimentation is necessary. &nbsp;But 
  I'll take pity on ye this much -- yuir early attempts should be something simple. 
  &nbsp;Why don't ye try combining a fire beetle eye and a rat ear in that oven 
  of yuirs and see what comes of it?" </font>

<P> 
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="-1">Ah, my first and 
  favorite love! Take all the known books (which I have had the good fortune to 
  read myself) and set out a stack of ALL the variations by type of food; therein 
  you will find wisdom from which to experiment! I truly look forward to the day 
  when I can obtain jars for pickles, and when skewers won't cost me an arm and 
  a leg! If I understand the recipes correctly, I won't need an oven for pickles, 
  which will make my skills <I>quite </I>portable! I fear that I have yet to find 
  the elusive recipes for rat-ear crunchies, or "deadly medley". While I've experimented 
  much with the former, I'm quite hesitant to do so with the latter... </font></font>
<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="-1">One little piece 
  of speculation worth noting-- while some foods seems to subsist folks much longer 
  than others (Batwing crunchies last about as long as snake eggs; whereas mammoth 
  steaks will keep one going for QUITE a while), it is said that things may change 
  in the future such that the price of foods will more accurately reflect its 
  value in weight AND sustinence. Word to the wise; if this is true, as it would 
  make our skill just that more in demand! That, and I hear the "duration" values 
  might be tweaked, though that's just a rumor. I have compiled a vast body of 
  work detailing my experience in the best ways to train new aspiring cooks. Once 
  I have taught a few people in my guild, and thoroughly tested it, I may make 
  this work available to you. In the far future. Maybe. </font></font>
