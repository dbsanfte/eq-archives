            <h3> Wind Spirits Armor - Qeynos Bard Quests<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop and restricted 
              to BRD/HUM, HEF only. This quest originates in the bard guild in 
              South Qeynos. The color on this armor is an icy pale green. <i>Please 
              note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often 
              are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second 
              one</i>.
