<span class="headers">Lost Dungeon Finds DenMother!</span>
<p>
<b>Someone pulled her out of the tink bag she was napping in!</b><br>
Most folks know by now that I've been gone from EQ for a couple months. Database burnout, exhaustion, other distractions, etc. all contributed to make EQ suddenly more work than play, and I decided it was time to take a break from it all.<p>
So, what lured the High Priestess of Mischief and tickle rezzes back, if only for an afternoon? Finding mischief in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath, of course!<p>
It was decided that we'd try out one of the dungeons meant for level 25-ish folks, so it was off to the beta server to whip up something suitable. A few minutes later I was settled into the body of a level 25 froggie shammie and was hopping around fribbling at folks.<p>
<img src="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/corpses.jpg" border="0" hspace="20" align="left"/><p>
<b>Brrrrr!</b><br>
The next stop was the frozen tundra outside Halas, to form up our group and prepare for our adventure. It wasn't the most balanced of groups, or well-geared, but we were ready for some fun! After we were grouped, our tour guide (Absor in froggie form) spoke with a strapping barbarian and got us our very own mission. (The one chosen was to kill a specific denizen of a dungeon, though there's a wide variety of missions available.) We were able to check our status on a special new screen, to find out that we had 30 minutes to arrive at our destination and begin our adventure.  Thankfully, my compass was able to point the way with a lovely blue bar, as the sense heading skill of my beta baby was a whopping 3 after much mashing of my sense heading key.  ;)<p>
Even the most snow-blinded of us could tell when we'd reached our destination, a large hole leading into a cave. Littered outside the entrance were the corpses of those who tried ... and failed. A lovely new feature is that all player-corpses are dropped in a pile outside the dungeon when the adventure is complete. There were just a few corpses from past parties left outside ...<p>
<b>Nice to Meet ... erm, Beat ... You!</b><br>
We made it to our destination in plenty of time, and entered the dark maw of the dungeon entrance. A fresh timer was started, giving us the time allotted to complete our mission, and we dove immediately into the fray.<p>
We may not have been well-geared level 25s. We may not have been an optimal group, or even close. We may not have even bothered to buff properly. What we lacked in those categories, though, we made up for in a lemming insanity that would have made Bristlebane proud. I'm not sure if Absor gained a few more grey hairs from keeping us alive, but feh, who needs everything mezzed, or root parked, or even slowed, for that matter? (Translation, I had a blast shammie tanking while bemoaning about my inability to cannibalize and cries of 'oom' from all the casters weren't the crises they would have been for a proper group.)<p>
<img src="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/icefloe.jpg" border="0" hspace="20" align="left"/>
Several new creature models were seen as we wandered through the dungeon, killing whatever got in our path, as well as some old favorites, and I was too distracted oohing and ahhing over things (with the House Ogre watching over my shoulder) to take many screen shots. This fellow, however, was one of many that decided to get up close and personal after I put a bee in his bonnet. (More accurately, threw several debuffs on him and began to dance with him.)  He's got a mean right hook!<p>
Eventually we found the area that contained our goal, and after a brief battle, left him with all 8 of his legs waving in the air as he died. While we were then given another alottment of time in the dungeon (to loot up, explore more, take out some of the other mobs, etc.), we decided to head out, once we found one last trapped box for the rogue to play with.<p>
A quick trip back out to the wayfarer's camp for all but the rogue (who somehow got left behind ...), and we got to browse the special vendor there. She was happy to instruct me that I had earned 2 adventure points, kept a running tally of what adventures I'd completed, and offered up some special port stones that I could purchase with my newly-won points.<p>
<b>Crawling back into my packs now</b>
There's still tuning to be done, and over a week of beta left, but this looks like a promising bit of fun. Strategy will be needed to make sure you're handling the mobs at a decent enough pace to meet your time limit, while at the same time not biting off more than you can chew at a time. For those tired of the same old same old, though, this offers up a lovely way for a single group to go off by themselves and adventure, without having to battle other groups for spawns and all of the frustration that goes with that. It may even be enough to lure some of my alts out of retirement now and then to hunt with old friends. Meanwhile, however, it's time for me to crawl into a fur-lined halfling haversack and take another nap. ... it was chilly up there!</p><p>
