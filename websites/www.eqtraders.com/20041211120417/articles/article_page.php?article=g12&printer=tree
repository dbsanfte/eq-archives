<p>
<p>
Some of these guides are meant as extremely basic introductions to a particular tradeskill, others will be far more complex. While some will be geared towards power-skilling, others will be aimed for those with limited finances.  I can't promise we'll have something of interest to everyone, but the offerings here should be good to get you started.

<p>
Now that the Database driven site has been up for some time, and we have some very capable helpers collecting and loading the database items, recipes, mobs, sources and such... I hope to have some time to re-examine these guides and fix those that are out of date, add new guides that have been created, and generally make it easier for you to find the information you are after. Please stay tuned.

If you are totally new to tradeskills, you will first wish to check out the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g7&menustr=030000000000">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> and read Niami's <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g113&menustr=040000000000">"Before you Start"</a> article. It should answer some of the more basic questions and brace you for the fascinating but often-frustrating world of tradeskills.
