<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>September 
  13:</b> The patch has been delayed until Friday, but I am beyond heartened at 
  the folks who have been stepping forward to help verify merchant offerings after 
  the patch. It will save me a lot of time and effort.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I'm going 
  to sit back and try to breathe for a day or two before the patch now that I'm 
  done with my RL scramble to get things ready. Over the weekend, my hubby and 
  a guildmate scrambled to get me more ready for the post-patch site mayhem. Since 
  our cablemodem ISP only allows us a limited number of IP addy's, and all three 
  were in use, they got me set up behind a router so that I could add a second 
  machine in my &quot;office&quot;. (My old PC, with a total brainwipe/reformat). 
  Now, I can finally be exploring in EQ, and be able to not only call up the site 
  to verify things, but be able to edit on-the-fly while still in-game. This should 
  save a tree or two a year, as it means I'll not be having to scribble on the 
  nearest slip of paper every time I find a new merchant that needs to be added 
  to the site. :) ... and I type MUCH faster than I write, too. </font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Anyway, we 
  seem to be in good shape for the merchant listing end of the post-patch mayhem. 
  The recipes section is going to be in upheaval for a while, as there are a LOT 
  of new recipes, and cross-skill recipes that need to go in. As always, I'm not 
  even thinking of touching them until we're sure they've gone live.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Thought 
  for the day: You know you're an EQ junkie when you schedule your chiropractor's 
  appointment to coincide with patch time, so that it doesn't interrupt your questing. 
  (It's a shame they changed the patch day on me at the last minute!)</i></font>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>September 
  5:</b> While we're waiting for the big smithing patch to be implemented, other 
  little discoveries have been trickling through. Thanks to folks active on the 
  message boards, we now have verified recipes for sliced cake, and pound cake, 
  and hopefully we'll have more discoveries in the days to come. Once the smithing 
  changes are in place, I'll be posting on the message board asking folks to &quot;adopt&quot; 
  a zone to re-explore and verify merchant offerings. I'll also be asking folks 
  to post new recipe verifications, so we can pool the information quickly for 
  this.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Keep up the 
  good work, gang ... it's thanks to all my &quot;regulars&quot; that this site 
  is as useful as it is.</font>
<p> 
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font> 
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">August 
  24:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It looks 
  like some, but not all of the smithing (and resulting tailoring) changes are 
  live on production. I'm not going to get frantic about verifying new recipes 
  and re-verify every merchant until after the rest of the changes are in place 
  -- it's just too time-consuming for a single person to do. Known new stuff working 
  on the live servers includes silk thread, silk bandages, silk cord, and hooked 
  arrowheads (possibly some of the other arrowheads as well, but I've not tested 
  other stuff yet). I've seen copies of *other* smithing and tailoring recipes 
  that are currently functioning on test, but since there's never a guarantee 
  that what is on test will stay that way from day to day, I'm not worrying about 
  posting them right yet.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When the smithing 
  changes are implemented, I will need help! A lot of the new smithing recipes 
  are going to use materials not currently on the live servers. When they go live, 
  merchant inventories will also change ... across the entire world. Anyone who 
  wants to &quot;adopt&quot; a zone to re-explore, please remember the following. 
  If you do NOT give me all the correct information, then it will take me even 
  longer than normal to run around and re-verify stuff -- which means it takes 
  longer to be posted on this site. For ANY report of new merchants, new items 
  on merchants, etc., I need 1) zone name, 2) merchant name, 3) merchant /loc, 
  as well as any landmarks, 4) exact item names. Sending me something that says: 
  &quot;The windmill in the Lake of Ill Omen has poison stuff&quot; just means 
  that I have to spend time to get one of my personas over to that zone and then 
  figure out where this doggone windmill is located. ;) It's still nice to get 
  the head's up, but it adds a couple days of delay onto anything being posted, 
  as I have to add it to the pile of things &quot;to do&quot; for the site ... 
  and for those not familiar with the force behind this site, it's a single-person 
  operation that costs me a lot of my personal time and pp to maintain. If you 
  find the info on this site useful, and you want to contribute, jotting down 
  that extra information requested above and sending it to me means that I can 
  free up more of my time on some of the more difficult or more expensive information 
  to verify.</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>July 21:</b> 
  Hopefully the servers are stable now, and the patches of the patches are done 
  for now. Reports are trickling in that the tailoring fixes are fixed, though 
  no mention was made of the studded tunic. A bit of research has shown reports 
  of the tailored quiver now being in-game, and while the quiver itself is nothing 
  to get excited about using, it is being reported as a way to increase your tailoring 
  skill above 108.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some poison 
  merchants have been updated (Dagnors, Lesser Faydark), and I'm going to be handing 
  poison books over to my linguist for translation of the one from Dagnors, since 
  my dwarvish isn't up to par). I missed the poison merchant in Steamfont, and 
  forgot to check the one in Kaladim while I was over there. If anyone can provide 
  me with full details of merchant name and location, that would be great, and 
  I'll catch them on my next trip over.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've received 
  some feedback on more merchants with poison supplies, etc., but very little 
  of it provides all the details I need (merchant name, /loc, exact items sold, 
  etc.) I will go and personally verify the information before I post it, but 
  it's time-consuming to do so, and requires me begging teleports all over the 
  place or long boat rides. Please have patience if you've provided me partial 
  information and it is not posted yet. :D If you know of a poison merchant not 
  listed yet, or have updated information on one that is listed, please be as 
  complete as possible on any information you <a href="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">send

  new poisons that went in with the last patch. Many new <a href="secrets/poison.html" target="mainright">recipes</a>

  For those of you who are listed in the Marketplace section of the website, please 
  email me with any updates or corrections to your listing (or ask me to remove 
  it if you're no longer providing the items/services). I am now providing dates 
  on any new additions/corrections to the listings, so that folks will be able 
  to tell if an ad is current, or if it's been gathering dust for a year or so. 
  (Note that old ads will not be backdated, as I've not kept the hundreds of pieces 
  of email that went into creating the Marketplace listings.) Please remember 
  to include not only your character name, but also your server name. A good quarter 
  of the listings I receive require extra back-and-forth email to get such &quot;little&quot; 
  details that were forgotten the first time around.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I got my requisite 
  once or twice a month insulting email today, and as usual, the person in question 
  couldn't even form a proper sentence, or remember what capitalization was for.

  the hard work of a group of people (for yes, many of you have contributed to 
  this site, making it yours as well as mine) without having a single productive 
  thing to say? <i>&lt;shrugs&gt;</i> They got their 10-second claim to fame in 
  my rant regarding their unsigned letter, and it's been quite happily trashed 
  as not having a single redeeming value. <i>(For those of you with constructive 
  criticism, yes, I'm willing to listen, but outright insulting email with not 
  a shred of information that would back up the claims ... pfaugh, tell me your

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meanwhile, 
  those of you who are actively testing things and sending back feedback, thank 
  you. There's only so much time in a week, and your feedback makes this site 
  better for everyone. I think we're definitely onto something with the varying 
  trivial levels (June 8 news below), based on notes compared by several people. 
  So, if you get a slightly (off by 4 or less) different trivial level than one 
  mentioned on one of these pages, don't worry. It may just be that your race/class/int/wis 
  combination has an easier/harder time learning than the one who tested that 
  batch of trivials.</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>June 08:</b> 
  I'm starting to chase down quests that require trade skills, and include them 
  on the appropriate trade skill recipe pages. I've added an unverified recipe 
  for embalming fluid to the brewing page, and shadow silk and a Cabilis tapestry 
  quest to the tailoring page. Once the dust settles a bit more in my new home, 
  I hope to go do yet another zone-by-zone exploration to re-verify trade supply 
  locations, update the jewel listings with more details, and see if I can figure 
  out where I last saw tall beers ... and somewhere in there actually get to play 
  the game some as well. ;)</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many thanks 
  to all of you who've been providing feedback and details on trivials, etc. for 
  me as it saves me a lot of extra time and effort.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've been 
  noticing some odd stuff with trivials, and will need to do some time-consuming 
  testing to verify. My RL hubby has an erudite wizzie with a ridiculously high 
  INT, and trivial levels *seem* to be a bit lower on some things (we were working 
  the wizzie up in brewing when we noticed it). When my hubby and I have some 
  time, I'll probably try testing the wizzie vs. a dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks character 
  on another trade skill (tailoring or baking) and see if they get different trivials 
  for things. If anyone else has witnessed this phenomenon, please let me know.</font>

  recipes</a> page I had mentioned on the message board. Several more player-merchants 
  were added to the Marketplace, including our first ad for someone on Morrell-Thule. 
  I also did some minor updates to many of the recipes pages, including some reminders 
  about trade skills and a) stacked items and b) water. Geimhreadh, a ranger on 
  Tribunal, has also provided me with some lovely clarifications on trivial levels 
  for arrows. I hope to have that information on the fletching page soon.</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On a lighter 
  note, the giggle of the week comes from a trade skills message board post (I

  complains that on their PvP server, when they were killed by another player,the 
  killer looted not their armor or weapon, but a stack of 20 snake eggs. Now that

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Marketplace:</i> 
  We've added several new player-merchants. Based on email from the last month 
  or so, please remember a few things when sending in email: If you don't include 
  your server name when sending in an ad, it's rather hard to post it. &lt;g&gt; 
  Let us know if you want an email link in the ad, or if you only want potential 
  customers to contact you in-game. Last but not least, if your server isn't listed 
  in the marketplace, it's not because I forgot it, but because nobody has sent 
  in an ad for that server.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Trade supplies 
  locations:</i> Please remember to eyeball the appropriate page before you send 
  email saying you found something, as I've gotten a lot of mail lately for things 
  that are already listed on the site. Please remember to provide enough details 
  on where you found something that is not listed so that I can find it in order 
  to get the details not included in the email.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Stance 
  on recipes/formulas:</i> This site has always left the posting of cheats/recipes/formulas 
  to other sites. My reasoning behind this was that, without player experimentation, 
  we don't find the new and undiscovered recipes. I've provided some links here 
  and there throughout the site for recipes and such for those who want to learn 
  things without costly experimentation. When I return, I <i>might</i> directly 
  link in some of the recipes that I, and other contributors to this site, have 
  found. However, this is a 1-person site that has tried to stay ad-free (other 
  than the remotely hosted message board) and low-maintenance. On top of all other 
  considerations, the amount of extra time I'd have to spend per week on handling 
  corrections/additions to those recipes, handling often irate and incoherent 
  email asking &quot;why do you have these recipes and not those recipes that 
  I really want?&quot; and a myriad of other issues, makes me very hesitant to 
  expand the offerings of this site. I love helping folks learn new things about 
  tradeskills, but I love playing even more. Thanks for your understanding on 
  this.</font>

  more things.</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">(Unfortunately, 
  they seem to be focusing enough on testing things out, that I've still not found 
  anyone willing to write a good &quot;how to&quot; article for this site.)</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">More tradesfolk have sent 
  in listings for the Marketplace, and I've done full re-explorations on a few 
  more zones. The site will slowly flesh out more. I'd love to see some re-writes 
  of some of the trade skill articles that were written many months ago, but nobody's 
  sent anything in for quite a while. I'll rewrite some of mine as time goes on, 
  but I'm getting ready for a month without internet from mid-December to mid-January, 
  so I'd rather focus my attentions on making sure that all the trade supplies 
  listings are up to date, etc. instead of trying to do more writing.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>October 22:</b> The 
  most major recent change was the promised splitting up of the Marketplace into 
  separate pages for each server. You'd not believe the number of emails I get 
  a week now, though, going &quot;where's ____ server?&quot; If you don't see 
  your server listed in the Marketplace section, it means that I don't have any 
  player advertisements for that server. (Or someone's simply sent me &quot;I'm 
  a tailor, list me&quot; without providing me with proper details as to what 
  they are offering and/or a premade&quot;ad&quot; to go in.)</font>

  The patch today includes at the very least, addition of weapon creation to the 
  blacksmithing skill. More information will be available after there is time 
  to test the three new recipes I've found, which include a morning star, a 2-handed 
  sword, and a bastard sword. The Trade Supplies section will be updated with 
  merchant information shortly.</font>

  I went out of town suddenly for 5 days, and came back to an over-stuffed mailbox. 
  I've got all the new Marketplace listings up, one new link added to the Links 
  page, and will do the location corrections and additions once I've had a chance 
  to breathe. The Marketplace is taking off like wild right now, so I'll be tweaking 
  the format a bit, and setting up separate pages for each server shortly. Keep 
  those submissions incoming, and I'll try to keep the updates flowing as much 
  as possible. I'll also catch up on message board queries later today. Once I 
  unbury from all the other pending stuff, I'll tackle the RP Corner section as 
  well and spruce it up, but that may not happen until next week.</font>

  after reading my mailbox this morning, I'll do my 10-second redheaded hissy 
  fit. If you don't like how an article on this site says to do something, please 
  either write something yourself (and get someone to proofread it if your grammar 
  is really that bad) or simply go somewhere else. This site is for folks who 
  enjoy trade skills as I do, so kewl d00dz who think these guides are the dumbest 
  thing they've ever seen ... why are you still here if all you can say are negative 
  things? <i>&lt;Niami waves her meat tenderizer in a shooing motion&gt;</i></font>

  the location pages to come over time, with little fanfare.</font>
