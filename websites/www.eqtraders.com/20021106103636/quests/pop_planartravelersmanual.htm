            <p><i>(This quest requires the Planes of Power expansion.)</i> This 
              quest originates in the Plane of Knowledge, with a halfling lady 
              by the name of Willamina. By the end of the quest, you should know 
              your way around the zone a bit better, and you will have an item 
              that will lead to several tradeskill-related quests. First, get 
              a travel buff on those feet of yours. You are about to do a LOT 
              of running. Next, find Willamina near a bent up old tree (-427, 
              1147) and hail her. 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Willamina says 'The city is full of curious people all searching 
                for something. Many have struggled for a long time to find their 
                reward. Some are not even aware of what is it they are looking 
                for, but will know it when they see it. Would you care to [help] 
                me out? It will only take a moment.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'I will help you' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Willamina says 'How wonderful! To pass the time I enjoy sitting 
                under the trees and sewing together luscious fabrics. But now 
                it seems my old sewing needles have all broke or gone dull, and 
                I require a new supply. Bolcen Tendag has promised to purchase 
                and deliver some for me, but he has not yet arrived and I worry 
                about him. If you could locate him and ask him </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Find Bolcen Tendag at 685, 951 (in the good part of town, near 
              one of the buildings with bridges leading to the library).</p>
            <p>You say, 'I have come for the needles' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bolcen Tendag says 'I feel just terrible that I haven't been 
                to see Willamina yet. Due to my illness I barely have the energy 
                to stand. If you could aid me in some way, I would greatly appreciate 
                it. Mirao Frostpouch might have an elixir that would help me feel 
                better. Please seek him out and ask for it.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Mirao is in the neutral part of town, in the building closest to 
              the Tranquility portal, selling invisibility and other potions (-89, 
              -208) </p>
            <p>You say, 'I have come for the elixir' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Mirao Frostpouch says 'That poor lad, he's always catching ill 
                this time of year. Unfortunately I am out of the medicine he needs 
                right now. Perhaps if you could obtain the key ingredient I am 
                missing, I could brew up a batch for you to take to him. I have 
                heard Cador recently came into possession of some black lava powder. 
                If you can convince him to give you some, bring it to me right 
                away!' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Oracle Cador is in the &quot;good&quot; part of town, and wanders 
              through the building at 604, 147.</p>
            <p>You say, 'do you have any black lava powder?' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Oracle Cador says 'You are most astute. I do have a stock of 
                black lava powder with me, but I will only share it with those 
                who prove themselves worthy. Onirelin Gali is currently in possession 
                of an artifact I need to better commune with the spirits. Please 
                recover it for me.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Head over to the more &quot;evil&quot; side of town. (Don't worry, 
              nothing there will eat you, though they may <i>think</i> about doing 
              so!) You'll find Onirelin inside a building at loc -648, 1048</p>
            <p>You say, 'I have come for the artifact' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Onirelin Gali pauses for a moment and continues, 'I am aware 
                of that which Cador desires. Be wary of his ways for they are 
                not always as they appear. Nevertheless, if he thinks this artifact 
                will bring him greater peace, he may have it for a price. Certainly 
                I have no use for it but what do I get in return? I'll tell you. 
                Narik and I used to be good friends, until he became jealous of 
                my relationship with his former companion Elisha. During our fight, 
                he marched off with one of my finest jewels, and I believe still 
                has it. Find him and ask for my jewel back. If you bring it to 
                me, Cador may get want he wants as well.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Do your feet hurt yet? Go back over to the neutral part of town 
              to Arch Mage Narik He roams from room to room in the building at 
              363, 77.</p>
            <p>You say, 'I have come for the jewel' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Arch Mage Narik slams his book shut. 'So, the snake has legs 
                after all! Tell Onirelin if he wants this back, he can come here 
                himself and kiss my. . ., no wait. I have a better idea.' He draws 
                closer and whispers, 'Did Onirelin tell you why I took this jewel? 
                I did it in response to him taking my lady love, Elisha Dirtyshoes. 
                We were to be married until she ran off with him. However, she 
                also ran off with my engagement ring I gave to her. It is quite 
                valuable to me, and I would be most happy to have it back. If 
                you can procure it from her, I'll give Onirelin his jewel back. 
                He's suffered long enough, I think.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You'll find the lady in question selling pottery supplies in a 
              building at 393, 942. Once you catch your breath ... </p>
            <p>You say, 'can I have the ring' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Elisha Dirtyshoes sighs and says, 'Tis a painful memory, for 
                sure. My love for Narik fell once I met Onirelin, but my love 
                for him was not reciprocated. Now I am left with no one to share 
                my life, with only this ring as a reminder. Narik may have it 
                back if he desires it, but then I shall be left truly alone. Boiron 
                Ston once held a door open for me, such a handsome dwarf he is. 
                If he could only find more time to spend with me, giving up this 
                ring would be no problem at all. Do you think he likes me? Could 
                you ask him and find out?' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I told you this was going to involve a lot of running, didn't I? 
              You'll find Boiron selling large plate armor at 25, 324</p>
            <p>You say, 'Do you like Elisha Dirtyshoes?' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Boiron Ston says 'Aye, she's a pretty lass. And I am aware of 
                her feelings toward me. I haven't had the courage to approach 
                her though. My family standard has recently disappeared, and no 
                dwarf is the same when their standard is in jeopardy. Seek out 
                Caden Zharik and demand my standard back, I believe he may have 
                lifted it from me.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Find the little thief upstairs on a landing at -343, 756</p>
            <p>You say, 'I have come for the standard' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Caden Zharik turns white with fear. 'Ah, so he sent you to rough 
                me up, did he? Fine, but you should know you couldn't hurt me 
                any worse than Agrakath Theric would! I'm in a bit of trouble 
                you see, I owe Agrakath some money I haven't got. So I stole the 
                standard to pay him off. If you could please find him and have 
                him somehow erase my debt, I would gladly give the standard back.' 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Still not done!?! Phew, I hope you have SoW on! Scamper over to 
              the evil side of town, and the erudite in the uglyyyy yellow robe 
              standing at -553, 1216.</p>
            <p>You say, 'I have come to erase the debt' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Agrakath Theric grins and says, 'So, that weasel Caden has sent 
                you to settle his debt? And you actually agreed to this endeavor? 
                Ha ha, very well! I shall transfer the responsibility of what 
                Caden owes me to your shoulders. I have a simple job for you. 
                Somewhere in the library there lies a book I have been searching 
                for, but it has eluded me for quite some time. I believe it can 
                be found somewhere in the upper levels. You are to venture into 
                Myrist and seek out a tome titled History of Evils: The Age of 
                Scale, and bring it to me. Do this one task for me and your debt 
                shall be relinquished.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The book is found in the library, up two flights of stairs from 
              the entrance. It spawns on the bottom shelf of the bookshelf located 
              at -100 pos 1000, beside NPC Sir Geravalsi. <i>(It's been reported 
              anything from 5 minutes to 30 minutes for respawn. I suspect 5 is 
              closer to the mark.) </i></p>
            <p>Run BACK to that erudite with the poor fashion sense (Agrakath 
              Theric, at -553, 1216, for those of you with short memories) and 
              then work your way backwards through the <i>other</i> folks you 
              visited.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Agrakath Theric eyes go wide with surprise as you hand over the 
                book. 'Very impressive for one of your abilities. Here, take this 
                note to Caden. He is absolved of his debt to me at this time.' 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He'll give you a smidgen of xp, as well as the Note to Caden (lore, 
              no drop, wt 0.1, small, none/none).</p>
            <p>Okies, back to the theiving gnomikins (-343, 756) with the note. 
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Caden Zharik eyes go wide with relief. 'Oh thank you thank you! 
                Here, take the standard. And do apologize to Boiron for me. It 
                shall never happen again. Again, thank you!' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You guessed it, another trickle of xp, and Boiron's standard (lore, 
              no drop, wt 1.0, small, none/none)</p>
            <p>Back to the cowardly dwarf (25, 324) ... </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Boiron Ston seems to perk up. 'Ah, 'tis a beauty, is it not? 
                I thank you for its safe return. Perhaps I shall go and visit 
                Elisha after all. Please take this letter to her, so she may be 
                ready for me when I arrive.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Another miniscule amount of xp, and a Letter to Elisha (lore, no 
              drop, wt 0.1, small, none/none)</p>
            <p>Okies, back to the fickle potter (393, 942), who has already worked 
              her way through two men of varying races, and is now trying to hook 
              the unsuspecting dwarf as well ...</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Elisha Dirtyshoes reads the letter and says, 'Oh happy day! Boiron 
                will be visiting me soon. You may take Narik's ring back to him 
                now. If you'll excuse me, I have some cleaning up to do.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Another droplet of xp, and, yep, Narik's ring (lore, no drop, wt 
              0.1, small, none/none) back</p>
            <p>Find him again (roaming near 363, 77).</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Arch Mage Narik says 'This is truly excellent. You have done 
                well recovering this for me. You may take Onirelin's jewel and 
                also tell him never to set foot near me again. Leave me now, I 
                have much work to do.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Another dribble of xp, and Onirelin's Jewel (lore, no drop, wt 
              0.1, small, none/none)</p>
            <p>Back you go to the &quot;darker&quot; side of town (-648, 1048).</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Onirelin Gali says 'How did you get this away from Narik? Oh 
                never mind, I'm just happy to have it back. I shall give you what 
                Cador desires now, keep it secure and deliver it to him.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Yep! Another speck of xp, and Cador's artifact (lore, no drop, 
              wt 1.0, small, none/none). Shamble back over to Cador (roaming near 
              604, 147) after dunking your aching feet in the pool near the fishing 
              vendors. Doesn't that feel good?</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Oracle Cador says 'The spirits are restful now that this piece 
                of legend is in safe hands. You may take this to Mirao for whatever 
                purpose he desires it for. May your vision always be clear!' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Whee! Another dollop of xp, black lava powder (lore, no drop, wt 
              1.0, small, none/none), as well as probably a couple more blisters 
              on your feet. Give it to Mirao (-89, -208) to make him &quot;cough 
              up&quot; the medicine.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Mirao Frostpouch takes the powder and quickly dashes it into 
                a boiling cauldron. He then stirs it and pours the concoction 
                into a small bottle. 'Here you go, this should make poor Bolcen 
                feel much better. Hurry now, he's waiting.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Another sliver of xp, and a curative potion (lore, no drop, wt 
              1.0, small, none/none)</p>
            <p>Trudge back to Bolcen (685, 951).</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Bolcen Tendag says 'Oh thank you so much.' He drinks from the 
                bottle, then reaches in his pocket and produces a set of needles. 
                'I believe this is what Willamina is in need of. Please take these 
                to her and give her my best.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Oohh, another partial pixel of xp, and, at last, new sewing needles 
              (lore, no drop, wt 0.1, small, none/none)<br>
            </p>
            <p>Finally! Head back to Willamina (-427, 1147).</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Willamina takes the needles and smiles. 'Thank you so much, kind 
                stranger. I can't tell you how much you have really helped by 
                doing this for me. It's funny, you know. The entire city seems 
                to be in a happier mood today. I can't quite put my finger on 
                it, but everyone seems to have uplifted spirits. Oh well, thank 
                you again. I have something you may find to be of use to you, 
                if you would be interested. Remember, knowledge is the key to 
                life.' </p>
