<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Muette Wavedancer 
  (&quot;Grasshopper&quot;)</b><font size="-1"> - human monk</font></font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A lithe woman practices 
  katas at the edge of the ocean. Her movements are sure, graceful, deadly. The 
  surf is high this day, but she doesn't seem to be swayed at all as the pounding 
  waves break against her.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Spirits grant me 
  strength. Spirits grant me courage. Spirits grant me wisdom.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Her body appears to be 
  a finely-tuned weapon -- what is not as apparent is that her mind is just as 
  finely tuned. Her voracious desire for learning is curbed only by access to 
  that learning. At last count, she knows 23 languages to varying levels of fluency, 
  and it is not enough. She is near master-level in jewelcrafting, plus journeyman 
  level in baking and pottery ... and it is not enough.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The only time she can be 
  pulled from her studies, is when there is someone in dire need, or her friends 
  ask her to hunt.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She has made it her personal 
  crusade to aid Sonoroud, an honorable dark elf of long acquaintance, on his 
  quest for acceptance in the bright worlds. While they are nearly inseparable, 
  refusing to go adventuring without each other, it appears to be only friendship. 
  She has oft been overheard, with many a sidelong glance at his necromancer's 
  robes, to state that she can't conceive of being romantically involved with 
  someone who wears a dress!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The two of them are often 
  joined by a cleric friend of theirs by the name of Janus, and the monsters oft 
  tremble at their approach!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Muette is generous to a 
  fault. Not only are her own needs simple, but she remembers well when she was 
  an orphan, begrudged of even the rags upon her back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One thing has remained 
  true since her childhood. Never will she willingly let another fall if she can 
  take her place.</font></p>
