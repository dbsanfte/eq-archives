            <h3>Trueshot Chainmail Armor - Kelethin Ranger Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in 
              Kelethin. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ELF/HEF,RNG 
              only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Armor has a green chain 
              graphic when worn. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, 
              the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before 
              you get the parts for a second one</i></p>

              Faydarks Champions. I have studied here for many of my years until

              gathering and will also provide you with a chance to fashion your 
              own Trueshot Chainmail. If you are a [ranger of Tunare] and are 
              willing to begin your training I will be happy to explain to you 
              how the tests work.'</P>
