<p>
This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.<p>
The completion of this quest will allow you to progress to tailoring skill 54. It will also allow you to learn how to process muramite etched scales and aged muramite etched scales into their preserved versions, so that you can use them in the new GoD tailoring recipes.
<hr>
<blockquote>You say, 'Hail, Garald Samer'
<p>Garald Samer  nods respectfully, 'Greetings.  If I can assist you, just let me know.  And perhaps, if you are [willing], you could assist me.'
<p>You say, 'I am willing'
<p>Garald Samer says ''All of the tradesfolk an board the Queen of Thorns have been kept very busy attending to the needs of the crew and the Wayfarers that pass through.  I am no exception.  I enjoy my work, and being busy is not of concern to me in most situations.  However, we have discovered some unusual [new material], and I would like to have some time to work with it.  I would be grateful if you could help me with my [work] so that I might have more time for other matters.''
<p>You say, 'what work?'
<p>Garald Samer  bows his head to you, 'I appreciate your offer.  There are many items that I need to keep up with demand.  Unfortunately, they need to be made from the Preserved Muramite Etched Scales.  I don't need the aged scales, just ones that you can obtain from Tonlyei just by giving her Muramite Etched Scales.  I understand that this will require you to obtain these scales in order to help me.  Because of this, I will be willing to teach you the secret of preparing the Muramite Etched Scales, both younger and aged.  And I will be able to reward you with this information more quickly than Tonlyei in recognition of the extra efforts I require of you.  If you are still interested in helping, just hand me an Preserved Muramite Etched Scale and I will show you what I need you to do.'
</blockquote>
Ignore his mention of the aged muramite etched scales for the moment, and instead scrounge for the mob-dropped muramite etched scales. Hand them to Tonlyei (the other tailoring vendor, standing beside him) to have them converted into the preserved muramite etched scales that Garald needs for your quest. Hand Garald one of the preserved muramite etched scales in order to trigger step one.<p>
STEP ONE<p>
<blockquote>Garald Samer says ''Wonderful.  I am pleased that your desire for knowledge is important to you.  Many of the Wayfarers are asking for armor made from the skin of these Muramites.  Wristguards are popular among our scouts, and they are not difficult to make.  So this will be your first task.  Simply take the Muramite Scale and the Wayfarer Wristguard Pattern and combine them in your Sewing Kit.  Bring the completed wristguards to me.''
</blockquote><p>
Garald will give you enough supplies for 10 combines of the wayfarer wristguards. Hand him the completed wristguards, then hand him another preserved muramite etched scale. Continue to loop through until you have handed him 30 completed wristguards, at which time, he'll progress to step two the next time that you hand him one of the preserved muramite etched scales.<p>
STEP TWO<p>
<blockquoteGarald Samer says ''Ah, good.  The Muramite scales make very supple and durable gloves.  They seem to have become a popular item among our own Wayfarers, and so I need you to make some for me.  Take one piece of Muramite scale and one glove pattern and combine them in your sewing kit to make the gloves.  Please bring them to me when you are done.  Thank you.''
</blockquote>
This is a repeat of step one, only with new ingredients and a new result. Once you've given him 30 completed wayfarer gloves, he'll progress on to step three.<p>
STEPS THREE AND FOUR<p>
NPC text is not currently available for these steps, but basically continue to loop the scale-combine-handin until you have given him 30 of the items needed for step three and 30 of the items needed for step four. Upon completion of step four, the next time that you hand him a preserved muramite etched scale, he will hand it back and send you over to Tonlyei for instruction on how to convert the scales for yourself.
