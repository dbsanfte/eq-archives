              to learn a trade skill? Do you want to sell the fruits of your labor 
              to other players? Are you trying to find specific items to pratice 
              your craft? Or are you just trying to find someone who sells player-crafted 
              items for a reasonable price on your server? If the answer to any 
              of these questions is "yes", then I hope this site will be of assistance 
              to you. If you can't find the information you need on the main part 
              of the website, it's likely that you can find the answers you need 
              on the message board.</p>

                <b>A quiet week.</b> My mailbox forwarding, and that of my tradeskill 
                guide editor went awry for a while, but they're fixed now. </p>
              <p>It's a quiet week on the tradeskill front since there's no patch, 
                but experimentation and discussion continue on the boards. Slowly, 
                we're getting more <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">stats 
                for various cultural smithing items</a>, as more folks try out 
                various enchanted variations.</p>

                <b>We're back!</b> It was a rollercoaster day for the site, with 
                a lot of ups and downs, but things look stable now. I'll keep 
                my fingers crossed that the hard-working folks at Refplace have 
                got things well in hand now.</p>
              <p>I'll get more up tomorrow, as I'm sort of busy in Hate right 
                now, but a quick note to let folks know that while the tier'dal 
                version of enchanted adamantite chain jointing is misbehaving 
                (Yakatizma's looking into it), enchanted tier'dal plate works! 
                I'll get the appropriate recipes onto the dark elven smithing 
                page tomorrow . For now, you'll find out how I did it on <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=2160.topic">this

              <p>A few quick notes in the meantime. <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">Baking 
                recipes</a> have been updated with several new recipes, as well 
                as food type information and know stat information. Once the boards 
                are back up, I'll ask folks to scan the recipes page and see what 
                I've missed. Since this <i>is</i> a tradeskill site, you'll only 
                find information on there for player-made food, not for any of 
                the purchased stuff. It's also been officially confirmed that 
                right-clicking on foods will NOT give any of the listed stat changes 
                for that food, and will only last half-duration.</p>
              <p>A few pieces of <a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring_erudite.htm">steelsilk 
                armor</a> (erudite cultural tailoring) have been made. Due to 
                the rarity of the spawn, and the extreme expense involved, we 
                don't expect to quickly have complete stats for this tailored 
                plate-class armor.</p>
              <p>Thanks to the changes in enchanting metals for smithing, we're 
                gradually learning more about the various enchanted cultural armors. 
                The <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">armor stats 
                page</a> has been updated and slightly revamped to make it easier 
                to find out what we know.</p>

                <b>Message board downtime. </b>All EZBoards, including the EQTraders 
                Corner boards, will be down tomorrow (Tuesday) from approximately 
                9am to 6pm, PST while they move to a new facility.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">04/17/01</span> <i><b>(Updated)</b></i><br>
                <b>Patch Day!</b> It's that time again, and there are several 
                known tradeskill changes in it:</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>Durations on food items have changed. We've got a thread on 
                the baking message boards tracking meal/snack status on various 
                goodies. Some foods also have stat bonuses listed, however, these 
                bonuses are NOT actually showing up when you right-click to eat 
                the food.</li>
              <li>Ovens have been added to Grobb. I'll get info on where, and 
                put it on the proper Trade Supplies pages.</li>
              <li>Buying stacks of items off merchants has been implemented. This, 
                of course, only works if the item is stackable. Also, merchants 
                have improved their inventory retention program, and fully count 
                stacks of items that are sold to them, so that they can sell all 
                the items back to someone else. (Before, if you sold a stack of 
                items to a merchant, the merchant paid for them all, but would 
                then only think he/she had one of the item to sell back.)</li>
              <li>World (stationary) trade containers have been fixed. This <i>should</i> 
                fix the crash to desktop problem folks were having on a combine, 
                and solve the confusion generated when folks thought their ingredients 
                were disappearing after an incorrect combine (from a wrong recipe). 
                This likely does NOT address the tailoring issues we're seeing, 
                and once the dust has settled, we'll need to start getting in 
                feedback if the DNC problems are still continuing for portable 
                trade containers such as sewing kits.</li>
              <li><b><i>Cooking spits have had their weight increased to 3. Contrary 
                to the patch message, skewers are still weight 0.1</i></b></li>
              <li>Last, but <i>definitely</i> not least, enchanting metals for 
                cultural smithing no longer requires gems during the enchanting 
                process. This is a great boon to cultural smiths, and should allow 
                us to experiment a bit more easily with some of the enchanted 
                armors and weapons. There's already been much rejoicing over the 
                news that this was on Test, and I expect we'll see a lot of the 
                &quot;gaps&quot; in our enchanted cultural armor stats information 
                filled in over the next week or two.</li>
            </ul>

                <b>Thanks folks!</b> Thanks to feedback from various folks who 
                follow these boards, the QA folks may have nailed down the crash 
                to desktop problem with tradeskill containers. I'm still not sure 
                if the DNC message folks have been getting on valid recipes are 
                linked (i.e., &quot;phantom&quot; items still in the container 
                from a failed combine) or not, but they've at least found part 
                of the problem, and are working to resolve it. For those of you 
                unaware of what I'm talking about, here's a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000032.html">link 
                to the thread over on the SONY boards</a>. </p>

                <b>One Million ... Plus!</b> Thanks to Ragefire not showing up 
                for a few days on my server (just when I'm one of the prime people 
                &quot;camping&quot; for hours on end to try to get him for a guildmate), 
                I'm even more behind on things than normal. However, since today's 
                a banner day, of sorts, it deserves some sort of post. The message 
                boards topped the 1 million hit mark today, since their rebirth 
                a year ago January. (That's a half a million hits just since this 
                January.) I wish I had better stats for the main website, which 
                is tracked separately from the boards, but we only have stats 
                for the last couple of months since I moved hosting providers. 
                If March's traffic is any indication, I'd expect that the main 
                site will get over a million hits this month, on top of all the 
                heavy volume on the message boards. Welcome to the mainstream, 
                folks! It's only going to get busier from here, with all the changes/additions 
                to tradeskills that have been happening.</p>
              <p>Other mini-updates. Thanks to Khrolan and his raids, I was able 
                to test out two more pieces of the ice burrower silk (&quot;ice 
                silk&quot;) armor this week, as well as verify stats on two more 
                pieces of haze panther armor. As soon as I get more haze panther 
                pelts, I'll try to get stat verification for the final piece of 
                that set, then will be trying to avoid my sewing kit except for 
                testing the rest of the ice silk and the velium hound armor as 
                parts are available. It's STILL taking folks about 10 tell bombs 
                to get it to sink in that I'm not tailoring for other folks anymore, 
                but eventually folks will either accept that no means NO, or I'll 
                be clearing out and refilling my /ignore list every half an hour 
                because of all the folks who think I &quot;owe&quot; them civil 
                conversation on tradeskills in the middle of a raid. ;)</p>

                <b>FanFest = one exhausted halfling!!!</b> I'll likely have more 
                of an update on Monday, after I sleep, deal with an in-game wedding 
                tomorrow, etc., etc. Meanwhile, as soon as I got home, I went 
                in-game and verified two recipes that other players gave me at 
                the FanFest: <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=449.topic">pickled

                my friend. Meanwhile, the message board links are included for 
                folks. I also added a comment in the huge thread about <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=215.topic&amp;start=81&amp;stop=100">tradeskill 
                containers</a> with an idea that has been brought up to Yakatizma. 
                There are NO promises it will go anywhere, but at least the idea 
                has been aired. There are also <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=446.topic">changes 
                afoot in baking sometime soon</a>, and I'll talk about that, and 
                other experiences from the FanFest (including my interview for 
                the <i>Avatars Offline</i> documentary) ... but likely not until 
                Monday. The same goes for the multitude of posts with trivials 
                and other site updates that I've not dealt with - it likely will 
                be Monday before I tackle much more. Sleeeeeeeeep <i>&lt;thuddddd&gt;</i></p>

                Tradeskill experimenters rejoice! One of the things that has always 
                hindered significant experimentation with the myriad of recipes 
                that we've been told are &quot;out there somewhere&quot; but that 
                have been undiscovered has been resources. It's painfully hard 
                to throw what can be hundreds of platinum pieces' worth of items 
                and/or hours worth of collection time, into a tradeskill container 
                on an &quot;experiment&quot; that will fail and destroy the items. 
                Currently live only on the test server is a change that will make 
                tradeskill containers NOT destroy items that &quot;do not combine&quot; 
                (DNC), making the lives of curious experimenters a lot easier. 
                On the downside, many portable tradeskill containers will given 
                a weight increase, making it harder for packrats like myself to 
                lug about multiple different containers for tradeskilling in the 
                field. (My worst packrat is my shamaness, who regularly carries 
                around a spirit pouch, bearskin potion bag, Coldain Tanners Kit 
                *and* a cooking spit.) Message board threads were popping up all 
                over regarding this change, and I'm trying to get them funneled 
                into <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=215.topic" target="_new">one

              <li>More brewed egg oils have been discovered, though we've not 
                found a use for them yet. Discussion/experimentation for valid 
                egg oil recipes is in this <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbrewing.showMessage?topicID=270.topic">brewing 
                message board thread</a>. Once we know what oils can be made, 
                I'm sure folks (especially tailors) will start trying every crazed 
                combination they can, to see if they can find a use for these, 
                but as always, it will be expensive and time-consuming experimentation 
                since we have no &quot;clues&quot; as to if these are for any 
                implemented recipes, or if they are for future recipes, or if 
                they're just there for the sake of being there.</li>

              <p><span class="dates">03/28/01</span><br>
                <b><u>PART TWO:</u></b> I promised some happier stuff in Part 
                One of today's update (written earlier today). Since then, I've 
                managed to get stats for one piece of ice burrower silk armor, 
                and one of the three velium hound recipes. Eventually, more will 
                follow, but these are high-level mobs, and the parts are hard 
                for any of us tradesfolk to come by, since we're generally so 
                busy huddled over our sewing kits as to not be of a high enough 
                level to hunt these beasts for ourselves. ;)</p>
              <p>I also sent in feedback via the new Sony process for their message 
                boards, regarding today's patch message. I'm sure I'm not the 
                only one that caught the newest &quot;oops&quot; with the note 
                about specialized tradeskill containers telling folks to rely 
                on in-game information and NPC text, then the statement that the 
                Velious tailoring now has to use the Coldain Tanners Kit ... but 
                they forgot to add the note about the kit to the proper recipe 
                book (i.e., Velium Leathers) and/or to any NPC that folks have 
                hailed in Thurgadin. It's been submitted, we'll see where it goes 
                from there. In the meantime, I'll continue to keep on verifying 
                recipes, and making sure that functioning ones are listed here, 
                even when that conflicts with information in the books, etc.</p>
              <p>(<font color="#FF0000"><b>Corrected update:</b></font> the crystalline 
                silk still works in the large tailoring kit. Ice burrower silk 
                and all the Velium Leathers are confirmed to need the Coldain 
                Tanners Kit. The Fine Furs have not yet been tested in both kits. 
                Also note that <b>these tanning kits are MISSING on the Zeb server</b>, 
                possibly others. It has been bugged. One of these years someone 
                will remember to bring down Thurgadin on that server and patch 
                it in.)</p>
              <p><b><u>PART ONE:</u></b> The &quot;About&quot; page has been updated 
                at long last. I'm not happy to have to spell things out as bluntly 
                as I did there, and I fear it will give the wrong message to the 
                99.9% of you who are truly emjoying/using this resouce, while 
                the 0.1% of the ingrates that have spurred the change blithely 
                ignore it, and try to hound me until I get fed up enough to throw 
                in the towel and close all this down.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, once we've got some more positive news on tradeskills 
                (such as after I get my hands on the ice burrower silk and velium 
                hound fur that folks in one of the bigger guilds on my server 
                are risking life and limb to obtain for recipe verification and 
                testing), I'll be glad to balance all this depressing stuff with 
                happier celebration. ;)</p>
              <p><b>Time will tell:</b> if the changes to the SONY boards means 
                that they are continuing their recent track record of ignoring 
                anything that is uncomfortable to them, or if it will truly mean 
                that there will be more positive change and improvement on things 
                that are currently broken (and repeatedly reported as bugs) ... 
                if something to bridge the 131 to 230+ tailoring gap will be put 
                in within a few weeks, or take months, if it ever goes in at all 
                ... if the steelsilk recipes (aka Terrorantula silks) that have 
                been in-game for a few weeks will be actually functional, with 
                all parts dropping in reasonable amounts (more than 2 or 3 silks 
                per server per day) on the live servers within a month ... if 
                the sense of &quot;community&quot; that was on the SONY boards 
                has been totally destroyed by the sudden changes on the SONY boards 
                just at a time when a noticeable chunk of the EQ community can't 
                stay connected due to the recent patch or if folks will continue 
                to be forgiving, even though the timing on the board revamp was 
                horrific ... whether recipe books will be updated to be correct 
                any time in our lifetime (this includes not only the Velium Leatherworking 
                book which doesn't make any mention of Coldain Tanner's Kit and 
                never has, but also things like the several baking recipe books 
                that have been incorrect for well over a year) ... whether other 
                tradeskill improvements that were promised and/or hinted at many 
                months ago will be seen any time, *in a fully working order* will 
                be seen any time in the next half a year.</p>
              <p>I won't hold my breath, but life goes on. So do tradeskills. 
                There's always something more that needs verification, more stats 
                that need to be scrounged, etc., etc. You can play a passive part 
                and simply slurp up the wealth of information provided here, or 
                you can dive in, pitch in, and instead of saying &quot;I can't 
                believe she doesn't have <i>X</i> yet, since it's out on the net&quot;, 
                spend the extra few minutes to go out on &quot;the net&quot;, 
                find it, and post it here. </p>
              <p>The message boards are, as expected, seeing a higher load than 
                ever before. A second message board admin has been added, but, 
                as always, this is a labor of love for the folks that help out 
                around here and stomping around finding fault with stuff instead 
                of rolling up your sleeves and helping out is, and always has 
                been, considered bad form on in <i>this</i> community.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">03/28/01</span><br>
                <b>Velious recipes now need the Coldain Tanner's Kit</b>. Imagine 
                that. Almost 4 months AFTER the recipes are put in game, they 
                retroactively &quot;fix&quot; the recipes to not work in a normal 
                sewing kit, wait a day, then announce they were supposed to use 
                a different kit all along, then they bring down Thurgadin on all 
                servers to patch in said Tanner's Kit. Oh, SO sorry for the inconvenience 
                folks, this is what we intended all along, but had to do bass-ackwards 
                &quot;fix&quot; before we bothered telling anyone about the fix, 
                nor before we fixed the recipe books or put the kit in place. 
                That's no way to run a business.</p>
              <p>Before this patch, earlier today, I posted about the Velious 
                tailoring problems, and counseled patience, since I had faith 
                that Verant would find the problem and fix it. Foolish halfling. 
                My rose-colored glasses are now ground into dust, and the only 
                thing I have faith in is that they've finally pushed me over the 
                edge. Even when I've been upset at how things are working, and 
                upset with snerts in-game, I've tried VERY hard to put a positive 
                spin on things and not degenerate into Verant-bashing, but right 
                now I am SO steamed at the folks responsible for this mismanaged 
                &quot;fix&quot; that it isn't funny. It's taken two years, but 
                I've lost my faith in them ... but not in the wonderful folks 
                in this tradeskill community, so I'll keep plugging along, somehow, 
                for your sake.</p>
              <p>That having been said -- loyal visitors to this site and the 
                message boards, please brace yourselves, the worst is to come. 
                Verant's tired of folks getting mad at them when they mess up, 
                have pretty much taken away their message boards, and I expect 
                a large backwash of angry folks here.</p>
              <p>I know we're all going to want to rant and rave here, since they've 
                taken away places where issues can be raised elsewhere. Just remember: 
                This site is not connected to Verant. This site is at best viewed 
                by them as a &quot;fan&quot; site and at worst as a &quot;spoiler&quot; 
                site, and some of them would probably like nothing better than 
                to see it go under. If you use my boards as the dumping ground 
                for everything you're pissed at <i>them</i> about, it just might 
                go under as I hit total burnout and total frustration. Remember: 
                yes, folks here want to know about things that don't work BUT 
                if you're reporting something broken here, you'd better report 
                it to Verant through their lovely new submission process too. 
                Oh, and don't mention you got the recipes from here, else they're 
                likely to ignore you as working from &quot;spoiler&quot; recipes. 
                {rolls eyes}</p>
              <p>I am putting up a <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm58">&quot;Primal 
                Scream Room&quot;</a> message board forum. If you need to just 
                blow your top over this, do it there. Do NOT dump it onto the 
                other forums, such as the Tailoring section, etc. Keep it as clean 
                as you can. Do not use that area to do personal attacks against 
                others. Other than that, those of you that want to just plug your 
                ears and keep on going with your tradeskills are free to do so 
                in the rest of the forums, with less screaming going on in them.</p>
