<span class="headers">September 28, 2003 - We're Back!</span>
<p>
We are back from the Fan Faire safe and sound, though my voice is still on vacation ... somewhere. If you find it wandering around lost, please return it to me.  My cats are very unsettled by this stranger that smells like `mommy`, but sounds nothing like her!
<p>I will try to whip up a summary of the tradeskill issues tomorrow or the next day, but my first priority is going to be going over the issues with Maddoc, to see what can/should be addressed right away, what is going to be a while down the road, and what of it is going to fall in the `no can do` category. (Maddoc is the new tradeskill guy at SOE now that Frizznik has been promoted - we'd been keeping it a bit quiet to give him a chance to settle in before he got inundated.)  ;)<p>
Anyway, more in the next day or so. I just wanted to let folks know that I am back, and will be getting an update out soon.</p>

<p><span class="headers">September 21, 2003 - Fan Faire time!</span>
<p>
It's that time again! The time has flown and another <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/">EQ Fan Faire</a> is upon us.  I'd not said much about it until now, as we'd not been able to finalize our plans.  Hubby's managed to talk his partner into covering at the store, and we're going to board our very sick kitty at the vet's for special care while we're gone. (We're currently having many adventures with trying to feed her through a tube in her throat ... and seem to be learning new ways of interior decorating the house with cat food paste as we do so!) While we're there, I'm hoping to gather folks from the EQTC community together for a group photo. I'll update my first post in <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&threadid=10788">this thread</a> when we have a time and a place set up.</p>

<p><span class="headers">September 09, 2003 - Lost Dungeons of Norrath</span>
<p>
Today's patch marks the launch of the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion. As information becomes available regarding the new tradeskill recipes, my hard-working staff will work on getting the information onto the site.  (I've already trickled a couple alchemy recipes into place, without full item details.)  I've also started <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&threadid=10495">a thread in the database forum</a> for folks to add in their own details on the new stuff.</p>

<p><span class="headers">August 27, 2003 - Lost and Found</span>
<p>
Rumors that the extremely reclusive DenMother was actually found poking her nose into the lands have been confirmed.  It seems that the wee lass went on a tour of the upcoming <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/">Lost Dungeons of Norrath</a> yesterday, alongside Absor, Illia and others. While I did not get to poke at tradeskills at all during the tour, I did <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g223">get to see a few interesting things first-hand</a>.<p>
While I did not have the "oomph" to poke at tradeskills, thanks to an ofer from SOE, a few folks from the EQTC tradeskill community will have a chance to help test during the final week of beta next week. I've got PMs out to various folks now, and if I'm short on responses, or more decline due to RL time constraints, I may put something up on the boards this evening (Pacific time) to grab a couple late additions to the list I send in tomorrow. Keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>
I'm still awaiting word on just what caused the outages for both the site and the boards (hosted on separate servers specifically so we'd be less likely to have this sort of problem ..., but at long last, we're back!<p>

Sorry about that, folks.  :/</p>
