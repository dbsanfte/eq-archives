      <span class="headers">Ak`Anon Bertoxx Warrior (Plague Warrior) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many youngling armor quests based out of Ak'Anon. It is specifically for gnome warriors that worship Bertoxx. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
Similar structure to the other evil melee class-specific quests - you get a parchment from the quest giver (Naygog Mitope ) which you have to give to a secondary NPC (Windlebeck Tobokog), who will then give you a kit (a Mail Assembly Kit, exactly the same one as the evil rogue, cleric and shadowknight kits I think, and LORE so you can't get one of each). Windlebeck will then tell you the recipe for each item and give you a mold (Crude [xxx] Mold) when prompted. These molds appear to be exactly the same items as the evil cleric/shadowknight Crude [xxx] Molds (i.e. they're interchangeable). The primary quest giver gives out the class-specific weapon quest.
<p>
Your Location is 2109.61, -505.88, -182.06, in Ak'Anon
</p>
<p>
 You say, 'Hail, Naygog Mitope'
</p>
<p>
 Naygog Mitope says 'Hail Genumkin. I train those young gnomes who wish to [serve as a warrior] in the service of the Dark Reflection and our patron, Bertoxxulous the Plaguelord. Decay and destruction are powerful forces that influence Norrath. It is the duty of the Warriors of the Dark Reflection to bring destruction to the weak and injury to the strong so that our fellow gnomes may be reminded of their own mortality and new strong individuals may rise to power before Bertoxxulous decides it is their time to decay and be replaced like countless before them.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i serve as a warrior'
</p>
<p>
 Naygog Mitope says 'Ours is the duty of a martyr, to be the hated and feared hand of destruction and catalyst of change. All roads are paved with destruction and in turn are eventually destroyed. All machines are built from the rubble of broken mountains and in turn become rust and bits of metal. You must outfit yourself with the tools of a warrior, crafted from the destruction of archaic clockworks that have long since finished serving the purpose for which they were built. Take this parchment to Windlebeck Tobokog, he will assist you in the construction of a suit of armor. When you have been properly outfitted return to me for [further instruction].'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what further instruction?'
</p>
<p>
 Naygog Mitope says 'It is one thing to destroy the artificial life of a clockwork. It is another thing entirely to claim the life of another gnome. There is a member of the Dark Reflection, Yulcabis, who has been assigned to a task in the Steamfont Mountains. He has failed repeatedly in the tasks assigned to him in the past and has become a burden to the Dark Reflection. Find Yulcabis and slay him. Return to me with the weapon he carries.'
</p>
<p>
Windlebeck Tobokog is found with Mimtia Zethkog, Rebbie Romblerum and Glerbella Gibblix, in the tunnels at 2159.36, -592.41, -182.06. You give him the parchment...
</p>
<p>
Windlebeck Tobokog says 'Hail Genumkin! You must be one of Naygog's new soldiers. Naygog has asked me to help get you outfitted in a suit of armor to protect you from the weapons of our foes. I have assembled a kit for you that will allow you to construct the armor pieces once you have gathered the necessary components. The required components vary according to which piece of Plague Warrior Armor you are planning on assembling. Do you wish to craft a [plague warrior helm], a [plague warrior bracer], [plague warrior gauntlets], [plague warrior boots], [plague warrior vambraces], [plague warrior greaves], or a [plague warrior breastplate].'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i wish to craft a plague warrior helm'
</p>
<p>
 Windlebeck Tobokog says 'To assemble a Plague Warrior Helm you will need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Helm Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Helm with a Ruined Coyote Pelt and two Rebel Clockwork Eye Lenses in the Mail Assembly Kit.'

</p>

Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Vambraces with a Low Quality Coyote Pelt and two Rebel Clockwork Arm Sections in the Mail Assembly Kit.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i wish to craft some plague warrior greaves'
