            <h3>The Boat Beacon Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This quest originates in Qeynos and involves a small smithing 
              component. Additional details will be forthcoming.</i></p>
            <p><br>
              This is an old quest that may not be fully solved. As additional 
              details become available, this page will be updated.</p>
            <p><br>
              This quest starts in South Qeynos near the docks. Speak with Danaria 
              Hollin. She is an Erudite enchanter, and you may need to do some 
              faction work in order to get her to speak with you. <i>(Further 
              testing is needed to see if the faction adjustments from giving 
              Palatos the drinks will be sufficient to adjust your faction with 
              her.)</i></p>
            <p><br>
              You say, 'Hail, Danaria Hollin'<br>
              Danaria Hollin says 'Greetings! Nice to meet someone with manners. 
              I do not see how you people stand to live in this madhouse of ruffians. 
              I would have left weeks ago if I were not waiting for a delivery. 
              Oh, well. Nice to have met you.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what delivery?'<br>
              Danaria Hollin says 'I am in Qeynos to meet up with a fellow Erudite 
              coming from Freeport. He is two weeks late and I fear <br>
              the worst. I shall need to hire some lackey to go to Freeport to 
              find him.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a lackey'<br>
              Yes, that might work. Please go to Freeport and find him. His name 
              is Palatos Kynarn. Tell him that Danaria has sent you for <br>
              the painting. And be quick about it! Thank you.'</p>
            <p><br>
              I took this to mean &quot;get the painting from Freeport and give 
              it to me&quot;.</p>
            <p><br>
              Go to East Freeport, in the slum area. Palatos Kynarn is propped 
              up at the bar, having a few drinks.</p>
            <p><br>
              You say, 'Hail, Palatos Kynarn'<br>
              Palatos Kynarn says 'What do you want? Can't you see that I wish 
              to be alone?! I have no need nor desire to speak with <br>
              anyone. I have a minor dilemma to ponder and the only person I wish 
              to speak with is the [captain].'</p>
            <p><i>(he doesn't respond to anything with the phrase Captain that 
              I could determine)</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Danaria sent me'<br>
              Palatos Kynarn says 'If you are working for Danaria, you have been 
              misguided. You will go back to her empty handed. Now <br>
              leave. The [captain] and I have some business to discuss.'</p>
            <p><br>
              The bartender sells a drink called Captain Orlins Spiced Ale. </p>
            <p>Nesin Tapper tells you, 'That'll be 5 silver 6 copper per Capt. 
              Orlin's Spiced Ale.'</p>
            <p>Buy four of them, and give them to Palatos</p>
            <p>Palatos Kynarn says 'Mmmm.. more.. must.. drown.. sorrow..'<br>
              Palatos Kynarn says 'Mmmm.. more.. must.. drown.. sorrow..'<br>
              Palatos Kynarn says 'Mmmm.. more.. must.. drown.. sorrow..'<br>
              Palatos Kynarn says 'Ahh.. I.. &lt;Hic!!&gt; Need help.. &lt;Hic!!&gt; 
              You.. take this.. Go build.. boat beacon. &lt;Hic!!&gt; Ask gnomes 
              <br>
              about.. &lt;Hic!!&gt; boat beacon. They know how.. Then bring back.. 
              &lt;Hic!!&gt; Unnnhh!! Prexus help me!! I will never drink <br>
              again.'</p>

                You gain experience!!</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You are given a beacon Mount as well.</p>
            <p><br>
              Ok, time to annoy all the gnomes in Freeport (there are not many, 
              thankfully), and Svinal Wyspin is our guy.</p>
            <p><br>
              You say, 'Hail, Svinal Wyspin'<br>
              You say, 'Boat beacon?'<br>
              Svinal Wyspin says 'What!!? Looking for a boat beacon? We may be 
              getting one from Ak'Anon in about a year. You can always try to 
              make one. Find a greater lightstone, a metal disk and a copper band. 
              If you have a beacon mount, go to a forge and combine them all. 
              It's not that hard, but it's not that easy, either.'</p>
            <p>Svinal sells the metal disk and copper band. Greater Lightstones 
              are dropped from wisps. The beacon mount was given to you by Palatos. 
              Combine in a forge to make a Boat Beacon (LORE, NO DROP), trivial 
              &lt;= 87.</p>
            <p>Give the Boat Beacon back to Palatos</p>
            <p>Palatos Kynarn says 'Thanks.. &lt;Hic!!&gt; That saved me a lot 
              of money. Now I can spend more time with the captain before I <br>
              give this back to Lenka Stoutheart. Here is a little something.'<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Your faction standing with Craftkeepers got better.<br>

                You gain experience!!<br>
                You receive 1 platinum from Palatos Kynarn.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><br>
              Hmm. ok. You need to do it it all again and make another Boat Beacon.</p>
            <p>Give the Boat Beacon to Leanka Stoutheart (tavern near docks in 
              East Freeport)</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Lenka Stoutheart'<br>
              Lenka Stoutheart says 'Run while ye still can!! The Wolves o' the 
              North will not tolerate yer presence!'<br>
              Lenka Stoutheart looks your way apprehensively -- You would probably 
              win this fight..it's not certain though.<br>
              Lenka Stoutheart says 'Oh!! You must work for that Erudite named 
              Palatos. I guess he won't have to spend anymore money drinking in 
              Freeport. Here. Here is the portrait I kept until he could get me 
              a new boat beacon.'<br>

            <p><br>
              Recieve a portrait of King Ak'Anon.</p>
            <p><i>[log ends at this point for some reason, I will update text 
              with next step soon]</i></p>
            <p>(note, I have given this portrait back to Danaria, but she just 
              gives it back. You can give it to Palatos for more faction, but 
              he gives you nothing back...)</p>
