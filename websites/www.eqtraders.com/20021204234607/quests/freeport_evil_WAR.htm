            <h3> Dismal Warrior Armor - Freeport Warrior of Innoruuk Quests<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer) and no drop. 
            <p> 
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Brutol Rhaksen' </p>
            <p>Brutol Rhaksen says 'Oh, hello down there, puny one. I'm Brutol 
              Rhaksen, Commmander of warriors who [serve the Dismal Rage], and 
              that's really all you need to know..for now.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I serve the Dismal Rage' </p>
            <p>Brutol Rhaksen says 'You must become strong to survive amongst 
              the ranks of the Dismal Rage. Take this note to Rolfic Gohar and 
              he will help you get a suit of armor to protect your scrawny hide 
              from the weapons of our enemies. Once you have been properly outfitted 
              return to me and will give you your [next orders].' </p>
            <p>Rolfic Gohar is outside the Dismal Rage building. Hand him the 
              note. </p>
            <p>Rolfic Gohar says 'I see now we have similar interests. I will 
              help you get outfitted in an affordable suit of armor to help you 
              in your endeavors. You will need this Mail Assembly Kit to aid you 
              in the construction of the armor. The materials required depend 
              on the armor section you desire to craft. Do you plan to construct 
              a [dismal warrior helm], a [dismal warrior bracer], [dismal warrior 
              gauntlets], [dismal warrior boots], [dismal warrior vambraces], 
              [dismal warrior greaves], or a [dismal warrior breastplate].' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a dismal warrior helm' </p>
            <p>Rolfic Gohar says 'To assemble a Dismal Warrior Helm you will need 
              to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a [forge] with 
              a Water Flask and this Crude Helm Mold. Once that is done combine 
              the Crude Iron Helm with a Ruined Coyote Pelt and two Desert Tarantula 
              Eyes in the Mail Assembly Kit.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a dismal warrior bracer' </p>
            <p>Rolfic Gohar says 'To assemble a Dismal Warrior Mail Bracer you 
              will need to obtain a brick of crude iron and smelt it in a [forge] 
              with a Water Flask and this Crude Bracer Mold. Once that is done, 
              combine the Crude Iron Bracer with a Ruined Coyote Pelt and a Dune 
              Spiderling Tibia in the Mail Assembly Kit.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft dismal warrior gauntlets' </p>
            <p>Rolfic Gohar says 'To assemble Dismal Warrior Gauntlets you will 
              need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a [forge] 
              with a Water Flask and this crude Gauntlet Mold. Once that is done 
              combine the Crude Iron Gauntlets with a Ruined Coyote Pelt and two 
              Dune Spiderling Tarsi in the Mail Assembly Kit.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft dismal warrior boots' </p>
            <p>Rolfic Gohar says 'To assemble Dismal Warrior Mail Boots you will 
              need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a [forge] 
              with a Water Flask and this crude Boot Mold. Once that is done combine 
              the Crude Iron Boots with two Ruined Coyote Pelts, and two Dune 
              Spiderling Hairs in the Mail Assembly Kit.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft dismal warrior vambraces' </p>
            <p>Rolfic Gohar says 'To assemble Dismal Warrior Vambraces you will 
              need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a [forge] 
              with a Water Flask and this Crude Vambrace Mold. Once that is done 
              combine the Crude Iron Vambraces with a Low Quality Coyote Pelt 
              and two Desert Tarantula Patella in the Mail Assembly Kit.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft dismal warrior greaves' </p>
            <p>Rolfic Gohar says 'To assemble Dismal Warrior Greaves you will 
              need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a [forge] 
              with a Water Flask and this Crude Greaves Mold. Once that is done 
              combine the Crude Iron Greaves with two Low Quality Coyote Pelts 
              and two Desert Tarantula Femurs in the Mail Assembly Kit.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft dismal warrior breastplate' </p>
            <p>Rolfic Gohar says 'To assemble a Dismal Warrior Breastplate you 
              will need to obtain four bricks of crude iron and smelt them in 
              a [forge] with a Water Flask and this Crude Breastplate Mold. Once 
              that is done combine the Crude Iron Breastplate with a Coyote Pelt, 
              a Dune Tarantula Thorax, and a Dune Tarantula Abdomen in the Mail 
              Assembly Kit.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'Give me my next orders' </p>
            <p>Brutol Rhaksen says 'Ready to make yourself useful ____? Beneath 
              West Freeport are sewer tunnels leading to North Freeport being 
              used by the Knights of Truth and the Sentries and Passion that have 
              gained too much notoriety with the Freeport Militia and the Dismal 
              Rage to pass safely through the eastern and western quarters of 
              Freeport. We believe a sympathizer of the Sentries of Passion, Tarsa 
              Yovar, is hiding somewhere in the western tunnel system. The sympathizer 
              is a Steel Warrior faithful to Erollisi and although she is only 
              a minor nuisance must be dealt with. Find her and bring me her head.'</p>
