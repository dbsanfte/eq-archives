<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Hiloan O`Yviania'</p>
<p>Hiloan O`Yviania  glances at you and holds your stare for a moment before speaking, 'I don't suppose you have any skill at all throwing pots or at the kiln, because if you do I could use your help with some of the more [intricate items] that the fools around here are always breaking.'</p>
<p>You say, 'intricate items?'</p>
<p>Hiloan O`Yviania says 'I have been given the unsatisfying task of replacing [specialty items] for the gardeners and the folks that deal in poisons and other such things.  But I just don't have time for it.  I have my own research into the native clay to work on.  There appear to be golems made out of a type of clay that was dug up long ago, when this land was much more fertile and magical.  The clay of these [ancient golems] is more powerful and useful than the rest.  If you are interested in helping Malkidiv out with lesser tasks, talk to him.  He can also refine chunks of broken golem for you.'</p>
<p>You say 'specialty items?'</p>
<p>Hiloan O`Yviania says 'Let's put you to work.  You don't have to be a skilled potter to handle this.  Oh and, well, I'll need you to get some Clump of Refined Taelosian Golem Clay from Malkidiv.  He can refine chunks of golems for you, if you can find some.  I won't need the ancient stuff for these tasks.  Hand me the clumps and I'll get you started.  Work hard for me and I'll reward you with the secret recipe that Malkidiv and I share.  And since what I need is more difficult to obtain, I'll be quicker to reward you.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Malkidiv U`Ycionuz is right next to Hiloan on the Queen of Thorns.  Give him a Chunk of Broken Taelosian Stone Worker and he will convert it into two Clump of Refined Taelosian Clay. (You will also need to do this every time you run out of Clump of Refined Taelosian Clay and need more for this quest.)  Hand one of those clays to Hiloan to begin her quest to learn the process needed to make Clump of Refined Taelosian Clay for yourself.</p>
<p>STEP ONE: Wayfarer Augment Receptacle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hiloan O`Yviania says 'Let's start you out on one of the more urgent requests.  We use special ceramic receptacles to hold those augment stones to the buoys and other important locations.  We need to get a stockpile of those ready in case we need them.  They are easy to make, just put a small block of refined clay and the receptacle mold into a kiln and fire them.  Bring them back to me when they cool off.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then gives you enough materials to make 10 Wayfarer Augment Receptacles.  Combine them in a kiln and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Wayfarer Augment Receptacles.  When you give her the next Clump of Refined Taelosian Clay, she will move on to step two.</p>
<p>STEP TWO: Wayfarer Crucible</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hiloan O`Yviania says ''Fine.  I need you to make some replacement crucibles for various researchers on this ship.  Take a small block of refined golem clay and a Wayfarer crucible mold and fire them in the kiln.  Bring them back to me as soon as you can, this research is vital.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then gives you enough materials to make 10 Wayfarer Crucibles.  Combine them in a kiln and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Wayfarer Crucibles.  When you give her the next Clump of Refined Taelosian Clay, she will move on to step three.</p>
<p>STEP THREE: Wayfarer Watering Can</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hiloan O`Yviania says 'Hm . . . You're not too horrible at this.  Maybe you can start working on something less urgent but more complicated.  There are some obsessed gnomes on this ship that insist on keeping gardens.  It seems that someone has been using their watering cans as weapons and targets.  We could use some more.  Take a small block of refined Taelosian clay and a flask of purified sea water and form the unfired watering can on the pottery wheel.  Then take the unfired watering can to the kiln and add the waterproofer.  Fire those and bring them back to me.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then gives you enough materials to make 10 Unfired Wayfarer Watering Cans, plus materials to turn those into 10 Wayfarer Watering Cans.  Combine the clay and water in a pottery wheel and then each of those results with a waterproofer in a kiln.  Turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Wayfarer Watering Cans.  When you give her the next Clump of Refined Taelosian Clay, she will move on to step four.</p>
<p>STEP FOUR: Wayfarer Vial</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hiloan O`Yviania says 'You've been pretty useful.  How about you start work on some vials for storing our concoctions.  Just use the flasks of purified sea water, a small block of refined Taelosian clay and a Wayfarers liner sketch on the pottery wheel to make an unfired vial.  Take that vial to the kiln and fire it with the waterproofer and you should have a useable vial.  Bring them back to me as soon as you can.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then gives you enough materials to make 10 Unfired Wayfarer Vials, plus materials to turn those into 10 Wayfarer Vials.  Combine each clay, sketch and water in a pottery wheel and then each of those results with a waterproofer in a kiln.  Turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Wayfarer Vials.  Give her one last Clump of Refined Taelosian Clay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hiloan O`Yviania says 'You've been helpful.  Really don't have anything more for you to do.  Go over and talk to Malkidiv and he'll give you your reward.  Make sure to tell him how much [help] you've been.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow her instructions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'help'</p>
<p>Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'You've been a great help already.  I'd feel very guilty asking you to help out any further.  There are others that can do that work for us.  For all of your efforts, I'd be honored to teach you the secret of refining chunks of broken stone worker into refined Taelosian clay and hunks of broken ancient stone worker into refined ancient Taelosian clay.'  Malkidiv pulls a small text from his coat and leans forward to show you a few of the pages.  What he shows you seems amazingly simple once you've seen it.  You think that with practice you might be able to get better results than Malkidiv gives to those that he refines clay for.  Just place a single chunk of broken Taelosian stone worker onto a pottery wheel and you will receive clump of refined Taelosian clay.'</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>You now have the ability to turn Chunk of Broken Taelosian Stone Worker into Clump of Refined Taelosian Clay in a pottery wheel, as well as Chunk of Broken Ancient Stone Worker into Clump of Refined Ancient Taelosian Clay.
