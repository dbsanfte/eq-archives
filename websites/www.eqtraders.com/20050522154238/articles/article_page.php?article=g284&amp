<p>
<p>Ngreth thinking after long time out hunting and finding tuber strands, that
  Ngreth
want to make some yarn. So Ngreth go.</p>
<p>Ngreth go to Baubleshire where Ngreth now live after proving to Queen Antonia
  that Ngreth good person. Ngreth climes the hill to find the Deductive Annex
  and go in and make some burlap yarn. Once Ngreth in the Deductive Annex, Ngreth
  buy some filament for the loom, and some low quality stroma wash for the thread
  from the merchant in
  the instance. Ngreth could get better and maybe even cheaper stroma oil from
  other players, but Ngreth want to just get it done, and what the merchant sells
  will do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_recipeonly.jpg"><img src="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_recipeonly_tn.jpg" width="129" height="193" border="0" align="right" /></a>So
  Ngreth go to the Sewing table & Mannequin and set himself in front of it.
  Then Ngreth activate it and chooses Burlap Yarn. Ngreth have all the parts
  so Ngreth get started.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_start.jpg"><img src="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_start_tn.jpg" width="256" height="192" border="0" align="bottom" /></a>At first Ngreth no
  know all of what Ngreth will make, but as Ngreth go through the process Ngreth
  will learn more.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_badmeasurements.jpg"><img src="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_badmeasurements_tn.jpg" width="256" height="192" border="0" /></a>Oops, Ngreth
  make a mistake and the measurements are bad. Ngreth responded by reajusting the parts to keep working wiht what I had measured.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_crudestep.jpg"><img src="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_crudestep_tn.jpg" width="256" height="192" border="0" /></a>Ah! after just
  a little time at the table, Ngreth have crude burlap yarn, ngreth could stop
  now, but ngreth want to make it better.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_buffing.jpg"><img src="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_buffing_tn.jpg" width="256" height="192" border="0" /></a>Ngreth know this
  skill called simple beveling where I work on the edges to make the process
  work better,
  though it does wear out the parts just a little faster. Ngreth try it, and
  it work, the results are better!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_finished.jpg"><img src="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_finished_tn.jpg" width="256" height="192" border="0" /></a>So, Ngreth keep
  working and keep improving the yarn. Ngreth make, Shaped, then Normal, and
  finally after almost drifting off thinking about hot and spicy toelings and
  how they melt in the mouth wile the flavors of the mold flow through my mouth...
  oops sorry... Ngreth snaps out of it in time and make pristine burlap yarn!
  Ngreth happy!.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_dreamhurt.jpg"><img src="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_dreamhurt_tn.jpg" width="256" height="192" border="0" /></a>So Ngreth make
  some more and after making a few Ngreth drift off daydreaming about Ogre swill
  and its swampy consistency and how the mud and tadpoles clean Ngreth teeth
  so well and OW! Ngreth catch his arm in the Loom and get hurt!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_choose.jpg"><img src="http://www.eqtraders.com/images/articles/EQ2_choose_tn.jpg" width="256" height="192" border="0" /></a>So Ngreth decide to
  see if any other parts will work, and decides to see what Ngreth has for tubers
  in making the yarn. In this case Ngreth only have other stacks of tubers, so
  it make no difference, but sometime Ngreth have other things to work with and
  sometimes those other things work better, sometimes they work worse. Ngreth
  glad to know that Ngreth can choose.</p>
<p>So Ngreth happy, Ngreth make some yarn that Ngreth can use to make other stuff!</p></p><p>
