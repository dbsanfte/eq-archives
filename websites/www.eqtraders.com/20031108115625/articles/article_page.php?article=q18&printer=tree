<span class="headers">The Boat Beacon Quest</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This quest originates in Qeynos and involves a small smithing component. Additional details will be forthcoming.</i>
</p>
<p>
This is an old quest that may not be fully solved. As additional details become available, this page will be updated.
</p>
<p>
This quest starts in South Qeynos near the docks. Speak with Danaria Hollin. She is an Erudite enchanter, and you may need to do some faction work in order to get her to speak with you. <i>(Further testing is needed to see if the faction adjustments from giving Palatos the drinks will be sufficient to adjust your faction with her.)</i>
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Danaria Hollin'
</p>
<p>
Danaria Hollin says 'Greetings! Nice to meet someone with manners. I do not see how you people stand to live in this madhouse of ruffians. I would have left weeks ago if I were not waiting for a delivery. Oh, well. Nice to have met you.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what delivery?'
</p>
<p>
Danaria Hollin says 'I am in Qeynos to meet up with a fellow Erudite coming from Freeport. He is two weeks late and I fear the worst. I shall need to hire some lackey to go to Freeport to find him.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I am a lackey'
</p>
<p>
Yes, that might work. Please go to Freeport and find him. His name is Palatos Kynarn. Tell him that Danaria has sent you for the painting. And be quick about it! Thank you.'
</p>
<p>
I took this to mean "get the painting from Freeport and give it to me".
</p>
<p>
Go to East Freeport, in the slum area. Palatos Kynarn is propped up at the bar, having a few drinks.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Palatos Kynarn'
</p>
<p>
Palatos Kynarn says 'What do you want? Can't you see that I wish to be alone?! I have no need nor desire to speak with anyone. I have a minor dilemma to ponder and the only person I wish to speak with is the [captain].'
</p>
<p>
<i>(he doesn't respond to anything with the phrase Captain that I could determine)</i>
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Danaria sent me'
</p>
<p>
Palatos Kynarn says 'If you are working for Danaria, you have been misguided. You will go back to her empty handed. Now leave. The [captain] and I have some business to discuss.'
</p>
<p>
The bartender sells a drink called Captain Orlins Spiced Ale.
</p>
<p>
Nesin Tapper tells you, 'That'll be 5 silver 6 copper per Capt. Orlin's Spiced Ale.'
</p>
<p>
Buy four of them, and give them to Palatos
</p>
<p>
Palatos Kynarn says 'Mmmm.. more.. must.. drown.. sorrow..'<br>
Palatos Kynarn says 'Mmmm.. more.. must.. drown.. sorrow..'<br>
Palatos Kynarn says 'Mmmm.. more.. must.. drown.. sorrow..'<br>
Palatos Kynarn says 'Ahh.. I.. <Hic!!> Need help.. <Hic!!> You.. take this.. Go build.. boat beacon. <Hic!!> Ask gnomes about.. <Hic!!> boat beacon. They know how.. Then bring back.. <Hic!!> Unnnhh!! Prexus help me!! I will never drink again.'

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You are given a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6253&menustr=">beacon mount</a> as well.
</p>
<p>
Ok, time to annoy all the gnomes in Freeport (there are not many, thankfully), and Svinal Wyspin is our guy.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Svinal Wyspin'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Boat beacon?'
</p>
<p>
Svinal Wyspin says 'What!!? Looking for a boat beacon? We may be getting one from Ak'Anon in about a year. You can always try to make one. Find a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=2167&menustr=">greater lightstone</a>, a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6254&menustr=">metal disk</a> and a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6255&menustr=">copper band</a>. If you have a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6253&menustr=">beacon mount</a>, go to a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1610&menustr=">forge</a> and combine them all. It's not that hard, but it's not that easy, either.'
</p>
<p>
Svinal sells the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6254&menustr=">metal disk</a> and <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6255&menustr=">copper band</a>. <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=2167&menustr=">greater lightstone</a> are dropped from wisps.

Give the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6256&menustr=">boat beacon</a> back to Palatos
</p>
<p>
Palatos Kynarn says 'Thanks.. <Hic!!> That saved me a lot of money. Now I can spend more time with the captain before I give this back to Lenka Stoutheart. Here is a little something.'
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Hmm. ok. You need to do it it all again and make another <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6256&menustr=">boat beacon</a> .
</p>
<p>
Give the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6256&menustr=">boat beacon</a> to Leanka Stoutheart (tavern near docks in East Freeport)
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Lenka Stoutheart'
</p>
<p>
Lenka Stoutheart says 'Run while ye still can!! The Wolves o' the North will not tolerate yer presence!'
</p>
<p>
Lenka Stoutheart looks your way apprehensively -- You would probably win this fight..it's not certain though.
</p>
<p>
Lenka Stoutheart says 'Oh!! You must work for that Erudite named Palatos. I guess he won't have to spend anymore money drinking in Freeport. Here. Here is the portrait I kept until he could get me a new boat beacon.'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Your faction standing with Wolves of the North got better.<br>
Your faction standing with Shamen of Justice got better.<br>
Your faction standing with Merchants of Halas got better.<br>
Your faction standing with Steel Warriors got better.<br>
You gain experience!!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Recieve a portrait of King Ak'Anon.
</p>
<p>
<i>[log ends at this point for some reason, I will update text with next step soon]</i>
</p>
<p>
(note, I have given this portrait back to Danaria, but she just gives it back. You can give it to Palatos for more faction, but he gives you nothing back...)
