            <h3> Shar Vahl Progressive Pottery Quest</h3>
            <p><b><font color="#FF0000">Final step currently bugged</font></b></p>
            <p><i>(Note: the runequill sets are downward compatible - anywhere 
              it calls for a basic runequill set, you can use the novice or finely 
              crafted sets; where it calls for the novice set, you can also use 
              the finely crafted set)</i></p>
            <p>This quest originates with Merchant Ayyad (loc 240, -187) in Shar 
              Vahl. Give him your <a href="citizenship.htm">personal acrylia slate</a> 
              and he says '</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Some of my wares are spoiling and I must place them in a container 
                to preserve them. I cannot afford to take the loss that would 
                result if they were to rot. Please _____, take this bowl and combine 
                two lumps of gray mud with a flask of water and xakra bile. Take 
                the resulting clay and this sketch with another water flask to 
                fashion an unfired gray jar. Fire it in a kiln with a firing sheet 
                and return to me with the product as soon as you can.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He then hands you Ayyad's Clay Bowl (4 slot medium container), 
              and a reusable Grey Jar Sketch. (As always, make sure you have a 
              container spot free.) (2 gray mud, 1 xakra bile, 1 flask of water, 
              combined in Ayyad's Clay Bowl. Then take the resulting clay ball 
              and throw it, a flask of water, and your Grey Jar Sketch onto a 
              pottery wheel. Fire the resulting unfired jar in the kiln with a 
              firing sheet. Lumps of gray mud are a ground spawn in the pit surrounding 
              the city of Shar Vahl)</p>
            <p>Bring the resulting Grey Jar to Merchant Ayyad.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Merchant Ayyad says 'Excellent! Please accept this knapsack as 
                payment for your trouble. Here is my seal as well. I can always 
                use more jars and if you give me four of my seals I will share 
                with you a family secret. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He will give you Ayyad's Knapsack, a 4 slot medium container (<i>LORE 
              - Sell before giving next Grey Jar</i> ... and, as usual, make sure 
              you have a container spot free before you hand in the jar to him). 
              He will also give you Ayyad's Seal.</p>
            <p>Continue making and handing in grey jars until you have 4 seals, 
              then give the 4 seals to Merchant Ayyad.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Merchant Ayyad says 'Excellent, ___ few of our kind show a true 
                interest in the more refined arts of pottery these days. It is 
                very good to see the young people taking interest in the old arts. 
                Here is a Basic Runequill Set. Take the instruments in the set 
                and practice marking runes on the gray jars that you previously 
                brought to me. To etch the runes, simply cover a gray jar with 
                some Xakra bile and use the Runequill Set to etch the runes on 
                to the jar. You'll want to fire them in a kiln when youre finished. 
                When those jars become trivial come back and give me those basic 
                tools and we'll see about upgrading them.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> He will then give you the <b>Basic Runequill Set </b>(no drop, 
              of course!). Get your pottery skill up over 100, either by making 
              rune grey jars, or other pottery recipes, then hand him back the 
              Basic Runequill set to receive your next tool upgrade.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Merchant Ayyad says 'You're progressing nicely, ____ take this 
                sculpting tool and add it to the set you already have. This new 
                quill set will be able to make some very nice urns that should 
                help ease the burden of moving all that heavy clay around. Take 
                a gray jar and use the new set of tools I've given you to etch 
                Xakra blood into runes on the side of the jars. These should prove 
                to be very useful in your labors in the future. Once you have 
                mastered those runes, bring back your runequill set to me for 
                another addition. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Merchant Ayyad will then hand you your <b>Novice Runequill Set</b> 
              (yes, no drop, did you expect differently? ;D) Work your pottery 
              skill up some more, either on xakra runed jars or other pottery 
              items, then hand him back the Novice Runequill Set to trigger the 
              next tool upgrade.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Merchant Ayyad says 'You continue to amaze me with your progress, 
                ____. Here is the final pen to add to your set of runequills. 
                I have just received word that the king has need of your particular 
                talents. Take this note to Guard Fareed and he will instruct you 
                further. Also, this runequill set is able to mark a set of runes 
                on the Grey Jars with Sonic Wolf Blood. This will enchant the 
                jar and make a great container. I trust your artistic instincts 
                to guide you. You should also tell me when youre ready for some 
                [additional instructions]. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He will hand you a <b>Finely Crafted Runequill Set</b> (did we 
              mention it's no drop?) and Ayaad's Letter to Fareed.</p>
            <p>Guard Fareed will tell you that he needs 10 Vah Shir Figurines 
              for a game of the King's. <i>(I presume that he gives you a 10-slot 
              container for these, but the poster did not mention it)</i>. Reward 
              is unknown at this time.</p>
            <p><i>Tell Merchant Ayyad</i>, 'I am ready for additional instructions' 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Merchant Ayyad says 'Mastered those runes already, ___? You're 
                learning very fast indeed. Your next lesson will be in the molding 
                of a new type of item. You'll need to gather some gray mud from 
                below the city and mix it with some Rockhopper blood to make a 
                block of reddish clay. Take this block of reddish clay and combine 
                it with a Vah Shir model sketch to create an unfired Vah Shir 
                figurines. Fire the model in a kiln with a firing sheet to create 
                a Finished Vah Shir figurine. Finally, use the Runequill Set to 
                etch grimling blood into runes on the figurine. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>While the quest text mentions gray mud, it's actually grey clay 
              that is needed for this step.</p>
            <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>***Unfortunately, this is as far as you 
              can get with this quest ... at this time. Currently, the final step 
              of etching grimling blood on the figurine is eating your runequill 
              set and returning the wrong final product. It's been reported as 
              a bug, and when the status of this quest is known to be changed, 
              this page will be updated**</b></font></p>
