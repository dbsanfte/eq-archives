            <p class="black">Hail and well met, citizens of Norrath! Do you want 
              to learn a trade skill? Do you want to sell the fruits of your labor 
              to other players? Are you trying to find specific items to pratice 
              your craft? Or are you just trying to find someone who sells player-crafted 
              items for a reasonable price on your server? If the answer to any 
              of these questions is "yes", then I hope this site will be of assistance 
              to you. As the game changes and grows, so too, will this site - 
              remember to check back often.</p>

                I don't like having something negative and grumpy on the front 
                page of my site. Unfortunately, a lot of inconsiderate folks drove 
                me to it. I'm moving <a href="the_rant.htm">&quot;the rant&quot;</a> 
                to it's own page. If you are on the Tunare server read it before 
                you even THINK of sending me a tell in-game. Period.</p>
              <p>For the rest of you newer visitors, who have seen something about 
                the new tailored ranger, monk, rogue, etc. armors, please note 
                the following before you think of mail-spamming me for the recipes. 
                Recipes for these pieces are found on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious 
                recipes</a> page. Stats for any pieces that have been made are 
                listed. If you don't see stats for the piece you want, I haven't 
                made it yet, and nobody else who has made it has reported it to 
                me yet. Do not ask me for them, I can't give them to you if I 
                don't have them. If you want something more up-to-date than the 
                recipes pages that I sometimes update several times a day, check 
                the message boards. Do NOT email bomb me asking for more details. 
                There is an entire HUGE community of tradesfolk on the message 
                boards, several of whom can likely answer your questions in a 
                more timely manner than me. To expect me to answer up to 100 pieces 
                of email a day for information that is either clearly printed 
                on the recipes pages, or easily answered on the message boards 
                is silly.</p>
              <p>Those of you who have been loyal followers, and have been showering 
                the boards and my mailbox with your words of support, thank you. 
                I feel a bit better now. Last night was a bit more tolerable, 
                with only one person not wanting to accept my response to &quot;PLEASE 
                visit the website instead of asking me for info&quot;, and sending 
                me another dozen tells while I was, amazingly enough, trying to 
                keep a guildmate of his alive in Kael. Errrmmm. Hopefully word 
                will eventually go out that my tolerance for tell nukes in game 
                is gone. If not, I'll let my &quot;bodyguard&quot; take care of 
                'em. ;)</p>
              <p>A few more of the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">velious 
                tailoring recipes</a> have been verified, and Bristlebane smiled 
                upon me a bit. There were actually more successes than usual on 
                this extremely difficult and extremely frustrating armor ... and 
                some of the pieces may actually be worth wearing.</p>

                Weekend update: Post-patch news. <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_human.htm">Field 
                plate</a> boots are now fixed, but imbued versions are still DNC. 
                The <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">holgresh fur</a> cap 
                and boots that were to be fixed are also still broken. Some <a href="secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">imbued 
                jewelry</a> combinations were implemented, and we've heard that 
                there is more in the works. There is also supposedly something 
                in the works so that the &quot;missing link&quot; between non-cultural 
                tailoring and the extremely difficult velium tailoring will be 
                implemented eventually.</p>
              <p>This brings me to an interesting point, and yes, it means you 
                get to hear another mini-vent here. &lt;g&gt; I was treated rather 
                condescendinly by someone on my server the other day because I 
                am &quot;wasting&quot; my time on the velium tailoring before 
                my halfing racial tailoring was maxxed. (Mind you, this same fellow 
                then tried to hound me into giving/selling/trading haze panther 
                skins, so that he, with his lesser skill, could have the chance 
                to make these items, but that's another story.) I am working on 
                velium tailoring for one reason, and one reason only ... all you 
                folks. I, at least, am enough of a stubborn redhead to keep trying 
                until all the recipes are verified, and the stats are known. There 
                is nothing more frustrating to a tailor to make repeated expensive 
                and time-consuming attempts at making armor, only to find that 
                when you <i>do</i> end up with a success, that the item you've 
                made is nowhere near worth the work you put into it. By collecting 
                as much information as possible on DNCs and stats, I hope that 
                many of you tailors can focus on trying to make the pieces that 
                <i>are</i> worth your while. (Each set seems to have some great 
                items, and some items that no person over level 20 would want.) 
                For those of you who are going to sneer at me as being &quot;foolish&quot; 
                by &quot;wasting&quot; my time on this stuff, while being hypocritical 
                enough to then try to get me to collect pelts for you ... keep 
                it up and you'll find that while I've been the soul of politeness 
                so far, I am well capable of using /ignore ... and the rest of 
                my guild is too. You ARE making use of the fruits of my research 
                on this site, and as such, you have no right to snipe at how that 
                research is done.</p>
