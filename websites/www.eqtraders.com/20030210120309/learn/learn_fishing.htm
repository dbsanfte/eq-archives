              - by Niami </span></p>
            <p>Fishing is <b>the</b> easiest trade skill to master and the quickest 
              one to turn a profit. It also has the added benefit of being a cheap 
              trade skill you can avoid spending training points on, and still 
              keep your profit margin in the manageable ranges.</p>
            <p>Fishing can keep you fed. At low levels, fishing can earn you coins 
              enough to buy those spells or supplies you need in order to practice 
              your more difficult/costly trade skills. For those who don't like 
              /gems, it also gives you something to do when you're recovering 
              mana/health, practicing spell skills, etc. Later in life, fishing 
              will also have a better chance of netting you special items that 
              are needed in other tradeskills (such as<a href="../secrets/recipes_temper.htm"> 
              tanning and temper agents</a> for tailoring and smithing, special 
              fish for <a href="../secrets/recipes_baking.htm">baking exotic dishes</a>, 
              fish that can be <a href="../secrets/recipes_fishing.htm">turned 
              into eggs</a> and scales for a quest, etc.).</p>
            <p>What do you need in order to fish? A fishing pole, some bait, some 
              open inventory spots in order to transport your booty to the nearest 
              shopkeeper, and a stream/river/lake or ocean to fish in. The pole 
              will cost you over 2 gold, and it can/will break on you at some 
              point, so be prepared for the need to replace it. The bait will 
              cost you a few copper per bait, and you'll need at least one bait 
              per fish you hope to catch. You can also use <a href="../secrets/recipes_fishing.htm">fishing 
              lures</a> to catch fish, but while they enhance your ability to 
              catch fish, they will cost you added money.</p>
            <p>As mentioned briefly above, you can net yourself some special fish. 
              As with real life fishing, however, you have to know where to find 
              those special fish, as they each have their favorite spots to swim. 
              The <a href="../location/fishing_zone.htm">fish by zone listing</a> 
              can help you know which zones have special fish in them. Some of 
              these fish will be worth more coin than fresh fish, others will 
              be sought after by tradesfolk for various reasons.</p>
            <p>Make sure when you are trying to fish that your pole is held in 
              your primary weapon hand, that you're standing/sitting at the edge 
              of the water, and facing the water. (You can also meditate while 
              fishing, as long as you've equipped the pole in advance, and are 
              sitting on the shoreline.) Then just cast your line and wait for 
              the fish to bite. Cast. Wait. Cast. Wait. Eventually, you should 
              catch... something. Yep, that's right. There's more than just fish 
              available in the water. You can sometimes find fish scales and other 
              oddities snagged on your hook. Don't throw them away, as you can 
              sell them to any (NPC) merchant to add to your slowly growing profits. 
              (The most common nonfish items you will catch are tattered sandals, 
              rusty daggers, and fish scales.) As you continue to fish, your fishing 
              skill should improve... to a point. The fishing skill is level 
              capped (level times 5 plus 5), so there's only so far it will 
              improve,  especially if you're low level.</p>
            <p>When I had a couple hours of fishing under my belt, and about 20 
              ranks in fishing, I made a profit of over 6 gold in half an hour. 
              It's still a very slow way to make money, but it's relaxing and if 
              you're truly a broke newbie, it's a great way to earn some money. 
              When you're a spellcaster just learning how to meditate, it can 
              be relaxing and profitable to plant yourself next to a safe body 
              of water, spellcast your mana down to 0, and fish while meditating.</p>
            <p>When you're done fishing for the day, stow that fishing pole and 
              some bait (or some extra coins) in the bank. You never know when 
              you're going to end up with your corpse on one continent, and yourself 
              on another continent with no gear, and no way to get to your corpse 
              without food and money. Being able to run to the bank and fish your 
              way into food and coins can make all the difference in the world. 
              (On more developed servers, fishing for your food gives you something 
              to do while you're waiting for your res, tp back to your corpse, 
              etc.) </p>
            <p>Just DO remember to stow that fishing pole and re-equip your weapon 
              before you go wandering. As I can attest, from personal experience, 
              trying to attack a monster with a fishing pole does little... other 
              than cause folks to laugh at you. I know of no monster yet that 
              has been clubbed to death with a fishing pole...</p>
