<span class="headers">Shar Vahl Berserker Armor (Savageclaw)</span>
<p>
<p><i>This is the only youngling armor quest originating in Shar Vahl and is only useful for berserkers. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, VAH/BER only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one.</i></p>
