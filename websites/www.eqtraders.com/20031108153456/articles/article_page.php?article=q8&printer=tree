<p>
<p><i>This is one of several quests for youngling armor originating in Rivervale.
All pieces made from this quest are HFL/ROG only and are lore (other than
bracers) and no drop. All combines are no fail. Armor has a blue-green chain
graphic. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials
often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Megosh Thistlethorn'</p>
<p>Megosh Thistlethorn says 'Greetings Placibo! I am Megosh Thistlethorn first
Ranger of the Storm Reapers of Rivervale. I journeyed many years ago to the
Surefall Glade far to the west of our lovely shire. It was there I trained with
the human and half-elven rangers that like the Storm Reapers are faithful
disciples of Karana. I have returned now to Rivervale to teach our interested
young people the ways of a ranger of the Storm Lord, so that we may defend our
shire and the wilds of Norrath from the [evil forces] that would see it
destroyed. '</p>
<p>You say, 'what evil forces'</p>
<p>Megosh Thistlethorn says 'Currently the Death Fist Clan of Orcs, a race of
bloodthirsty humanoids concerned only with expanding their territory and
slaughtering all who stand in their path, threatens our homeland. The Orcs have
long had a minor presence in the Misty Thicket but lately they have been
amassing in greater numbers. The Death Fist has been chopping down our trees and quarrying rock from the nearby mountains. We know only that they have been
shipping the materials to the commonlands and stockpiling it for what purpose we do not know. As rangers of the Storm Reapers it is our duty to [stop the
desecration] of the thicket. '</p>
<p>You say, 'i will stop the desecration of the thicket'</p>
<p>Megosh Thistlethorn says 'First you must outfit yourself for battle with the
Death Fists. Seek Bipdo Hargin here in Rivervale and give him this letter. He
will instruct you further on getting yourself outfitted for the tasks ahead.
Once you have been outfitted in a suit of Thorn Mail Armor return to me and I
will instruct you for your [next task]. '</p>
<p>You say, 'what is my next task'</p>
<p>Megosh Thistlethorn says 'If you feel you are ready to face the Orcs of Clan
Death Fist then journey to the Misty Thicket beyond the protection of the Wall
of Cetelt. Hunt the Orcs that are cutting down the trees of the thicket and
bring me two of the Orc Lumberjack Axes and two of the Orc Lumberjack Machetes.
'</p>
<p>Providing the above items to Megosh results in a Storm Reaper Thorn Machete,
1HS, dam 4, delay 27, STR 1, DEX 1, MAGIC, wt 8.5, lore, no drop weapon.</p>
