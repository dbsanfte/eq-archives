<span class="headers">Neriak Necromancer (Unholy Silk) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of many new race- and class-specific armor quests. The resultant armor is for dark elven necromancers only, is no drop, and all pieces other than the bracer is lore. The tailoring combines are no fail, and the robe graphic is a plain black robe. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one.</i>
</p>
<p>
This quest starts at the top of the necromancer guild, with Talorial D'Estalian (-1272, -1228)
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Talorial D`Estalian'
</p>
<p>
Talorial D`Estalian says 'On what grounds do you think you are welcome to address me like that vermin? I am afraid you will have to prove yourself to me before I can treat you with any respect. Do you feel that you are [worthy] to stand before me? '
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i am worthy'
</p>
<p>
Talorial D`Estalian says 'Very well then, you are lucky that I have been looking for some sort of an apprentice to help me out in gathering some hides from those nasty halflings. I did have a young one as yourself working for me before but unfortunately they didn't work out as you can see by looking at this autopsy table. I would hope that you will complete my [tasks], for your sake. '
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what tasks'
</p>
<p>
Talorial D`Estalian says 'If you are willing to [gather some items] that are needed for specific halfling hides I can offer you with the resources necessary to fashion your own armor.'

It contains magical power that is able to fashion specific components into a magical version of whatever the core material is. If you are a Necromancer you will need to gather halfling hides that have been infused with many different elements that you will collect and combine in this box. Simply tell me what pattern you [want] and I will present you with the recipe necessary for [Gloves], [Robe], [Trousers], [Sleeves], [Skullcap], [Bracers] and [slippers].

</p>
<p>
You say, 'I am ready to be tested' 
</p>
<p>
Talorial D`Estalian says 'Very well child. There is an ancient tome of Necromancy called the Writ of the Fallen. I have kept the binding of this sacred tome for a very long time however I have never searched for the pages that form the writ. If you are able to recover the 4 pages of the writ I have faith that you posses the power to bind them to this empty tome that I carry. Seek out these pages and bind them to this tome. I assure you that you will learn much from this writ shall you construct it once again. I believe the pages were in the hands of spirits that haunt the Ultricle still to this day. Good luck and excellent work.'
