 Seria Woodwind says 'Our diviner in the Keepers of the Art have discovered that a Teir`Dal agent of the Ebon Mask, the spies and assassins of the Teir`Dal has been lurking around the Faydarks and communicating intelligence to the orcs of Clan Crushbone. We believe the spy can be lured out of hiding if his primary orc contact, a crushbone centurion by the name of Relgle, is eliminated on route to their rendezvous location. Find this Centurion Relgle, slay him for his crimes against the Koada`Dal, then do the same to his Teir`Dal ally. Bring me both their heads when the deed is done.'

<p>
Seria Woodwin says' Good work. King Tearis Thex and the Royal Order of Koada Vie shall be released. Take this Dull Felwithe Defender's Sword to a forge and sharpen it with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is accomplished bring me the Sharp Felwithe Defender's Sword, a Pristine Forest Drakeling Scales, and an Arborean Amber and i will put the finishing touches on the weapon.
</p> 
<p>
You receive a Dull Felwithe Defenders Sword (Lore). Combine that in the forge with a sharpening stone (there is a skill check on this, and the sword is returned on a failure) to receive a Sharp Felwithe Defenders Sword. The sword is 8/29 STR 1, WIS 1 PAL/HIE, HEF, Hef Tunare only. Wt 5.5 lore, magic and no drop. None of the components are no drop except the heads of the DE and orc.
