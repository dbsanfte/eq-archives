<p>
I'd like to thank all of you for your patience and moral support during this mess. Unfortunately, there's still been no word on the data recovery effort. None. Nada.<p>
Once the holidays are over, we'll be working more on replacing what was lost, working in large part from the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=86">Database Update Subsmissions</a> forum.<p>
Here's a bit of upcoming tradeskill information from the EQLive site, for those that missed it:
<blockquote><i>Tired of all the clicking and dragging needed just to make a type 1 wood arrow? We know that the current tradeskill interface is cumbersome, so the UI guys have come up with some new ideas.

Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface. In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are currently available to you. This includes recipes that are at your skill level as well as some above it. Clicking on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion. Clicking the "combine" button will extract those required items from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine, placing the results on the player's cursor. The new system is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you want to try a combine that is way out of your league, which uses the old style of combination.</i></blockquote>
<p>
Of course, since it's not implemented yet, and there's been LOTS of ways that the community is interpreting the above, there's the usual collection of folks dancing for joy and/or running in circles screaming. {grins}  Personally, I'm going to wait and see how this concept turns into a reality before I pass judgement, as many things tend to change and mutate before they hit the production servers.<p>
Meanwhile, here's wishing all of you a safe and happy start to 2004!

<p>
<p>Being Christmas Eve, I wanted to post a quick note.. I wish you and your loved ones a very Merry Christmas. -- Krazick, your Scaley Database Kitty</p>
<p>Oh, and the database reloading efforts are making progress. I hope to be chipping away at the LDoN Smithing recipes soon.</p></p>

<p>
First off, I'd like to thank everyone for their kind words of support, offers of help, offers of mirroring possibilities, etc. This wonderful community truly is the reason we keep struggling along, no matter how many curve balls are thrown at us.<p>
Currently, we're running on a pre-LDoN copy of the database. The folks at Racknine are still attempting to recover the up-to-date version from a dead hard drive, and it may be a few days before we know whether we're going to be able to recover, or if we are going to have to re-gather and re-enter several months' worth of work.<p>
Until we know for sure, we're mostly in a holding pattern. We don't want to start entering data again, only to find the work is wasted because the data is recoverable. (The staff and I also need a couple days to walk around in a daze, processing the enormity of the potential loss. It's hit us pretty hard, and I'm sure I'm not the only one that wants to hide and make the bad news go away.)</p>

<p><span class="headers">November 15, 2003 - Site Mostly Up</span>
<p>
Well...  The site is mostly back up.
<br>There may continue to be a few errors here and there.  There are articles that are missing, and I am certain that there are items and recipes that are missing.  Many Articles have been reverted to an old state.
<p>
I will be talking with the staff, and Krazic most importantly about how we want to move forward with recovery.</p>
<p>
Racknine is looking into further recovery of Data from the bad drive, but it will be a while... so it may not be feasable for us to wait for them.</p>
<p>Aditionally, racknine will be supplying a free backup tool for its users to use going forward.</p>

<p><span class="headers">July 21, 2003 - Welcome to the database!</span>
<p>
If you're reading this, you're now seeing the database version of the site. (For the non-beta testers, this means that we've finally recovered from exploding computer power supplies, sorted out the issues with backing up a far-too-large dev versoin of the item database, and so on.)<p>
It's been a rough year, getting all of this ready, and we're not done with it yet. At the rate this game changes, we may never be fully done with it. It is, however, done enough for the public to come play.  I'm excited, I'm relieved, I'm very burnt out on the entire EQ tradeskill thing, and this site.<p>
To go along with the burnt out thing, here's <b>a few things to note before you post a single, solitary thing about the database:</b>
<ul><li>We'll have a database bug forum in place for true-blue bugs (incorrect trivials, incorrect recipes, etc.) within 24 hours of the database launching.  We'll set up some posting rules so it doesn't turn into total anarchy, and you'll want to read the sticky there before posting to it.</li>
<li>Don't PM me with bugs. Don't email me with bugs.  Don't post in the DenMother's Corner with bugs. See the above about the bug forum. I won't be the only person tackling bugs, and addressing something personally to me adds unneccessary grief. Drop it in the proper forum so it can be tackled as someone has time for it.</li>
<li>Not all quest recipes are in the database. It will take time, and the primary focus has been on main tradeskill recipes, not quest recipes. <b>This means do NOT submit a bug report if you find a quest recipe missing from the database!</b> If the actual quest is missing from the quests writeup, then you can submit a writeup for the quest, but it is not yet considered a "bug" if we don't have every single quest recipe in the db.</li>
<li>Not all item prices are in place. Not even close. Once the dust settles, we'll likely be looking for some help with getting that fleshed out now, but please, don't be helpful and flood the forums, or my mailbox, with offers.  When/if we want volunteers, we'll say so. Until then, you're making more work with your offers, not helping with the problem.</li>
<li>Not all mob sources are in the database. I take full blame for that. I am working on it, slowly. It's an ugly set of lists, it's a messy collection of mobs, and I'm having to triple-check a lot of stuff before adding the 13 zillionth form of cat to yet another zone, for example.</li>
<li>Hold all feature requests! Do not put them in the bug forum, do not put them in DenMother's Corner, do not PM me with them, do not submit them to us in any way until we say so!  I repeat: <b>do not give us feature requests, requests to change display formats, search formats, etc., etc. at this time.</b> When the dust has settled, and Ngreth is ready to tackle some requests, we'll set up a submission method.  We will gladly ignore any and all people who feel they must ignore this and flood us with requests.  Those of you who turn your requests into demands or orders, will find I am a very burnt out and frazzled redhead who is not amused with the folks who are "instructing" me on what I must do for my site. Please remember that we cannot please everyone, some requests simply may be either technically impossible, or too resource-intensive. We reserve the right to say no if something is beyond the scope of what we can/want to do.</li></ul>
<p>I really hate having this much negativity on the front page, but as we learned from the beta phase, even with things spelled out this much, folks will still ignore all this and post whatever the blazes they feel like, and my tolerance is very, very thin right now. This has been a year-long nightmare, and the straw that broke the camel's back, and I've totally stopped playing EQ, as the game has been turned from play into "work" for me.  No, I'm not looking for sympathy, or another several dozen emails, posts, etc. of support, I'm just telling it like it is. Those who decide to <b>demand</b> more than I can give, or who decide that the forum rules are not meant for them, will find I'm a lot less tolerant of such things now that this has turned from a "labor of love" to simply "hard labor". While I hope folks will find the new format more helpful than the old static pages, I'm no longer going to stress because I can only please 95% of a far-too-large population.
