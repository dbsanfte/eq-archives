<p>
<h4>Brief overview of tradeskill portions</h4>
<p>
Two of the Cabilis Shaman Cudgel (or skull) quests require the use of the pottery skill. Another step requires the use of alchemy.  Click the links below for details on the rest of the respective quests. (Please post to the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=23" target="_new">message boards</a> if you have additional trivial information for this quest.)
</p>
<p>
The first quest requiring pottery is the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=207" target="_new">Second Cudgel Quest</a>
</p>
<p>
A rogue shaman in Warslik Woods drops a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9576&menustr=">Jawless Skull</a>. A different rogue shaman in the Field of Bone drops a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9577&menustr=">A Mandible</a>. You combine them in <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1750&menustr=">Pottery Wheel</a> with <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6211&menustr=">Mendglow Clay</a> (without water) to produce a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9578&menustr=">Skull With Ii</a>.  The trivial for this combine is unknown.
</p>
<p>
The other quest to require pottery is the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=217" target="_new">Fifth Cudgel Quest</a>.
</p>
<p>
The froglok ton warriors in Swamp of No Hope randomly drop one of three pieces of the totem.  The unique, lore pieces are: <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9580&menustr=">Piece Of Totem</a> (top), <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9579&menustr=">Piece Of Totem</a> (middle), and <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9581&menustr=">Piece Of Totem</a> (bottom).  Combining the three in <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1750&menustr=">Pottery Wheel</a> with foraged <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6211&menustr=">Mendglow Clay</a> (which is NOT no drop) and without water will produce a <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9582&menustr=">Ton Warrior Totem</a>. This is NOT the Ton Warrior Totem needed for the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=420" target="_new">Illusion:Iksar quest </a>. If Identify is cast upon this item, it reports "Lore Information: Key of Dai.|-." The rest of the fifth quest has you find the Dai Canopic Jar and the two keys to open it as one of its steps. This mended Ton Warrior Totem is one of the two keys.  The trivial for this combine is 0&lt;x&lt;=122.  
</p>
<p>
The quest that involves alchemy is the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1249" target="_new">Sixth Cudgel Quest</a>.
</p>
<p>
For this quest you need to acquire six different dropped or foraged items.  You combine three together to make one item, and the other three to make another.  Then you combine those two items to make the Potion of Xinth, which is then given to an npc to proceed with the quest.  The items and recipes are as follows:
</p>
<p>
Combine <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9583&menustr=">Pouch Of Dust</a> off sarnak partisans in Frontier Mountains with <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6082&menustr=">Gorge Moss</a> foraged in Beholder's Maze and <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=6230&menustr=">Sponge Mushroom</a> foraged in the Mines of Nurga.  This makes <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9587&menustr=">Opal Slush</a>.  The trivial for this combine is unknown.
</p>
<p>
Combine <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9584&menustr=">Firiona Drixie Dust</a> off of drixies in Firiona with <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9585&menustr=">Stoneleer Emerald Plume</a> off of stoneleer cockatrices in Overthere and <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9586&menustr=">A Chant Rock</a> off of goblin rockchanters in the Mines of Nurga.  There are three varieties of chant rock, so be sure to get the tan one and not the blue or green.  This makes <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9588&menustr=">Dristilate</a>.  The trivial for this combine is unknown.
</p>
<p>
Then combine the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9587&menustr=">Opal Slush</a> with the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9588&menustr=">Dristilate</a> to make <a href="http://eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9589&menustr=">A Potion Of Swirling Liquid</a>.  The trivial for this combine is unknown.  You've now finished the tradeskill portions of the cudgel quest!
