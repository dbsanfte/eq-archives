            <h3> #7: Runed Coldain Prayer Shawl </h3>
            <p> Take a deep breath. One more shawl...four more trade skills...yikes! 
              That's right, now you'll need to get brewing, fletching, jewelcraft, 
              and pottery all at least over 150. Here again, remember that just 
              because an item is trivial does not mean you can't fail. I just 
              failed at one of the pottery steps here and my pottery skill is 
              188. Based on the difficulty in acquiring some of these ingredients, 
              it is probably well worth the time to get your skills plenty high...but 
              you still have a decent chance of success if your skill is not yet 
              to where the item is trivial. Good luck, young sprout.

              is nearly impossible for even the most skilled of Coldain craftsmen. 
              You should be exceedingly proud. Many have attempted this feat and 
              nearly all have lacked the skill, faith, patience and persistence

            <h4> <a name="inst">Detailed Instructions</a><br>
            </h4>
            <p> <i> <a name="skill">Skill Info</a> </i> 
            <p> <b> Brewing: </b> Ahhh, near and dear to my heart, my very first 
              trade skill! Brewing is quite simple. There are no portable containers, 
              you must use the brew barrels located in or around pubs in cities. 
              You get the ingredients for your recipe, put the required amount 
              of each into the brew barrel, and combine. Some recipes require 
              foraged items, but it is possible to go all the way through brewing 
              strictly on store bought ingredients. Just check your <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_brewing.htm">Recipes 
              and Trivials</a> and <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/brewing.htm">Supply 
              Locations</a> and have at it. 
            <p> Note that there are a few varieties of liquids that can be brewed. 
              The originals are the alcoholic brews. These must be placed in an 
              open main inventory slot and right clicked to drink. These are intoxicating 
              and will affect your stats, your speech, and your vision. Drinking 
              them will build your alcohol intolerance, which moderates their 
              effects. Then there are the non-alcoholic drinks. Some of these 
              will be automatically imbibed and fill your need for drink just 
              like water or milk do, while others cannot be drunk at all and are 
              instead used in tailoring or quests. There are also some brewing 
              recipes for tempers, which are used by some races to make their 
              racial armor. Those cannot be drunk either, which is a good thing 
              if you look at the ingredients that go into them. Ick. Because the 
              temper ingredients are much harder to obtain than most of the regular 
              brews, don't worry about them for the sake of raising your skill 
              for the shawls. Focus on the other drinks with ingredients that 
              are easy to get. 
            <p> <b> Fletching: </b> Fletching is one of the easiest skills to 
              raise because it's relatively cheap and you can go from 0 to over 
              200 in front of a single vendor. There are two purposes to fletching: 
              making bows and making arrows. Bows are much more difficult and 
              expensive and totally unnecessary to skill for the shawl, so don't 
              worry about them. Look at the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/fletching.htm">Fletching 
              Supplies</a> page for a vendor that has "arrowheads (3), shafts 
              (4), fletch (3), vane (3), groove nock (3)" and a fletching kit. 
              Be careful, as many vendors have all of the components but no kit. 
              For which recipes to use, many recommend <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/%7Eewj/fletchguide/index.htm#The%20Cheapest%20Way%20To%20Fletch">Aoenla's 
              Cheapest Way to Fletch</a>. However, it seems to me that there are 
              cheaper recipes that could be used to bridge some of the levels 
              of skill, so if you want to check for yourself, see her <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/%7Eewj/fletchguide/index.htm#The%20Arrow%20Table">Arrow 
              Table</a> and look over the trivials for yourself. You might want 
              to consult a vendor for basic pricing information for each ingredient 
              for yourself. Basically, there are four parts to an arrow: point, 
              fletch, shaft, and nock. Don't be confused by vanes, they are just 
              another kind of fletch. You just put one of each of the four ingredients 
              into your kit and combine them, to make a batch of arrows. Each 
              of the four components come in varying qualities. The higher quality 
              (and therefore more expensive) the components, the better the arrow 
              will be. The progression of trivials is messier than in some skills 
              because there are so many variables, so just watch your charts. 
            <p> <b> Jewelcraft: </b> Yes, the much maligned jewelcraft. It's more 
              expensive than many skills, but not as bad as some might claim. 
              I went from 0 to 185 in about 2kpp. Everything you need for shawl 
              skill can be found on merchants in many cities, although most ingredients 
              are also drops. Only the most valuable gems are drops only. There 
              are two basic "kinds" of jewelry merchants and they are usually 
              found right next to each other in the jewelry shop or casters guild 
              of a city. See the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/jewelry.htm">Jewelcraft 
              Supplies</a> page for specifics. Typically one vendor has 18 gems, 
              starting with malachite, the cheapest and easiest, and running up 
              through rubies. These are the ones you will want to focus on while 
              practicing. All of these also drop from various mobs throughout 
              Norrath. The other standard vendor has the very important Jeweler's 
              Kit and the four old world metals: silver, electrum, gold, and platinum. 
              I believe one or more of these metals are also extremely rare drops 
              off of the muddites in Beholder. In a few levels of hunting there 
              I got one electrum bar once. But it is definitely not an adequate 
              way to acquire your metal for our purposes here. The jewelry merchant 
              in Thurgadin is the only source of velium bars for jewelcraft, but 
              you won't have to go anywhere near that stuff for the shawl quest. 
            <p> To actually make jewelry, all you do is put one bar of your chosen 
              metal and one of your chosen gems in the Jeweler's Kit and combine 
              them. In order to make jewelry with stats, you must first have an 
              enchanter magically enchant the metal via their line of spells for 
              that purpose. Jewelry that is made with plain metal that has not 
              been enchanted has absolutely no stats and is only worth anything 
              to a vendor, who will usually pay just a smidgen less than the ingredients. 
              Unenchanted metal is just as good, however, if you are just practicing 
              to increase your skill and intend to sell your successes back. 
            <p> The jewelry kit has four slots but you will never have more than 
              two ingredients, at least not for existing recipes. Items get progressively 
              harder by the metal you are working with. Within the recipes for 
              a metal, they also get progressively harder by the gem. Silver is 
              the easiest metal, then electrum, gold, platinum, and velium, in 
              that order. Gems increase in difficulty according to the price of 
              the gem. So, the cheapest gem (malachite) plus the cheapest metal 
              (silver) is the easiest thing you can make. The most expensive gem 
              (blue diamond, not sold on vendors) plus the cheapest metal (silver) 
              is only slightly easier than the cheapest gem (malachite) plus the 
              next metal (electrum). If I've confused you, see the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/jewelry/The_Art_of_Jewelcraft.htm#TrivialChart">Jewelcraft 
              Trivial Chart</a> for a more obvious visual display. You will probably 
              also want to print this chart to refer to while working, as it is 
              one of the best available for printing purposes. 
            <p> Just in case you're wondering, <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">Imbued 
              Jewelry</a> works along the same principles as regular jewelry except 
              that only certain gems can be used. Each Norrathian diety has a 
              specific gem which can be imbued by one of their followers of the 
              right class, and which then gives unique stats. As it is more complicated 
              than regular jewelcraft and does not fill any particular gap in 
              trivials, however, you won't need to deal with it for the purposes 
              of the shawl.

              I'll add more as I get it, hopefully soon. Any information is welcome!
