<span class="headers">General Tradeskills FAQ</span>
<p>
<p><b>This is both a general and specific FAQ for all Tradeskills.</b></p>

<p><b>General Questions: </b></p>

<p><b>Q: How do I make (whatever)? </b></p>
<p>A: Go to <a href="http://eqtraders.com/"> www.eqtraders.com </a> and look it up under the recipes section. If it's not there, and it's not on the message board (Check back a couple pages to be sure), NOBODY KNOWS! Most likely it isn't implemented yet, and may never be implemented. At the very least, nobody has discovered the recipe. Feel free to post attempts and DNC messages, but please check to be sure you're not repeating somebody.</p>

<p><b>Q: Where can I find (whatever ingredients)? </b></p>
<p>A: Again, go to <a href="http://eqtraders.com/">www.eqtraders.com</a> and check under trade supplies for store-bought items. The site also contains lists of zone-specific forages and fish, as well as pelt/silk drop info. Other specific items are listed in this FAQ or in one of the other message board.</p>

<p><b>Q: How many tradeskills can I have above 200? </b></p>
<p>A: One ... sorta. Of the 7 main tradeskills (baking, brewing, fletching, jewelcraft, pottery, smithing, tailoring) you may ONLY have one over 200 (up to 250), while the rest are capped at 200.</p>

<p>Update: There is a new Alternate Advancement ability called New Tanaan Tradeskill Mastery. This allows you for a purchase of 3 AA points, at class level 51 or greater, to gain the ability to raise another of the 7 basic tradeskills above 200. The ability can be purchased multiple times (6 times total) to get the ability to do another tradeskill above 200. The cost is 3AA points each time (the price does not increase)</p>

<p><b>Q: What about the tradeskills not listed above? </b></p>
<p>A: Regardless of whether another skill is above 200 or not, other specialized tradeskills are capped as follows: Alchemy 130 before level 51/180 at 51+; Poison Making 200 pre-51/250 post-51; Tinkering 250, fishing 200</p>

<p><b>Q: But I'm already over 200 in one of the seven main skills listed above. How do I reset it to 200 so I can GM in something else? </b></p>
<p>A: You can't. Once you go over 200 skill in one of the 7 main tradeskills, that character is "stuck" with it.</p>
<p>Update: There is a new Alternate Advancement ability called New Tanaan Tradeskill Mastery. This allows you for a purchase of 3 AA points, at class level 51 or greater, to gain the ability to raise another of the 7 basic tradeskills above 200. The ability can be purchased multiple times (6 times total) to get the ability to do another tradeskill above 200. The cost is 3AA points each time (the price does not increase) There is no other way to do this. You cannot "go back"</p>


<p><b>Q: What stats are used in what skills?</b></p>
<p>A: For ALL tradeskills, the greater of your Wisdom or Intelligence will determine your skill-up rate. In Smithing, Strength also affects this rate, while Dexterity affects Fletching. NO stat changes your rate of success, as far as we can tell. (See the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&threadid=19">Stats and Tradeskills FAQ</a> for further details.)</p> 

<p><b>Q: What other skills should I work on for my favorite skill?</b></p>
<p>A: Here are a few suggestions:</p>

<p><b>Baking:</b>  Pottery up to 90 and smithing to 35 (for pottery utensils using metal bits) or smithing to 130 and pottery to 35 (for smithed utensils using ceramic linings.)</p>

<p><b>Fletching:</b>  Smithing up to various levels, for cheaper arrow heads. (Not necessary, but possible)</p>

<p><b>Pottery:</b>  Smithing up to about 40 (pottery utensils require metal bits.)</p>

<p><b>Smithing:</b>  Pottery up to about 40 (smithed utensils require ceramic linings.) Tailoring to 40 or so for leather paddings. Brewing up to 142+ for tempers if you want to do cultural smithing.</p>

<p><b>Tailoring: </b>Brewing to 100 (heady kiolas) or 140 if you are doing cultural tailoring (tannins). Smithing to 60 (for studs/boning), 100 if you are doing wood elf cultural tailoring, or 135 or higher for Velious tailoring, so that Velium bonings and Studs are well beyond trivial. Both brewing and smithing should be higher by the time you start Velious items. Pottery to 135 (you are more likely to get an enchanter's help with thickened mana if you can supply the vials.)</p>

<p><b>Q: How good can I get at a tradeskill? </b></p>
<p>A: Of the 7 main tradeskills (baking, brewing, fletching, jeweling, pottery, smithing, tailoring) you may only have one up to 250, while the rest are capped at 200. Regardless of whether another skill is above 200 or not, other specialized tradeskills are as follows: Alchemy 130 before level 51/180 at 51+; Poison Making 200 pre51/250 post51; Tinkering 250, fishing 200.</p>

<p><b>Q: I just bought this recipe book because I heard it will help my skill. Is this true? </b></p>
<p>A: No. Having a recipe book, whether it is open or not, makes NO difference in your tradeskill attempts.</p>

<p><b>Baking: </b></p>

<p><b>Q: I just got to 135 on fish rolls, now what? </b></p>
<p>A: There are a wide variety of pies and other goods to get you to 142, but from 142-162 you're making cakes and other chocolate things, which require a number of brownie parts, which drop off brownies including the LFay brownie camp, Brownie Scouts in GFay, and Nillipus in the Halfling city. Above 162 you make Dragon Steaks, which use dragon meat, which in turn drops off named Dragons, all of which are 50+ level. Good Luck!</p>

<p><b>Q: Where can I buy skewers, pot, smoker, pie tin, bread tin, cake round, muffin tin, etc? </b></p>
<p>A: These are made by players with either the smithing skill or the pottery skill. Check in the appropriate recipe section of EQTraders and either learn the skill or find someone who has, so they can make your implements.</p>

<p><b>Q: What is a spit/what is a mixing bowl? </b></p>
<p>A: A spit is a portable oven, and works exactly like a town oven, except of course you can take it with you. It can be bought at a few different vendors. A mixing bowl is a container used in making clumps of dough and winter/white chocolate, as well as a few quest foods. It can be bought, or made by pottery.</p>

<p><b>Q: I just pounded down a stack of (Stat food name), but none of my stats went up. What went wrong? </b></p>
<p>A: Nothing went wrong. Force-feeding a stat food does NOT give you the benefits of the food. To use stat foods, simply place them in the first food slot in your inventory (any slot before the first slot you have food in). You can *prevent* yourself from using these foods by force-feeding yourself something without stats.</p>

<p><b>Q: Why should I bake? </b></p>
<p>A: Stat foods, lighter food, and a number of quests make Baking a good skill to learn. Plus, with Fish Fillets and Fish Rolls, it's easy and rather cheap.</p>

<p><b>Brewing: </b></p>

<p><b>Q: How do I skill up after 135? </b></p>
<p>A: 2xBrewed 2xStout Dwarven Ale will get you to 142. Above that all recipes to 162 take Foraged Vegetables, Ground Spawns, or Amadillo/Skunk parts. Or you can skip straight to Faydwer Shakers (188) and Minotaur Hero's Brew (248)</p>

<p><b>Q: What's with the Keg of Vox Tail Ale? </b></p>
<p>A: It's for the Warrior Epic Quest. You can buy it and get 10 drinks out of it, but it's very expensive. It's found on a number of vendors. It is not brewed, nor is it used in brewing.</p>

<p><b>Q: What's this Blackburrow Cask? Can I brew in it? </b></p>
<p>A: The Blackburrow Cask is used in a Rogue Quest. It is NOT a portable brew barrel, nor is it used for regular brewing.</p>

<p><b>Q: Why should I Brew? </b></p>
<p>A: Heady Kiola for Tailors, Tempers, oils, and tannins for cultural/Velious smithing/tailoring, a handful of quests, many, if not all, of the alcoholic beverages you could want, and the fun of handing somebody a Bleeding Brain and daring them to drink it.  </b></p>

<p><b>Fletching: </b></p>

<p><b>Q: What's the best bow I can make? </b></p>
<p>A: Define best bow? The answer will vary based on your level, race and class, as well as the intended use for the bow (pulling tool vs. main weapon). Wood elves can make some very nice cultural bows, and the new bows from the Planes of Power are quite impressive. If neither of those is an option for you, then the "best bow" you can make will depend on whether you're going for higher damage, or higher range or damage/speed ratio.</p>

<p><b>Q: How do I skill up? </b></p>
<p>A: Make arrows until a part trivials. Triviality depends on the most complex part, so if you're not concerned about making the best arrows in skilling up, buy the one part you're practicing on and go cheap on the rest. Arrows will take you to 202, so if you don't want to GM, be careful. Compound Darkwood bows will go to 235. From there it's on to Shadewood bows and/or Condensed Element arrows. We're still working on nailing down the trivials for the specific Shadewood bow and Condensed Element arrow combinations, but we do know that a combination of the bows and arrows will take you all the way to 250.</p>

<p><b>Q: Can players make Velium Bows? </b></p>
<p>A: Not at this time. All Velium Bows in game are Monster Dropped, or the result of quests.</p>

<p><b>Q: Why should I Fletch? </b></p>
<p>A: If you want high-quality bows and arrows, fletching is for you. Also there are a few quests that use fletching. A storied and complex art it may be, but the reasons are fairly simple.</p>

<p><b>Jewelcraft: </b></p>

<p><b>Q: Why doesn't my jewelry have any stats? </b></p>
<p>A: You need to enchant the metal before using it to have enchanted jewelry. The enchant silver, gold, etc. spells are for Enchanters only, so you need to be an enchanter or have access to one to make stat jewelry.</p>

<p><b>Q: What can I do with a gemcutter? </b></p>
<p>A: Take one gemcutter and one uncut hyacinth and put into a jewelry bag. Have a high-level jeweler combine these items and you receive the faceted Hyacinth. (Needed for a quest) Other than that, it is used in a tinkering recipe for the greasy diamond of innovation. The Gemcutter itself is made by tinkering, a gnome-only skill.</p>

<p><b>Q: What about Imbued stuff? </b></p>
<p>A: You'll need an imbued gem, made by a spell that takes a regular gem, and the enchanted metal (must be enchanted or DNC). Enchanted Velium results in DNC. Use of imbued gems restricts wearing to followers of that deity, though they can be made by jewelers of any deity, including agnostic. Stats for Imbued, as well as non-imbued, items can be found at <a href="http://eqtraders.com/"> www.eqtraders.com </a> as usual.</p>

<p><b>Q: Does enchanting metal increase skill faster? </b></p>
<p>A: No, but it does make the pieces sell for more. If you have the time to enchant the metal, go ahead, but if you have to pay for the service, don't bother, since early on you'll fail too often for it to matter.</p> 

<p><b>Q: Where can I buy the Enchant Metal spells?</b></p>
<p>A: Neriak Third Gate in the Library, and Felwithe in the Enchanter's Guild. The Enchant Velium Spell can be found in Thurgadin, in the Rogue's Guild.</p>

<p><b>Q: Why should I do Jewelcraft? </b></p>
<p>A: You can make powerful stat-enhancing jewelry, plus do a few quests. However, unless you have the services of an enchanter (yourself or a friend) it'll be uphill work all the way.</p>

<p><b>Pottery: </b></p>

<p><b>Q: Why shouldn't I fire the early stuff I make for skill? </b></p>
<p>A: Time. If you follow the <a href="http://eqtraders.com//articles/article_page.php?article=g12&menustr=040000000000">Learn a Tradeskill</a> guide, you make jars and bowls, which are containers and thus take up a lot of space. Also, it requires buying firing sheets, going to the kiln, and not making back all that much. Plus, the trivial for firing anything is very low, something like 15 or so, and new potters get the idea their recipe is trivial before it is. That being said, there's nothing stopping you from firing your bowls and jars and trying to break even.</p>

<p><b>Q: How do I skill up after 128? </b></p>
<p>A: There are 2 choices to 148, the more popular being poison vials, since even the unfired vials stack and firing them can be a good idea. After that is lined vials (168) , Sealed vials (188) and Idols (>200). That's it.</p>

<p><b>Q: Where do I get Sands of Ro for the wisdom deities? </b></p>
<p>A: Sands of Ro is a drop only item from the Sand Giants in the Desert of Ro. Hunt yourself, buy it from players or search the shops in that area.</p> 

<p><b>Q: Who do I get imbued gems to make Idols? </b></p>
<p>A: The gems must be imbued by a cleric/druid/shaman/wizard of that diety using the level 29 spell Imbue gem name </p>

<p><b>Q: Do I have to worship [insert diety name here] to make their Idol?</b></p>
<p>A: No. Only the person who imbues the gem and the user of the finished Idol need to follow that god. The potter can be any religion.</p>

<p><b>Q: What types of skins can I use to make vials? </b></p>
<p>A: In the process of making Poison vials, Lined poison vials or Sealed poison vials the potter needs one piece of skin per vial. This skin must not be ruined. A lot Old World pelts and skins can be used for this process like bear, cat and wolf pelts (look at www.eqtraders.com Tailoring section for a master list of all pelts with the info if they can be used for pottery). If you want to be nice to other tradeskill users, you may prefer the following pelts: White/Black/Silver wolf skins and Puma skins. Those have no other use anyway and you can buy them in stacks from vendors in lowbie zones. Zombie skins can also be used for the vials and have been the "standard" skin for potters some time ago when all other skins have not been stackable.</p>

<p><b>Q: Why should I do Pottery? </b></p>
<p>A: You can make baking implements (Which no vendor regularly sells), Poison vials (possibly for less than the vendors sell them for), and the deities and Idols that pump stats. Plus, you can call for a Pizza, start potting, and be a master before the doorbell rings for not a lot of plat.</p>

<p><b>Smithing: </b></p>

<p><b>Q: How do I skill up from 135-175? </b></p>
<p>A: Answer out-of-date after the recent smithing trivial changes. We'll get back to you on this one.</p>

<p><b>Q: How about after 175? </b></p>
<p>A: Answer out-of-date after the recent smithing trivial changes. We'll get back to you on this one.</p>

<p><b>Q: What are those scalers used for? </b></p>
<p>A: We STILL have no idea. Theories we have plenty of, but nothing yet. Even scaling fish is done with a Skinning knife. </p>

<p><b>Q: Why should I Smith? </b></p>
<p>A: To make cool armor, a number of useful objects, maybe some weapons, and a few quests. It's expensive, but if you work hard you can be famous for being the first to make your race's cultural armor on your server, assuming your race has cultural smithing.</p>

<p><b>Tailoring: </b></p>

<p><b>Q: I've gotten to 158 with Wu's Armor, now what? </b></p>
<p>A: It used to be 115 with quivers, then 131 with Crystilline silk, now 158 with Wu's armor. From here you either do cultural tailoring if you can, or start on acrylia studded and acrylia reinforced armor. (If you do not have the Luclin expansion, this will require hiring folks to farm pelts and ore, however.) You can also work on Fleeting Quivers, though they are also hard to find and expensive to make. Due to the expense and difficulty (never trivial) of the Velious leathers and Fine Furs, it is not recommended that you use them for skill increases. BTW, while tailors are generally kind-hearted folk, they're getting close to violence the next time somebody asks this, especially wanting to go from 0-250 in one night.</p>

<p><b>Q: Where do I buy a Skinning Knife? </b></p>
<p>A: Smiths make them, the recipe is at <a href="http://eqtraders.com/"> www.eqtraders.com </a>.</p> 

<p><b>Q: Where do I buy a Deluxe (10-slot) Tailoring Kit? </b></p>
<p>A: Long answer on this one. At one time, there were only small (2-slot) and large (8-slot) sewing kits. One patch, all large sewing kits became 10-slot. Eventually the recipies for Wu's armor were found which needed the extra space to make the bigger items. However, this ruined the Tailored Backpack market, since they had very low weight and could hold large items. First the weight was upped, and then finally the kits were re-named Deluxe Sewing Kits, and the vendors once again sold 8-slot large sewing kits. Since the 10-slot kits couldn't be bought anymore, Verant put up 10-slot looms in a number of cities, which anyone can use. So, you can only buy the 10-slot Tailoring kits off players who had them during that crucial period (maybe a month long). </p>

<p><b>Q: I have looted a Supurb XXXX Pelt. What is it for? </b></p>
<p>A: With the addition of Luclin, Superb Rockhopper pelts were added, and the recipe for studded acrylia armor is on <a href="http://eqtraders.com/"> www.eqtraders.com </a>. There are no other known recipes for any of the superb pelts that are in the game.</p> 

<p><b>Q: Why should I do Tailoring? </b></p>
<p>A: Because you want to make good monk armor, or lightweight armor for those who can wear leather, or you have the money to try out Velious Armors, or you want cultural tailored armor, or you want to save money on tailored backpacks. Just be ready for frustration and have access to vials of mana for the Wu's armor.</p>

<p><b>Q: I just made a Rallic Pack and/or a handmade backpack and it's now no drop! What's going on with that? </b></p>
<p>A: The moment that you place a no drop item in a container, the container's tag is changed to list NO DROP. This is to remind you that there are items in it that need to be removed before you can trade the pack.</p></p><p>
