<B>I need your help!</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You'll find several areas 
  of this site that have large gaps in the information. &nbsp;I can't do/learn 
  everything at once, so I'm asking for help. The more folks who help, the more 
  useful this site is for everyone. &nbsp;Additionally, if I get enough active 
  participation in this site, I'll be more likely to make available to the serious 
  tradesperson some of the more closely-held information such as exact recipes, 
  gem/metal combinations, etc. </font>

      trade skill information: </B>Articles on&nbsp;any trade skill are welcome, 
      but&nbsp;I'm especially looking for articles on alchemy and tinkering at 
      the moment.. &nbsp;Please <A HREF="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">send email</A> 
      that contains the submission, as well as your character name and server, 
      and email address. &nbsp;(Please let me know if you'd rather I didn't link 
      in your email address-- I'll be happy to oblige). Additionally, please send 
      me any corrections/additions you may have to posted information on the other 
      trade skills </font>

      for trade materials in each city and zone:</B>. If your favorite zone is 
      missing items in my listings, and you'd be willing to explore/document for 
      me, please <A HREF="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">send email.</A> &nbsp;I'd like 
      to have up-to-date lists for all zones that have merchants, and this has 
      already been a huge undertaking. &nbsp;Even if you can only list information 
      for a couple shops, every little bit helps! Where possible, include NPC 
      merchant name, building name, and /loc, as well as what trade items are 
      available.</font>

      wanted! </B>You want to make money, I want to help you hook up with players 
      who need your goods. If you've got trade items to sell, or a skill to offer 
      (i.e., wedding services, weapon sharpening, guide services) <A HREF="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">send 
      email</A> with your ad, and I'd be happy to include you in the list. Please 
      <i> <b>be sure to include all relevant information</b></i>, including server 
      name, specifically what you are offering (i.e., not just &quot;I'm a tailor&quot;, 
      but what types of tailored items you can/will make), your in-game name, 
      and a note to me as to whether you would like your email address linked 
      in.</font>
