<p>
This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.<p>
The completion of this quest will allow you to progress to smithing skill 54. It will also allow you to learn how to process aligned shimmering steel, which are used in the GoD smithing recipes.<p>
Bring Snokin Breaksteel on the Queen of Thorns some aligned steel, and he will convert it into bars of aligned steel. Hand one of those bars to Esunta to begin her quest. In return for helping her out, she'll teach you the process needed to make bars of aligned and shimmering steel, that are needed for many, many new smithing recipes.<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>You say, 'Hail, Esunta'
<p>Esunta says ''We is workin all day and night to make tings for da Wayfarers.  Can you help us wit all dis [work]?  We wants time to play wit da new ore.''
<p>You say, 'what work?'
<p>Esunta says ''We been gettin da new ore an I wants ta take it to da forge.  Near da mountains dere is ore dat shines.  It's da same aligned ore dat is found everywhere, but gots augment bits in it, and dat makes it shine.  I wants time ta work wit it.  Dere is too much work to do here, an you look like you can do some of it.  If you can do dese [tasks] for me, den I can work wit da [Shimmering Ore].''
<p>You say, 'what shimmering ore?'
<p>Esunta says ''Da ore is pretty.  Da bits of da augmentation stuff makes da stuff more magical.  It only found in the mountains.  Dey say dat's because some magic ting happen up dere long time ago.  Dem magic types will do stuff wit da ore, for sure.  I figured out how to smelt it, wit help from Snokin.  If you bring da shimmering ore ta me, I will give you da shimmering steel.''
<p>You say, 'what tasks?'
<p>Esunta says ''Lot a work ta do here.  You help us out, work hard like real ogre, an I show you da secret of making steel from da ore.  I needs to make stuff out of da aligned steel, so you needs to bring me some.  Find da aligned ore an have Snokin make da steel, den bring to me an I will give you work.  I reward you sooner dan Snokin if you help me.  Jus bring da aligned steel to me when you ready to work.''</blockquote>
Ignore her mention of shimmering steel for now, and hand her one of the bars of aligned steel that you had Snokin convert for you.<p>
STEP ONE<P>
<blockquote>Esunta says ''Good, you is ready to work.  We need skewers.  Da more we make, da more we gets to eat!  Da new steel makes skewers that last long time an don't make food taste bad.  So you take dis stuff and forge skewers.  Bring dem to me when you done.''</blockquote>
She will give you enough supplies for 10 combines of the wayfarer skewers. Hand her the completed skewers, hand her another bar of aligned steel, and continue to loop until you have handed her 30 wayfarer skewers. The next time that you hand her a bar of aligned steel after this, she will proceed to step two.<p>
STEP TWO<p>
<blockquote>Esunta says ''Dere is much work for you.  We use steel spikes for lots of tings here, an dey asks me to make some wit da new steel.  It easy job, so maybe you do it.  Just take da metal an da mold to da forge an make da spikes.  Bring dem to me when you is done.''</blockquote>
She will give you enough supplies for 10 combines of aligned steel spikes. Hand her the completed spikes, hand her another bar of aligned steel, and continue to loop until you have handed her 30 spikes.  The next time that you hand her a bar of aligned steel after this, she will proceed to step three.<p>
STEPS THREE AND FOUR<p>
Additional NPC text is not available at this time, but basically repeat what you did in step two with the new materials for steps three and four. At the end of step four, when you hand her a bar of aligned steel, she will hand it back to you and send you back over to Snokin for instruction in how to refine the shimmering and aligned steel for yourself.
