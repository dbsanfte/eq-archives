Humans have it ... interesting ... in the cultural tradeskill field. They have two unique starting cities, each with a unique set of cultural smithing recipes that can be combined only in the forge for that specific city. Fortunately, you don't have to remember which city your character started in, as any human can smith recipes from either city, as long as they use the forge appropriate for each specific recipe. Humans who are less hotheaded, and want a quieter cultural past-time will find that they can tailor 6 unique robes as well.
</p>
<p>
As I'll repeat over and over in the cultural recipes section of the site, the recipes contained in the human cultural recipes listings are to be performed only by real humans. Illusions will not work to "fool" any cultural tradeskill container or cultural pattern provider.
