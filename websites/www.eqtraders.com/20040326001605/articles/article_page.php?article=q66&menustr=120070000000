<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Paineel. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ERU/NEC, Cazic-Thule only. They are no-fail tailoring combines. This armor has dark leather graphic. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one.</i>

<i>Shwara can be found in the Abbatoir, up the first set of steps, at 759, 837</i>

<p>
You say, 'What important research?'
</p>
<p>
Shwara Volerno says 'We Cazicites of the Abattoir are the most advanced Necromancers in all of Norrath. Our greatness is due to the diligence and studiousness we apply to our research, and our powers over fear. The foolish sorcerers in Erudin are afraid of the knowledge we possess. They fear the magic we wield and control, for their minds are too weak to harness it themselves. Despite our vast knowledge there is always more to learn that can prove to be beneficial to The Abattoir. I require your assistance in obtaining some [new information].'
<p>
You say, 'What new information?'
</p>
<p>
Shwara Volerno says 'The Abattoir has recently discovered a Kobold Spiritist that wields necromantic powers. We believe this unusual kobold resides in the Warrens of Clan Kolbok as he has been sighted entering and exiting those ruinous caverns. It is possible that this kobold has somehow acquired this necromantic knowledge from Paineel but I would not like to rule out the possibility that it is a rare form of kobold sorcery. Find this Kobold Spiritist and bring me whatever arcane parchments you discover in his possession.'
