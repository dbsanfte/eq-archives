<p>
<p>Naea Fobbins stands at 330, -175 in the Abysmal Sea, near the gnomish gardeners tending their plants on the rear, eastern deck of the ship.  She gives a quest for a nice necklace that requires foraging and a little hunting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Naea Fobbins says 'Why hello there. Just arrived? My name is Naea Fobbins. My husband and I recently joined the Wayfarers Brotherhood. When we heard that they were sailing for lands unknown we just had to go. Truth be told, I do miss home though. I had quite a lucrative business in Rivervale making [necklaces].'</p>

<p>You say 'What necklaces?'</p>

<p>Naea Fobbins says 'I made all kinds! Some were magical in nature and some just beautiful to look at. That reminds me. My husband recently brought some shells from the shores of Natimbi. They were quite wonderful and I was able to make a nice necklace from them. If you could bring me some shells from Natimbi, I can try to make you one as well. I have nothing else to do at the moment. Are you [interested]?'</p>

<p>You say 'I am interested.'</p>

<p>Naea Fobbins says 'Okay, great! I will need three Broken Shore shells, and one set of Reef Crustacean Glands to make a necklace for you. The glands are needed because they secrete a kind of sealant to protect the delicate shells. You should be able to find all the items in Natimbi. Hand them to me once you find them.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 3 <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=12794&menustr=">Broken Shore Shell</a>s<!-Broken Shore shells-> are rare forages in Natimbi.  They are No Drop.  The <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=13120&menustr=">Reef Crustacean Gland</a><!-Reef Crustacean Gland->s are, logically enough, drops off of Reef Crustaceans in Natimbi.  They are also No Drop.  Hand the four items to Neaea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Naea Fobbins says 'Oh, you have returned. And you brought all the items I asked for! As promised I will make you a necklace.' Naea begins to carefully thread the shells and adds the secretion from the gland. 'This should do nicely. Here you go! It was a pleasure making it for you. Take care!''</p>

<p>There is at least one report of this being successfully multiquested.  You just need the forager with the shells to turn them in first, and then the person who wants the necklace to turn in the gland and receive the item.</p></p><p>
