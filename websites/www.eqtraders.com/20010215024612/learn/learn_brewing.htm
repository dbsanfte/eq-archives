            <p class="headers"><b>The Benefits<a name="Benefits"></a> Brewing 
              by Aesop (Tunare Server)</b></p>
            <p>The one book on brewing is an excellent guide for learning the 
              skill to near mastery levels. Unlike most skills, this one was one 
              I didn't even bother to put <b>one</b> point into (not even to "prime" 
              the skill!). The same it true for alcohol tolerance, but it would 
              seem the this skill isn't as useful as I thought it might be for 
              a magician-- a few drinks and I've got the intelligence of an ape 
              (and a dumb one at that)! However, I recognize that there are a 
              few <b>very</b> potent elixirs one can mix for warriors (who have 
              little use for intelligence in the heat of battle!) who can benefit 
              <b>much</b> from the bonuses alcohol can give to them at high tolerance 
              levels!</p>
            <p>There is at least one recipe I know of for a brew that cannot be 
              found in any tavern in Norrath (to the best of my knowledge!), and 
              I know more will be found eventually. To date, it is not a very 
              profitable skill to have, as the common brews one begins with can 
              be had for <b>far</b> cheaper than they cost to make. This may change 
              at a future date, and perhaps the harder-to-find or otherwise unfindable 
              brews will make it a more profitable undertaking.</p>

            <p>You're going to need to locate several things, before you try brewing. 
              First, you need recipes. The book you can buy so far is the "Brewer's 
              Limericks" book. The only location found so far for this is Kaladim. 
              (There is a quest in Halas/Everfrost for more advanced brewing recipes.) 
              Then, you need a brew barrel. These can be found in pretty much 
              every town. They are that odd things that look like a barrel with 
              a hose leading from it to a white trashcan. Then you need containers 
              for the finished product. Casks, bottles and the like can usually 
              be found in inns and taverns. But wait, there's more. That's right 
              - other ingredients. Some recipes will need ingredients that you 
              can purchase at a few select shops in Norrath. Other recipes will 
              requires foraged goodies, or creature loot (rat ears, snake scales 
              and other such yummy stuff).</p>
            <p>Ok, you've located everything and are ready to try. Wade through 
              those Brewer's Limericks, try to translate them into the ingredients 
              needed, pop them into the brew barrel, and press combine. (You can 
              also take the easy way out and visit the recipes section of this 
              site for recipes if you don't want to chase books all over.) If 
              you fail, you will get back the bottle/cask, but you will lose all 
              the other ingredients. </p>
