<p>
(Note that this quest requires the Planes of Power expansion.) Find Ramos Jerwan in the Plane of Knowledge (a barbarian near a pol at loc -31.28 1431) and hail him.

<p>
"Hail Ramos Jerwan"

<p>
Good Day Traveler... perhaps you have come to help me with my studies?
</p>

<p>
"I can help you with your studies"
</p>

<p>
It's quite simple really. I'm interested in studying some aquatic specimens from around the planes....
</p>

<p>
"What hand?"
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
There are some particularly interesting chichlid swiming about in the Plane of Nightmare. I also hear the discus in the Plane of Valor are quite Plentiful. I need you to bring me two sets of bones from each for study. You do know how to extract them, yes? If not, I believe the lovely Peras Glickon may have something that can instruct you . Best of luck lad.
