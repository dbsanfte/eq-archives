            <p> Hail, Yun Trainer Kintok (located in Innothule swamp, exact loc 
              not available) </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok leans in close to whisper something in your 
                ear, 'Be on your guard, friend. You should be ever watchful in 
                these swamps. Beasts lurk in the waters and behind every rotting 
                tree stump. Perhaps you would be interested in a shield of my 
                own creation. I'll confess it has saved my life on more than one 
                occasion.' <br>
                an adult bleeder picks up the scent of fresh blood. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As him &quot;What shield?&quot;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok says 'It's quite simple and surprisingly effective. 
                Bring me some [Stretched Kobold Leather], a [Bundle of Faydark 
                Twigs], a [Bundle of Thicket Twigs], and some [Leathery Twine] 
                and I'll weave you one in a frog's blink. It is the least I can 
                do for a fellow spiritist.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Ask him &quot;What Stretched Kobold Leather?&quot;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok nods knowingly, 'With a pair of kobold hides 
                and a skinning knife, it is a relatively simple matter for one 
                to make Stretched Kobold Leather' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Place 2 Kobold Hides and a Skinning Knife in a sewing kit or loom 
              to obtain &quot;Stretched Kobold Leather&quot; (magic, weight 1.0, 
              small, none/none). This is believed to be a no-fail combine. It 
              was reported as trivial 17-19.</p>
            <p>Ask him &quot;What Leathery Twine?&quot;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok says 'For the best twine I've found that the 
                medium quality skin from a bear and a pair of spider silks does 
                the trick. You will need a skinning knife, of course.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Place two Spider Silk (unstacked), a medium quality bear pelt and 
              a Skinning Knife in a sewing kit or loom to obtain &quot;Leathery 
              Twine&quot; (magic, wt 1.0, small, none/none). This is believed 
              to be a no-fail combine. It was reported as trivial 17-19.</p>
            <p>Aks him &quot;What Bundle of Thicket Twigs?&quot; (You receive 
              the same response for &quot;What Bundle of Faydark Twigs?&quot;) 
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok gasps, 'Oh, I almost forgot! Here you are. 
                Collect four of the twigs and place them into this box to combine 
                them into a full bundle.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Make sure to have a container spot free. He hands you a &quot;Twig 
              Bender&quot; (lore, wt 3.0, 4 slots, large items, 0% weight reduction)</p>
            <p>The Twigs are ground spawn:</p>
            <p>The Misty Thicket Twigs (magic, wt 1.0, small, none/none, nonstacking) 
              spawn at -433, 397 in Misty Thicket, and appear to be about a 26-minute 
              spawn. Combine four of them in your twig bender to receive a Bundle 
              of Thicket Twigs (magic, wt 1.0, small, none/none, nonstacking). 
              The twigs may also spawn at other locations, and we hope to have 
              more details soon.</p>
            <p>The Faydark Twigs (magic, wt 1.0, small, none/none, nonstacking) 
              spawn at -145, 288 in Greater Faydark, and appear to be about a 
              26-minute spawn. Combine four of them in your twig bender to receive 
              a Bundle of Faydark Twigs (magic, wt 1.0, small, none/none, nonstacking). 
              The twigs may also spawn at other locations, and we hope to have 
              more details soon.</p>
            <p>Give the four items (stretched kobold leather, leathery twine, 
              bundle of thicket twigs, bundle of faydark twigs) to Yun Trainer 
              Kintok: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok begins working furiously with the items you 
                acquired, weaving the twine between the various twigs faster than 
                your eyes can track, 'This is an old family tradition, you know. 
                My parents showed me this skill many years ago. Ah, there we are. 
                One final tie and it is finished. A fine shield, if I may say 
                so. This should keep you protected for years to come. If you ever 
                find that it is not serving up to your standards, see me again, 
                and I shall see what I can to to improve it for you.' </p>

            <p>He will then hand you :</p>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok says 'Ahh, so you have returned to me with 
                your shield. It appears to have gotten some good use in the recent 
                months. Before I can get to work on your shield, I need a few 
                components. Would you mind [retrieving the components] for me?' 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say &quot;I will retrieve the components. &quot;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok says 'A brave young initiate, indeed. This 
                task may prove to be a bit daunting, but the items I require are 
                quite rare, and are not available in this section of the world. 
                Return to me with a [chunk of prismatic metal], a [chunk of refined 
                metal], a [shield frame mold], in addition to your Initiates shield, 
                and then I will get to work on rebuilding your shield for you!' 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say &quot;What chunk of prismatic metal? &quot;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok says 'This particular type of metal is very 
                difficult to come by, and has only ever been reported to me as 
                being found in the caverns of Permafrost. Last I heard, some sort 
                of sage or something had been hoarding it for some sort of an 
                experiment that he was working on. If you can find the sage, you'll 
                find the metal.' </p>

            <p>Go beating on ice goblins in Permafrost until you receive a Chunk 
              of Prismatic Metal (magic, lore, wt 1.0, small, none/none, non-stacking)</p>
            <p>You say &quot;What chunk of refined metal?&quot;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok says 'The refined material has only ever been 
                found in the depths of Unrest Mansion. It is regretful, but I 
                cannot recall what, or who was guarding this item, but Im sure, 
                if you explored the mansion thoroughly, you would find some.'

            <p>Beat on dark boned skeletons until you receive a Chunk of Refined 
              Metal (magic, lore, wt 1.0, small, none/none, non-stacking)</p>
            <p>You ask &quot;What shield frame mold? &quot;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok says 'Ahh, the mold, yes. . . Unfortunately, 
                I do not know exactly where one would obtain one of these particularly 
                useful molds. I used to know a smith in Halas, he may have one, 
                you might go speak with him. Tell him that I sent you.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Head up to Halas and hail, Kevan McPherson. You can find him in 
              the McPherson's Bloody Blades shop.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Kevan McPherson says 'Well met, Eido! I'm Kevan McPherson, the 
                best darn smith in the north. Have ye come to purchase my finely 
                crafted weapons or are ye wanting me ta teach ya the secrets of 
                Northman smithing?' </p>

            <p>You say &quot;Kintok sent me.&quot;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Kevan McPherson says 'He did, did he? How is that fool doing? 
                Its been a while since I saw him last! So, what has he sent you 
                here for? Oh, a mold? I have a stockpile of those laying around. 
                I suppose I could part with one if you were able to somehow get 
                a fire goblin skin.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Give Kevan the fire goblin skin. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Kevan McPherson says 'Well, arent you full of surprises! I appreciate 
                you retrieving this for me, as I cant really leave my shop here 
                for very long, the services I provide are nearly irreplacable. 
                As promised, here is your mold! Good luck!' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He will give you a Shield Frame Mold (magic, lore, wt 1.0, small, 
              none/none, non-stacking)</p>
            <p>Head back to Gukta and give Yun Trainer Kintok your Guktan Initiate's 
              Shield (from step 1), chunk of prismatic metal, chunk of refined 
              metal and the shield frame mold.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok says 'You have proven to be quite a resourceful 
                young initiate! I had not expected to see you again for quite 
                some time. This was definitely not an easy task to complete, by 
                any means' he says, as he begins working on the shield. A few 
                hammer swings, and a jug of water later, he holds the new shield 
                up for inspection. ' Here you are, you've earned it! I replaced 
                the old wooden shield frame with a metal one, it should increase 
                the durability of the shield ten fold. May it serve you well!'

            <h3>Step 3: (unsolved)</h3>
            <p> Hail, Yun Trainer Kintok </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok says 'You sure are rough on shields, arent 
                you?! No matter, I am sure that I can reinforce the shield enough 
                to get you a few more years out of it, but this wont be easy. 
                I have been expecting a shipment of supplies that have not yet 
                arrived. The shipment left Erudin last week, but I've not received 
                it, and I fear the worst for my assistant. If you are [up to the 
                task], I could certainly use you to research the problem, and 
                in exchange for your services I will upgrade your shield one final 
                time.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say &quot;I am up to the task&quot;</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Yun Trainer Kintok says 'I thought you might be. As I said before, 
                the shipment left out of Erudin last week sometime, and has not 
                been seen or heard from since. As you well know, that boat could 
                be anywhere from Erudin to Qeynos. Do what you can, and return 
                to me when you have made some progress.'</p>
