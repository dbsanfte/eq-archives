            <h3>Fell Blade Armor - Paineel Shadow Knight Quest</h3>
            <P><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in 
              Paineel. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ERU/SHD 
              only. They are no-fail smithing combines. While we're missing stats 
              for most of the pieces, the resulting armor graphic is dark grey 
              plate. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer 
              materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the 
              parts for a second one</i></p>
            <P>You say, 'Hail, Faratain'<br>
              Faratain says 'Salutations Darulius. If you are here to make use 
              of the forges then feel free to pursue your crafts within this chamber. 
              If you are a new Fell Blade in need of a suit of armor and weapon 
              then I will assist you in crafting [armaments] fitting of a young 
              Shadow Knight.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'What armaments?'<br>
              Faratain says 'You will require this specially prepared Mail Assembly 
              Kit in order to construct a suit of Fell Blade Armor. The materials 
              required vary depending on the piece of armor you desire to craft. 
              Once you have been outfitted in the Fell Blade Armor, return to 
              me and I will present you with a somewhat important [task]. Do you 
              desire to craft a [fell blade helm], a [fell blade bracer], [fell 
              blade gauntlets], [fell blade boots], [fell blade vambraces], [fell 
              blade greaves], or a [fell blade breastplate]?'</P>
            <P>You say, 'What fell blade helm?'<br>
              Faratain says 'To assemble a Fell blade Helm you will need to obtain 
              two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water 
              Flask and this Crude Helm Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude 
              Bronze Helm with a Ruined Kobold Pelt and a Calcified Skull in the 
              Mail Assembly Kit.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'What fell blade bracer?'<br>
              Faratain says 'To assemble a Fell blade Bracer you will need to 
              obtain a brick of crude bronze and smelt it in a forge with a Water 
              Flask and this Crude Bracer Mold. Once that is done, combine the 
              Crude Bronze Bracer with a Ruined Kobold Pelt and a Calcified Ulna 
              Bone in the Mail Assembly Kit.'</P>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Completed bracer is ac 4, +1 str, +5 hp, wt 2.0</p>
            </blockquote>
            <P>You say, 'What fell blade gauntlets?'<br>
              Faratain says 'To assemble Fell blade Gauntlets you will need to 
              obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with 
              a Water Flask and this crude Gauntlet Mold. Once that is done combine 
              the Crude Bronze Gauntlets with a Ruined Kobold Pelt and two Calcified 
              Finger Bones in the Mail Assembly Kit.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'What fell blade boots?'<br>
              Faratain says 'To assemble Fell blade Boots you will need to obtain 
              two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water 
              Flask and this crude Boot Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude 
              Bronze Boots with two Ruined Kobold Pelts, and two Calcified Foot 
              Bones in the Mail Assembly Kit.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'What fell blade vambraces?'<br>
              Faratain says 'To assemble Fell blade Vambraces you will need to 
              obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with 
              a Water Flask and this Crude Vambrace Mold. Once that is done combine 
              the Crude Bronze Vambraces with an Intact Kobold Pelt and two Calcified 
              Humerus Bones in the Mail Assembly Kit.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'What fell blade greaves?'<br>
              Faratain says 'To assemble Fell blade Greaves you will need to obtain 
              two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water 
              Flask and this Crude Greaves Mold. Once that is done combine the 
              Crude Bronze Greaves with two Intact Kobold Pelts and two Calcified 
              Tibia in the Mail Assembly Kit.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'What fell blade breastplate?'<br>
              Faratain says 'To assemble a Fell blade Breastplate you will need 
              to obtain four bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge 
              with a Water Flask and this Crude Breastplate Mold. Once that is 
              done combine the Crude Bronze Breastplate with a Pristine Kobold 
              Pelt, a calcified sternum, and a calcified ribcage in the Mail Assembly 
              Kit.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'What task?'<br>
              Faratain says 'The blacksmiths of [Clan Kolbok] craft weapons using 
              an ancient Kobold tradition that has been long forgotten by most 
              of the kobold clans. I believe there is something to be learned 
              from their traditions should we discover their intricacies. Go into 
              the Warrens and locate the chambers of the kobold blacksmiths. There 
              you should be able to find some record of their traditional techniques 
              to return to me here in Paineel where they can be translated and 
              studied.' </P>
