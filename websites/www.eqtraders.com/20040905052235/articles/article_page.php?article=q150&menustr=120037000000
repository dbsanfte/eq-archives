<p>This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.</p>
<p>The completion of this quest will allow you to progress to brewing skill 54. It will also allow you to learn how to process Taelosian Tea Leaves into Taelosian Tea and Taelosian Mountain Tea Leaves into Taelosian Mountain Tea, which are used in some of the GoD brewing recipes.</p>
<p>Bring Yitimis Groglenog on the Queen of Thorns some Taelosian Tea Leaves, and she will convert it into Taelosian Tea. Hand one of those teas to Galidnus Corkpopper to begin his quest. (You will also need to do this every time you run out of Taelosian Tea and need more for the quest.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Galidnus Corkpopper'</p>
<p>Galidnus Corkpopper says 'Welcome!  Welcome!  Hey, I don't suppose you'd like to learn how to brew?  Or maybe you already know the trade and you just want to help me out?  I've got some busywork to do, and I'd like to get someone else to do it for me.  I'd rather spend my time making tea from those wonderful local tea leaves.  There's a wild variety that somehow grows in the mountains that I really would like to spend some time working with.  Can you help me with my [busywork]?'</p>
<p>You say, 'busywork?'</p>
<p>Galidnus Corkpopper says 'The local tea can be used for some helpful brews. Of course this means that I have to spend all my time and energy brewing stuff up for the Wayfarers and no time trying new ideas.  I really want to investigate this [mountain tea]!  It's supposedly growing in harsh terrain, and the properties it displays are definitely magical.  So if you are willing to do [some work] for me, I'll reward you with the secret that Yitimis and I have learned about preparing both types of local tea.  I would need you to bring me some of the Taelosian Tea that Yitimis can make for you if you bring her Taelosian Tea Leaves.'</p>
<p>You say, 'some work?'</p>
<p>Galidnus Corkpopper says 'I can definitely use your help.  I need some Taelosian Tea for the tasks I want you to do.  Give Yitimis some Taelosian Tea Leaves and she can prepare Taelosian Tea for you.  If you bring that to me, I can get you doing the busywork.  Of course, since I'm asking you to supply the materials, I can reward you sooner than Yitimis will.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STEP ONE: Traveler's Tea</p>
<p>Give a Taelosian Tea Leaves to Yitimis and receive back two Taelosian Teas. (Repeat this process during the quest whenever you are out of Taelosian Tea and need more.) Give one of those teas to Galidnus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galidnus Corkpopper says 'Let's get you started.  Brew us up some Traveler's Tea.  Just drop a Small Bundle of Taelosian Tea and a Pinch of Sugar into a brew barrel and combine.  The tea it makes is very tasty and very popular with the Wayfarers.  Bring the Traveler's Tea to me as soon as you have it.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then gives you enough materials to make 10 Traveler's Tea.  Combine them in a brew barrel and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 40 Traveler's Tea.  When you give him the next Taelosian Tea, he will move on to step two.</p>
<p>STEP TWO: Wayfarer Spiced Tea</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galidnus Corkpopper says 'Much work to do.  Dive right in and brew up some Wayfarer Spiced Tea.  Just take a Small Bundle of Taelosian Tea and Wayfarer Spice and combine them in a brew barrel.  The result is pretty good!  Just bring the tea back to me when you have it ready.  Thank you.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then gives you enough materials to make 10 Wayfarer Spiced Tea.  Combine them in a brew barrel and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Wayfarer Spiced Tea.  When you give him the next Taelosian Tea, he will move on to step three.</p>
<p>STEP THREE: Berry Tea</p> 
<blockquote>
<p>Galidnus Corkpopper says 'You'll have plenty of experience brewing tea before I'm done with you,'  Galidnas smiles.  'I need more Bitter Berry Tea.  Personally, I can't stand the stuff, but it goes over well with some folks.  Just take a Small Bundle of Taelosian Tea and a Bitter Berry and combine them in a brew barrel.  Don't worry, you only need one of those berries, they are really bitter!  Bring the tea back to me when you're done.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then gives you enough materials to make 10 Berry Tea.  Combine them in a brew barrel and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 40 Berry Tea.  When you give him the next Taelosian Tea, he will move on to step four.</p>
<p>STEP FOUR: Rum Tea</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galidnus Corkpopper says 'Busy work is never done, is it?  Well, I need some Rum Tea brewed up.  Simple, but wonderful stuff, especially with that new tea.  Combine Small Bundle of Taelosian Tea, Wayfarer Spice and an Ounce of Rum in a brew barrel to make this.  It's my favorite drink.  Bring it right back here to me as soon as you can, please.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then gives you enough materials to make 10 Rum Tea.  Combine them in a brew barrel and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Rum Tea. Give him one last Taelosian Tea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Galidnus Corkpopper says 'I don't want to work you to death.  There are others that can help me.  Besides, you've earned your reward.  Go talk to lovely Yitimis and she'll give you the secret.  Make certain to tell her that you were able to [lend a hand] over here.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow his instructions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'I was able to lend a hand'</p>
<p>Yitimis Groglenog says 'You've been just a peach helping out!  I don't think I need your help any more, you've already done so much.  Let me give you the secret I promised and you go out and enjoy the rest of the day.'  Yitimis pulls out several ragged-looking pieces of parchment, most with wine stains that make them almost unreadable.  She holds one up for you to look at.  It only takes you a minute to grasp what needs to be done to prepare the Taelosian Tea Leaves and the Taelosian Mountain Tea Leaves.  In fact, you are certain that if you work at it long enough, you can produce more usable tea with practice.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You now have the ability to turn Taelosian Tea Leaves into Taelosian Tea, as well as Taelosian Mountain Tea Leaves into Taelosian Mountain Tea.
