            <h3> Stonehand Armor - Freeport Monk</h3>
            <p>One of many new quests for younglings, this one is for Freeport 
              Monks. Armor made will be lore (other than bracer), no drop, HUM/MNK 
              only. Graphic is plain leather when worn. <i>Please note that while 
              the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make 
              your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one.</i> 
              Tailoring combine is no-fail and trivial &lt;=26</p>

            <p>Klom Jysun says 'Pleasure to meet you Fistsaflyin. I am Klom Jysun, 
              Grandmaster of the Ashen Order. I have lived in the great city of 
              Freeport for quite sometime now and have watched the city evolve 
              and change. Nowadays though I am in charge of training new members 
              of the Ashen Fist. If you are a young monk and are in need of some 
              armor I might have some work for you. Are you a [monk]?'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a monk'</p>
            <p>Klom Jysun says 'I am always pleased when a new disciple visits 
              our sacred halls. If you are [interested] in crafting your own armor 
              I have a number of gathering tasks for you to do that will test 
              both your navigational and fighting skills.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I am interested'</p>
            <p>Klom Jysun says 'I am very pleased to here about your interest 
              in proving your worth to the Ashen Order. First let me present you 
              with this Fistfighters Loom. Inside of it you will combine [various 
              components] to form armor materials. Once you have a material for 
              a certain piece of armor you will combine it in a Loom along with 
              the appropriate pattern. When you inform me what piece of armor 
              you [want] to craft, I will be able to present you with the component 
              recipe and pattern needed for crafting it.'</p>
            <p>The loom you get is a 10 slot combine box called Fistfighters Loom.</p>
            <p>You say, 'what various components'</p>
            <p>Klom Jysun says 'The items you will need to collect are all over 
              the Freeport area, some in stores some off vicious monsters. If 
              you are up for the challenge though I will be able to provide you 
              with the armor recipes and patterns for Stonehand [Caps], [Bracers], 
              [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. All you 
              will need to do is tell me what piece of armor you [want] to craft, 
              and I will be able to present you with the component recipe and 
              pattern needed for crafting it.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a cap'</p>
            <p>Klom Jysun says 'A cap will almost certainly be your most important 
              piece of armor you will craft. To create your cap material you will 
              need to combine 2 Matted Lion Pelts, 1 Malachite, 1 Snake Scale

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a bracer'</p>
            <p>Klom Jysun says 'In the case that you are not able to dodge a blow 
              from an attacker a solid wristband will prevent you from getting 
              seriously hurt. To create your bracer material you will need to 
              combine 1 Matted Lion Pelt, 2 Rat Ears, 1 Coyote Pelt and a Cloth

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft sleeves'</p>

              or she has worked so hard for. It would be a shame to see your body, 
              especially your arms riddled with bruises. To create your sleeve 
              material you will need to combine 2 Matted Lion Pelts, 2 Lion Tails, 
              and Cloth Sleeves in your assembly kit. Once you have created the

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft sandals'</p>
            <p>Klom Jysun says 'Lightweight but effective, your Sandals of the 
              Stoenhand will give you the appropriate foot protection without

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft trousers'</p>
            <p>Klom Jysun says 'Trousers are a definite must for any Initiate 
              of the Ashen Fist. You will learn to generate some attacks using 
              your legs later in your training that is why it is necessary that

            <p>Klom Jysun says 'The gloves will assist you in hitting anything 
              that might have some kind of magical barrier surrounding it preventing 
              you from damaging it with your bare hands. To create your glove 
              material you will need to combine 3 Matted Lion Pelts, 1 Giant Scarab

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a robe'</p>

            <p>You say, 'what favor?'</p>
            <p>Klom Jysun says 'I had a student not too long ago that trained 
              with me for quite sometime. He showed a lot of promise on his way 
              to becoming a Grandmaster, however one day he came to tell me that 
              he intended on joining the militia. I told him that I did not feel 
              that was what he wanted to do but he insisted. On the day that he 
              left he stole a headband from me that I was presented with by the 
              Hall of Truth. This headband meant a lot to me, if you were able 
              to find Firansad I am sure he will have it. Return it to me with 
              2 Orc Toes and I will surely reward you for your trouble.'</p>
