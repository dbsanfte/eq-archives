              you start ... <span class="headers">A few words<a name="words"></a> 
              from Niami (Tunare Server)</span></p>
            <p>If you've never tried a trade skill before, there are a few things 
              you should know.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Remember that training points can only be spent on trade skills 
                early on. Once you hit a skill of 20 in the standard trade skills, 
                you MUST gain skill increases through hands-on-practice. </li>
              <li>While tradeskills in EQ increase with practice, trade skills 
                cost you money (in supplies), regardless of success or failure. 
                For the more expensive skills (such as jewelcraft), it's wise 
                to not only stockpile some money in advance, but also spend the 
                training points to get to skill 20 before trying the skill. </li>
              <li>Low-level players: Before you even train in a trade skill, you 
                should check to be sure that the materials you will need to practice 
                your skill <a href="../learn.htm">are available nearby</a>. If 
                they are not easily available, you have to make a hard decision 
                -- do you want to try the skill anyway or do you want to try another 
                trade skill? For example, basic smithing supplies are not available 
                in Halas, and if you look at a map, you'll realize you're going 
                to be running through a lot of zones to get things such as sharpening 
                stones and ore. This isn't meant to discourage you, but to make 
                sure you don't spend a lot of training points before you realize 
                the scope of the task ahead of you. (Higher level players tend 
                to move around a lot, so this is less of an issue for them.) </li>
              <li>Keep close eye on the failure messages that you get when you 
                attempt to combine items. <i>"Those items do not combine in those 
                quantities ..."</i> means just that. Those items don't work together, 
                or not in the ratio you're trying. Give up with those items, or 
                try different amounts of them <i>"You lack the skill to ..."</i> 
                means you've actually got the right items, in the right quantities, 
                but that you failed to make anything. Try, try again. Practice 
                makes perfect, as we well know. And if you're getting a failure 
                rate that will rapidly bankrupt you, then either spend more training 
                points, or find something simpler to practice on. (i.e., don't 
                try to make a silver sapphire necklace the first time you try 
                jewelcraft). </li>
              <li>For everything but fishing, sell your goods to other players 
                as opposed to NPC merchants where possible. If you sell to NPCs, 
                you rarely will be paid what the raw materials cost you, much 
                less the value of the item. For example, you'd get slightly over 
                1 gold for a piece of patchwork armor, when sold to an NPC merchant. 
                The going rate when selling directly to players is generally 2 
                gold or so, depending on supply/demand and individual whimsy. 
              </li>
              <li>When a recipe calls for two or more of a single item, <b>DO 
                NOT STACK</b> the items. Have two (or more) piles of the item 
                in your forge, brew barrel, etc., not one pile of two. </li>
              <li>Most trade skills are not level-capped, meaning that with enough 
                time and raw materials, you could master the tradeskill at level 
                1. Other skills, such as fishing and alchemy are limited based 
                on your level, just like your combat and other skills. </li>
              <li>When you see mention of a "trivial" on a chart, it means that 
                at that skill level, you will no longer gain skill increases from 
                making the item. You will, however, still continue to fail quite 
                a bit when making the item. Just because something is trivial 
                does not mean you can do it in your sleep. Eventually, as your 
                skill improves, your chance of failing at making the item will 
                decrease, but there's generally <b>always</b> a chance of failure. 
                <i>(silk swatches and silk thread seem to be the exception to 
                this)</i> </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As time goes on, this list will be improved and enchanced (I'm 
              collecting suggestions/submissions from folks now). In the meantime,
