                It WILL be mid-afternoon before even the first of these gets onto 
                the site. It's even more important than ever that you READ before

                we're going to be running a tight herd on the chaos caused by

                to watch your manners when posting on the message boards. A LOT

                in the doghouse. The posting and conduct rules are there for a 
                reason, and we are very actively enforcing them. This goes especially 
                for those of you wanting to let off some steam. Even in the Primal 
                Scream Forum, remember that the rules apply. Keep it family-rated, 
                and remember NO personal attacks. We understand that when tradeskills 
                change, folks tend to get a tad ... excited ... but this message 
                board community really does NOT appreciate some of the foaming 
                at the mouth we've seen lately. Such antics only distract us from 
                making sure that data gets accurately reported, then recorded, 
                onto the site.</font></li>

            <p>The following is <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1638.topic" target="_new">a 
              post</a> from Rich Waters, one of the Lead Designers for EQ: 
            <blockquote>
              <p>If you are not a Druid and you've completed <a href="quests/potc_intro.htm">the 
                PoTC quest</a>, go and speak with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove 
                - She's more than happy to give you something you'll be able to 
                use instead of Xanthe's Earring.</p>
              <p>If you're one of the few people who did the quest twice and lost 
                an earring due to it being made lore, petition in game and a GM 
                will reimburse you with the nine ingredients needed to make another 
                earring after verifying your loss.</p>
              <p>If your Xanthe's Earring is out of charges, trade it in with 
                Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove, and she'll give you one that 
                has charges. When items that didn't have an effect are retroactively 
                changed, it sometimes causes the &quot;out of charges&quot; bug. 
              </p>
              <p>To trade the earring in with Rebecca, give her your Xanthe's 
                Earring and she'll give you an alternate kind of earring. Give 
                her back the alternate earring, and she'll give you a fully charged 
                Xanthe's earring back.</p>
              <p>Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you, this should 
                solve any difficulties anyone's had with the earring.</p>
              <p>Thanks,</p>

              a plethora of gifts for you all. Recipes, recipes everywhere! Yes, 
              it's chaos everywhere, with tradesfolk running around, comparing 
              notes, wanting to exchange their gifts for other gifts, and so on. 
              It's going to take quite a while for things to settle down around 
              here and for &quot;DenMom&quot; to clean up everything. In the meantime, 
              you'll want to watch the message boards (as always), as well as 
              bookmark the following: <a href="secrets/recipes_may8.htm">Main

              cultural</a>. Yes, I really do mean to move each of the cultures 
              to their own page for easier sorting out, and then later merge them 
              with their other cultural recipes, but I keep getting sidetracked 
              by new recipe updates. It'll get there.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've been agonizing 
              for over a day now what to mention in a front page update, as so 
              much of it is newsworthy to varying parts of the tradeskill community, 
              and I know, no matter what I highlight, someone will feel left out. 
              Some posts late last night/early this morning decided me on what 
              would be highlighted ...</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Druids and 
              tradeskillers from all across Norrath have been hard at work, deciphering 
              the Liber Brassica Felix books, in search of the Protection of the 
              Cabbage spell (a single-target PoTG). It's been a monumental undertaking, 
              and I'd like to thank the EQTC community and the folks over at the 
              Druid Grove for sharing information and ideas enough to get this 
              sorted out quickly. The quest has been gargantuan, to say the least. 
              And it's now over. The lovely Lady Xanthe Ravenwolf of Bertoxx exhaustedly 
              reported in last night that she had completed the quest, and was 
              kind enough to provide us with information on the reward (the spell 
              and a nice earring), and a run-down of the quest. (I'll be working 
              on webbing it after the caffeine kicks in.) We then received a visit 
              from Rich Waters, one of the Lead Designers from EQ (I swear, he's 
              got to be getting as little sleep as I am right now, from the looks 
              of his posts on the boards!)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Rich said</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Congratulations, Xanthe!</p>
              <p>With the first completion of this quest, a new spell was brought 
                into the world, and I'd like to thank the many druids and tradesfolk 
                who participated in this event. </p>
              <p>This quest is unusual in EverQuest, as it was intended to be 
                done once and then change after it was solved. In the next patch, 
                Xanthe will reap the rewards of finishing the quest first, and 
                all druids will find the scroll much easier to attain now that 
                the quest has been completed.</p>
              <p>The quest will stay in game, for people who enjoy tradeskills 
                and anyone who completes the full quest will find the final reward 
                is quite suitable for the effort.</p>
              <p>Thanks for playing,</p>

            <p>In other words, folks, if you wait until the next patch, the spell 
              <i>will</i> be easier to obtain. The quest will stay in game for 
              those of us who enjoy playing with such stuff <i>{curls protectively 
              around her fishing pole and her Misty Thicket Picnic}</i>, but for 
              those who don't have a tradeskill junkie's patience with such quests, 
              find enough patience to wait for the next patch. ;D</p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I won't repeat 
              the entire patch message, but here are the parts that are relevant 
              to tradeskills, along with some commentary:</font></p>
            <ul>
              <li> <b><font color="#400000">Added over 1,000 new tradeskill recipes 
                for all levels of skill,</font></b> along with many recipe books. 
                A few of the vendors of Norrath might be able to get you started 
                on your way <i>(of course, we'll be scrambling here to get the 
                information online for all of you, but expect things to be a tad 
                ... hectic ... for a while)</i></li>
              <li> Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant <i>(this should 
                make poisonmaking, dyemaking, pottery idols, and a few other things 
                a bit easier for those who have chosen to live mostly in Velious)</i></li>
              <li> Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin 
                <i>(happy shawl questing! No more running to Cabilis!)</i><br>
              </li>
              <li> Hit point bonuses on food items should be working<i> (centi 
                steaks and centi toe stew, anyone?)</i></li>
              <li> Characters can no longer scribe a scroll that they can't cast 
                due to deity restrictions <i>(imbue gem spells were bugged for 
                a while so anyone of the proper level/class could scribe them, 
                now you should be able to only scribe the spell for your deity)</i><br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your best bet for the first 24 hours is to keep an eye on the message 
              boards for the new recipes. It's going to take some time to get 
              these things webbed, especially with the server lag I'm already 
              seeing this morning from eager folks at w*rk hitting the site, trying 
              to see if anything's been found yet. 
            <p><b><i><font color="#400000">Addendum - </font></i></b> 
            <p>Erm, um ... if you tried to access the message boards earlier, 
              and were timing out all over the place, you weren't alone. I feel 
              sort of bad for the folks at EZBoard when they saw the load hit 
              today. We've now been moved to a server of our very own (I'll be 
              sending them a very heartfelt thank you to them for their fast work). 
              The reroute to the new message board server is automagic, but please 
              DO change your bookmarks when you have a chance, to cut down on 
              their load.. It will take me days before I can change all the links 
              on all the pages other than the front page, as the recipes that 
              everyone's trying to get information on are the priority right now.

              boards, please), whether this works well for folks, or if you'd 
              prefer that the tailored armor recipes get added back into that 
              main table. (I'd been waiting to see the redesign submission from 
              one of the folks on the message boards, but, sadly, he's not yet 
              responded to me with an email address so we can begin email-tag 
              regarding it, so I made some tweaks on my own)</font></p>

              - Thanks to Caell (with feedback from many folks on the message 
              boards), we have a <a href="secrets/info/luclin_spawndrop.htm">Luclin 
              Spawn Drop table</a> for trade supply items. I've also continued 
              the process of removing recipes from the temporary <a href="secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">Luclin 
              Recipes</a> page, and integrating those recipes onto their proper 
              pages. I hope to make the Luclin page obsolete within a week. I 
              also plan to remove the Luclin Data Reporting forum from the message 
              boards within a week. Luclin has been out long enough that I'd now 
              like to funnel the information into the proper tradeskill discussion 
              forum. Hopefully this will start to cut down on duplicate questions, 
              answers, etc.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font color="#400000">Prices</font></b> 
              - Balidil wants to expand on his pricing data with merchant buy-back 
              prices. This will require quite a bit of input from the tradeskill 
              community. I've set up a special message board forum and am tagging 
              him as the moderator. When he gets a chance, he'll make a post listing 
              what he needs from the community, etc. Please have patience until 
              he gets it all set up ... and thanks in advance for any help you 
              can provide that will add to our knowledge pool.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b><font color="#400000">Message 
              Boards</font></b> - It's cleanup time! On top of adding the new 
              pricing board mentioned above, I've removed the Luclin Archive forum. 
              I'm also moving the Luclin Tradeskill Discusion forum and the Luclin 
              Data Reporting. I'm hoping that the move will make folks stop long 
              enough to think and READ before they make posts to forums that are 
              going to be phased out in the next week. ;)</font></p>

              - Various image hosting sites seem to be having issues lately, causing 
              folks on the message boards to receive a login prompt when trying 
              to view someone's sig pic in a post. Please be aware that this is 
              NOT something done by my website, sending me email about it will 
              NOT do much good, it's NOT really a security risk, just very annoying. 
              It is also generally NOT intentional by the folks whose images are 
              being affected. When someone posts regarding affected threads on 
              the boards, as able, we go in and edit the individual post in question 
              remove the personal pic or sig pic, but in some cases, the hosting 
              provider has resolved the problem by the time we get to the image. 
              I really, really don't want to simply stop allowing sigs on the 
              message boards,so please have patience with this issue, and just 
              click &quot;cancel&quot; if you get such a prompt while viewing 
              our message boards. (The most recent &quot;culprit&quot; seems to 
              be www.facelink.com, and while the problem seems to be resolved, 
              it's hard to tell when/where it will crop up again.) </font></p>

              Just a few quick updates today. The Kaladim high quality ore merchant 
              is now in place in the mines of Kaladim, and he offers up the same 
              <a href="quests/qeynos_ore.htm">quest to restock his inventory</a> 
              as the Qeynos and Bazaar vendors. The non-visible pieces of black 
              panther armor have been updated to allow all BST-capable races to 
              wear them. The <a href="learn/learn_alchemy.htm">Learn Alchemy</a> 
              section of the site has been expanded a tad, and more of the content 
              from Belgar's site will be up later this week. As always, I feel 
              like I'm still running way behind on things, and it's going to be 
              a busy week. I'll be sneaking in updates and additions as able.</font></p>

              After <i>much</i> hard work by Balidil, EQTC is proud to announce 
              the unveiling of a new <a href="prices.htm">trade supply prices</a> 
              section. While it cannot tell you selling prices for your hard-made 
              wares, it should give you an idea of the costs of the vendor-purchased 
              raw materials that went into making the item. Thanks a ton, Balidil!</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Last, but not 
              least, Belgar Frostvenom has decided to close the doors to Belgar's 
              Ultimate Guide to Alchemy. This site will be sorely missed. While 
              it sounds like the Shaman's Crucible may be picking up the content 
              from the site, I've also received copies of the alchemy tables from 
              Belgar, and will be working on formatting them and getting them 
              up here on EQTC. While I may surprise even myself, and have them 
              in place in a couple hours, its more likely that it will take me 
              a couple days to get it all in place. Please be patient with the 
              wee halfling. I am unsure how long the message boards will stay 
              up, but for those of you who have lost track of a link to it, it

              Since I know many folks are weekend tradeskillers, I rushed through 
              and got the basic alchemy information in place (a <a href="learn/learn_alchemy2.htm">basic 
              guide to alchemy</a>, a detailed explanation as to the <a href="learn/learn_alchemy3.htm">effects 
              of various potions</a>, and an <a href="secrets/recipes_alchemy.htm">alchemy 
              recipes page</a>). There's lots more to be added, and there are 
              some formatting/color issues still, but I wanted to have <i>something</i> 
              in place as a reference source for folks. It <i>will</i> take several 
              days for me to get everything else in place, as there are a lot 
              of files for me to wade through, but more content <i>will</i> be 
              added.</font></p>
