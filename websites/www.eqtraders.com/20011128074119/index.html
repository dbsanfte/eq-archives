              We had a bit of a DNS issue, for those of you who had problems reaching 
              the site yesterday. All should be well now. Trivials, stats and 
              updates continue to trickle in, but don't expect the foraging pages 
              to be fully updated for a while. It seems that in some zones, anything 
              you can fish, you can forage now, and that's going to really enlarge 
              my forage listing, or make me redesign it.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">Other than that, I'm trying to conserve 
              my &quot;oomph&quot; in preparation for the flood of new tradeskill 
              stuff that's bound to come out with the release of Luclin ... just 
              in time for holiday travel that will slow down site updates, of 
              course. ;-)</p>

              Congratulations go out to Kallamindar Sunfury <united Guardians> 
              on Morrel-Thule for discovering the recipe for <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_dwarven.htm">brellium 
              chain</a> armor! We've got <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">stats</a> 
              for a few pieces of the imbued/enchanted (no &quot;just&quot; enchanted 
              version). If you have stats on other pieces, please post on the

              and <a href="location/foraged.htm">foraging</a> a tad, and as word 
              comes in, the site will be updated with more information. So far, 
              we've got verification that yew leaves and misty acorns can now 
              be foraged, if rarely. Cinnamon sticks are also now live, and folks 
              will be trying to pin down the trivial for <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">Pixie 
              Powdered Cinnesticks</a> (it trivials somewhere <i>above</i> 174!). 
              Still no word on a verified recipe for the <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=4008.topic">brellium 
              chain</a>, though there's even a few gnomes who've decided to try 
              and see if they can figure out a working recipe.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">Other than that, there's not a lot going 
              on tradeskill-wise, and I don't expect to see much more until Luclin.</p>

              The recipe for chocolate covered cherries was discovered a couple 
              days back, and was placed on the <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">baking 
              recipes page</a>. Tonight, we've learned that the cherries are, 
              indeed, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=1204.topic">used 
              in a quest</a>, which rewards folks with a couple +5 WIS, -1 STA 
              pouches of catnip! Meow! Still no luck on finding a working version 
              for the brellium chain, however, despite being told that it followed 
              the elven chain model for a recipe.</p>

              Several bits of info have been brought back from the Fan Faire of 
              interest to tradeskillers. You'll find discussions of items of tradeskill 
              interest <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessage?topicID=3136.topic" target="_new">here</a>, 
              <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=3999.topic" target="_top">here</a> 
              and <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=843.topic" target="_new">here</a>. 
              This includes making cultural tailoring pelts stack, yew leaves 
              possibly able to be foraged, mention that there IS a dwarven cultural 
              chain, and that it has Bristlebane and Brell imbues (not quite what 
              halfling clerics wanted to hear, but at least there actually <i>is</i> 
              a Bristlebane armor imbue!), upcoming robes for erudites (and others), 
              more tinkering, something to bridge the tailoring gap (chasm?), 
              there is supposedly a working recipe for <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=1189.topic" target="_new">chocolate 
              covered cherries</a> in-game, and much, much more. Much, of course, 
              will be waiting until after Luclin, but the tradeskill community 
              hopes it won't be <i>too</i> long a wait after that launch before 
              we start seeing some of this stuff! I've started a new message board 
              thread for those willing and able to experiment with <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=4008.topic" target="_new">brellium 
              chain</a>.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">At long last, someone has reported success 
              with the creation of an <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_velious_silks.htm">ice 
              silk robe</a>. While, sadly, this doesn't have any fancy graphics 
              texture attributed to it, it is one of the better tradeable robes 
              out there, and kudos go to Qweeg of the Brell server for making 
              this rare and difficult item. We still have no stats for the ice 
              silk leggings, but a painful failure this past weekend by the DenMom 
              at least verified that the recipe was correct. ;) We'll try again 
              when more ice silk is available.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">There's a new version of <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/intro.htm">Verdandi's 
              Thurgadin Shawl Quest guide</a> in place. I don't know if we should 
              cheer or just break down and cry that we've had word that there 
              will be <i>ten</i> of these shawls one of these days, given the 
              shawl-induced insanity we're seen. ;) New shawls, will, of course, 
              not be in place until sometime after Luclin launches.</p>

              There have only been a few things to note in the last few weeks. 
              First and foremost, brewers will be happy to note that, thanks to 
              Laurefin on the message boards, we now have <a href="secrets/recipes_brewing.htm">verified 
              brewing recipes</a> for Egg Nog and the more alcoholic version of 
              it, Egg Nog XXX. A few more trivials have been narrowed down in 
              other recipes around the site, but nothing too earth-shattering. 
              The post-patch version of the city newspapers had little to note 
              tradeskill-wise, other than a hint that bread might soon become 
              readily available again.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">On the ooc front, many already know 
              that I'm almost never in EQ anymore. This site <i>will</i> continue 
              to stay on top of up-to-date tradeskill information, but I will 
              continue to be pretty much &quot;retired from EQ&quot; until further 
              notice. Yes, in part this is due to <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com" target="_new">DAoC</a> 
              launching (and the fun I had doing tradeskills over there in beta 
              4), but only in part. Perhaps once the visit by the House Ogre's 
              mom is over, I'll post something to the message boards about my 
              decision, but I decided it was time to make an &quot;official&quot; 
              announcement. (I was all prepared to announce my retirement on September 
              11, well before DAoC beta was done, but events of that day made 
              me decide to delay such an annoucement...)</p>

              yesterday's patch ... unless someone posted a find to the boards 
              late last night after I last read the boards. Somehow, I don't have 
              a lot of hope for stackable pelts for halfling and wood elf cultural 
              tailors, or the myriad of other nigglies that are still a bit awry, 
              and likely will stay that way, with Luclin taking up so much of

              until it's gone ... such as my wonderful webhosting provider, who 
              was laid low for several days. (I never did find out why, but given

                been changed. (We know some non-quest tailoring pelts were overlooked, 
                but we're not sure if it was accident or intent - I've submitted 
                an enquiry) about it. At least one of the idols we consider &quot;bugged&quot; 
                has not been fixed (Rallos Zek), and another (Cazic Thule) had 
                a couple surplus classes removed from the list of who could wield. 
                More details as they become available.</p>
              <p>New issues of the newspapers should be available in all starting 
                cities. Please use <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=624.topic">this 
                message board thread</a> to track anything regarding tradeskills 
                that is found in local papers.</p>
              <p>Site updates have been slow due to an RL death in the family 
                last week. I hope to get a bit more caught up on information from 
                the boards, screen shots, etc., as time goes on. So far, the biggest 
                news item since the last front page update, was information on 
                three different imbued versions of the <a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring_erudite.htm">erudite 
                steelsilk</a> armor.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">7/10/01 - Patch Day</span><br>
                As usual, I'm going to be swamped, the boards are going to be 
                VERY busy, and very slow. It looks to be a good patch day tradeskill-wise, 
                but it's going to take time for us to verify everything mentioned 
                in the patch message ... and the stuff that wasn't mentioned. 
                :)</p>
              <p>On the confirmed list, we've got the new weight stats for the 
                <a href="secrets/recipes_velious_leathers.htm">black panther armor</a> 
                (two pieces stayed at their old weight of 0.3, all others had 
                their weight reduced), the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious_silks.htm">ice 
                silk lined slippers</a> had their stats updated, spider silk and 
                silk swatches are now stackable, and at least some types of sheet 
                metal and folded sheets of metal are stackable (we've not yet 
                tested all the racial sheets yet). More information will be on 
                the message boards as the day goes on. Meanwhile, I'm going to 
                be working on editing and submitting screenshots to EQ'Lizer and 
                Alla'Khazam's, so that they have the updated stats on the changed 
                tailored items ... and maybe get some more sleeeeeeep.</p>

                Nothing <i>too</i> earth-shattering to report with this patch. 
                Pottery idols are now equippable, for the most part, by the proper 
                races and classes. (I've added in a <a href="secrets/pottery_idols.htm">stats 
                page for the idols</a>, and we're slowly filling in the blanks 
                on it.) One new baking recipe (orange flavored cod) was found 
                in the village newspapers. </p>

              <li>I've added a few new images to the fashion section in the last 
                few days, but I really can't do much with it on top of everything 
                else, so it will be slow to get updates until I find another fashion 
                editor. </li>
              <li>I've added info about mana vials to the FAQ section of the boards, 
                and will try to find time to put up an FAQ section on this main 
                site as well as time permits. Now, if only we could get folks 
                to read the FAQ posts, it'd clear up some of the extra noise on 
                the boards. :)</li>
              <li>There are still folks directly emailing me with questions about 
                things that are better posted to the message boards where they'll 
                get responses from more folks. Please, folks, use the boards. 
                Do not expect one overworked halfling to sit there and personally 
                explain to you the ins and outs of making dyes, for example. If 
                my explanation on the main site isn't clear, then maybe someone 
                on the boards can explain it to you more clearly than I apparently 
                can. ;)<br>

                <b>We're Back!</b> Ngreth and I are back in town now, and I'm 
                trying to get caught up on all the message board posts and other 
                updates that built up over the last two weeks. During the last 
                two weeks, I did manage to sneak in some updates, as well as create 
                an <a href="secrets/imbued_gemlist.htm">imbued gems master list</a>,

              <p>No ETA yet on the pottery idol fix, but Absor said they're aware

                Pottery idols are currently bugged (they cannot be equipped). 
                It's been submitted to the SONY QA boards, and hopefully they'll 
                be fixed with the next patch. :)</p>

                <b>Patch Day</b>. As usual, this means I'll be really busy once 
                the servers come back up, seeing what's changed on the live servers. 
                Also, as usual, it means the message boards will be VERY slow 
                loading, as it's likely to hit the 20K hits in a single day mark 
                today. Patience, grasshoppers. I'll get updates up as able.</p>
              <p>I normally don't talk a lot about what's going on over on the 
                Test server, though we randomly get updates from the Test tradesfolk 
                when something is coming through that will impact the trade community. 
                After all, it <i>is</i> Test, and things can/will/do change often 
                on Test before they hit the live servers. (And I absolutely refuse, 
                under any situation to post recipes/stats on the main part of 
                my site until it's verified as &quot;live&quot;.) However, an 
                accomplishment last night on Test deserves a little cheering. 
                The fleeting quiver has been very much a &quot;holy grail&quot; 
                type item for tailors and archers for 2 years now, and finally, 
                the recipe was put in place on Test. Given the difficulty of obtaining 
                the needed ingredients on Test, and the fact that there is a much 
                smaller tradesfolk community on Test, extra kudos go to Uind and 
                Gyodokan for reporting the first known success on a <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessage?topicID=1676.topic">fleeting 
                quiver</a> on Test last night about half an hour before the servers 
                went down. Well done! I'm sure the folks on the live servers will 
                quickly follow suit once the servers are back up. :)</p>
              <p><b>Addendum:</b> The new imbued pottery idols are in-game. Recipe 
                is on the pottery recipes page and has been verified as functional. 
                Discussion and stats are on the message board. Snake meat can 
                now be pickled and made into steaks. Another fish recipe (marinated 
                muskie) has been found that trivials at 142. The fleeting quiver 
                recipe is live, and folks who have tried it today confirm that 
                it's not trivial at skill 209.</p>
              <p><span class="dates">05/22/01</span><br>
                <b>Tailoring Recipes Found</b>. My thanks to Suppina as well as 
                a large number of other folks who took the challenge of the missing 
                recipes and ran with it. We have stats, plus rough trivial levels 
                for an entire new set of silk armor (<a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring.htm">Wu's 
                Fighting Armor</a>) that will get tailors into the 150-range with 
                their tailoring skill. You folks on the message boards have done 
                the EQ tradeskill community proud with your cooperation and information 
                sharing! My one comment on all this, though, is that they just 
                recently stated that the Coldain Tanners Kit could be used for 
                ALL recipes other than the cultural tailoring ... but they don't 
                have enough slots in them for the 3-silk pieces of this armor. 
                Hmmmmmm ... Are tailors stuck needing multiple sewing kits ... 
                again?</p>
              <p>Last week, Aragir also posted results on the enchanted Antonian 
                longswords. It seems we had the right recipes all along -- sort 
                of. (The &quot;ruby&quot; and &quot;emerald&quot; mentioned by 
                the NPC turned out to be &quot;star ruby&quot; and &quot;fire 
                emerald&quot;, respectively)</p>
              <p>New baking discoveries seem to have trickled to a halt for the 
                moment, but it's likely we'll figure out a few more once the dust 
                settles.</p>
              <p>Potters are eyeing a couple new items on Test with some interest. 
                There's a lot of speculation going on, but we'll just have to 
                bide our time to see what actually makes it to the live servers.</p>
