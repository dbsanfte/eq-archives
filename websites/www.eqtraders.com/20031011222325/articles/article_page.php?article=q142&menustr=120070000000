<p>
<p>To begin the quest, speak with Kordian Keshalin, a male Erudite on the second floor of the Temple of Prexus, right at the top of the stairs. The final armor is light blue plate.</p>

<p>You say, 'Hail, Kordian Keshalian' <br />
Kordian Keshalian says 'Good day Seerys, is there something I can help you with? I am currently training young paladins the way of our house so if you are a [paladin] perhaps we can start you off on the right path.' </p>

<p>You say, 'I am a paladin' <br />
Kordian Keshalian says 'Fantastic to hear young one. There are many that pass through these halls with the willingness to learn the ways of the Sentinel, but few that complete their training. If you feel you can handle it and are [interested in creating your own armor] simply say so.' </p>

<p>You say, 'I am interested in creating my own armor.' <br />
Kordian Keshalian says 'All right then Seerys, lets see what you got. When you are ready to begin I will send you into the field to collect [various items]. ' </p>

I will present you with the recipe for Sentinel [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. When you are ready to attempt a specific piece please let me know what piece you wish to [craft] and I will give you the necessary mold along with the recipe.' </p>
