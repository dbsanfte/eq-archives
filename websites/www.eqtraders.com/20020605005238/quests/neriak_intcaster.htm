            <h3> Unholy Sillk - Neriak INT Caster Armor Quests</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of many new race- and class-specific armor quests. 
              The resultant armor is for dark elven INT casters only, and is no 
              drop. The tailoring combines are no fail. There are reports that 
              some of the combines may still be bugged (sandals require sleeves 
              piece, etc.), but I've yet to have anyone verify if things are working 
              properly after the last couple of patches)</i></p>
            <p>The enchanter/mage/wizzie npc is in the middle of the entrance 
              room in the Spurned Guildhouse... this is what he says (to a necro):</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen'</p>
            <p>Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Who dares to address me while I am 
              clearly busy reviewing my daily research. I sure hope this is important 
              Legion, I do not have time to waste on just any initate of House 
              Spurned. Not a single day goes by that I do not come face to face 
              with cannon fodder that is not even worthy of a headstone in our 
              burial grounds. If you wish to [prove yourself] then I might be 
              in a generous mood. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i wish to prove myself'</p>
            <p>Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'I must admit this is not the first 
              time I have heard someone say that nor will it be the last, however 
              I am wiling to give you a chance. First thing we will need to do 
              is get some clothes in your back if you wish to survive for any 
              amount of time. If you are a young Wizard, Enchanter or Magician 
              of House Spurned then I will present you with a [mystical sewing 
              kit]. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what mystical sewing kit'</p>
            <p>Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'The Mystical Sewing kit that I have 
              created is one that is able to fashion a material used for crafting 
              clothes worn by all Initates of House Spurned. All that is required 
              are Cloaks worn by Lightwalkers that plague our Forest to this very 
              day. If you are to take my task and seek vegenence on this inferior 
              group of Arcane lightwalkers you will pride your house along with 
              gathering one of the [key ingredients] for your armor. I have heard 
              rumor that they have tried to generate some kind of magic from a 
              source shrouded by our forest. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what key ingredients'</p>
            <p>Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'You will be given different combination 
              recipes for whichever armor piece you wish to craft. You will combine 
              the specific items in the Mystical Sewing Kit that I will give to 
              you when you are ready. After you have combined the correct items 
              in your sewing kit you will fashion together a Bloodstained Cloth 
              of the Spurned. At that time you will put the pattern that I will 
              give you for each armor piece you request in the loom along with 
              this cloth to craft your Armor piece. I will also suggest that you 
              craft your Breastplate last due to the difficulty of obtaining the 
              items. Do you [understand] the instructions I have given you? '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i understand'</p>
            <p>Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Very well Legion, here is your Mystical 
              sewing kit. I have the patterns and recipes necessary to craft Spurned 
              Initiate [Skullcaps], [Bracers], [Sandals], [Sleeves], [Trousers], 
              [Gloves} and [Robes]. When you feel you are ready to gather the 
              items necessary to craft your armor simply tell me which piece you 
              want to craft. The items that you will need to collect will mostly 
              be found in the Forest but some will be here in town. As I said 
              before seek out the Arcane Lightwalkers to collect the cloaks that 
              you will need to make the armor materials. I look forward to seeing 
              what you will make of this opportunity.'</p>
            <p>I can't get him to respond to what the recipes are, probably because 
              of being a necro. In the necro hall, all the way up top in the room 
              with the row of bloody tables is a necro version of this:</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Talorial D`Estalian'</p>
            <p>Talorial D`Estalian says 'On what grounds do you think you are 
              welcome to address me like that vermin? I am afraid you will have 
              to prove yourself to me before I can treat you with any respect. 
              Do you feel that you are [worthy] to stand before me? '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i am worthy'</p>
            <p>Talorial D`Estalian says 'Very well then, you are lucky that I 
              have been looking for some sort of an apprentice to help me out 
              in gathering some hides from those nasty halflings. I did have a 
              young one as yourself working for me before but unfortunately they 
              didn't work out as you can see by looking at this autopsy table. 
              I would hope that you will complete my [tasks], for your sake. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i will complete your tasks'<br>
              You say, 'what tasks'</p>
            <p>Talorial D`Estalian says 'If you are willing to [gather some items] 
              that are needed for specific halfling hides I can offer you with 
              the resources necessary to fashion your own armor. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i will gather some items'</p>
            <p>Talorial D`Estalian says 'Excellent Legion. Please take this Old 
              Enchanted Tailors Kit. It contains magical power that is able to 
              fashion specific components into a magical version of whatever the 
              core material is. If you are a Necromancer you will need to gather 
              halfling hides that have been infused with many different elements 
              that you will collect and combine in this box. Simply tell me what 
              pattern you [want] and I will present you with the recipe necessary 
              for [Gloves], [Robe], [Trousers], [Sleeves], [Skullcap], [Bracers] 
              and [slippers]. I would recommend you fashion your Robe last due 
              to the difficulty and complex nature that is involved with finding 
              the items necessary. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want a glove recipe'</p>
            <p>Talorial D`Estalian says 'If you are interested in making your 
              own Unholy Silk Gloves you will need to gather 3 Halfling Hides, 
              2 Snake Eggs, 2 Spiderling Silks and a Cask which can be found in 
              town. '</p>
            <p>Completed gloves are AC 2, INT 2, mana 2, wt 0.9</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want a robe recipe'</p>
            <p>Talorial D`Estalian says 'Your Unholy Silk Gown is your most important 
              and symbolic item you that will be able to craft on your own. I 
              would recommend that you have already gone through the steps of 
              crafting your other pieces before your Gown. If you think that you 
              are ready you will need to collect 4 Halfling Hides, 1 Black Wolf 
              Pelt, 2 Embalming Dusts, 1 Halfling Toe, 1 Bear Meat and 1 Fish 
              Wine. Combine all of these in your box to create the Infused hide 
              used with the Robe pattern to fashion your Gown. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want a trouser recipe'</p>
            <p>Talorial D`Estalian says 'To make your own Unholy Silk Trousers 
              you will need to collect many items in the forest along with a few 
              in town. The halfling hide that you will need along with a pattern 
              to craft together these Trousers will need to be infused with 4 
              Halfling Hides, 2 Bone Chips, 3 Spiderling Silks and 1 Raw Bamboo. 
              All of these items will be collected in the field with the exception 
              of the Raw Bamboo which can be bought in town. '</p>
            <p>Completed trousers are AC 4, CHA 1, INT 2, mana 2, wt 1.5</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want a sleeve recipe'</p>
            <p>Talorial D`Estalian says 'If you wish to fashion together your 
              own Unholy Silk Sleeves you will need to gather 3 Halfling Hides, 
              1 Fire Beetle Leg, 4 Bone Chips and 2 bandages. Once you have collected 
              these items combine them in the Old Enchanted box to fashion your 
              Infused halfling hide. Return to me when you are ready for the Sleeve 
              Pattern. '</p>
            <p>Completed sleeves are AC 3, INT 1, mana 2, wt 0.7</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want a skullcap recipe'</p>
            <p>Talorial D`Estalian says 'In order to fashion your own Unholy Silk 
              Skullcap you will need to collect a few things and then combine 
              them in the kit I presented you with earlier. Gather 1 Halfling 
              Hide, 2 Deathfist Scouts Scalp and a bottle of Red Wine. After you 
              have done this you will receive an Infused Halfling Hide. Return 
              to me then and ask for your [Skullcap pattern] and I will present 
              you with the pattern necessary to craft your Skullcap. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want a bracer recipe'</p>
            <p>Talorial D`Estalian says 'To make your own Unholy Silk Bracer you

              Snake Egg. Combine all of the items that you have collected and

              Silk Sandals you will need to collect a few things in order to fashion 
              the applicable hide in your Old Enchanted Box. You will need to 
              gather 2 Halfling Hides, 2 Fire Beetle Eyes and 2 Malachites. Once

            <p>Note: he mentions a &quot;final task&quot;. Quest text not available 
              at this time, but it requires obtaining 3 different orc chief prayer 
              beads, and results in a Dagger of the Spurned Initiate, dam 5, delay 
              25, int 2, mana 20, primary hand piercer.</p>
