            <h3>Dismal Priest Armor - Freeport Evil (Innnoruuk) Cleric Quest</h3>
            <p>This is one of several armor quests for younglings that was recently 
              added. This one is for evil Freeport human clerics, and is HUM/CLR, 
              Innoruuk, no drop and lore (other than bracer). <i>Please note that 
              while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, 
              so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second 
              one</i></p>
            <p>Questgiver is Zhem Xecia in East FP tunnel. The &quot;Dismal Priest&quot; 
              armor is a matte dark rust color of fine plate, and the helm has 
              little horns near the forehead.</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Zhem Xecia' </p>
            <p>Zhem Xecia says 'What is it maggot? I have only time for new clerics 
              who have chosen to [serve the Dismal Rage]. If you are looking for 
              meaningless banter, than I suggest you find a bar wench.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I serve the Dismal Rage' </p>
            <p>Zhem Xecia says 'The clerics of the Dismal Rage must be strong 
              and familiar with battle. There are many beings across Norrath who 
              oppose our deity and our dogma. Take this note to Jerra Renlock 
              and she will aid you in obtaining a suit of armor to protect you 
              from the physical threats of our enemies and the creatures of the 
              wild. Once you have been properly outfitted return to me and will 
              offer you [further instruction].' </p>
            <p>Jerra Renlock is outside the building, near neg 314, neg 334. Hand 
              her the note. </p>
            <p>Jerra Renlock says 'Ah, so Zhem wants me to assist you with some 
              armor. You will surely need it if you are an associate of the likes 
              of him. This Mail Assembly Kit will be needed for you to construct 
              your armor. The materials required depend on the armor section you 
              plan to construct. Do you plan to construct a [dismal priest helm], 
              a [dismal priest bracer], [dismal priest gauntlets], [dismal priest 
              boots], [dismal priest vambraces], [dismal priest greaves], or a 
              [dismal priest breastplate].' <br>

            You say, 'I plan to construct a dismal priest bracer' 
            <p>Jerra Renlock says 'To assemble a Dismal priest Mail Bracer you 
              will need to obtain a brick of crude iron and smelt it in a [forge] 
              with a Water Flask and this Crude Bracer Mold. Once that is done, 
              combine the Crude Iron Bracer with a Ruined Coyote Pelt and a Sand
