              friend in Freeport. It was stolen from me not too long ago when 
              I had to venture towards Crushbone to help a new recruit like yourself. 
              The Orc that stole it from me was quite fast, most definitely a 
              scout. The vile beast did not stick around for it knew they could 
              not best me in combat. Therefore I had no chance to retrieve my 
              lute or to seek revenge. Will you retrieve my lute for me Dobbila?'</P>

              Jawbones to prove that you are united with us in our war against 
              the vile orcs. I hope to see you soon.'
