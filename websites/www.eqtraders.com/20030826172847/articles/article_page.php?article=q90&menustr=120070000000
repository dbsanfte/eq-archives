<span class="headers">Ak`Anon Bertoxx Cleric  (Plague Raiser) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many youngling armor quests based out of Ak'Anon. It is meant specifically for young gnome clerics that worship Bertoxx. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i> 
</p>
<p>
Similar structure to the other evil melee class-specific quests - you get a parchment from the quest giver (Derthix Gibblix) which you have to give to a secondary NPC (Glerbella Gibblix), who will then give you a kit (a Mail Assembly Kit, exactly the same one as the evil warrior, rogue and shadowknight kits, and LORE so you can't get one of each). Glerbella will then tell you the recipe for each item and give you a mold (Crude [xxx] Mold) when prompted. These molds appear to be exactly the same items as the evil warrior/shadowknight Crude [xxx] Molds (i.e. they're interchangeable). The primary quest giver gives out the class-specific weapon quest.
</p>
<p>
Your Location is 2066.76, -453.64, -182.06, in Ak'Anon.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Derthix Gibblix'
</p>
<p>
Derthix Gibblix says 'Greetings Genumkin. It is my duty to train young gnomes that have been called to they ways of Bertoxxulous, the Plague Bringer, and wish to [serve as a cleric] of the Dark Reflection. The faithful of the Plague Bringer are gifted with the sight of the Dark Reflection. The ability to recognize the importance of the powerful forces of disease and decay, and the role they play in the cycles of deterioration and renewal, death and life, destruction and creation.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i serve as a cleric'
</p>
<p>
 Derthix Gibblix says 'We have been blessed by Bertoxxulous with the vision of the Dark Reflection. We are the prophet and protectors of all who serve the Plague Bringer and have devoted our lives to spreading disease and decay for the glory of Bertoxxulous and the balances that must be maintained. Take this parchment to Glerbella Gibblix, she will assist you with the construction of a suit of armor to aid in protecting you from the weapons of those who would see us destroyed. When you have been properly outfitted return to me for your [next task].'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what next task?'
</p>
<p>
 Derthix Gibblix says 'We faithful of Bertoxxulous are misunderstood even by the majority of the gnomes of Ak'Akanon. The Eldrich Collective and the Deep Muses would have us chased from the Mines of Malfunction and exiled from these lands. They are not gifted with the vision of the Dark Reflection and thus are blind to the necessity of our actions. In the Steamfont Mountains you will find a Cleric of the Deep Muses, Vyntok Bonkle. Vyntok has been aiding others of our enemies in their mission to eliminate the Dark Reflection from Ak'Anon. Find Vyntok and slay him. When you have accomplished this task return to me with Vyntok's Mace.'
