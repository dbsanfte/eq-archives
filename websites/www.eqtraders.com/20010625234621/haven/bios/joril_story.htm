      <p align="CENTER"><b><u><font face="Verdana">Wolf of Everfrost – The Beginning</font></u></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Dawn broke upon 
        the barren wastelands of Everfrost. Stunted trees dotted the landscape, 
        twisted and bare. Everything is stark white as far as the eye can see, 
        with an occasional spot of brown that betrayed the presence of dirt beneath 
        the blanket of snow and ice. Wolves fought with each other for the feeding 
        rights to a half-frozen corpse. A roar echoed through the hills and they 
        quickly scampered away. A massive white bear arrived and settled the wolves' 
        squabble. It glared menacingly at the wolves, daring them to dispute its 
        claim. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A dark creature shuffled 
        along quickly, dodging from shadow to shadow trying to avoid the light 
        of the coming day. It paused to snuffle at the air, trying to locate the 
        scent of its quarry. It grunted to itself and resumed its course, giving 
        the bear a wide berth. The creature gripped the shaft of the shortened 
        spear tightly, feeling it's unfamiliar length. Short, squat and bad tempered, 
        considered by others of its kind as a sort of runt. Yet by human standards, 
        it was quite powerful. Its long arms bulged with corded muscles. Its hands, 
        strong enough to crush a man's skull, end in hard sharp nails. But most 
        fearsome of all, was its mouthful of sharp teeth, made to rend flesh and 
        its powerful jaw that could crack bone and suck out the sweet marrow within. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A trumpeting sound 
        erupted from further ahead. The orc dropped into a defensive crouch, its 
        eyes darted frantically back and forth, scanning the hills and gullies 
        around him, looking for signs of an attack. Satisfied that nothing immediately 
        threatened it, it moved forward slowly toward a small hill. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Below the hill lay 
        a flat, open area. A hairy, four legged creature with immense tusks and 
        of massive proportions was besieged by a hunting party of large humans. 
        They were clad in furs, wielding an assortment of weapons. Each and every 
        one wore a head covering made from the head of a great white bear, signifying 
        they were from the nearby town of Halas. The orc's lips curled back in 
        a snarl as he gazed upon these most hated of foes of his kind. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The hunters, bent 
        on the task at hand, did not noticed the head peering at them from over 
        the rise. They had spent two days tracking this great beast. The party 
        had encircled the mammoth when it had stopped to forage. Working methodically 
        as a group, they kept the beast constantly turning to defend itself. Every 
        time it would turn, a pair of hunters would rush in from its rear, stabbing 
        with spears or slashing at its legs with axes or great two-handed swords. 
        The mammoth would wheel to defend itself, unwittingly placing its rear 
        quarter to the pair it had just faced. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This continued for 
        what seemed an eternity to the orc. The beast wheeled and the humans attacked. 
        Finally, a hunter, larger than the rest, rushed in and with one mighty 
        slash of its sword, it cut deep into the mammoth's neck and struck the 
        deathblow. The others pulled back, knowing that it would only be a matter 
        of time now. The hunter calmly wiped his blade on his cloak. A female 
        of the party stepped to his side and gave him a quick kiss, then smiling, 
        she turned to attend to those that had been injured by the mammoth. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Culbarth, as the 
        great hunter was known to his people, watched Edrian at work. He smiled 
        as he remembered the day they had first met. He always marveled at her 
        skill as she mended the huntsmen's' wounds. Quietly speaking to each person, 
        she bandaged wounds or murmured a prayer to the spirits to guide her hand 
        if the wound was too serious for bindings. He shook himself from his reverie 
        and turned to a young boy near him. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Joril, you and 
        Nroth, run back to Halas. Fetch more clansmen to help us carry the meat 
        home."</i> barked Culbarth. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Aye, father,"</i> 
        Joril replied. He and Nroth quickly gathered their packs and weapons. 
        Joril stopped and said good bye to his mother Edrian. Then the pair ran 
        off across the tundra in the direction of Halas. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Culbarth watched 
        Joril as he dwindled in the distance. He felt concern for his son and 
        Nroth. They had found signs that orcs were becoming more active than usual. 
        He also felt a sense of foreboding. He hoped the two would be safe. Then 
        he turned and surveyed the remaining party. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Come. We must 
        be quick about this,"</i> he said. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The rest of the party 
        quickly set about to dressing the kill and quartering it. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The orc had gone 
        unnoticed this whole time. It watched two scrawny humans run off. The 
        wretched things go for help it mused to itself. The smell of blood hung 
        heavy in the air and it began to whine from hunger. It began to drool 
        at the thought of all that meat down there, enough to feed his clan for 
        weeks. The little orc was so lost in its thoughts; it failed to notice 
        the form creeping up behind it. Huge arms reached out for the orc and 
        snatched him up roughly, a massive paw clamped over its mouth; the other 
        arm pinned the little creature. It struggled and squirmed. A low threatening 
        snarl sounded in its ear and it immediately went limp, soiling itself 
        at the sound of that snarl.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> The figure tossed 
        the pitiful little orc down the hill in disgust. Recovering, it scampered 
        to a boulder and sat rocking itself, quaking with fear and shame. The 
        figure then turned and looked down on the humans. It was a head shorter 
        than the hunters and bore necklaces of teeth and bone, clothed in the 
        pelt of an arctic wolf. The shaman made a gesture and another dressed 
        like it appeared by its side. More forms came from the shadows, two hulking 
        mountaineers and four troopers. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Quietly, the orcs 
        positioned themselves, and then the shaman began a guttural incantation. 
        Flicks of green energy began to swirl from its hands and around its body. 
        The other shaman began to utter another spell, surrounding itself with 
        flickering blue flame, beginning to focus the energy at a hunter below. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The air around Androth 
        began to glow green, stinking of ozone. He looked around in bewilderment 
        for a moment, and then realization hit him like a hammer. His eyes grew 
        wide and he yelled, <i>"Orc Shaman!"</i> He started reaching for his axe 
        but he found he could not move his legs. It was as if he were rooted to 
        the ground. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Culbarth reacted 
        swiftly, snatching up the giant sword he had laid aside to skin the carcass. 
        Edrian immediately began to cast a spell of her own, glistening shards 
        of ice beginning to whirl about her body. Galron readied his halberd, 
        preparing for an assault he knew would be coming. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The mountaineers 
        and troopers ran down the hillside, howling in glee. One mountaineer's 
        howl of glee turned to one of pain as Edrian directed the ice at him. 
        Shards sliced open his skin, piercing through his hide armor, momentarily 
        blinding him. The others continued to charge. A shaman loosed its spell 
        on Galron, who suddenly felt very weary. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Culbarth knew there 
        was no way they could stand and fight these things. He bellowed for them 
        to fall back. Edrian began to cast another spell. She screamed in surprise 
        and agony as her body was surrounded by flames, burning her skin and clothing. 
        Her spell forgotten, she fell to the snow in an attempt to put out the 
        fire. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Galron's eyelids 
        drooped. <i>"Noooooo!"</i> he raged within his mind, willing himself to 
        remain alert. As he reopened his eyes, two troopers hit him at the same 
        time, pummeling him, knocking him senseless. He managed to strike a mortal 
        blow to one of the troopers. A mighty blow to the side of his head crushed 
        his skull and Galron fell limply to the ground. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Androth swung his 
        axe back and forth. Tears of anger and frustration at his inability to 
        move streamed down his face. An orc in its zealousness, stepped too close 
        to him. With a satisfying thunk, he cleanly separated the orc's head from 
        its body. As he twisted his torso to find another foe, a spear tip exploded 
        out of his chest. He glanced down at it in surprise. <i>"Well blimey"</i> 
        he thought, then he collapsed in a grotesque position. His legs still 
        rooted upright in place, his torso bent in an awkward fashion. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The mountaineer that 
        was the victim of Edrian's spell charged at her, howling with rage. He 
        stumbled and fell, his left leg missing from mid-thigh. It bellowed in 
        pain and fury, he rolled over in time to see Culbarth reverse his grip 
        on his sword and plunge it straight down into his chest, sending him to 
        Innoruuk's open arms. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Edrian climbed shakily 
        to her feet. She was horrified by the fury of the orcs assault. She began 
        to cast a spell of healing on her husband. Then called upon the spirits 
        to lend him strength.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Gate Edrian!&quot;</i> 
        bellowed Culbarth. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"I will not leave 
        ye"</i> she screamed in reply. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Gate damn ye! 
        For Joril and Calamon and Sanu! And for all of Halas, GATE!"</i> She knew 
        he was right. She began to utter the words to open a portal to Halas. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Culbarth swung at 
        a trooper and missed. He allowed the momentum to carry him around and 
        he kicked out with his foot, catching the orc squarely in the chest and 
        knocked it over. Then he swung his sword in a high overhead, cleaving 
        another trooper almost in half. Culbarth was consumed with fury and desperation. 
        He fought like a madman. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The two orc shaman 
        on the hill began to utter more incantations. The air around Culbarth 
        began to freeze, particles of frost formed into thin needles of ice. Whirling 
        about him, blinding him. More frost formed into an ice spear and hurtled 
        at him. The spear of ice buried itself deep into his chest and knocked 
        him off of his feet. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Swirls of lavender 
        surrounded Edrian as the portal began to take shape. Seeing this, the 
        remaining mountaineer grabbed a warhammer from its belt and hurled it 
        with a mighty heave at her. The portal finished forming and she stepped 
        through it. Then the portal closed and vanished. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All was quiet for 
        a moment. The little orc that had been near the boulder snuck forward 
        and began to loot the corpses of the hunters. He howled in pain as the 
        mountaineer vented his rage on the little scout, furious that his quarry 
        had escaped him. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The two shaman looked 
        at each other and began to grunt in their own language, turning from the 
        carnage they had wrought. Finally, the remaining mountaineer, trooper 
        and scout, collected the loot and what meat they could carry and marched 
        off to their cave. </font></p>
      <hr>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Teria O'Danos had 
        a small vending stall near the gates of Halas. She sold various items, 
        mainly food and the occasional 'treasures' of adventurers and hunters. 
        The sound of thunder drew her attention to the docks. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Wonder who's 
        gating here"</i> she thought to herself. A figure materialized before 
        the docks, burned, battered and bloody. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Edrian!"</i> 
        she gasped and ran towards her friend. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Orc …war …party!"</i> 
        Edrian managed to croak. Guards and fellow clansmen converged on her. 
        A warhammer suddenly materialized behind Edrian and struck her in the 
        back of the head. She collapsed lifelessly to the ground. Shaman throughout 
        the city grasped their heads and screamed in agony. Visions of orcs ripping 
        apart the hunting party flashed through their minds. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Margyn McGennis, 
        guild Second of the Shamans Guild, gasped <i>"My mistress!"</i> and then 
        fainted. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Out on the tundra, 
        Joril and Nroth ran on towards Halas, oblivious of the death and destruction 
        behind them. Joril stumbled and fell to his knees. Nroth laughed and turned 
        to look at his friend. His laughter abruptly died in his throat as he 
        was assailed with the same images. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Tunare have mercy!"</i> 
        gasped a horrified Nroth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Tears streamed down 
        Joril's face. <i>"I must go back!"</i> he said. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Are ye daft?"</i> 
        replied Nroth. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"I must help him,"</i> 
        cried Joril. He then turned to began stumbling back the way they had just 
        come. Nroth tackled him and sat on his chest.</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"Get off a me!"</i> 
        screamed Joril. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>"NO! Think Joril. 
        What can we do? Those things would surely kill us too. Who would look 
        after Calamon and little Sanu?" </i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Joril went limp with 
        sorrow. Nroth helped his friend to his feet and together the stumbled 
        on towards Halas. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Quiet descended upon 
        the plains. Wolves cautiously approached the mammoth carcass and the corpses. 
        They squabbled with each other over feeding rights. A loud roar resounded 
        from the hills. The wolves scattered as a giant white bear appeared and 
        settled the argument for them. The bear glared at them threateningly, 
        daring them to dispute its claim. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The cold, stark landscape 
        grew dark as the day faded. Long shadows covered the ground and the grisly 
        scene. Short stunted trees bore silent witness to what had transpired 
        in this barren wasteland called Everfrost. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And somewhere, a 
        young boy began on his path to bring vengeance to the orcs. </font></p>
