<p>This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.</p>
<p>The completion of this quest will allow you to progress to pottery skill 54, without spending any money. It will also allow you to learn how to process the chunk of broken taelosian stone worker into a clump of refined taelosian clay, which is used in one new pottery recipe.</p>
<p>Speak with Malkidiv U`Ycionuz in the hold of the Queen of Thorns to begin this quest.</p>
<p><b>Quick Summary</b>:<br>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Malkidiv U`Ycionuz'</p>
<p>Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says ''Hello.  Thanks for stopping by.  Are you, by chance, interested in helping me with some of the more [menial tasks] I have to get done around here?''</p>
<p>You say, 'menial tasks?'</p>
<p>Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says ''Well, I am responsible for keeping the ship stocked with plates, pots and other simple supplies, but with all of the research I'm working on and my experiments with the amazing local [clay], I just don't have time to keep up.  Wayfarers are notoriously hard on dinnerware.  Can you [help] me out?  And if you have any spare clumps of refined ancient clay, please speak with Hiloan, she needs help making some of the more complicated items used on the ship.''</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STEP ONE: Wayfarer Plate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'help'</p>
<p>Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says ''Great!  We've discovered that this new clay makes wonderfully durable plates.  Of course, there's no point in making durable plates, that's just a challenge to these people to try to break them.  But with this clay we can make thinner plates that are just as strong and take up less room.  Here, take these bits of broken plates and this bonding agent and re-fire the plates.  Bring them back to me as soon as you can.  I'm grateful for the help.  If you can keep helping me out, I might be willing to share with you our secret method for refining the golem clay.''</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then gives you enough materials to make 20 Wayfarer Plates.  Combine them in a kiln and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 100 Wayfarer Plates, when he will move on to step two.</p>
<p>STEP TWO:  Wayfarer Pot</p>
<blockquote>
<P>You say, 'help'</p>
<p>Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Excellent.  You're obviously too talented to be wasted fixing plates.  We could use a lot of pots.  Our cooks are just as clumsy as our patrons.  Take these pot molds and these Wayfarers pot molds and blocks of clay and fire them in a kiln.  I can use a lot of these things, we use them for storage, cooking, breaking over heads... all the usual stuff.  We don't need quality here, just quantity.  Bring them back to me quickly, we'll run out soon.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then gives you enough materials to make 20 Wayfarer Pots.  Combine them in a kiln and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 100 Wayfarer Pots, when he will move on to step two.</p>
<p>STEP THREE: Wayfarer Mug</p>
<blockquote>
<P>You say, 'help'</p>
<p>Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Wonderful! You are certainly good at working with the kiln, and you've been a great help to me. I have a somewhat more complicated task to be done, if you have the time. We go through mugs here faster than an ogre goes through chcolate.Take this clay and these flasks of water and turn them on the pottery wheel until you have something resembling a mug. Handles would be helpful, but are not necessary. Then take the unfired mug and these Wayfarer seals and carefully fire them in the kiln. Don't worry these seals are stamped into a tough sea serpent skin, they wont burn. bring me the mugs when your done'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then gives you enough materials to make 20 Unfired Wayfarer Mugs, plus materials to turn those into 20 Wayfarer Mugs.  Combine the clay and water in a pottery wheel and then each of those results with a seal in a kiln.  Turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 100 Wayfarer Mugs, when he will move on to step four.</p>
<p>STEP FOUR: Wayfarer Arrow Shaft</p>
<blockquote>
<P>You say, 'help'</p>
<p>Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'Fantastic! You have been a great service to the Wayfarer Brotherhood. If you can help me with the next task, I'd be willing to give out one of the Wayfarer's's trade secrets. This task requires more effort and skill than those i been asking you to do. Some of our Scouts use ceramic shafts for their arrows. these require some skill to make properly and have to be well made. I can't just trust just anyone to make them. Take this clay, these flasks of water and this special dye and use the pottery wheel to form them into unfired shafts. Then, take these molds and fire the shafts. The dye is important, as each of our scouts like to have their own colors on the shafts. Something about competing over who kills the most enemies or something like that.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then gives you enough materials to make 20 Unfired Wayfarer Arrow Shafts, plus materials to turn those into 20 Wayfarer Arrow Shafts.  Combine the clay, dye, and water in a pottery wheel and then each of those results with a mold in a kiln.  Turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 100 Wayfarer Arrow Shafts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Malkidiv U`Ycionuz says 'You've been a great help already.  I'd feel very guilty asking you to help out any further.  There are others that can do that work for us.  For all of your efforts, I'd be honored to teach you the secret of refining chunks of broken stone worker into refined Taelosian clay and chunks of broken ancient stone worker into refined ancient Taelosian clay.'  Malkidiv pulls a small text from his coat and leans forward to show you a few of the pages.  What he shows you seems amazingly simple once you've seen it.  You think that with practice you might be able to get better results than Malkidiv gives to those that he refines clay for.  Just place a single chunk of broken Taelosian stone worker onto a pottery wheel and you will receive clump of refined Taelosian clay.'</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>You now have the ability to turn Chunk of Broken Taelosian Stone Worker into Clump of Refined Taelosian Clay in a pottery wheel, as well as Chunk of Broken Ancient Stone Worker into Clump of Refined Ancient Taelosian Clay.
