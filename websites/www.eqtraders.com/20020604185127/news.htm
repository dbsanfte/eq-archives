                  Lo and behold, when I logged on this morning, there was a patch 
                  message! Nothing was mentioned about the Butcherblock HQ ore 
                  vendors, or about the hilt mold vendors, but mention was made 
                  of the <a href="location/bazaar.htm">Bazaar water and HQ ore 
                  vendors</a>. Early reports are back from someone who purchased 
                  150 large bricks before the Bazaar merchant ran out, and &quot;about 
                  300 or so&quot; small bricks, and the merchant had still not 
                  run out. This is happy news indeed for our smiths! And yes,

                    we'll ever know for sure, but there are a lot of hopeful smiths

                  it was mentioned in the patch, we've been unable to find any

                  made it into the patch was the HQ ore vendor in Qeynos. I'd

                  My cable connection is less than reliable right now (@home), 
                  and our &quot;backup&quot; DSL isn't quite happy, so I've been 
                  trying to do a bit of offline work with the information I have 
                  available on my hard drive (and in my overloaded memory). Several 
                  hours after I wrote this initial update, I've finally got enough 
                  of a DSL connection to publish all the pages I've worked on 
                  today ... barely. Hopefully by tomorrow things will have stabilized 
                  a bit, and we'll have full net access once again.</font></p>

                  It will take a while for me to get the button onto all the pages, 
                  and for the page to include all the Shar Vahl class quests, 
                  etc., but it's starting to shape up a bit. (I'm always looking

                  So, if you don't find a recipe that you saw here, look a bit 
                  more closely at the proper tradeskill recipe pages. (Hint for

                  that, for one reason or another, we can't seem to get working

                  that were reported in as bugged, and we've not yet realized

                  now stacking as promised and the recipes are yielding 2 rings

                  Yesterday I spent a couple hours (while our houseguest was still 
                  asleep) doing a bit more merchant re-verification. <a href="location/felwithe.htm">Felwithe</a> 
                  looks a lot better now for tradeskills, but I'm still not sure

                  If folks find any updates/corrections, please provide details

                  I've got a couple pieces of email from wonderful folks to tackle 
                  that contain more details regarding Luclin tradeskill quests, 
                  and I'll be updating <a href="quests/luclin.htm">that quest

                  time, but hopefully it will be worth it. After I get done with 
                  that, then I'll be going back to beating on things that still 
                  need tackling from message board posts, and also doing some 
                  final straightening on the <a href="secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">Luclin

                  It's very slow going, but I'm starting a page that will detail 
                  the various <a href="quests/luclin.htm">Luclin tradeskill quests</a>, 
                  and am cross-linking recipes from the <a href="secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">Luclin 
                  recipes page</a> over to it as I get the appropriate details 
                  in place. As always, I'm worried more about the accuracy of 
                  the information before I worry about making it &quot;pretty&quot; 
                  and so forth. I should be adding quite a bit to both these pages 
                  over the next couple weeks, so for those of you interested in 
                  saving a few trees, I'd recommend not printing them out until 
                  just before you're going to need them, otherwise your printouts 
                  will likely need to be replaced at least a dozen times per week. 
                  Once I'm fairly certain that the majority of the information 
                  is on these pages, and correct, I'll start splitting the recipes 
                  off onto the appropriate tradeskill pages, and will clean up 
                  the quests page. I'll get to further merchant re-verification 
                  in the Old World once I take a much-needed nap ... hopefully 
                  it will help me recover from yesterday's flight chaos as well

                  The December 20 patch, which advertised some tradeskill changes, 
                  may not have had as many tradeskill changes as we thought. At 
                  least some of the rings (such as some of the quality rings) 
                  are reported as still not stacking. Other reports state that 
                  bait and fishing flies are not able to be equipped in the ammo 
                  slot, as advertised, and if there is a bonus to the fishing 
                  skill available from player-made fishing flies, it's not yet 
                  visible. On the positive side, new tradeskill merchants have 
                  been added in several spots, and now that I'm back from traveling, 
                  I'll be doing more zone verification to make sure we catch them 
                  all. (I spent time in <a href="location/halas.htm">Halas</a> 
                  this morning, and those trade supply location pages should be 
                  updated.)</font></p>

                  I won't guarantee a happy mood, thanks to information that one 
                  of my regulars found in the pit of chaos that is usenet. Someone 
                  who apparently needs a clue-by-four as to the amount of time 
                  and expense that this site has cost me over the past two years 
                  of running it is slamming my chosen uses for donation money. 
                  Of course, if I'd NOT upgraded the memory on this dratted machine 
                  so that I could explore Luclin and verify tradeskill information, 
                  I'm sure he/she would be complaining because I wasn't keeping 
                  the site &quot;current&quot;. I'd rather deal with my third 
                  nosebleed since getting off the airplane in the dark hours of 
                  last night, than go over to usenet right now, but for those 
                  of you following that particular thread, I'd actually rather 
                  NOT hear about what's going on with it. I'm having a hard enough 
                  time keeping up enthusiasm for all this at times, despite the 
                  other 99% of the folks around here who are the reason I've burnt 
                  myself out for the last 2 years doing this. I stopped counting 
                  all the things I've put in out-of-pocket over the last 2 years 
                  so that I could explore for the site and not crash at the drop 
                  of a hat, as well as all the web publishing and graphics editing 
                  tools, etc. (If not for the site, I'd not need half this junk, 
                  and I'd have been VERY happily retired from EQ months ago), 
                  I stopped counting the hours per week I've put into site research 
                  when I'd rather have been playing (but it is anywhere from 20-60 
                  hours PER WEEK, every week. Even while on &quot;holiday travel&quot; 
                  this past week, I put in over 10.) I stopped counting the fees 
                  for domain name registration, reimbursement for my OLD hosting 
                  provider when her fee schedule changed without warning before 
                  I could move the site, etc. I've lost count of the times that 
                  idjits have run through slamming my way of doing things, oft-times 
                  simultaneously making use of two years of hard work and stubborn 
                  redheaded research. None of them, of course, want to do the 
                  work that is required for pretty much solo-running a million-plus 
                  page hit per month site, plus mommy the mess that is the message 
                  boards (accounting for an added 10K hits per day on top of the 
                  site page hits), nor would they have payed for the first 6 months 
                  of CSC gold out of their own pockets, etc.</font></p>

                  of the week (even with a houseguest arriving tomorrow), in order 
                  to clean up a lot of this Luclin data that's been flooding in.
