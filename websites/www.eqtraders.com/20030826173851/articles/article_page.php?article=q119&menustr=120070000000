<span class="headers">Freeport Shadowknight (Dismal Knight) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Freeport. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, HUM/SHD only. Further details on stats and exact armor names are not yet available for this armor, but it's been reported as having a black plate graphic when worn. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
Hail Gunex Eklar in the underground guild area in East Freeport. He will give you a letter to take outside to Quan Nektogo in East Freeport (merchant NPC in pit outside). Give Quan the letter and he will give you a Mail Assembly Kit and instructions on making the newbie shadowknight armor.

Take this note to Quan Nektogo here in the eastern quarter of Freeport. He will aid you in the construction of your armor. When you are properly outfitted return to me and I will present you with an [important task].'

Gunex Eklar says 'It has come to our attention that a paladin of the Sentries of Passion, Raenna Griff, has been aiding sympathizers and wanted members of the Sentries of Passion and the Knights of Truth in the sewer tunnels beneath the western quarter of Freeport. The incompetent Freeport Militia has yet to capture these wanted followers of the Mar twins. We will wait for their capture no longer. Seek this Raenna Griff individual and slay her. I want her head presented to me this very night!' 
</p>
<p>
<i>note: There may be three extra NPCs that spawn with her, so be careful when you attack her.</i>
</p>
<p>
Gunex Eklar grins wickedly. 'It took you long enough. I wonder if the Militia will be able to identify the body minus its head. Take this Dull Dismal Long Sword and sharpen it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is accomplished deliver the Sharpened Dismal Long Sword and a Giant Rattlesnake Skin to Quan Nektogo. He will make the final preparations on your weapon.
