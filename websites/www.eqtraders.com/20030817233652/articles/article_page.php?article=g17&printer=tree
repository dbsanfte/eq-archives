Baking</p>
            
<p>Baking is the art of turning various items into edible food. Many of you may be thinking "but why not just buy food from the vendors?"</p>

<p>There are several reasons to pursue baked foods:</p>

<p><b>stats -</b> several player-baked foods now grant statistics (gained when the item is the first food item in your inventory).  These stat bonuses stack with all buffs, and can be a boon to those trying to eke out every point in a stat (or resist) that they can get</p>

<p><b>weight -</b> this is especially true for monks, since most baked goods weigh less (0.1) than most purchased foods</p>

<p><b>duration/yield </b>- you can make long-lasting foods (hearty meals, banquets, etc.), as well as make several of some items at a time</p>

<p><b>price</b> - since many of the items are scrounged from mob drops, 
relying on baked goods can save you money in the long run</p>

<p><b>satisfaction </b>- now, truly, which would you rather bite into, an iron ration, or a nice juicy steak off that mammoth you just killed? </p>

<p>If any of this has sparked your interest, or you're trying to raise your baking skill for a quest, read on! ...</p>
