<p>
This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.<p>
The completion of this quest will allow you to progress to jewelcraft skill 54. It will also allow you to learn how to process pale and shimmering nihilite, which are used in the GoD jewelcraft recipes.<p>
Speak with jewelcraft merchant Rilwind Sitnai, in the hold portion of the Queen of Thorns.<p>
<blockquote>You say, 'Hail, Rilwind Sitnai'
<p>Rilwind Sitnai says ''Greetings.'  Rilwind nods in greeting.  'We are busy here, and I have little time for pleasantries.  I can sell you supplies, if you have need.  Or perhaps you are here to [assist] me with my work?''
<p>You say, 'I will assist you'
<p>Rilwind Sitnai says ''I haven't the time to keep up with the needs of the Wayfarers, I have more urgent matters to attend to.  We have discovered a rare form of a relatively worthless mineral.  Some trauma seems to have affected the local ulexite, striating it, which has given it the unusual property of image transference, as well as imbuing it with some sort of magical properties.  I can only imagine the sort of magical and geologic upheaval that would be required to make these changes in ulexite!  I certainly would have been a dramatic experience.  Study of this material is my primary concern.  But I also have a duty to the Wayfarers Brotherhood.  If you could attend to some of my tasks, I would be grateful.  If you can relieve me of enough of these [tasks], I can continue my study of the [Shimmering Nihilite].''
<p>You say, 'what shimmering nihilite?'
<p>Rilwind Sitnai says ''Nihilite appears to have two forms.  The Pale Nihilite is relatively common.  Shimmering Nihilite is infused with crystals that make the usual milky color of the stone glimmer with specks of light.  It is truly beautiful.  But it is hard to find.  It seems to be concentrated in the interior of Taelosia.  If you can find Raw Shimmering Nihilite, I can prepare it for you.  In exchange, I will keep a small amount of it for my own work.''</blockquote>
Additional NPC text is not available at this time.<p>
Ignore, for now, the fact that Rilwind mentions shimmering nihilite. What he needs for questing is pale nihilite, which is obtained by giving the other jewelcraft vendor, Bansama, raw pale nihilite.<p> Once you have some pale nihilte, give him a single unit of it to start the quest. He will give you enough raw materials to make ten combines on an item that he needs. Combine the items, hand him the results, hand him another pale nihilite, and rinse and repeat until you've handed him 30 of the item. The next time that you hand him a pale nihilite after that, he will progress to step two.  Continue until you've completed all four of his tasks, and he will send you back over to Bansama to learn the process of converting the raw pale and shimmering nihilite into something that you can jewelcraft with.
