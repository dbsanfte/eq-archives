            <p class="headers">Of smithing and grime<a name="grime"></a> 
              and sweat...by Janus Xanathis, Necrobane (Tunare server)</p>
            <p>There are books you can read, and other documents to view that 
              can tell you HOW to use the skill of the hammer and the forge. I 
              am not going to do that today. What I am going to do is tell you 
              WHAT to make when your body is layered in sweat and grime, and the 
              smoke of the bellows is against your face. If you follow this plan, 
              you shall have the skill to create the armor that everyone wants, 
              in only as long as your gold holds true. For once you start selling 
              the armor... gold is not something you need to want for again.</p>
            <p>First off, let me tell you this. To walk on the road to become 
              a master of this skill requires much time, and a greater amount 
              of gold. Unlike skills such as baking, or jewelcraft, in which you 
              can start to recoup some of your gold loss at a lower skill, you 
              cannot do that with the hammer and the forge.</p>
            <p>How many people do you know of walking around town shouting for 
              skewers, or metal bits?</p>
            <p>Exactly.</p>
            <p>But as I said above, once you get the skill to start creating the 
              banded armor that sells so well, you will start to gain your gold 
              back, and you shall get many an order for more.</p>
            <p>With that said, what is the quickest road to gaining the skill 
              to become an armor-smith, you ask? Well, I shall tell you.</p>
            <p>The easiest jump, on the road to creating glorious armor, is to 
              save up your trainings for four levels. Once you have all twenty 
              trainings, dump them all into Smithing. Since you won't have the 
              skill to kill the monsters that have the loot that you can sell 
              for the amount of gold you'll need... until you are in the low teens... 
              saving up the trainings shouldn't be a problem.</p>
            <p>But, if for some reason, you need all of your trainings, there 
              are other ways to get to the twentieth level of skill.</p>
            <p>Two to be exact.</p>
            <p>You sharpen the rusty weapons that are taken from the dead hands 
              of monsters that hold them... or you make the metal bits that are 
              needed for some of the later items.</p>
            <p>I don't want to replace the part of the book, but, some basics 
              to know when you are doing anything with the forge.</p>
            <p>NEVER stack anything in it. If it calls for multiples of something 
              that stacks, put them in different slots.</p>
            <p>The last item you will always be placing in the forge, is a flask 
              of water. Hunting down madmen in the desert of Ro is a good way 
              to gain the huge amounts of water that you will need for this skill. 
              Whether you are making metal bits, or a banded helm... each step 
              of the way has a single flask of water as the last item to place 
              in the forge.</p>
            <p>Also, not matter if you succeed, or fail, when you are using the 
              forge ... All items you place in it will be lost. If you succeeded, 
              you will have the item you were creating. If you failed, you have 
              nothing, but some more skill on the road to becoming a hammer master.</p>
            <p>Once you have been ranked as having a skill of the twentieth level, 
              you will see the message that making the metal bits, or sharpening 
              the weapons is beneath you. It's quite uppity to tell you this, 
              but what it means is that you will gain no more learning from doing 
              these tasks. So, you now switch over to making a different item....</p>
            <p>A metal sheet.</p>
            <p>But can't you buy those, you ask? Why yes, you can, and they are 
              about the same price, if not lower, to buy then they are to make. 
              So when you are making the more difficult items that require the 
              sheets to make, simply buy the sheets, that way you don't have to 
              worry about the random failure in making them. BUT... they are the 
              easiest thing to make to get you up the ladder of skill at this 
              point. Making metal sheets will get you to rank fifty in smithy. 
              Again, you will fail, more then you succeed at first... and you 
              will make a LOT of sheets by the time you get to fifty. But a good 
              note is that you can sell them back to the vendors that you are 
              buying the parts that you need to make them from. You won't get 
              back all of your money... maybe half... maybe three quarters... 
              but it's still something back.</p>
            <p>Once you get to the level in which the metal sheets are gaining 
              you no skill... what should you make next?</p>
            <p>Banded Armor?</p>
            <p>Sadly... not yet. You can try... and you will fail... greatly. 
              And you may be able to make a piece every twenty or thirty tries. 
              But your learning will not go up that fast, and the money you will 
              loose will be insane.</p>
            <p>The next item that we go to create is the skewer. This is another 
              item in which you can sell it back to the vendor and you will make 
              some of your money back. At this point down the road of the hammer 
              and forge, you are spending quite a bit of money per item to create. 
              Skewers are not that bad, overall. Only a gold, or so, for each 
              mold, and then the amount it takes to make the metal bits you need, 
              and a single water. You don't get nearly that much back when you 
              sell them, but every little bit helps.</p>
            <p>How high can making skewers get you? I, myself, don't quite know. 
              As of this writing, I have been listed as having a skill of eighty 
              in smithy. It has yet to tell me that skewers are below my skill, 
              but I expect to see the message any time now. I shall update this 
              document when I find that information out.</p>
            <p>If you are at eighty... NOW are you going to try to make the banded 
              armor?</p>
            <p>Aye. You can.</p>
            <p>I, so far, have been able to make five banded helms, and two banded 
              shirts. The shirts I did at with my skill of eighty. Two tries per 
              shirt. I know I was lucky to only have a single failure per item. 
              But it goes to show you that having the patience to walk the long 
              road will pay off. With the going rate being about forty plat for 
              a shirt, if not more... You can see that even with a few failures 
              per item, you will be making your gold back, and more.</p>
            <p>Don't just worry about getting to the skill to make banded, and 
              stopping there. There are rumors around that smiths shall soon have 
              the ability to start to make plate, or a type of plate armor. I 
              have also heard that you are going to need a skill up around one 
              hundred and thirty, if not more, if you want to pull this off.</p>
            <p>All I can say is... start making your banded wares... and continue 
              to makethem.</p>
            <p>Also... out of any of the skills... none are as physically rewarding 
              as this one. Having spent hours over the hot coals, pounding away 
              with your hammer... and creating an item that will help save someone 
              from those extra slices and blows... is also a very good feeling 
              to have.</p>
            <p>Of course, so is feeling the weight of your purse after you just 
              sold off a full suit to someone.</p>
