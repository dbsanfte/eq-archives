<I>If there will be a Star Wars MMORPG it will be played by the same people
who plays Everquest. <BR>
We all know how it will be, won't we?</I>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
Luke tells the group: Lets pull some Tie-fighters<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Han tells the group: Sure!<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Leia tells the group: Hmm, shouldn't we go after the DeathStar itself?<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Han tells the group: No way! I'm not KoS with the empire yet, I need <BR>
to protect my faction.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Leia tells the group: You will be KoS with the empire soon enough<BR>
anyway, and the deathstar gives you a huge faction boost with the<BR>
rebels.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Han tells the group: Yeah, right. And citizens of Alderaan and a few<BR>
others. Who cares? I have enough faction with the rebels to do their<BR>
quests anyway.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Luke tells the group: Thats right, and I have even better faction, so <BR>
why should I care?<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Lando tells Leia: R U a RL female?
<P>
Leia tells Lando: Nope.
<P>
Chewie tells the group: I think we are in the entirely wrong place<BR>
anyway. Tie-fighters are very social and tends to train. They could<BR>
even train the deathstar itself on us. The Deathstar is not worth it<BR>
anyway. Some of us WILL die if we fight it, so its not worth the xp.
<P>
Chewie tells the group: Oh, Rooooarrr-Growl, by the way )
<P>
Leia tells the group: hehe
<P>
Kewlio tells Luke: U R a Jedi, huh? Plz come to Tattooine and gimme<BR>
some Jedi buffs and cash!
<P>
Lando tells the group: The deathstar actually DO drop a few nice items<BR>
sometimes, but you are much better of killing 50 stardestroyers and use<BR>
that loot to buy the deathstar-loot you want.
<P>
Luke tells the group: I have an idea! Lets go to cloud city and kill<BR>
some guards there.
<P>
Leia tells Luke: Hrmpf, Lando just asked me if Im a RL female. He<BR>
should have asked you instead darling...
<P>
Lando tells the group: Hmm, I have to stay in the background in that<BR>
case, I dont want to lose faction there. I'll show you the best ways<BR>
and keep you buffed, but I wont fire any shots myself. Is that ok with<BR>
everyone?
<P>
Luke tells Leia: Hehe, lets NOT tell him i'm your RL girlfriend, ok?
<P>
Kewlio tells Luke: Hello? Are you there?
<P>
Chewie tells the group: np.
<P>
Luke tells the group: Ok everyone! Off to cloud city then!
<P>
Leia tells the group: k
