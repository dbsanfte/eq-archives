            <p><i>(Note: This mini-article will be updated with new information 
              on <a href="../secrets/recipes_fishing.htm">fishing lures</a>, as 
              well as with details on how to fish from moving boats, in the near 
              future)</i></p>
            <p>Fishing is <b>the</b> easiest trade skill to master and the quickest 
              one to turn a profit. It also has the added benefit of being the 
              only trade skill you can avoid spending training points on, and 
              still be able to keep your learning/profit margin in the managable 
              ranges.</p>
            <p>Fishing can keep you fed. Fishing can earn you coins enough to 
              buy those spells or supplies you need in order to practice your 
              more difficult/costly trade skills.</p>
            <p>I highly recommend that everyone learn how to fish at one point 
              or another, unless you've found the secret to independent wealth!</p>
            <p>What do you need in order to fish? A fishing pole, some bait, a 
              couple open inventory spots in order to transport your booty to 
              the nearest shopkeeper, and a stream/river/lake or ocean to fish 
              in. The pole will cost you over 2 gold, and it can/will break on 
              you at some point, so be prepared for the need to replace it. The 
              bait will cost you a few copper per bait, and you'll need at least 
              one bait per fish you hope to catch.</p>
            <p>Make sure when you are trying to fish that your pole is held in 
              your melee weapon hand, that you're standing/sitting at the edge 
              of the water, and facing the water. (You can also meditate while 
              fishing, as long as you've equipped the pole in advance, and are 
              sitting on the shoreline.) Then just cast your line and wait for 
              the fish to bite. Cast. Wait. Cast. Wait. Eventually, you should 
              catch ... something. Remember that I mentioned something about "booty"? 
              Yep, that's right. There's more than just fish available in the 
              water. You can sometimes find fish scales and other oddities snagged 
              on your hook. Don't throw them away, as you can sell them to any 
              (NPC) merchant to add to your slowly growing profits. As you continue 
              to fish, your fishing skill should improve.</p>
            <p>When I had a couple hours of fishing under my belt, and about 20 
              ranks in fishing, I made a profit of over 6 gold in half an hour. 
              It's still a slow way to make money, but its relaxing and you're 
              unable/unwilling to hunt, it's a great way to earn some money.</p>
            <p>When you're done fishing for the day, stow that fishing pole and 
              some bait (or some extra coins) in the bank. You never know when 
              you're going to end up with your corpse on one continent, and yourself 
              on another continent with no gear, and no way to get to your corpse 
              without food and money. Being able to run to the bank and fish your 
              way into food and coins can make all the difference in the world.
