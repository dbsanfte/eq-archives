            </h3>
            <p><i>This quest originates in the top of the Plane of Knowledge Library, 
              with Aid Grimel. It requires advanced planar flags for PoP zones, 
              multiple tradeskills over 200 (exact requirements listed below) 
              and, of course, the Planes of Power expansion. At this time, the 
              quest has not been fully completed, so additional details will be 
              added to this page as they become available. Discussion of this 
              quest can be found <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=76">on 
              the new message boards</a>.</i>

            <p>After Hailing Aid Grimel, he will mention that he needs someone 
              willing to help him who is a master of trades AND has travelled 
              the planes. In other words, you will need to meet a certain minimum 
              skill level (without any tradeskill improving devices like the various 
              Geerlok tools being taken into account) in a tradeskill AND have 
              been flagged for a certain plane or two for each tradeskill quest 
              he gives you. If you do not have the appropriate planar flag yet, 
              he will reply to you with: </p>
            <p></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Aid Grimel says 'I am sorry but one who has such limited knowledge 
                of the Planes would not be able to assist me.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><br>
              If your skill does not meet the requirement, he will insult your 
              ability in the skill. The flag has priority over skill level. </p>
            <p>Once you start combining the signet in recipes, keep in mind that 
              you WILL get the signet back if the combine fails. So don't stress 
              out (as much) about failed combines. </p>
            <p>This assumes that all combines are done in either a Planar kit 
              of some sort (i.e. Planar Fletching Kit, Planar Sewing Kit, etc) 
              or in a stationary container IN the Plane of Knowledge. </p>
            <p>Also, flags, unless said otherwise, are flags you get from <em>killing</em> 
              the god. </p>

            <p>Grimel will hand you a breastplate, ask that you wash it, and then

                Aid Grimel says 'Thank you for offering to help Bakara. Take this 
                breastplate and clean it with a diluted acid wash to get all of 
                the debris out of it. Brew the wash by combining acid and a three 
                celestial essence's. Once the armor is cleaned, coat it with hurricane 
                temper. Finally add two black diamonds of nightmare to the breastplate. 
                This should provide adequate protection for our next journey.'

                Aid Grimel says 'My hand was crushed when I used it to deflect 
                a blow from a War Boar that was headed towards Taldarius's back. 
                For some time afterwards my hand was crippled but Brell saw to 
                it I regained full use of it. The ring I used to wear was damaged 
                beyond repair and my hand was never steady enough to etch a new 
                one. If you would make me a new one by combing a mounted blue 
                diamond, the etching dust and etching tools in a jewelry kit. 
                Then take the faceted gem and combine it with a bar of pure enchanted 
                velium and my signet. I have no idea how the pure bars are made.

              Going to Velious and in Thurgadin, hail Meg Tucker with the appropriate 
              trigger text for a clarifying response. </p>

              <p>You say, 'what bar of pure enchanted velium' <br>
                Meg Tucter says 'Wow that is an odd request Yalum. Very rarely 
                do we make an item that requires a pure bar of metal. Pure enchanted 
                velium bars are made by combing three enchanted velium bars in 
                a forge along with a coldain velium temper, pure water and a Coldain 
                smithy hammer. Tis quite expensive but it enables the crafter 
                to obtain pure working materials.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Meg also gives you the Etching tools. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>You say, 'I need a set of Etching Tools' <br>
                Meg Tucter says 'Oh, really? There are not many that work in faceting 
                gems. I am surprised to see your interest. You can have this old 
                set of mine. If you are working with Royal Velium and want to 
                give it to someone else, you can use these etching tools and your 
                jewelers kit to engrave the piece for them. Be careful though, 
                because once the armor is engraved you cannot remove it and it 
                will be useless to the Dain. There is no need to return the tools, 
                Talem recently made me a new sturdy set. Brell bless him.' </p>

            <p>And when you finally hand in the ring, the text Grimel gives is:

              <p>Aid Grimel grins. 'Quite a nice ring you have made for me Iustus.

            <p>Now Grimel will give you an urn pattern and ask you to make a Sacred 
              Urn and fill it up with Sacred Water--to replace one that was destroyed 
              in the Plane of War--and to cap it with your signet from the Jewelcrafting 
              part of the quest. Pretty straightforward. After making the, start 
              heading over to the Plane of Valor and camping &quot;the knights 
              in the tents in Valor&quot; as Khoren puts it for Sacred Water. 
              After filling up the Urn with Water and your signet, combine for 
              the Filled Sacred Urn and turn it in for the REALLY promising Metal 
              Signet. </p>

                Aid Grimel says 'On our last tome gathering expedition a stray 
                arrow in the Plane of War struck our urn filled with sacred water. 
                It was quite a waste of sacred water! Three large enchanted blocks 
                of clay, three lacquered opals, a vial of purified mana, a ceramic 
                lining, sculpting tools and the urn pattern should make an unfired 
                urn. The urn is so large you will need to fire it with three divine 
                crystalline glazes. Once you have the urn it needs to be filled 
                with three sacred waters and the signet as a cap.' </p>

                one meal that keeps us in top fighting shape. It is called a Bristlebane's 
                Party Platter. Unfortunately the platter is awkward and not easy 
                to adventure with so you need to place them in this satchel. I 
                know not how to make the Platter, a rather nice female Halfling 
                cleric used to deliver them to us. Quite an amazing lass to be 
                braving so many of the Planes by herself. We chatted a bit last 
                time she was here about her next trip she was planning on taking. 
                She was going to spend time in Plane of Justice, twice as long 
                as the other Planes. From there she was going to the river in 
                Nightmare. After departing the land of Terris Thule she was going 
                to visit the home of the God who was once tormented by Terris. 
                After picking up a few baskets from a friend, she was off to the 
                home of the Triumvirate. Alas! Word made it back to me she was 
                crushed by a Regrua while hunting for the dreaded beast's claws! 
                Combine three of the platters and the signet inside the satchel.

            <p>Following Grimel's advice, hailing the councilman gives a quest 
              similar to Secrets of the Planes: Go fetch a Hope Stone! This step 
              has been verified to NOT be MQable. The councilman will reject items

                Councilman Taldarius regards you, and grins. 'Greetings, Iustus. 
                I am Councilman Taldarius, mighty Paladin of Mithaniel Marr and 
                Guardian of the City of Tanaan! If you cannot find what you are 
                looking for here in the Myrist library, I most certainly can add 
                it to my list of things to look for in the Planes. Unfortunately, 
                I am quite busy at the moment, planning my next trip to the Elemental 
                Planes. I believe my aid may have some tasks he could use help 
                with. That is, if you are skilled enough.' <br>

              <p>You say, 'What about the Marked Runed Signet' <br>
                Councilman Taldarius says 'I see you have helped Grimel immensely. 
                He would not have given up his signet very easily. I cannot let 
                him deprive himself of such a valuable tool. If you were to do 
                a task for me I would grant you something I picked up in the Planes. 
                Are you interested in the task?' <br>
              </p>
              <p>You say, 'i am interested in the task' <br>
                Councilman Taldarius says 'Very well Iustus. I warn you I will 
                not grant this without proof that you possess a valiant spirit. 
                You may have the trust of my aid but I still require a noble deed. 
                Through research done by the council they have discovered something 
                called a Hope Stone that exists in the Elemental Planes. Bring 
                me one of these stones and the signet of Grimel. Fear not I shall 
                reward you well.' </p>
