<p>
<p>There are many details still missing from the guide for this race.  What we have so far is either here or waiting in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/forumdisplay.php?f=100">DoN Data Submissions Forum</a>.  Please look there if you do not find the detail you need.  But keep in mind, it simply may not have been reported yet.  If you have some details that aren't here or there, please post them and we'll get them updated!</p>

<p>This is the quest for ogres to acquire the books necessary to make the cultural armor that is available with the Dragons of Norrath expansion.  For more information on the general details, see the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q182&menustr=120030000000">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Armor Quest Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You start in Ogguk, with Garth Okken at 260, -213, next to the regular forge.  The books do not need to be acquired in any particular order, as Garth will give you all of the quests at once if you ask.</p>

<h4>Ancestral:</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Garth Okken'</p>
<p>Garth Okken says 'Hrmph! What der you want? A [clubbin]?'</p>
<p>You say, 'clubbin'</p>
<p>Garth Okken says 'You do wants a clubbin! Ha ha! You pass da test den! Anyone who wants a clubbin' from me must be too tuff for a clubbin! Leave me with jusa broken club! How you get to be so tuff, Gorthag? You don't even wear da good [armor]!'</p>
<p>You say, 'armor'</p>
<p>Garth Okken says 'Aye, ha ha. Da gud armor! Normally ogres not good at making tings, just breakin' tings, ya? But dis one ogre, a crazy war face named Kizrak da Tyrant, he design da gud armor and gave me da [pattern] book. Told me to pass it out to da other tuff ogres. Since you tuff enough to ask me for a clubbin', you tuff enough for dis armor! Mebbe you even tuff enough to earn [medals].'</p>
<p>You say, 'pattern'</p>
<p>Garth Okken says 'Me can make you a pattern book too if you bring me some tings first. Me need a cat skull cap for da cover, a large brick of unrefined ore for da binding, a fractured femur for a book clasp, and a glob of muddite mud for da ink. I hear dese tings can be found in da Runnyeye Goblin lair and the Beholder's Maze, which be tuff places of dare own. But dat's okay. Diis armor is tuff stuff, Gorthag. You'd have a thicker head than I thought if you pass it up.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quest Details: Collect and hand in Cat Skull Cap, Muddite Mud, Fractured Femur, Large Brick of Unrefined Ore</p>
<p><i>Tips:</i> Cat Skull Caps (no drop) drop from Picklaw mindrippers in Runnyeye. Muddite Mud drops from muddites in Gorge of King Xorbb. Fractured Femurs (no drop) drop from goblins in Runnyeye.

<blockquote>
<p>Garth Okken says 'You bring da guds? Excellent! Here's your pattern book. Kizrak said da armor designs be a gift from da big Rallos Zek war face himself. Me don' know 'bout dat, but I do know da armor in dis book is da best Garth ever seen for fighting... and me been fightin' since me was no bigger dan an elf! Ha ha!'</p>

<h4>Ogre Book Texts</h4>

<p>Ancestral Ogre Armor:<br />
"Dese are da armor patterns o' Kizrak da Tirant, da smartest ogre ever to lead us inta war. He say that da patterns be a gift from da big Rallos Zek as a reward for all our proper fightin' and brawlin' throughout all time. And its a good gift too! Dis book contains lotz o' stories bout how da ogre mastered da art o' war and splattered all dey enemies along the way. Da book mentions ways we could o' splattered enemies better tho' and so it contains plans to make our armor tuffer and stronger. Ogres always be getting tuffer and stronger till the end o' time. Dis book is jus' one more step 'long da way. May da war face Rallos Zek smile forever on da ogre battle line!  The patterns in this book can be copied many times, but eventually they will wear out and you can tell that if you use the patterns enough you will need to replace the book. To create pattern for tailoring armor templates based on these patterns you will need this book, a large bottle of ink, a roll of plain parchment, a quill, and a compacted backpack to hold the patterns you will make. You'll also need a book binding to do the work. If you wish to use the patterns to make molds you'll need a kiln to work in as well as a high quality firing sheet, sculpting tools, a huge block of clay, and a compacted backpack to hold the molds when you're done."</p>

<p>Books of Ogre Culture:<br />
"Ogres have da long history o' warrin with da other races of Norrath. Wez known for our strength and f'rocity in battle... but not for our culture or arts. Dat's stoopid'! Whats most don't know is dat ritual and symb'lism very important to us ogres, especially if it has ta do with da ritual and symb'lism of warfare. Dis book covers all da battle symbols and glyphs o' da ogre armor used since da ogre armor raised da first club and smashed da first dwarf into his first dwarven afterlife... And dat was a long time ago cuz we ogres have been standin' tall and proud forever!</p>

<p>"Dese pages 'splain how to make da intermediate ogre armor symbols, da glyphs found on war standards and banners. Its good stuff worn by captains and other crazy war heads. It shud last you awhile til the patterns wear out. Probably by den you ready for the da more advanced stuff anyway so don't sweat it.</p>

<p>"To create pattern for tailoring armor templates based on these patterns you will need this book, a large bottle of ink, a roll of good quality vellum, a quill, and a compacted backpack to hold the patterns you will make. You'll also need a book binding to do the work."</p></p><p>
