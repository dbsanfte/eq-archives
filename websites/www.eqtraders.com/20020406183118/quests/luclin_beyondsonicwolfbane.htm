            <h3>Beyond Sonic Wolf Bane - Continuing Quests for Vah Shir</h3>
            <p>While the creation of a Vah Shir's class-specific <a href="luclin_sonicwolfbane.htm">Sonic 
              Wolf Bane weapon</a> is a major achievement, it is not the end of 
              the quest. The continuation of the quest is available to Vah Shir 
              who have completed all the previous steps. The remaining steps will 
              be prety much the same, but the reward will vary based on the class 
              of the questor.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Once you create your Sonic Wolf Bane weapon, you need to bring 
              the weapon to the person that gave you the quest, along with your 
              Apprentice Cloak. Bards return them to Hana Sulm, beastlords return 
              theirs to Kaam Rahiir, rogues return theirs to Elder Taruun Ternq, 
              members of the shaman class return theirs to Jaima Seyel, and warriors 
              return theirs to Khala Dun Kuash.</p>
            <p>Below is the text from the warrior version of the quest. While 
              the text will vary slightly from class to class, all will be sent 
              to find Ahom Guzhin.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Khala Dun Kuash says 'Now ths is a nice dagger! Do you like it 
                better than mine? I thought so. When I was looking in my storeroom 
                for the dagger molds, I found this for you. Here take it and wear 
                it with pride... you're now officially a Khala Dun Journeyman! 
                Pretty exciting surprise, eh? I thought so! No, you need to take 
                the cloak to Ahom Guzhin. He'll meet you in the moor. He's always 
                in the moor. Bye friend!</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Kuash will give you back the dagger, along with a new cloak, which 
              is your Khala Dun Journeyman's Cloak. (Other classes will receive 
              their class-specific Journeyman's Cloak. Stats are not available 
              at this time)</p>
            <p>It's at this point that the quest was stalled for quite a long 
              time. Despite Kuash's assurances that Ahom Guzhin is always in the 
              Moor, he was apparently removed when the Hollowshade War was turned 
              off. He appeared back in the game on March 7, and it seems he disappeared 
              again about a week later, as the Hollowshade War was very buggy.</p>
            <p>It also appears that while the quests for each Vah Shir class were 
              different up to the creation of the Sonic Wolf Bane weapon, once 
              that weapon has been created the quest is the same for each class, 
              but the rewards are different. In any case, bring your Journeyman's 
              Cloak to Ahom Guzhin, who is found inside the tunnel from Hollowshade 
              Moor to Grimling Forest (if he's in the game that is).</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>You say, 'Hail, Ahom Guzhin'<br>
                Ahom Guzhin says 'Please do not think poorly of me, but I must 
                see your Journeyman's cloak if you wish to converse. Be quick 
                about it. This place is not completely safe. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Hand him your Journeyman's Cloak...</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Ahom Guzhin says 'Ah, there it is... I haven't seen one of those 
                in a while. I remember when I first became a journeyman myself. 
                That was many seasons and twice as many trails ago. Time becomes 
                most deft in the period just after you figure that you've got 
                a grasp on it. '</p>
              <p>Ahom Guzhin says 'Well, let us get back to pebbles and tax, shall 
                we? You displayed a great deal of bravery in coming out here and 
                looking for me. I fear my age is beginning to show. I can't evade 
                danger as I did in my youth. With that in mind, I would like you 
                to take this journal back to town for me. Historian Sharar will 
                tend to my notes for me. She is a trusted friend and a valuable 
                scholar. Please give it to her with my thanks. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He will hand you a journal to take to Historian Sharar, who is 
              outside the Palace in Shar Vahl.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>You say, 'Hail, Historian Sharar'<br>
                Historian Sharar says 'It is a pleasure to meet you, friend. Please 
                let me know if you have trouble finding the book that you seek. 
                If you request something that we do not have available, I can 
                make a note to keep an eye out for it. We are getting in a great 
                variety of interesting new material these days. Speaking of which, 
                I need someone to take a tome to Elder Animist Dumul. He has been 
                frantically researching something or another. I'm sure that you 
                could pry a little and learn more about it if you were to take 
                this book to him. Is that something that you would be interested 
                in doing? '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Hand him the journal that you got from Ahom Guzhin.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Historian Sharar says 'I see that you've found the codger. He 
                really should settle down and come in from the weather. I often 
                find myself worrying about him these days. Adventure takes its 
                toll on everyone. I'd like to see him settle down before the moor 
                takes a final toll from him. '<br>
                Historian Sharar says 'Well, I can't say that it isn't a pleasure 
                to have his journal. He's documented the moor with such splendid 
                detail. I cannot wait to see what he's written in these last few 
                seasons. It is all so very helpful. Just take a look at these 
                earplugs. They are a product of his last set of notes. He came 
                up with the idea, while hunting owlbear in the moor. They are 
                supposed to keep the sound they make from harming you. You can 
                keep them, if you take this note to General Avilah for me. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Historian Sharer hands you an Earring of the Owlbear, and a note 
              to take to General Avilah. The Earring of the Owlbear is a NO DROP 
              earring with no stats, and a right click effect of Immunity to Owlbear 
              Screech. Take the note to General Avilah...</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>You say, 'Hail, General Avilah'<br>
                General Avilah says 'Thank you for delivering this. While I have 
                you here, perhaps you can help. We are in dire need of assistance 
                in the moor. All of the reports from our Taruun are indicating 
                the same thing. The area has to be swept clear of the factions 
                that currently inhabit it. The land itself seems defendable, we 
                need someone to gather some soldiers and clear the area. '<br>
                General Avilah says 'If you accomplish this mission for us, I 
                will be able to reward you for your actions in this leadership 
                role. You will need only to return this box to me to collect your 
                reward and promotion. It will need to contain a grimling chieftain 
                staff, an owlbear guardian talon, a sonic wolf guardian fang, 
                and your Journeyman's Cloak. Good luck too you, should you elect 
                to accept this challenge. '<br>
                You gain experience!!</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>General Avilah gives you a 4 slot box in which to collect the needed 
              items. Each of the needed items drops rarely from grimlings, owlbears, 
              and sonic wolves in Hollowshade Moor. They are all Magic, Lore, 
              and No Drop (note that these items may not be dropping unless the 
              Hollowshade War is working). Once you have all three items, place 
              them in the box along with your Journeyman's cloak, and hit combine. 
              Take the combined box back to General Avilah.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>General Avilah says 'You have proven to be a great leader and 
                excellent soldier. Please accept this cloak as a symbol of your 
                accomplishment. We would be proud to have you as a member of our 
                ranks. You can choose to stay within the ranks of your sect or 
                you can work with us was a member of the Shar Vahl Garrison. If 
                you wish to continue your work as a member of the garrison, please 
                take this form, sign it in triplicate and give it to Captain Darznel. 
                Either way, please stand still, while I offer you our formal salutation. 
                '<br>
                General Avilah shouts 'Ahem... Citizens of Shar Vahl, Attention! 
                It is my duty and honor as commander of the Shar Vahl Garrison 
                to thank Tnar for their fine work. Give 'em your complete respect 
                and salute 'em when you see them in passing. We enjoy our freedom, 
                because of brave citizens like Tnar. Thank you for your time... 
                Carry on! '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>General Avilah will hand you a form to take to Captain Darznel, 
              along with your new Garrison Cloak. The new cloak is called a Khala 
              Dun Garrison Cloak, and it is AC 9, Str +6, Dex +4, Sta +4, Agi 
              +2, HP +30, with +3% to Blacksmithing skill. Congratulations! <i>(This 
              is the warrior reward, details not available for the rewards for 
              other classes.)</i></p>
            <p>Now it's time to trek back to Grimling Forest and hand the form 
              to Captain Darznel...</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>You say, 'Hail, Captain Darznel'<br>
                Captain Darznel says 'Well met, friend. May I be of assistance? 
                '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Hand him the form you got from General Avilah...</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Captain Darznel says 'Let's see, yes... yes... It looks like 
                you signed everything in the correct spot. That can only mean 
                that you're not only brave, but you have some wits as well. If 
                you have all of your teeth and can stand on one leg until the 
                count of five, I think we can make use of you. '<br>
                Captain Darznel says 'Take this Polished Acrylia Sphere and give 
                it to Scout Husman. He's been leading raiding parties against 
                the grunt camps. Adventurers are great, but we need a real soldier 
                to assist him this time. Perhaps we will get better results with 
                your help. '<br>
                Captain Darznel says 'After you complete that raid, please go 
                with Scouts Danarin and Derrin. Once you secure those camps, bring 
                me any grimling intelligence reports or documents that you may 
                have found. Place the documents and your Garrison cloak in this 
                bag and bring them back to me. Complete this task and you may 
                even get a promotion. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Captain Darznel will hand you a 4 slot box, and a Polished Acrylia 
              Sphere. You will need to complete the raids given by each scout, 
              and loot the Captured Grimling Documents that each officer drops. 
              They will appear as Captured Grimling Documents I, II, and III. 
              Be sure to also loot the body part dropped by the officer and hand 
              it back to the scout, so you will have the medals that you will 
              need for the next part.</p>
            <p>Once you have completed the three raids (bring friends - it can 
              be tough to keep the scout alive), place the three Captured Grimling 
              Documents in the box, along with your Garrison Cloak, and hit combine. 
              Hand the combined box back to Captain Darznel.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Captain Darznel says 'This documentation is a great start. Judging 
                by the amount of material here, we'll be able to formulate a new 
                battle within the week. It shouldn't take our linguists too long 
                to decipher this scribble. '<br>
                Captain Darznel says 'I cannot help but think that your presence 
                and leadership are what made those missions such wonderful successes. 
                I have been authorized to give you a field promotion for your 
                valor and bravery in combat. You're ability to lead was the keystone 
                in the success of those engagements. Welcome to the rank of Garrison 
                Officer, Tnar! '<br>
                Captain Darznel says 'We can celebrate your promotion when we 
                make it back to the rear. Right now, I need you to lead another 
                set of missions into the grunt occupied territory. Speak to Captain 
                Necin and show him the Soldier's chest that you've filled with 
                the medals that you earned from the first set of raids. He will 
                direct you through the next several mission. Once you have completed 
                the missions, combine the Medallion of the Hero of Shar Vahl and 
                your Officer's cloak in this Satchel. Take the Locked Satchel 
                to Sergeant Cursah. He will assist you from that point forward. 
                '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Captain Darznel will hand you a 2 slot container, and your new 
              Garrison Officer cloak! The new cloak is called Khala Dun Officer's 
              Cloak, and it's stats are AC 12, Str +10, Dex +8, Sta +8, Int +3, 
              Agi +5, HP +50, with +3% to Blacksmithing. Like all the other cloaks
