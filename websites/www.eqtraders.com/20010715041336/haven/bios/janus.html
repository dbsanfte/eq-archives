  guess I would need to begin this in the beginning. That is where most stories 
  are supposed to start, correct?<br>
  <br>
  I was born to pair of traveling human merchants, Brianne and Hoseph. They would 
  take their small caravan of goods between Freeport, Rivervale and Qeynos all 
  year round. I remember my father telling me that I was born on the path while 
  they were trying to get a good batch of Jum-Jum Wine over to Qeynos. He said 
  that my mother refused to allow him to stop to help her with the birth, as she 
  was determined to have me, AND get the Jum-Jum Wine to the festival they Qeynos 
  was having.<br>
  <br>
  Their first love was being the traveling merchants that they were. Do not get 
  me wrong; I was treated better then most children on this world. I always was 
  fed and clothed. I had plenty of little gadgets and doohickeys from the gnomes 
  to keep me occupied. How many people can honestly say that they have been across 
  the breadth of Antonica more times when they were five, then most people their 
  entire lives? <br>
  <br>
  I learned much from them in the ways of buying and selling. I believe most would 
  call it, haggling. I have even heard tales that my mother used me in her haggling 
  when I was but a wee one. No… not to sell, but as a way to get the tough merchants 
  to open up some. She was good at that kind of thing.<br>
  <br>
  So how did I become the awesome force of undead slaying power that I am today? 
  Well, that is a story that I have been able to piece together after the events 
  surrounding it. The fall-from-grace of his Voidness has helped me put the final 
  pieces together in the puzzle that was that section of my life. I was able to 
  sit with him and ask him what I was, to be honest, scared to ask him while he 
  was Lord of the Void. He answered me truthfully, and for that, I am indebted 
  to him.<br>

  <br>
  We were on the road between Rivervale and Freeport. I was 6 at the time. We 
  had passed through Kithicor forest a few hours past (this was, of course, years 
  before the events of Bloody Kithicor and it turning into the haven for undead 
  that it is today). We always made sure to stop by at every inn along the roadway. 
  The innkeepers were always on the lookout for that something unique that they 
  could have at their inn, which no others would have. They would then use that 
  as a tool to get passer-bys to stay there for the eve. We must have supplied 
  the inns along that road to Freeport with over twenty different types of alcohol 
  and foodstuffs over the years.<br>
  <br>
  I also remember that my parents always liked to stray from the road, as it were, 
  and go stop at a shop of a good friend of theirs. Jogre had always liked living 
  a tad bit on the edge. He once dealt in rare, and sometimes, illegal items when 
  he had his shop in Freeport. He always gave my parents as good of a deal as 
  you could ask for, and he honestly was a good person. When he had found that 
  the Paladin’s of Mithaniel Marr were going to start a formal investigation into 
  his workings, he decided that he should leave for a while and let things cool 
  off. He had heard of a dungeon that many an adventurer went to but were always 
  grumbling about having to carry all of their goods quite a distance before they 
  could do any selling.<br>
  <br>
  It was this place out in West Commons that he set up shop, near the entrance 
  to what I would later find out was that putrescent hole, Befallen. Back then; 
  there was no inn or guard post along the road. Jogre had a perfect spot, or 
  so he thought.<br>
  <br>
  We had parked the wagon next to the building. Father was already inside speaking 
  with Jogre. I could hear their deep voices booming out from inside. I was helping 
  my mother to unpack the goods that we had brought to sell. One of the items 
  had been given to us by one of the Clergy from the Temple of Rodcet Nife in 
  Qeynos. He had told us to give it to Jogre. The Temple had heard of his shop, 
  and it’s location to Befallen. They had sent with us an item that they hoped 
  would be of use to someone that was intent on cleaning out the undead from there. 
  The Clergyman had said that we were to give instructions to Jogre to have him 
  display the item freely in his shop. When my mother asked what price should 
  Jorge ask for it, the Clergyman had said that there was no price, the right 
  person would simply use the item, at the correct time. Not one to argue with 
  a Temple, my parents took the crafted box that held the item.<br>
  <br>
  Well one thing I could tell you about the item, it was heavy with a big H. It 
  only took one of the acolytes from the Temple to carry it, and place it on our 
  wagon. But my mother was having a hard time simply dragging the box across the 
  back of the wagon. I couldn’t even budge it.<br>
  <br>
  Mother did manage to get the box to the back edge of the wagon. She called out 
  to Father and Jogre to help her get it into the shop. The sun was starting to 
  set, and my mother wanted to get back on the road as soon as possible.<br>
  <br>
  Jogre and my father had just grabbed a hold of the crafted box when we heard 
  a voice from behind us. It was what looked to be a man, in dark robes wielding 
  a gnarled etched staff. He was standing in the shadows of the store, but we 
  could see that he was alone. He asked if the proprietor of the shop was about, 
  as he had some transactions that he wanted to do. Jogre told him that he was 
  busy at the moment, and if he could wait, he would be glad to deal with him 
  as soon as he was done. <br>
  <br>
  The man said that he was there for the item in the box, and that he could not 
  wait. My father turned and asked him why would he want the box. The man simply 
  stated that his master Innoruuk had told him to retrieve the item, and so he 
  would. He stepped forward out of the shadows a foot, and we could all see that 
  he was not a man at all, but one of Innoruuk’s Children, a Dark Elf.<br>
  <br>
  Father pulled his sword from its scabbard. He jumped between Mother and myself, 
  and the Dark Elf. The Dark Elf simply laughed and began a magical incantation. 
  My father lunged at the Dark Elf and had his sword deflected by some unseen 
  force. Jogre had run back inside the store to gather his weapon, as well.<br>
  <br>
  Mother pushed me back around the corner of the wagon to help shield me from 
  what was going on. She sat me down on the ground beside the wheel and told me 
  to not move. She then grabbed her sword from the front of the wagon, and began 
  to move around to help my father. I crouched down behind the wheel trying to 
  use it as cover, but I could still look under the wagon and mostly see what 
  was going on.<br>
  <br>
  I heard the Dark Elf finish his incantation as another of my father’s blows 
  harmlessly bounced off the magical shield. He simply pointed at my father, and 
  a blue-green bolt of energy shot out of his hand and struck my father in his 
  chest. I heard my mother scream, and watched as my father’s body simply fell 
  to the ground like a rag doll. I could look into my father’s eyes as he lay 
  there on the ground and watched as the light faded from them. My world exploded 
  before me, reality stopped to be.<br>
  <br>
  The next few moments were a blur. Jogre came out wielding a two handed battle-axe. 
  Mother held Father’s body for a moment, and then lunged at the Dark Elf as well. 
  Blow after blow from both of them simply bounced of the Dark Elf. He said that 
  they could not stop him from getting what was in the box, and began another 
  incantation. Mother and Jogre stopped their attacks and backed a step away from 
  the Dark Elf defensively. The Dark Elf stopped his incantation but nothing seemed 
  to happen. Both Jogre and Mother looked around in confusion, but only the Dark 
  Elf and myself were the ones that could see what the spell did. The Dark Elf 
  began another incantation, this one he almost screamed out as he cast it.<br>
  <br>
  I watched in absolute horror as the skeleton of my father ripped itself free 
  from its skin and muscles. In fighting the Dark Elf, Jogre and Mother had positioned 
  them between Father’s fallen body and the Dark Elf. With the loudness of the 
  incantation the Dark Elf was casting, it was obvious that neither Jogre nor 
  my mother could hear what was going on behind them. I watched as the bones of 
  my father stood up, picked up its sword, and drove it through Jogre’s back.<br>
  <br>
  Mother turned and screamed as she finally noticed what had happened. She backed 
  away from my father’s skeleton. The Dark Elf finished his incantation and caused 
  Jogre’s skeleton to rip free of its flesh casing before the body had even finished 
  settling on the ground. It too picked up its weapon. Mother backed away from 
  both skeletons in enough of a rush that she slammed into the wagon knocking 
  herself unconscious.<br>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="-1" ptsize="10" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mother 
  hit the wagon with such force that the crafted box managed to tip over and hit 
  the ground. The Dark Elf commanded the skeleton of my father to pick her up. 
  He then walked over to where the crafted box lay and knelt down. The box had 
  busted open on the fall, and the Dark Elf reached in to grab the item. The Dark 
  Elf stood up and pulled his hand back in pain as if something had burnt him. 
  I could smell the acrid stench of burnt flesh as he turned to look at me. <br>
  <br>
  “Boy, do as I say, and I shall not have your mother killed. Come over here.”<br>
  <br>
  It was as if waves of fear oozed off of his body. I simply nodded and stood 
  up. As I walked over towards him I looked to see what the item was. It was a 
  hammer. Not like a hammer used to pound nails, or a war-hammer, but a metal 
  almost brick shape topped hammer. It had golden symbols and worlds running over 
  the head and the length of the half. The grip was woven with some sort of silken 
  material.<br>
  <br>
  “Do you see the Hammer, boy?”<br>
  <br>
  I nodded.<br>
  <br>
  “It seems that Rodcet Nife was trying to find a champion for his cause.”<br>
  <br>
  I stammered out, “C-c-cause?”<br>
  <br>
  “Yes, boy. His cause to wipe out all undead and the ones who control them, the 
  Necromancers like myself. It seems the God of Life has a thing about bringing 
  souls back from their final resting place. This Hammer was created by Him to 
  be wielded by the One who would champion that cause. My God does not want this 
  to happen. He has sent me to find the Hammer and destroy it.”<br>
  <br>
  I looked up at the Necro, now knowing what he was. He rubbed my face with his 
  hand. It felt as if all of the heat from my body was being sucked out where 
  he touched me.<br>
  <br>
  “You shall make such a nice sacrifice to Innoruuk, boy. I think I will keep 
  your mother as a plaything.”<br>
  <br>
  I looked over to my mother’s unconscious form. She was slumped over the shoulder 
  of my father’s skeleton. At that moment I knew that even if it was my death, 
  I had to do something.<br>
  <br>
  The Necro pulled out a bag from under his cloak.<br>
  <br>
  “Now boy, I want to you to pick up the hammer and put it into this bag. Then 
  we shall go back into Befallen and start the sacrifice.”<br>
  <br>
  Knowing that this was my last chance, I simply did what he said and grabbed 
  the Hammer.<br>
  <br>
  “By the Dark God Innoruuk! What is happening?”<br>
  <br>
  A column of pure light shot down from the sky and slammed into me with great 
  force as I grabbed the Hammer. The skeletons and the Necro were thrown back 
  and off their feet as if hit by an explosive force. My limbs felt lighter as 
  I stood up. I looked around and noticed that some sort of energy like a shell 
  surrounded me. As I turned, I caught a glimpse of what it was in a mirror in 
  the back of the wagon. It was of an adult male human wearing a set of plate 
  armor adorned in the symbols of Rodcet Nife and one other. At that moment, I 
  knew that it was me… that was my destiny, I knew the Hammer’s name and I knew 
  what to do.<br>
  <br>
  With no fear in my heart, and strength I had never felt, I turned towards the 
  skeletons. With tears in my eyes, I pointed the Hammer of Deconstruction at 
  the skeletons and spoke, “Sleep a final sleep weary Spirits of Hoseph and Jogre. 
  May you know the piece in death that you may not have known in life. Sleep well 
  in the Void.”<br>
  <br>
  Twin arcs of white-red energy shot from the head of the Hammer and struck both 
  skeletons full on. The bones shattered and fell to the ground as the explosive 
  force from the bolts destroyed the arcane power holding them together. For a 
  brief moment, I saw the spirits of my father and Jogre begin to float away. 
  From my connection with the Hammer I could hear my father. <br>
  <br>
  <i>^^I am proud of you, my son. Go now and live your life as it is written. 
  We shall meet again, someday.^^</i><br>
  <br>
  I turned towards the Necro and spat pure hatred at him as I advanced.<br>
  <br>
  “You vile, lump of putrescent scum. I shall send you back to your Dark God faster 
  then you could imagine.”<br>
  <br>
  The Necromancer simply took a few steps back and began casting the spell that 
  I would later find out allows a spell caster to gate himself to a place of safety. 
  It did not work for him today. <br>
  <br>
  “My spell? It should have worked. Why did it not… By the Dark Gods, no!!!”<br>
  <br>
  I turned to see what the Necro was looking at. Floating in the air beside me 
  was, what I could best describe as a being of immense power. It seemed to be 
  humanoid in shape, but I could not discern a face or hands due to the energy 
  exuding from it.<br>
  <br>
  <i>^^You shall not escape your punishment this time, Devault. You have escaped 
  my wrath long enough. You may be one of Innoruuk’s chosen. But your abuse of 
  power continues to invade upon my realm, and that I shall not tolerate any longer.^^ 
  </i><br>
  <br>
  “Oh please, Lord of the Void, do not…”<br>
  <br>
  <i>^^I shall not listen to your pedantic prattle, you are mine now.^^</i><br>
  <br>
  And with but a thought, this being smote the Necro before my eyes. The Dark 
  Elf known as Devault was simply no more.<br>
  <br>
  <i>^^Arise Janus, son of Hoseph, and by doing so, you are accepting the title 
  of He who shall slay all undead.^^</i><br>
  <br>
  I did not realize that I had been kneeling, but I was.<br>
  <br>
  “I am simply a boy. How am I to do this task?”<br>
  <br>
  Chuckling the being looked down upon me.<br>
  <br>
  <i>^^You shall age, young Janus, and you shall become the man that you see in 
  time. Know this, once you step foot upon this path, you shall not be able to 
  sway from it.^^<br>
  </i><br>
  All I could do was look over at the prone form of my mother.<br>
  <br>
  <i>^^I shall make sure that she does not suffer, young Janus. Take her to the 
  Temple of Rodcet Nife, and there you will find training, and your mother will 
  be taken care off. This I swear.^^</i><br>
  <br>
  Knowing this, I stood up.<br>
  <br>
  “I, Janus Xanathis, pledge my soul to Rodcet Nife in the glory of His name and 
  power. I shall live every waking moment to hunt down and destroy the scourge 
  that is undeath upon this land. Smiting those that are walking that should be 
  dead, and those that control them. So this I swear.”<br>
  <br>
  Again, the being chuckled as he began to fade from sight.<br>
  <br>
  <i>^^And so you shall, young Janus… and so you shall.^^</i><br>

  As the being faded, the divine strength that I had been given faded with the 
  armor of energy that had surrounded me. I was still able to wield the hammer, 
  but no better then a young boy of six years of life could.<br>
  <br>
  I remember things blurring at this point. I remember gathering my mother up 
  and trying to make her as comfortable as possible in the back of the wagon. 
  I remember getting to the nearest inn and the innkeeper taking us in and helping 
  us. I remember finally getting to the steps of the Temple of Rodcet Nife. There 
  were acolytes and Clergy and Paladins there to greet me. It was if they were 
  expecting me.<i> (Arlest’s Note: So Janus wasn’t always the smartest brick around. 
  Come to think of it, he still isn’t.)</i><br>
  <br>
  My mother never totally recovered from that evening. She was found most days 
  simply sitting at a high window in one of the towers that the Temple owned and 
  staring off into the distance. She hardly spoke, nor did she ever say anything 
  about Father. She passed away in her sleep one year to the day after that evening. 
  True to His word, she never had a moment of pain physically or emotionally.<br>
  <br>
  After that, the hours bled into days, which bled into months, which bled into 
  years. Many a night I had a dream of a grizzled man in the armor I saw around 
  me that day. I now know whom the other symbol belongs to, the being that was 
  there that evening, The ex-Lord of the Void. I remember thinking to myself on 
  how I could not let my parents down, nor could I let Rodcet Nife or his Voidness 
  down either.<br>
  <br>
  I still remember the day I stepped from the north gates of Qeynos. Clothed in 
  nothing but my simple garb and just some food and milk to tide me over, and 
  my Hammer. It was my final test to see if I was ready. There was nothing more 
  the Temple could teach me. The rest I needed to learn on my own.<br>
  <br>
  With my first few steps out of the gate, I walked into my future embracing my 
  destiny and the path that was laid out in front of me. Woe be it unto those 
  that crossed my path and felt the power of the righteous and the glory that 
  is.<br>
