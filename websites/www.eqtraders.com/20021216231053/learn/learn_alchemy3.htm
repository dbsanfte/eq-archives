<p><i>This guide was moved here when Belgar's Alchemy site closed. Some updates have been made for formatting and to reflect changes in alchemy.  Much of the remaining advice is Belgar's.  This has not been updated to reflect new potions from Luclin and Planes of Power.</i></p>

<h3 align="center"><font size="5">What Do Alchemy Potions Do?</font></h3>

<p>In order to take full advantage of this intriguing aspect to Everquest, a complete understanding of exactly what each potion will do is crucial.</p>

<p>When Verant first revamped the old alchemy into the new alchemy, many shamans on many servers spent untold hours and many thousands of platinum discovering its secrets by trial and error. Many potions have been discovered, and there are likely others still to be discovered. For the time being, we do have quite a few potions (59 at last count) to work with. </p>

<p>The following information will be vital in determining which potions you might need and which you do not.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><u>Potion Categories</u></font></p>

<blockquote> <p>There are essentially three broad catagories of potions discovered so far:</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<blockquote> <p><b>1) Stat-enhancing potions</b> (adjust <i><b>two</b></i> stats from among Strength, Stamina, Agility, Dexterity and Charisma)</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>2) Aura-enhancing potions</b> (adjust <i><b>one</b></i> stat from among Strength, Stamina, Agility, Dexterity and Charisma, <u>AND</u> adjusts <i><b>one</b></i> stat from among Disease Resist, Poison Resist, Heat Resist or Cold Resist)</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>3) Utility potions</b> (provide you with special, useful abilities)</p> </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="5"><u>Stat-Enhancing Potions</u></font></p>

<blockquote> <p><font size="4"><u>Varieties:</u></font></p> </blockquote>

<blockquote> <p>There are six Stat-Enhancing Potions that each increase two stats upward:</p> </blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<blockquote> <p><b>1) Stability </b>(strength and stamina)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>2) Vigor </b>(agility and strength)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>3) Power </b>(dexterity and strength)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>4) Adroitness</b> (agility and stamina)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>5) Cohesion</b> (stamina and dexterity)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>6) Accuracy</b> (agility and dexterity)</p></blockquote>

<p><font size="4"><u>Potencies:</u></font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote> <p>Each of the above stat-enhancing potions comes in three potency levels:</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> <p><b>1) Lesser Stat Potions</b> (+ 5, + 5)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>2) Regular Stat Potions</b> ( + 10, + 10)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>3) Greater Stat Potions</b> (+ 15, + 25)</p></blockquote>

<p><b>TIP:</b> More powerful stat adjustments mean more expensive herbs and more skill will required to succeed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="5"><u>Aura-Enhancing Potions</u></font></p>

<blockquote> 
<p><font size="4"><u>Varieties:</u></font></p>

<p>In similar fashion to <i>stat-enhancing</i> potions, aura-enhancing potions come in five known varieties, each variety increasing <i><u>two stats</u></i>:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<blockquote> <p><b>1) Aura of Heat</b> (stamina and cold resist)</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>2) Aura of Cold</b> (agility and heat resist)</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>3) Aura of Purity</b> (strength and poison resist)</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>4) Aura of Null</b> (dexterity and magic resist)</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>5) Aura of Antibody</b> (charisma and disease resist)</p> </blockquote>

<p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Potencies:</u></font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<p>Aura-enhancing potions also come in three potency levels:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> 
<blockquote> <p><b>1) Minor Aura Potions</b> ( + 5, + 5)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>2) Regular Aura Potions</b> (+ 15, + 15)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p><b>3) Greater Aura Potions</b> ( + 25, + 25)</p></blockquote>

<p><b>TIP: </b>As with the stat-enhancing 
                potions, more powerful stat adjustments mean more expensive herbs and more skill will required to succeed..</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="5"><u>Utility Potions</u></font></p>

<blockquote> <p>Utility potions are wonderful elixirs that will confer some special ability to your character for varying lengths of time. They come in a plethora of varieties.</p>

<p><font size="4"><u>Varieties:</u></font></p>

<blockquote> <p><b><u>Adrenaline Tap</u></b> bestows <font color="#408080">Quickness</font> upon you to increase your attack speed for approximately 5 minutes. Still an expensive potion at an average price of 100 pp even if it has a slightly longer duration than Tamed Mercury.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote> <p><b><u>AntiWeight</u></b> grants you the ability to fly over lava, water, pits or canyons with <font color="#408080">Levitate</font> lasting approximately 12 minutes. You must have a <font color="#408080">bat wing</font> in your inventory as a component before drinking this potion. Despite the necessity of a component, this is a very popular potion in areas of deep canyons (Dagnor's Cauldron) or for crossing expanses of water (Ocean of Tears) or lava (Sol A &amp; B, Skyfire). To many players, well worth the average price of 20 pp.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote> <p><b><u>Ant's Potion </u></b>will <font color="#408080">Shrink</font> you to the size of a gnome and will last until you camp, die or zone. Very useful to all non-shaman large races and well worth the average price of 20 pp.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote> <p><b><u>Aquatic Haunting</u></b> will give you the ability to <font color="#408080">Breath Underwater</font> for approximately 30 minutes. You must have a <font color="#408080">fish scale</font> in your inventory as a component before drinking this potion. This is a &quot;must-have&quot; or &quot;better-have&quot; potion for underwater adventuring in Kedge Keep or Lake of Ill Omen when your Enduring Breath caster goes link dead or dies and you start to drown. Very handy for emergencies at an average price of 20 pp.</p>

<p><b><u>Blood of the Wolf</u></b> gives you the benefit of <font color="#408080">Spirit of the Wolf</font> spell, allowing you to <font color="#408080">run much faster than normal</font> in outdoors zones (although can be imbibed outdoors and will stay in effect after zoning into a dungeon) for approximately 40 minutes. Probably the most popular potion in game for the broadest population of players, the long duration and ability to outrun &quot;most&quot; mobs can save your life and at an average price of 12 to 15 pp (10 shot multi-dose usually around 120 pp) is well-worth keeping a few around for any non-sow-casting class. </p>

<p><b><u>Bone Field</u></b> will instantly <font color="#408080">Teleport</font> you to location negative 2000 positive 350 in the Field of Bone on Kunark with exactly a 30 second &quot;casting&quot; time. A crucial potion for non-gating, non-porting, non-evacing classes and well worth the 375 pp average cost to escape the planes or other high-level deep dungeons.</p>

<p><b><u>Dulsehound</u></b> bestows <font color="#408080">+ 18 Strength</font> while also reducing <font color="#FF6633">Intelligence by - 25</font> and invoking a 3 min Regeneration at 3 hp per tick. Drinking time (read: casting time) is virtually <font color="#408080">instantaneous</font> and duration is approximately 3 minutes. A nice potion to drink in the heat of a tough battle if you can afford the average 70 pp price.</p>

<p><b><u>Etheria's Poison Antidote</u></b> will <font color="#408080">Counteract Poison</font> and works instantly. At an average price of 12 pp 5 gp, a very handy potion to keep around for mid to high level players. <font color="#FF6633">Stronger poisons may require drinking multiple gulps</font>.</p>

<p><b><u>Frost</u></b> will instantly <font color="#408080">Teleport</font> you to Everfrost Peaks in the &quot;3 igloos&quot; area with exactly a 30 second &quot;casting&quot; time. A crucial potion for non-gating, non-porting, non-evacing classes and well worth the pricey 375 pp average cost to escape the planes or other high-level deep dungeons.</p>

<p><b><u>Graveyard Dust</u></b> will add <font color="#408080">+27 to Strength, +20 to Agility </font>and increase your<font color="#408080"> attack speed</font>, the effects gradually wearing off over the course of approximately 1 minute, leaving you a slightly negative  effect of <font color="#FF6633">less strength and less agility</font> after it's worn off than before you drank it. Drinking or casting time is <font color="#408080">instantaneous</font>.</p>

<p><b><u>Kilva's Blistering Flesh</u></b> invokes a <font color="#408080">Scorching Skin</font> damage shield lasting <u>approximately</u> (level of the drinker/4) minutes. Damage is equivalent to the (level of the drinker/4) + 1. Hence, a level 40 drinker would benefit from an approximate 10 minute (40 / 4) <font color="#408080">damage shield doing 11 points of damage</font> ( 40 / 4 + 1). At an average price of 17 pp, this potion is more popular with higher level drinkers due to the increased damage and duration. Also note that <font color="#408080">this damage shield WILL STACK with Mage and Druid damage shields</font>.</p>

<p><b><u>Kilva's Skin of Flame</u></b> invokes a <font color="#408080">Scorching Skin</font> damage shield lasting <u>approximately</u> (level of the drinker/4). Damage is equivalent to the (level of the drinker/2) + 1. Hence, a level 40 drinker would benefit from a approximate 10 minute (40 / 4) <font color="#408080">damage shield doing 21 points of damage</font> ( 40 / 2 + 1). At an average price of 30 pp, this potion is more popular with higher level drinkers due to the increased damage and duration. Also note that <font color="#408080">this damage shield WILL STACK with Mage and Druid damage shields</font>.</p>

<p><b><u>Kithor's Disease Treatment</u></b> will <font color="#408080">Counteract Disease</font> and works instantly. At an average price of 12 pp 5 gp, a very handy potion to keep around for mid to high level players. <font color="#FF6633">Stronger diseases may require drinking multiple gulps</font>.</p>

<p><b><u>Negation</u></b> will <font color="#408080">Cancel Magic</font> by removing the top-most spell effect on your screen instantly, but then only sometimes. Until Verant fixes this &quot;top most&quot; spell removal to &quot;last cast&quot; spell removal, this potion is fairly worthless if you have any other buffs cast upon you at all.</p>

<p><b><u>Negation, Greater</u></b> will <font color="#408080">Cancel Magic</font> by removing the <font color="#408080"><i>top two spell effects</i></font> spell effects in certain circumstances.</p>

<p><b><u>Rejuvenation, Lesser</u></b> has the same effect as <font color="#408080">Chloroplast</font> (<font color="#408080">regenerates your hit points at + 10 per tick for ~ 2 min</font>) but will <font volor="#FF6633">reduce your intelligence by - 10 and slow your attack speed by - 9</font> while it is in effect. Fairly expensive at 40 pp or more for 200 points of damage healing.</p>

<p><b><u>Rejuvenation</u></b> has the same effect as <font color="#408080">Chloroplast</font> (<font color="#408080">regenerates your hit points at + 20 per tick for ~ 2 min</font> ) but will <font color="#FF6633">reduce your intelligence by - 20 and slow your attack speed</font> while it is in effect. Expensive at 75 pp or more for 400 points of damage healing.</p>

<p><b><u>Rejuvenation, Greater</u></b> has the same effect as <font color="#408080">Chloroplast</font> (<font color="#408080">regenerates your hit points at + 40 per tick for ~ 2 min </font>) but will <font color="#FF6633">reduce your intelligence by - 40 and slow your attack speed</font> while it is in effect. Very expensive at 140 pp or more for 800 points of damage healing.</p>

<p><b><u>Serpent's Conviction</u></b> grants you the effects of <font color="#408080">Serpent Sight</font>, also known as Infravision. A good potion for Barbarians, Humans and Erudites that have no &quot;night-sight&quot; spells and, to many, worth the 18 pp average price per potion to keep a few around.</p>

<p><b><u>Serpent's Drink</u></b> buffs your <font color="#408080">armor class by 6 points</font> in the manner of <font color="#408080">Scale Skin</font> spell and has a duration of approximately 27 minutes. A fairly worthless potion, you must have a <font color="#408080">snake scale</font> in your inventory as a component before drinking this potion.</p>

<p><b><u>Spirit Shield</u></b> buffs your <font color="#408080">armor class by 18 points</font> in the manner of <font color="#408080">Shifting Shield</font> spell and has a duration of approximately 47 minutes. No component is needed, this potion may prove moderately useful at an average price of 40 pp.</p>

<p><b><u>Stinging Wort</u></b> grants an <font color="#408080">instantaneous 300 Hit Point boost</font> both to total and current hit points while adding <font color="#408080">17 to Strength</font>. The Strength and Hit Point boosts wear off gradually in &quot;<font color="#FF6633">damage over time</font>&quot; fashion over a 6 minute period. Another nice potion for melee classes.</p>

<p><b><u>Swamp</u></b> will instantly <font color="#408080">Teleport </font>you to Innothule Swamp with exactly a 30 second &quot;casting&quot; time. A crucial potion for non-gating, non-porting, non-evacing classes and well worth the pricy 375 pp average cost to escape the planes or other high-level deep dungeons.</p>

<p><b><u>Tamed Mercury</u></b> bestows <font color="#408080">Quickness</font> upon you to <font color="#408080">increase your attack speed</font> for approximately 3 minutes. While a very popular effect for melee'ers, a fairly expensive potion at 55 pp average price considering the short duration.</p>

<p><b><u>Unlife Awareness</u></b> makes you <font color="#408080">Invisible to Undead</font> creatures. Like most invisible spells, duration may fluctuate. Very useful in the areas like Lower Guk (dead side), Combine City (Dreadlands), Kaesora, and elsewhere. Worth the 20 pp average price in many instances when you'd like to enter or leave an area without agro'ing everything in your path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>TIP: </b>Whether you need a utility potion for some specific mission or raid, or whether you just want to keep a few around for emergency purposes (the most likely reason), these utility potions can give you the edge you need to survive, conquer or escape death and the xp loss that death conjurs. Ask yourself, &quot;Is it worth a half bubble of lost xp to gobble down a potion at the right moment?&quot; The answer is academic. A tank walking out of the Frenzied room in Guk would find an Unlife Awareness potion handy. Being stuck alone deep in a dungeon or on the planes after going link dead could be disastrous without a gate potion. There are a thousand different situations where you may find yourself needing a potion.</p>
