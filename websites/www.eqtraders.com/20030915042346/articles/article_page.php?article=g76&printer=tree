<p>
By studying how their own scales are designed to protect them, iksar have learned the art of smithing scale armor for their more combative types. They also have learned the art of making robes to protect the thinner-skinned spellcasters, and have one lone pottery recipe that is required for their more advanced cultural smithing.
</p>
<p>
Note that illusioning into an iksar, or glueing a tail and scales onto yourself will not fool the iksar cultural forge, nor will it trick the NPc that provides the robe patterns. Only true iksar can perform the race-restricted iksar combines.
