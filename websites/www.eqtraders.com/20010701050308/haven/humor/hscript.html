(skip first 1.5 hours of movie which are spent killing rats and snakes)
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
FADE IN:
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
1. EAST KARANA. Rolling landscape with a few hills, and trees with<BR>
branches going in only 4 directions. Animals scamper across the screen,<BR>
vanishing occasionally, only to re-appear a few feet further away moments<BR>
later. The sun is setting in the distance to the West, and the moon is<BR>
rising to the South. LOMBARD SETHERIAH, a Paladin, enters from the right.<BR>
He is clad in shining orange armor of Bronze and wielding a halberd, weapon<BR>
of the Paladin. Behind him strolls his faithful companion, DOBIN KINKLE,<BR>
wearing the finest in leather attire and wielding a large magical staff.
<P>
&nbsp;
<P>
LOMBARD<BR>
Ahh, looks like a full moon!
<P>
&nbsp;DOBIN<BR>
Yes, just like last night. And the night before. And the night before.
<P>
LOMBARD<BR>
This new land is foreign to me, but I have been told it is cursed with<BR>
vile undead reavers which appear at dusk. We must prepare for them. Do<BR>
you have...
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
LOMBARD is suddenly interrupted by a loud clap of thunder. Suddenly, a<BR>
thick bank of fog rolls quickly in and the rain begins to fall.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
LOMBARD<BR>
I cannot see more than 20 feet ahead. This will provide a challenge.<BR>
I shall attempt to sense the undead around us.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
LOMBARD throws his arms around and suddenly flecks of light sparkle from
his eyes.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
LOMBARD<BR>
I sense undead, but they appear to all be... dead... hmm... I appear to<BR>
not be able to find any animated undead due to all the dead ones lying<BR>
around. Friend Dobin, your tracking skills will be most useful now.
<P>
DOBIN<BR>
Very well, I shall attempt to find some.<BR>
<P>
Enter HARRYBALZ, a low level warrior decked out in light blue armor and<BR>
wielding a powerful looking axe.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
HARRYBALZ<BR>
cn u give me sow?
<P>
<P>
LOMBARD looks the warrior up and down. He realizes that this warrior will<BR>
need substantial aid in an environment such as this, as his skills are far<BR>
too weak to handle the creatures which roam about EAST KARANA.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
LOMBARD<BR>
Dobin, let us assist our friend the warrior here.
<P>
DOBIN<BR>
k
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
DOBIN waves his arms around, and a brief lupine aura settles around HARRYBALZ.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
HARRYBALZ<BR>
thx dood!
<P>
LOMBARD<BR>
Be safe, frie...
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
Before LOMBARD can complete his sentence, HARRYBALZ goes running off and
<BR>
quickly disappears into the fog.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
DOBIN<BR>
I'm not tracking anything.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
LOMBARD<BR>
That is well in any case. The fog makes it far too dangerous to be<BR>
hunting at this time. Let us journey to the wooden bridge to the north and<BR>
rest ourselves as we await this storm to pass.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
LOMBARD and DOBIN run north and soon a large wooden bridge looms into view.<BR>
This structure is huge, and has been rumored to have been built by Giants<BR>
long ago. The two men sit down at the edge of the bridge. Suddenly, the<BR>
screen is filled with the image of a Tomb of Magic.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
DOBIN<BR>
medding
<P>
&nbsp;
<P>
10 minutes pass, and finally the book comes down and we see that the storm<BR>
has passed.
<P>
&nbsp;
<P>
LOMBARD<BR>
Excellent, we can now resume our hunt. Let us...
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
LOMBARD is interrupted by a loud shout which rips across the land.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
HARRYBALZ<BR>
BROON TO BRIDGE! MOVE YER ASS!
<P>
LOMBARD<BR>
Broon? What beast is this?
<P>
&nbsp;
<P>
HARRYBALZ suddenly runs past our heroes and down the bridge, behind him<BR>
runs a large bald CYCLOPS. HARRYBALZ vanishes as soon as he gets to the <BR>
middle of the bridge, but the CYCLOPS has spotted the heroes.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
LOMBARD<BR>
Ahh, a beast to vanquish at last!
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
DOBIN<BR>
err, we should zone.
<P>
<P>
LOMBARD readies his halberd, and swings at the CYCLOPS as it tries to pass.<BR>
His halberd meets air as the large clumsy CYCLOPS is surprisingly agile<BR>
enough to parry and dodge his blows. LOMBARD manages to pierce the Cyclops<BR>
with his razor sharp halberd several times, but the CYCLOPS shows little<BR>
damage. Meanwhile, the bare fists of the CYCLOPS are tearing into LOMBARD,<BR>
causing him visible injury.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
LOMBARD<BR>
This beast is stronger than I realized.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
DOBIN<BR>
zone
<P>
<BR>
LOMBARD and DOBIN realize their plight and head down the bridge to escape<BR>
the CYCLOPS. As soon as they get to the middle of the bridge, the screen<BR>
goes blank and we see the message:<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
2. NORTH KARANA. Rolling hills in this open land. Our heroes emerge on<BR>
the other side of the bridge. Behind them, they can see no trace of the<BR>
CYCLOPS. HARRYBALZ is sitting down on the bridge in front of them,<BR>
greatly injured.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
LOMBARD<BR>
It would appear that it is far too dangerous to hunt in that land. This<BR>
is a new land I see before us here, perhaps we should try to...<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
LOMBARD is suddenly interrupted by a loud clap of thunder. Suddenly, a<BR>
thick bank of fog rolls quickly in and the rain begins to fall. LOMBARD<BR>
and DOBIN look at each other, and then begin to laugh as we...
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
FADE OUT
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
During blackness, and before ending credits roll
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
HARRYBALZ<BR>
Dood, cn u heal me plz?
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
