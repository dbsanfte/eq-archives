<p>
<p>
The main cultural skill for dark elves is smithing - solid chain and plate for the tanks and hybrids as well as lightweight caster-wearable chain. With the advent of LoY, they also began to show some minor skill at tailoring, with the addition of 6 tailored robes that can be made only by dark elves.
</p>
<p>
As with all "cultural" tradeskills, final combines can ONLY be performed by the race in question.  In this case, that means real dark elves, not illusioned ones.
