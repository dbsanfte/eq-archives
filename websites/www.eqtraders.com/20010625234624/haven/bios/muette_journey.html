      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When Muette was a 
        child, she witnessed a dark elven child being horribly mauled by a young 
        kodiak. She had no weapon, training or profession at that point, but still 
        Muette launched into the fray, punching and kicking for all her young 
        body was worth. She gave a very good accounting of herself, but still, 
        she was too untrained, and the kodiak had the benefit of bulk and natural 
        weaponry.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All would have been 
        lost if not for an elder monk who had heard the ruckus. After he had killed 
        the bear and bandaged their wounds, he turned to young Muette, his voice 
        taking on a censurious tone.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Young one, 
        what you did should have gotten you killed ... and for the sake of a dark 
        elf spawn, no less! Have you never heard of running?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She refused to be 
        cowed by his formidable stare. &quot;Much better that I die than another, 
        respected elder. Regardless of race, he deserves better than to be dinner 
        for a bear! I had been hoping to distract it enough that he could run. 
        Barring that, I'd hoped to goad it and lead it back to the guards.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">His stare softened 
        a bit at her words, as well as by the stubborn look in her eyes. This 
        was no foolish youngling as he had first thought. She fully realized the 
        danger in her actions, but had made a conscious choice to risk her own 
        life to save another. Additionally, for an untrained youngling, she seemed 
        to have a natural speed and reflexes that would be the envy of many a 
        belted monk.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It had been long 
        since he had taken a student. Long since he had found any that measured 
        up to his exacting standards ...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Young Muette stood 
        still under that stare as long as she cared to. When his look became introspective, 
        she moved to check on the wounded boy's bandages. Then, not realizing 
        that his gaze had returned to her, she stood and tried to move her hands 
        to exacute a strike she had seen him use on the wounded bear.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;I stand corrected, 
        lass. It was a brave thing you did, though your body is not yet as strong 
        as your heart is large.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She whirled to face 
        him, her chin coming up stubbornly. &quot;Then I must make it stronger, 
        sir monk.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">His gaze measured 
        her once more. &quot;If ye do not remember to grab a weapon before your 
        next such fray, ye may not have a body left to strengthen.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;But, if I turn 
        my body into a weapon, sir, I shall never want for one when someone is 
        in need of aid.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By Quellious, was 
        that a challenge he saw in the wee snippet's eyes? She definitely had 
        spunk! &quot;Who be your parents, lass?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;I am an orphan, 
        a ward of the city of Freeport.&quot; Her chin came up another notch, 
        as if she expected pity ... or scorn.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;I see. So none 
        who would grieve if ye left, and mayhaps some who would rejoice in one 
        less mouth to feed?&quot; He chose a tone sure to prick a child's pride 
        ... he <i>had</i> to be sure of her.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She flushed at his 
        words, but her tone was respectful, if a bit strained. &quot;Just so, 
        sir. You have the right of it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Then, lass, 
        how would you like to learn the <i>proper</i> way to perform that eagle 
        strike, and many other things as well?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The soul-deep joy 
        in her eyes was answer enough.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">By the time her teacher 
        passed from this world, and into the world of the spirits, she had learned 
        many things indeed ... but that is a tale for another time.</font></p>
