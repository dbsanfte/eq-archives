      <span class="headers">Gates of Discord Alchemy Collect</span>
<p>
<p>This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.<p>
This quest allows a shaman to progress to skill 54 in alchemy, <b>provided that your character level will allow you to progress to skill 54</b>. (Remember that alchemy is level capped, and that this quest can only be completed once per character - if you finish the quest before you are allowed to progress to skill 54, you cannot go back later and get the rest of the skill points for free.)
</p>
<p>Each step requires that you collect taelosian sludge, which you then hand to Lita Hegeway, next to Jorlan Hegeway in the hold of the ship. She will hand back two samples of filtered taelosian sludge.  You then hand Jorlan one of the samples of filtered taelosian sludge in order to receive stacks of 10 of the raw materials to make something for him. Each step will require that you give him 30 completed items, so you will need at least 3 samples of filtered taelosian sludge per step (more if you are prone to failure). You must give the sludge to Jorlan one at a time, complete all the combines, and give him back all the finished product before you give him more sludge. When you complete step 4, you will be taught how to process the alchemy-specific raw material, taelosian sludge. However, please note that at this time none of the new GoD alchemy recipes require the use of this new material, so the processing ability is not as important as the skillups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Jorlan Hegeway'</p>
<p>Jorlan Hegeway looks at you appraisingly. 'Have you any skill at alchemy? I certainly could use some [assistance] providing the unusual items that the Wayfarers are always in need of.'</p>
<p>You say, 'What assistance?'</p>
<p>Jorlan Hegeway says 'As the master alchemist on board, it is my duty to provide some of the more [unique chemicals] used on the ship. Unfortunately, this has prevented me from furthering my research on the unusual sludge that comes from the continent. My partner Lita also has some tasks that she may need help with and she can filter samples of Taelosian sludge for you. Me, I am trying to study the sludge that comes from the highland regions of the continent, particularly the mountainous areas. Something about those areas has imbued the [highland sludge] with unusual properties.'</p>
<p>You say, 'what unique chemicals?'</p>
<p>Jorlan Hegeway says 'I believe you can be of assistance to me, but I need some Sample of Filtered Taelosian Sludge that we can work with.  Lita can filter a Sample of Taelosian Sludge for you. If you bring some filtered sludge to me, I can get you started helping out. If you help me I could teach you the secret of filtering the sludge. You'll have to work hard, but because the tasks I will be asking of you require you to bring your own materials, I can reward you sooner than Lita will.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STEP ONE: Abysmal Sea Breathing Potion</p>
<p>Hand him one of the samples of filtered taelosian sludge that you received from Lita, as per the above instructions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jorlan Hegeway says 'Thank you for helping out.  Your first task will be to help me with some water breathing potions.  These are special, easier to make than most because they will be very limited in nature.  They will only work here in the Abysmal Sea.  Take a Sea Turtle Lung, a Flask of Abysmal Sea Water and a Small Sample of Filtered Taelosian Sludge and combine them in your medicine bag to produce the potion.  Bring them back to me when you are done.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give Lita a Sample of Taelosian Sludge and receive back two Samples of Filtered Taelosian Sludge.  Give one of the filtered sludges to Jorlan.  He then gives you enough materials to make 10 Abysmal Sea Breathing Potions.  Combine them in a medicine bag and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 40 Abysmal Sea Breathing Potions, when he will move to step two.</p>
<p>STEP TWO: Simple Taelosian Disease Cure Potion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jorlan Hegeway says 'Ah, good.  I need a good volume of disease curing potions.  We are not yet certain what sort of plagues may exist here.  These are not too hard to make.  Just take one of these Taelosian Insects and combine it in your medicine bag with a Small Sample of Filtered Taelosian Sludge.  The insects should have samples of any illnesses we should have to worry about, and the sludge, used properly, will tame them.  When you have the potions, please bring them back to me.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give another filtered sludge to Jorlan.  He then gives you enough materials to make 10 Simple Taelosian Disease Cure Potions.  Combine them in a medicine bag and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Simple Taelosian Disease Cure Potions, when he will move to step three.</p>
<p>STEP THREE: Jorlan's Amazing Cleaner</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jorlan Hegeway says 'Your efforts are appreciated.  I need more of a substance that I call Jorlan's Amazing Cleaner.  I use it for many things lately.  Primarily it's a fantastic cleaner.  But it can be used in a few potions and such that I'm going to keep to myself.  If you could take a Small Sample of Filtered Taelosian Sludge, a Orange Rind and two Chunk of Sandstone, combine them in your medicine bag and bring them back to me, I'd be grateful.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get more filtered sludge from Lita and give one to Jorlan.  He then gives you enough materials to make 10 Jorlan's Amazing Cleaner.  Combine them in a medicine bag and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 40 Jorlan's Amazing Cleaner, when he will move to step four.</p>
<p>STEP FOUR: Wayfarer Special Waterproofer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jorlan Hegeway says 'Bless your ancestors!  I could certainly use some Wayfarers Special Waterproofer.  It's not that hard to make.  You just take this Sticky Tree Sap and combine it with a Sample of Filtered Taelosian Sludge in your medicine bag and you have it.  Bring it back to me as soon as you can, I have a lot of potters waiting on that stuff.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give Jorlan another filtered sludge.  He then gives you enough materials to make 10 Wayfarer Special Waterproofer.  Combine them in a medicine bag and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Wayfarer Special Waterproofer.  Then get another batch of filtered sludge from Lita and hand one to Jorlan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jorlan Hegeway says 'You've been of great assistance.  I owe you my thanks.  I'll find others to do these tasks now.  Go over and talk to Lita and she'll give you your reward.  Make sure to tell her that you were here to [help out].'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow his instructions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'help out?'</p>
<p>Lita Hegeway says 'You've been a great help already.  I sense that you have greater tasks to attend to and there are fledglings about that can continue your work.  As a reward for you assistance, please allow me to teach you the secret of filtering the Taelosian sludge. '  Lita leans forward and whispers directly in you ear.  What she tells you makes sense and you believe that you can now filter the sludge.  All you need to do is put the Sample of Taelosian Sludge into your medicine bag and combine.  This will return a Sample of Filtered Taelosian Sludge.  You believe that with continued work on filtering the sludge you may be able to improve your results.'</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>You now have the ability to turn Samples of Taelosian Sludge into Samples of Filtered Taelosian Sludge in your medicine bag.
