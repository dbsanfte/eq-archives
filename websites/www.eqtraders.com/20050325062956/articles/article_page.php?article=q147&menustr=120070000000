<p>
<p><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Kaladim. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, DWF/BER only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one. All dwarf berserkers get the same quest and armor, regardless of diety.</i></p>
