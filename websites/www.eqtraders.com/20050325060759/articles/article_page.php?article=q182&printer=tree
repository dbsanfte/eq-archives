<span class="headers">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Armor Quest Overview</span>
<p>
<p>The only quests available in the Dragons of Norrath expansion are those to acquire the starting material to make the cultural armors that are available with the DoN expansion.  (Do not confuse these with the "old" cultural, which involves no questing and has blue diamonds as a primary ingredient.  That is completely different.  The rest of this discussion refers only to the DoN cultural armor.)</p>

<p><b>This page has not yet been thoroughly fact-checked.  A few details here and there may be off.  If you find something wrong or have additional info to offer, please <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/forumdisplay.php?f=100">let us know</a>.</b></p>

<p>There are four sets of DoN cultural armor available, each with a sets of augment "symbols" to dramatically improve the quality of the armor.  Each set (or "tier") of symbols has a different minimum level required <b>to be able to make it</b>, in addition to different recommended and required levels for wearing it.  We're talking about the level of your character, not the level of tradeskills.  (The different tiers of armor can be made at any level.)  The names and required levels to make the symbols are: journeyman (level 15), expert (level 35), master (level 55), grandmaster (level 65). Only the grandmaster tier symbols require access to the Dragons of Norrath expansion.  (Grandmaster tier armor may also require drops from DoN.)  The lower tiers can be done without DoN.</p>

<p>You start the process by going to a city where your race can start.  Every home city has a quest NPC for each race that can start there.  Those npcs will only give you the quests needed to make the tiers of armor available to you.  The quests come in two types, each of which results in a different book.  The first of those books, the "ancestral book", is used to make the molds (for smithed chain and plate) or patterns (for tailored leather and silk) for the armor.  This book can only be used a certain number of times (as yet undetermined) before it wears out.  However, as the book it is used for making all of the different cultural armors for your race, the quest is reported to be comfortably soloable by a level 15-20.</p>

<p>The other books, hereafter referred to as the "symbol books", are used to make the symbol augments for use on the cultural armor.  The symbols, can only be used on cultural armor but improve the quality of the armor substantially.  The augments are deity-specific, covering every possible deity for each race, including agnostics.  The stats are very similar for every deity, apparently varying only in minor ways to suit the races and classes that deity generally attracts.</p>

<p><b>Quest for the Ancestral Book ("Pattern Book")</b></p>

<p>This quest gets you the book to make molds and patterns to make the cultural armor.  You must complete this quest to proceed, as the book is an actual ingredient for making the molds and patterns.  To start, talk to your cultural tradeskill quest npc in your home city, looking for them to mention a "pattern book".  Ask about the pattern book, and you will be told to bring a few things from nearby zones back.  Which things you need will depend on which city you are in.  When you return and hand in the items, you will be given the ancestral book for your race, plus some experience and faction with your city.</p>

<p><b>Prepare to Make the Armor</b></p>

<p><i><u>Make molds or patterns with the ancestral book</u></i>: Once you have obtained your copy of your race's ancestral book, you can make the molds and patterns for your race's cultural armor.  Before doing this you will need to have one general inventory slot open, as the recipe will generate a bags of materials.  That's a main inventory slot, NOT a slot within any container.  When you're ready, find a vendor with the right materials.  Each city should have one; refer to your race's cultural quest page for more details.  If you want molds for smithing plate or chain, combine the book with a huge block of clay, a compacted backpack, sculpting tools, and a high quality firing sheet in a kiln.  This combine cannot be failed.  You will get back your sculpting tools plus a bag containing eight stacks of patterns: one each for boots, chestplates, gloves, helms, leggings, sleeves, and wristguards.  If you want patterns for tailoring leather or silk, combine the book with a compacted backpack, large bottle of ink, quill, and roll of plain parchment in a book binding.  You will get a backpack just like that for smithing, with stacks of patterns for making the same types of armors.</p>

<p><i><u>Make cultural sewing kit and needle</u></i>: (This is only for tailored cultural armor, as smithed cultural uses the cultural hammer from vendors and cultural forge.) To make the cultural sewing kit you combine a small brick of your cultural metal with a water flask, needle mold and thimble mold in your cultural forge.  To make the cultural needle, combine your culture's essence (also used for making faithstones) with an embroidery needle in any forge.</p>

<p><i><b>NOTE:</b></i> The cultural sewing kits which existed before the Dragons of Norrath expansion will not work for these recipes.  They will only work for their original recipes.  You must make a kit with the DoN recipe to make the DoN cultural armors.  Cultural forges have also been tweaked, but in a helpful way.  You can do all ordinary smithing combines in your own race's cultural forges, as well as in the usual forges.  But you are still unable to use other race's cultural forges.</p>

<p><i><u>Make cultural material</u></i>: There are four different tiers of cultural metal, which correspond to the four tiers of armor that can be made.  You must match the material you use to the tier of armor you are making.  The exact ingredients for each material vary by race.  For smithing, the materials are metal bars, made from one item drop, one small brick of a vendor metal, and one cultural hammer, combined in a cultural forge.  (There are also alternative recipes using more drops and larger bricks of vendor metal to yield more finished bars.)  The bars are for cultural chain, or can be combined with water and your cultural hammer to make sheets for cultural plate.  For tailoring, the materials are hides or swatches, made from a particular hide or a particular silk swatch (made from dropped silks), a small spool of a vendor thread, and your cultural needle in your cultural kit.  (Here again, there are alternative recipes using more drops and larger spools to yield more finished hides and swatches.) For tailoring, the hide or swatch used will also vary by tier as well as race.</p>

<p><b>Make the Armor</b> <i>(Finally!)</i></p>

<p>For both smithing and tailoring, the number of cultural materials (sheets/bars/hides/swatches) per armor piece is:</p>
<blockquote>
</p>
3: chest & legs<br />
2: head & feet<br />
1: arms, wrists & hands
</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i><u>Smithing (Chain & Plate)</u></i>: In your cultural forge, you combine: 1 large brick of your cultural vendor metal (same as for making the bars), 1 armor mold for the slot of armor you want, your cultural smithy hammer, and the right quantity of bars (for chain) or sheets (for plate) for that slot of armor. (See the list just above for the quantities by slot.)

<p><i><u>Tailoring (Leather & Silk)</u></i>: In your cultural sewing kit, you combine: 1 large spool of your cultural vendor thread (same as for making the hides and swatches), 1 armor pattern for the slot of armor you want, your cultural needle, and the right quantity of hides (for leather) or swatches (for silk) for that slot of armor. (See the list just above for the quantities by slot.)</p>

<p><b>Quest for the Symbol Book (or "cultural symbol patterns", or "book of culture")</b></p>

<p>These will vary depending on your race.  See your race's DoN cultural quest page for more details.  They are given by the same NPC as gave you the quest for your Ancestral Book.  Look for the NPC to talk about "cultural symbol patterns". When getting these quests, be very careful to note the order in which the NPC explains the quest steps.  They will tell you about the level 15, then level 35, then level 55, and then level 65 quests.  For each tier you must complete the first parts and then return to the quest giver to be given the second parts.  You will not get credit for the kills or drops unless you have first been given that part of the quest by the NPC, before doing the killing and looting.  (If the creature you kill is a special named, you may also not get credit for either the kill or the loot.)  These tasks may vary slightly by race, sometimes with small additional steps.  See your race's writeup for more details.  But <i>in general</i>, they consist of:</p>

<p><i><u>Journeyman</u></i>: Kill 20 of a type of creature and get at least 4 of a certain drop from that creature.  Then kill 10 of a certain creature and get at least 1 of a certain drop from that creature.</p>

<p><i><u>Expert</u></i>: Kill 50 of a type of creature and get at least 10-20 of a certain drop from that creature.  Then kill 5 of a certain creature and get at least 1 of a certain drop from that creature.</p>

<p><i><u>Master</u></i>: Kill 80 of a type of creature and get at least 40 of a certain drop from that creature.  Then kill 5 of a certain creature and get at least 1 of a certain drop from that creature.</p>

<p><i><u>Grandmaster</u></i>: <b>You need to be doing a DoN mission in order to get the drops you need for the grandmaster quest.  The same mobs outside of a mission will count towards your kill count but will not drop the items.</b> Kill 120 of a type of creature and get at least 80 of a certain drop from that creature.  Then kill 10 of a type of creature and get at least 1 of a certain drop from that creature.</p>

<p>Upon completing each of these quests you will get the Book of your Culture for that tier (for example, the Journeyman's Book of Barbarian Culture, or the Master's Book of Halfing Culture).

<p><b>Gather Symbol Materials</b></p>

<p><i><u>Make symbol patterns with the symbol book</u></i>: Here again, before doing this you will need to have one general inventory slot open, as the recipe will generate a bags of materials.  That's a main inventory slot, NOT a slot within any container.  When you're ready, find a vendor with the right materials.  Each city should have one; refer to your race's cultural quest page for more details.  Buy a book binding.  In it combine your book of culture, a compacted backpack, a quill, a large bottle of ink, and a roll of the right kind of vellum for the tier of armor you wish the symbol to augment.  (That's "vellum", <i>not</i> "velium".) The tiers and their vellums are: vellum for journeyman, good quality vellum for expert, high quality vellum for master, and superb vellum for grandmaster.  The quill used is the same one that is used for spell research.  This combine cannot be failed.  You will get back a bag containing eight stacks of symbol patterns: one each for boots, chestplates, gloves, helms, leggings, sleeves, and wristguards.</p>

<p><i><u>Make imbued water</u></i>: I call this water "imbued" because it is deity-specific.  It does not actually use the imbue spells or the gems they make that have been used in cultural tradeskills before DoN.  Instead, to imbue the water for DoN cultural, you buy a blessed water from a vendor in your guild hall and combine it in a jewelcraft kit with a particular drop for the tier of armor you wish your symbol to augment.  The items are jade shards for journeyman, lambent stones for expert, crushed diamond dust for master, and purescale ore for grandmaster.  The blessed waters are sold in the class guild halls in your starting cities, where you go for your class's guild trainers and where casters buy most vendor spells (not in the guild hall you share with your guildmates and access from the Plane of Knowledge). Guild halls sell the waters for all of the dieties that can be worshipped by race(s) of that city who are also a class served by that guild hall.  If the race(s) and class(es) served by that guild hall can also be agnostic, water is also available to imbue for that.</p>

<p><i><u>Gather the symbol base</u></i>: You make a symbol base that will be the actual material turned into the augment. The base you use depends on the tier of symbol you wish to make.  For chain or plate the bases are: warbone chips for journeyman, fire opals for expert, shissar scales for master, and metallic drake scales for grandmaster.  For leather or silk the bases are: silk swatch for journeyman, drachnid silk swatch for expert, nightmare silk swatch for master, and coarse silk swatch for grandmaster.</p>

<p><b>Make the Symbol</b></p>

<p>When you have crafted this symbol, it will only be able to be used on a slot of cultural armor, and will restrict its use to followers of a particular deity.  You can, however, put a symbol of one tier on a piece of armor from a different tier.  At any rate, it will enhance the stats quite impressively.  Furthermore, the smithed and tailored versions appear to be the same items.  So as far as we know, you can use a tailored symbol on smithed armor, and vice versa.</p>

<p><i><u>Smithing (Chain & Plate)</u></i>: Combine the symbol pattern with the imbued water and the dropped item for that tier, in any forge.</p>

<p><i><u>Tailoring (Leather & Silk)</u></i>: Combine the symbol pattern with the imbued water and the swatch for that tier, in any sewing kit. </p>

<p><b>Augment the Armor with the Symbol</b></p>

<p>At long last, you can augment your cultural armor with its symbol to get the full stats offered by the DoN cultural.  <b>Remember that when you apply an attunable augment, it becomes no drop.  Only the person who applies the augment to the armor will be able to keep the augment.  (To sell the armor, the augment will have to be removed and will remain no drop.)</b>  You apply the augment in the same way you apply any other augment to any other armor: in the augmentation sealers (also known as "bird baths") found at Wayfarer Camps and in the guild halls accessed through the Plane of Knowledge (not the ones in home cities).  At least as of right now, these are the only augments that fit in type 11 slots, and the only armors that hold type 11 augments.</p>

<p>Great work!</p></p><p>
