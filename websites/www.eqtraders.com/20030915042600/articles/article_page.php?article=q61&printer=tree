<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Felwithe. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, HEF/HIE,PAL only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Armor is blue in color. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one </i>

Find this Centurion Relgle, slay him for his crimes against the Koada`Dal, then do the same to his Teir`Dal ally. Bring me both their heads when the deed is done.'

Once that is accomplished bring me the Sharp Felwithe Defender's Sword, a Pristine Forest Drakeling Scales, and an Arborean Amber and i will put the finishing touches on the weapon.
