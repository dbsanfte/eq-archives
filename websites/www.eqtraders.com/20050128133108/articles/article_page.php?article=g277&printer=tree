One thing, however, has stayed rather consistent for the last couple of those years.  Every time there was a new expansion, and every time Ngreth and I went to a Fan Faire, I could be heard to whimper, sometimes loudly, for a "straightjacket of tradeskilling."<p>
Let's face it, anyone who tries to track this many items, recipes, mobs, drops, forages and so forth for a splinter group of gaming junkies (I resemble that remark!), has got to be a bit crazed.<p>
Regardless of whether I get "paid" in donations, chocolates, heartfelt thanks, or just more spam posts from board trolls, I just keep plugging along, brain often pretzeling during the times when a few thousand new recipes are all released at once. It may be insanity, but it's <i>my</i> insanity of choice.<p>
I never really expected anything to come of my whimpering. After all, the devs have more than enough on their plates without custom-making an item for one demented redhead. I didn't, however, take into account one very devious and determined House Ogre.<p>
Imagine my surprise when I was having an especially annoying fight with over 100 problem entries in the database today, to be handed a lovely gift bag by my grinning hubby. Lo and behold, at long last, I have my very own Straightjacket of Tradeskilling, complete with site name and all.
