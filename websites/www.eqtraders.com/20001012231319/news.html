<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">September 
  30:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> New non-alcoholic 
  brewing recipes have been found in a newly-added recipe book.(Thanks, Ikipu!) 
  Experimentation has already verified several more recipes, based on the guidelines 
  provided within it. As more recipes are verified, the <a href="secrets/brewing.html" target="mainright">brewing 
  recipes</a> page will grow. Wood elves now have a cultural forge and a few recipes 
  for <a href="secrets/woodelf.html" target="mainright">mithril weapons</a> have 
  been determined (thanks, Snowscale!) Slowly, we're getting information on various 
  cultural smithing items (stats, recipe verifications, etc.) Sometimes the recipes 
  pages will change hourly, as I try to get you the most up-to-date information. 
  A good rule of thumb before you're about to sign on for a trade skill session 
  is to check the recipes page first, then quickly browse through the message 
  boards, in case there's something on there I've not had a chance to web yet.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">My mailbox 
  and the message board are still very active with recipe corrections and additions. 
  However, I'm starting to notice a disturbing trend. I've received several emails 
  and seen several posts announcing something &quot;new&quot; or something &quot;broken&quot;, 
  when they *correct* information has been on my site for several days (or longer). 
  I can't control what other sites put up for recipes &lt;grin&gt;, so if you 
  find something that doesn't work, be sure you got the information from my site 
  before you report it to me. If my site has it wrong, by all means, <a href="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">let 
  me know</a> so I can fix it! :)</font>
<p> 
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>September 
  27:</b> The patch was finally completed, and yours truly went on a sleep deprivation 
  binge in order to get new, correct, information onto the site. There are still 
  missing recipes, the cultural recipes section needs cleaning up, etc., but a 
  LOT of information is now available. We now have fully verified temper recipes 
  from numerous sources, we know which dye extracts are currently not working, 
  other recipes and rumors are being chased down, and the dust is finally settling. 
  I'm working on a page that will show what the <a href="secrets/dysample.html" target="mainright">various 
  dyes look like</a>, and will be starting housekeeping on the <a href="secrets/culture.html" target="mainright">cultural 
  recipes</a>, so that the individual pages are easier to read. Any new smithing 
  recipes that are not cultural in origin (limited to being made by a specific 
  race), will be on the <a href="secrets/advanced_smith.html" target="mainright">advanced smithing</a> 
  page. A LOT of active discussion is going on in the message boards, including 
  talk of fishing and possible uses for the tacklebox, a discussion of Cabilis 
  hints on some unique recipes over there, folks trying to sort out the entire 
  enchant/imbue concept as it applies to armor, etc., etc. Stop on over, ask a 
  question, share your knowledge ... the more we share, the more we all can learn 
  about new recipes that are being discovered almost daily. </font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">My many, many, 
  thanks to all who have helped make this huge patch more manageable. From adopting 
  zones and checking merchants, to posting recipes, to providing feedback on trivials 
  and broken recipes and more, your help is making this site a truly useful resource 
  to folks working on tradeskills. Keep up the lovely work!</font>
<p> 
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>September 
  13:</b> The patch has been delayed until Friday, but I am beyond heartened at 
  the folks who have been stepping forward to help verify merchant offerings after 
  the patch. It will save me a lot of time and effort.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I'm going 
  to sit back and try to breathe for a day or two before the patch now that I'm 
  done with my RL scramble to get things ready. Over the weekend, my hubby and 
  a guildmate scrambled to get me more ready for the post-patch site mayhem. Since 
  our cablemodem ISP only allows us a limited number of IP addy's, and all three 
  were in use, they got me set up behind a router so that I could add a second 
  machine in my &quot;office&quot;. (My old PC, with a total brainwipe/reformat). 
  Now, I can finally be exploring in EQ, and be able to not only call up the site 
  to verify things, but be able to edit on-the-fly while still in-game. This should 
  save a tree or two a year, as it means I'll not be having to scribble on the 
  nearest slip of paper every time I find a new merchant that needs to be added 
  to the site. :) ... and I type MUCH faster than I write, too. </font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Anyway, we 
  seem to be in good shape for the merchant listing end of the post-patch mayhem. 
  The recipes section is going to be in upheaval for a while, as there are a LOT 
  of new recipes, and cross-skill recipes that need to go in. As always, I'm not 
  even thinking of touching them until we're sure they've gone live.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><i>Thought 
  for the day: You know you're an EQ junkie when you schedule your chiropractor's 
  appointment to coincide with patch time, so that it doesn't interrupt your questing. 
  (It's a shame they changed the patch day on me at the last minute!)</i></font>
<p> 
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>September 
  5:</b> While we're waiting for the big smithing patch to be implemented, other 
  little discoveries have been trickling through. Thanks to folks active on the 
  message boards, we now have verified recipes for sliced cake, and pound cake, 
  and hopefully we'll have more discoveries in the days to come. Once the smithing 
  changes are in place, I'll be posting on the message board asking folks to &quot;adopt&quot; 
  a zone to re-explore and verify merchant offerings. I'll also be asking folks 
  to post new recipe verifications, so we can pool the information quickly for 
  this.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Keep up the 
  good work, gang ... it's thanks to all my &quot;regulars&quot; that this site 
  is as useful as it is.</font>
<p> 
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font> 
<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">August 
  24:</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> It looks 
  like some, but not all of the smithing (and resulting tailoring) changes are 
  live on production. I'm not going to get frantic about verifying new recipes 
  and re-verify every merchant until after the rest of the changes are in place 
  -- it's just too time-consuming for a single person to do. Known new stuff working 
  on the live servers includes silk thread, silk bandages, silk cord, and hooked 
  arrowheads (possibly some of the other arrowheads as well, but I've not tested 
  other stuff yet). I've seen copies of *other* smithing and tailoring recipes 
  that are currently functioning on test, but since there's never a guarantee 
  that what is on test will stay that way from day to day, I'm not worrying about 
  posting them right yet.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When the smithing 
  changes are implemented, I will need help! A lot of the new smithing recipes 
  are going to use materials not currently on the live servers. When they go live, 
  merchant inventories will also change ... across the entire world. Anyone who 
  wants to &quot;adopt&quot; a zone to re-explore, please remember the following. 
  If you do NOT give me all the correct information, then it will take me even 
  longer than normal to run around and re-verify stuff -- which means it takes 
  longer to be posted on this site. For ANY report of new merchants, new items 
  on merchants, etc., I need 1) zone name, 2) merchant name, 3) merchant /loc, 
  as well as any landmarks, 4) exact item names. Sending me something that says: 
  &quot;The windmill in the Lake of Ill Omen has poison stuff&quot; just means 
  that I have to spend time to get one of my personas over to that zone and then 
  figure out where this doggone windmill is located. ;) It's still nice to get 
  the head's up, but it adds a couple days of delay onto anything being posted, 
  as I have to add it to the pile of things &quot;to do&quot; for the site ... 
  and for those not familiar with the force behind this site, it's a single-person 
  operation that costs me a lot of my personal time and pp to maintain. If you 
  find the info on this site useful, and you want to contribute, jotting down 
  that extra information requested above and sending it to me means that I can 
  free up more of my time on some of the more difficult or more expensive information 
  to verify.</font>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>July 21:</b> 
  Hopefully the servers are stable now, and the patches of the patches are done 
  for now. Reports are trickling in that the tailoring fixes are fixed, though 
  no mention was made of the studded tunic. A bit of research has shown reports 
  of the tailored quiver now being in-game, and while the quiver itself is nothing 
  to get excited about using, it is being reported as a way to increase your tailoring 
  skill above 108.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some poison 
  merchants have been updated (Dagnors, Lesser Faydark), and I'm going to be handing 
  poison books over to my linguist for translation of the one from Dagnors, since 
  my dwarvish isn't up to par). I missed the poison merchant in Steamfont, and 
  forgot to check the one in Kaladim while I was over there. If anyone can provide 
  me with full details of merchant name and location, that would be great, and 
  I'll catch them on my next trip over.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've received 
  some feedback on more merchants with poison supplies, etc., but very little 
  of it provides all the details I need (merchant name, /loc, exact items sold, 
  etc.) I will go and personally verify the information before I post it, but 
  it's time-consuming to do so, and requires me begging teleports all over the 
  place or long boat rides. Please have patience if you've provided me partial 
  information and it is not posted yet. :D If you know of a poison merchant not 
  listed yet, or have updated information on one that is listed, please be as 
  complete as possible on any information you <a href="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">send 
  me</a>.</font>

  I've just spent the better part of an hour scrounging some information on the 
  new poisons that went in with the last patch. Many new <a href="secrets/poison.html" target="mainright">recipes</a> 
  have been listed, most still need research before they are complete. If there 
  are any rogues out there that can provide more feedback (information on where

  For those of you who are listed in the Marketplace section of the website, please 
  email me with any updates or corrections to your listing (or ask me to remove 
  it if you're no longer providing the items/services). I am now providing dates 
  on any new additions/corrections to the listings, so that folks will be able 
  to tell if an ad is current, or if it's been gathering dust for a year or so. 
  (Note that old ads will not be backdated, as I've not kept the hundreds of pieces 
  of email that went into creating the Marketplace listings.) Please remember 
  to include not only your character name, but also your server name. A good quarter 
  of the listings I receive require extra back-and-forth email to get such &quot;little&quot; 
  details that were forgotten the first time around.</font> 
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I got my requisite 
  once or twice a month insulting email today, and as usual, the person in question 
  couldn't even form a proper sentence, or remember what capitalization was for.

  the hard work of a group of people (for yes, many of you have contributed to 
  this site, making it yours as well as mine) without having a single productive 
  thing to say? <i>&lt;shrugs&gt;</i> They got their 10-second claim to fame in 
  my rant regarding their unsigned letter, and it's been quite happily trashed 
  as not having a single redeeming value. <i>(For those of you with constructive

  those of you who are actively testing things and sending back feedback, thank 
  you. There's only so much time in a week, and your feedback makes this site 
  better for everyone. I think we're definitely onto something with the varying 
  trivial levels (June 8 news below), based on notes compared by several people. 
  So, if you get a slightly (off by 4 or less) different trivial level than one 
  mentioned on one of these pages, don't worry. It may just be that your race/class/int/wis 
  combination has an easier/harder time learning than the one who tested that 
  batch of trivials.</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>June 08:</b> 
  I'm starting to chase down quests that require trade skills, and include them 
  on the appropriate trade skill recipe pages. I've added an unverified recipe 
  for embalming fluid to the brewing page, and shadow silk and a Cabilis tapestry 
  quest to the tailoring page. Once the dust settles a bit more in my new home, 
  I hope to go do yet another zone-by-zone exploration to re-verify trade supply 
  locations, update the jewel listings with more details, and see if I can figure 
  out where I last saw tall beers ... and somewhere in there actually get to play 
  the game some as well. ;)</font>

  to all of you who've been providing feedback and details on trivials, etc. for 
  me as it saves me a lot of extra time and effort.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've been 
  noticing some odd stuff with trivials, and will need to do some time-consuming 
  testing to verify. My RL hubby has an erudite wizzie with a ridiculously high 
  INT, and trivial levels *seem* to be a bit lower on some things (we were working 
  the wizzie up in brewing when we noticed it). When my hubby and I have some 
  time, I'll probably try testing the wizzie vs. a dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks character 
  on another trade skill (tailoring or baking) and see if they get different trivials 
  for things. If anyone else has witnessed this phenomenon, please let me know.</font>

  recipes</a> page I had mentioned on the message board. Several more player-merchants 
  were added to the Marketplace, including our first ad for someone on Morrell-Thule. 
  I also did some minor updates to many of the recipes pages, including some reminders 
  about trade skills and a) stacked items and b) water. Geimhreadh, a ranger on 
  Tribunal, has also provided me with some lovely clarifications on trivial levels 
  for arrows. I hope to have that information on the fletching page soon.</font>

  note, the giggle of the week comes from a trade skills message board post (I
