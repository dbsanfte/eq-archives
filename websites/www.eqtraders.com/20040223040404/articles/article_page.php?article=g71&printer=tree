Erudites excel with the needle and thread, making silk armor that seems as solid as steel, as well as lighter-weight robes.  In addition, they need to perform minor amounts of smithing, in order to fashion the threads needed for some of the more advanced tailoring.

<p>
As with all other cultural tradeskills, unless otherwise specified, these items must be made by someone of the proper race (Erudite) using their cultural tradeskill containers (cultural forge, erudite sewing kit). Note that cultural tradeskill containers are not fooled by illusions.
