      <span class="headers">Gates of Discord Fletching Freebie</span>
<p>
<p>This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.</p>

<p>The completion of this quest will allow you to progress to fletching skill 54, without spending any money. It will also allow you to learn how to process a chunk of Taelosian rock into a Taelosian Stone, which is used to make new arrows.</p>

<p>This quest begins down in the hold of the Queen of Thorns, with a fletching vendor that has been the bane of my existence, named Imildu Woodstreak.</p>

<p><b>Quick Summary</b>:<br>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Imildu Woodstreak'</p>
<p>Imildu Woodstreak says ''Welcome Niami, Tunare smiles upon us all.  I don't want to impose, I know that we are all very busy, but if you have the time and inclination, I could use your help finishing some [tasks] that have been overwhelming me.''</p>
<p>You say, 'what tasks?'</p>
<p>Imildu Woodstreak says ''As you may know, many of our scouts have been lost. That has not kept us from trying to explore, but to do so we need supplies. We also must keep those that stay behind stocked with weapons to use in our defense. This has kept me in here working on those supplies and has prevented me from getting out to see the new lands. A dwarf brought me back some strange stone from Taelosia and it's made me want to go out and explore with all my heart. The stone has magical properties too. If treated properly, it can be used much like flint to make some of the sharpest arrowheads I've ever come across. If you could [aid] me with some of the simple tasks, I might be able to do more work with the [Taelosian Stone].''</p>
<p>You say, 'what taelosian stone?'</p>
<p>Imildu Woodstreak says ''Truly unusual material. I suspect that there has been some long-term unnatural stress on it. If handled one way, it can be ground to powder relatively easily, but with some clever manipulation it can be sheared to make very fine edges. It also seems to hold some magical potential, though. I just haven't had time to explore that possibility. If you come across a Chunk of Taelosian Rock, please bring it to me. I'll treat it for you at the cost of keeping a small portion of the treated stone for myself.''</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STEP ONE</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'what aid?'</p>
<p>Imildu Woodstreak  nods to you.  'You are as welcome here as a shade tree in the Desert of Ro, friend.  I and others have created the components needed to make arrows for the Wayfarers.  I would be grateful if you could do the final assembly for me.  Just take a Wayfarer Arrowhead, a Wayfarer Shaft, and a Wayfarer Fletching and combine them in your fletching kit.  There are many chores that need to be completed.  If you assist me with them, I might be willing to share with you the secret for treating the Chunks of Taelosian Rock to create the useful Taelosian Stones.  When you have those arrows finished, please bring the right back to me and I will make certain that they get to those that need them.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additional NPC text is not available at this time, but if you ask him "what aid?", but, from here, it progresses like the other "freebie" quests in this series, with you giving him 100 of the indicated item before he will progress to the next of the four steps. When you complete all four steps, he will teach you how to refine the chunks of taelosian rocks into taelosian stones, and the chunks of discord rocks into discord stones.</p></p><p>
