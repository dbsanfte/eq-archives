      <span class="headers">PoP: Aid Grimel Quest - For multi-GM tradeskillers</span>
<p>
<b>Quest info is outdated -- fresh update from the site needed before we go live to include info on the baking and final step ...</b><p>
<i>This quest originates in the top of the Plane of Knowledge Library, with Aid Grimel. It requires advanced planar flags for PoP zones, multiple tradeskills over 200 (exact requirements listed below) and, of course, the Planes of Power expansion. At this time, the quest has not been fully completed, so additional details will be added to this page as they become available. Discussion of this quest can be found <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=76">on the new message boards</a>.</i>

</p> 
<p>After Hailing Aid Grimel, he will mention that he needs someone willing to help him who is a master of trades AND has travelled the planes. In other words, you will need to meet a certain minimum skill level (without any tradeskill improving devices like the various Geerlok tools being taken into account) in a tradeskill AND have been flagged for a certain plane or two for each tradeskill quest he gives you. If you do not have the appropriate planar flag yet, he will reply to you with:</p>
<p>Aid Grimel says 'I am sorry but one who has such limited knowledge of the Planes would not be able to assist me.'</p></blockquote> 
<p>If you have the proper flags, but your skill does not meet the requirement, he will insult your ability in the skill.</p>
<p>This assumes that all combines are done in either a Planar kit of some sort (i.e. Planar Fletching Kit, Planar Sewing Kit, etc) or in a stationary container IN the Plane of Knowledge.</p>

Brew the wash by combining acid and a three celestial essence's. Once the armor is cleaned, coat it with hurricane temper. Finally add two black diamonds of nightmare to the breastplate. This should provide adequate protection for our next journey.'

Turn in the finished Breastplate for a Leather Signet. <b>Do not throw away the Leather Signet!</b>

Aid Grimel smiles. 'What a wonderful job! Councilman Taldarius shall wear this on our next adventure, I am sure he will find it more protective than his old one. Take this signet as a token of my gratitude. If you are not too busy I have another task, do you have any brewing skill?'

Grimel will give you a portable Brew Barrel with 4 slots in it, as well as 1 Fermenting Dust. You will need to ask him twice for more Fermenting Dust, and will be making a Portable Drink.

Aid Grimel says 'I bet you could make a wicked brew! However I am forced to drink a refreshing drink while out adventuring. I do have this powder that will give the best drinks quite a bite though. Mix the powder in with two Kaladim Constitutionals and a flask of pure water. If you need more dust just ask for it! Put three twice brewed constitutionals and the signet in this drink barrel.

At this point, Grimel will give you Etching Dust and ask that you make him a new ring from the previous signet. You will need to head to Velious to gather some velium bars that are needed, and will also need to head to Eastern Wastes and locate Tain Hammerfrost in order to procure a Coldain Smithy Hammer. After combining, you will get a rather tempting Velium Blue Diamond Ring with Enduring Breath on it to hand in--and NOT have returned--for a Wooden Signet and some experience.

Aid Grimel says 'My hand was crushed when I used it to deflect a blow from a War Boar that was headed towards Taldarius's back. For some time afterwards my hand was crippled but Brell saw to it I regained full use of it. The ring I used to wear was damaged beyond repair and my hand was never steady enough to etch a new one. If you would make me a new one by combing a mounted blue diamond, the etching dust and etching tools in a <i>planar</i> jewelry kit. Then take the faceted gem and combine it with a bar of pure enchanted velium and my signet. I have no idea how the pure bars are made. You may want to seek the help of the ice dwarves.'

<p>
Going to Velious and in Thurgadin, hail Meg Tucter with the appropriate trigger text for a clarifying response. 
</p> 
<p>
Quote: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
You say, 'what bar of pure enchanted velium'
</p>
<p>
Meg Tucter says 'Wow that is an odd request ____. Very rarely do we make an item that requires a pure bar of metal. Pure enchanted velium bars are made by combing three enchanted velium bars in a forge along with a coldain velium temper, pure water and a Coldain smithy hammer. Tis quite expensive but it enables the crafter to obtain pure working materials.'
</p>
</blockquote> 
<p>
Meg also gives you the Etching tools. 
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
You say, 'I need a set of Etching Tools'
</p>
<p>
Meg Tucter says 'Oh, really? There are not many that work in faceting gems. I am surprised to see your interest. You can have this old set of mine. If you are working with Royal Velium and want to give it to someone else, you can use these etching tools and your jewelers kit to engrave the piece for them. Be careful though, because once the armor is engraved you cannot remove it and it will be useless to the Dain. There is no need to return the tools, Talem recently made me a new sturdy set. Brell bless him.'

<p>
Hand in the velium blue diamond ring in order to receive the wooden signet:
</p>

<p>
Aid Grimel grins. 'Quite a nice ring you have made for me ____. May it serve me as well as my old ring. Here take this signet. We seem to be finishing the tasks on my list at a nice pace. Tell me when you are ready to use some clay.'

Now Grimel will give you an urn pattern and ask you to make a Sacred Urn and fill it up with Sacred Water -- to replace one that was destroyed in the Plane of War--and to cap it with your signet from the Jewelcrafting part of the quest. Pretty straightforward. After making the, start heading over to the Plane of Valor and camping "the knights in the tents in Valor" as Khoren puts it for Sacred Water. After filling up the Urn with Water and your signet, combine for the Filled Sacred Urn and turn it in for the REALLY promising Metal Signet.

Original text: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
You say, 'I am ready to use some clay.'
</p>
<p>
Aid Grimel says 'On our last tome gathering expedition a stray arrow in the Plane of War struck our urn filled with sacred water. It was quite a waste of sacred water! Three large enchanted blocks of clay, three lacquered opals, a vial of purified mana, a ceramic lining, sculpting tools and the urn pattern should make an unfired urn. The urn is so large you will need to fire it with three divine crystalline glazes. Once you have the urn it needs to be filled with three sacred waters and the signet as a cap.'
</p>
</blockquote> 
<p>
Give him the filled sacred urn in order to receive the metal signet:

After the grueling work of finding different components, the item Grimel wants you to make in Tailoring...is surprisingly simple. All it is essentially is a Robe of Eternal Fire with two extra, (relatively) easy to get components: A Vial of Purified Mana and your previous Signet.

<p>Original text:</p>

<p>You say, 'I am skilled with the needle'<p>
</p>Aid Grimel says 'I appreciate the help Demorgoth. I need a new tunic made for Councilman Taldarius. Last trip through the Plane of Disease, one of those flies spit mucus on him and it dripped through his armor seams! The result was a gooey mess that ate away all the leather underneath. It was a blessing he was wearing something under all that metal! Combine three firesilk swatches, a vial of purified mana, an emblem of fire, a firestrand curing agent, a tunic pattern and the signet. Bring it to me when you have completed it.'</p>

<p><b>Flag requirement:</b> Rallos Zek</p>
<p>Finally, the last monster. Baking. This was one of the most annoying recipes for folks to figure out. So when you make it, thank the people who spent the months combining and researching and just smashing their heads against their monitors figuring it out for you. Combine three of the Bristlebane Party Platters and your signet in the Satchel he gives you.</p>
<p>Original Text:</p>
<blockquote><p>You say, 'I am a Master Chef'</p>
<p>Aid Grimel says 'When we adventure in the Planes there is only one meal that keeps us in top fighting shape. It is called a Bristlebane's Party Platter. Unfortunately the platter is awkward and not easy to adventure with so you need to place them in this satchel. I know not how to make the Platter, a rather nice female Halfling cleric used to deliver them to us. Quite an amazing lass to be braving so many of the Planes by herself. We chatted a bit last time she was here about her next trip she was planning on taking. She was going to spend time in Plane of Justice, twice as long as the other Planes. From there she was going to the river in Nightmare. After departing the land of Terris Thule she was going to visit the home of the God who was once tormented by Terris. After picking up a few baskets from a friend, she was off to the home of the Triumvirate. Alas! Word made it back to me she was crushed by a Regrua while hunting for the dreaded beast's claws! Combine three of the platters and the signet inside the satchel.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Following Grimel's advice, hailing the councilman gives a quest similar to Secrets of the Planes: Go fetch a Hope Stone! This step has been verified to NOT be MQable. The councilman will reject items that are turned in to him one at a time. Turn in the signet and the Hope Stone, and you will receive a disgustingly droolworthy earring.</p>

If you cannot find what you are looking for here in the Myrist library, I most certainly can add it to my list of things to look for in the Planes. Unfortunately, I am quite busy at the moment, planning my next trip to the Elemental Planes. I believe my aid may have some tasks he could use help with. That is, if you are skilled enough.' 
man about the signet.'</p>
<p>You say, 'What about the Marked Runed Signet'</p>
<p>Councilman Taldarius says 'I see you have helped Grimel immensely. He would not have given up his signet very easily. I cannot let him deprive himself of such a valuable tool. If you were to do a task for me I would grant you something I picked up in the Planes. Are you interested in the task?'</p>
<p>You say, 'i am interested in the task'</p>
<p>Councilman Taldarius says 'Very well Iustus. I warn you I will not grant this without proof that you possess a valiant spirit. You may have the trust of my aid but I still require a noble deed. Through research done by the council they have discovered something called a Hope Stone that exists in the Elemental Planes. Bring me one of these stones and the signet of Grimel.
