            <p class="headers">A Guide to Pottery by <a href="mailto:Keith@SanDiablo.Com" class="header">Etienne</a>, 
              Tunare Server</p>
            <p><i>(DenMother's note: while this guide is many months out of date, 
              it does provide some basic information for the beginning potter 
              ...)</i></p>
            <p>Pottery is a unique trade skill in a number of ways. First of all, 
              pottery seems to be the only trade skill aimed at enhancing another 
              trade skill. Most of the goods you'll manufacture with this skill 
              will only be of interest to bakers. Second of all, it is the only 
              trade skill, to the best of my knowledge, that requires you to make 
              two skill attempts in order to manufacture goods. Third, it’s incredibly 
              easy to raise. Finally, you can make a good profit off this skill 
              just selling goods to vendors though you'll have to have a high 
              skill level before this is possible.</p>
            <p>To start with, first verify that everything you need to practice 
              pottery is readily available. That means you'll need to find a pottery 
              wheel, kiln, and vendors to buy sketches, clay, and firing sheets 
              from. When I first started practicing pottery I was using a pottery 
              wheel and kiln in South Qeynos, buying my clay and firing sheets 
              in West Karana, and was getting my sketches from a barbarian shaman 
              who was making frequent trips between Halas and Qeynos. Trust me 
              when I say it was a very frustrating period for me and I eventually 
              just relocated to Halas, where I paid higher prices for raw materials 
              and received lower prices for finished goods, just to have all of 
              my pottery needs met in one small area. You'll eventually also want 
              glass shards and bits of metal for more advanced pottery but you 
              can worry about that when the time comes.</p>
            <p>Next you'll want to spend a practice point on pottery just to get 
              it started. Once you start practicing you'll find that pottery raises 
              fairly easily and I certainly wouldn't spend more than 1 practice 
              point on it. Certainly not before trying it a few times just to 
              see what sort of raises you get on your own. Buy the basic pottery 
              book for the instructions and "recipes."</p>
            <p>The actual practice of pottery is a two-stage process. First you 
              place a sketch, a flask of water, don't use the globes of water 
              some casters can summon or the pods of water that woodsy types can 
              forage for, the appropriate amount of clay, and any necessary extras 
              like glass shards on a pottery wheel and click combine. If you're 
              successful you'll be rewarded with an unfired product that you can 
              then place in a kiln with the appropriate type of firing sheet(s) 
              and combine to get your end product. When practicing keep working 
              with an item until the pottery wheel returns the message that the 
              item is trivial for someone of your skill level to make but ignore 
              the kiln if it tells you that an item is trivial. It is harder to 
              turn something out on the pottery wheel than it is to put it in 
              the kiln to harden. The kiln will tell you something is trivial 
              to make long before it’s trivial to make on the pottery wheel.</p>
            <p>Clay, firing sheets, and some sketches don't stack so when buying 
              trade supplies you may find yourself pressed for space. Because 
              of this I recommend that you don't buy firing sheets until you actually 
              have unfired products ready to put in the kiln. Otherwise you'll 
              probably wind up dragging around excess firing sheets that are filling 
              inventory slots that could be better used carrying clay.</p>
            <p>What to make? The first few items in the pottery book, skewers, 
              ceramic linings, and clay jars, are good starts. After those, however, 
              there's a sharp increase in prices. I've never made a pot because 
              I can't find a pot sketch but it also calls for metal bits and a 
              smith friend has told me that they cost around 7 gp to make. Smoker 
              and cookie cutter sketches are expensive as well, running in the 
              5 to 6 gp range. As you can see, at this point failures become very 
              costly and you may want to jump ahead to more difficult but cheaper 
              items. As of this writing, the recipe for small bowls appears to 
              be broken. At least I get the message that "those items don't appear 
              to combine in those quantities" when I try it. However, the next 
              recipe, pie tins, works just fine and, even better news, actually 
              turns a tidy profit when successful. It costs me slightly under 
              2 gp to make a pie tin and I can sell it to a merchant for slightly 
              over 5 gp for a profit of 3 gp and mind you I'm dealing with merchants 
              who give me bad prices because they don't like me. Cake rounds are 
              slightly more expensive to make since they require glass shards 
              but they also return a profit. Beyond that, I don't know the profit 
              potential of the larger bowls because I haven't tried them yet and 
              probably won't until pie tins and cake rounds become trivial. I 
              suspect some of them will be quite profitable too, especially mixing 
              bowls which may actually have a player market now that the baker's 
              recipe for clump of dough has been fixed.</p>
            <p>Now if you'll excuse me, my cookies are about ready and they're 
              always best straight out of the oven. (I like to bite the heads 
              off the troll shaped ones.)</p>
            <p><b>Addendum by Etienne:</b> </p>
            <p>Since the writing of this pottery guide, Verant has implemented 
              a patch which has effectively made pottery non-viable as a trade 
              skill. NPC merchants now pay below cost, in some cases as much as 
              1 to 2 pp below, on all items listed in the basic pottery book. 
              NPC merchants also sell some pottery goods, primarily those that 
              other players would be interested in buying, for less than a potter 
              can make them. Which means that you will lose significant amounts 
              of money practicing pottery, even when you successfully make whatever 
              item it you're attempting, and then be unable to sell your goods 
              to anyone but NPCs because players will prefer buying pottery goods 
              at the lower NPC prices. </p>
            <p>If you choose to be a potter then I urge you not to sell any of 
              your more saleable goods (skewers, pie tins, cake rounds, muffin 
              tins, mixing bowls, vials, etc.) to NPC merchants. They don't normally 
              stock pottery goods so if we don't sell to them then they won't 
              be able to undercut the prices we're now forced to charge in order 
              to make a profit. When you generate excess stock of these items 
              through practice, bank what you can to sell later and destroy the 
              rest. I know that sounds bad but when you reach my skill level and 
              are looking at expending 40-60 pp just to master large bowls, which 
              are not a saleable item, you'll be thankful for the existence of 
              a player market for your wares and that market can only exist if 
              the merchants aren't undercutting us. Hopefully Verant will make 
              pottery more viable some day but in the meantime this is what we 
              have to do if we're to pay for our craft. </p>
