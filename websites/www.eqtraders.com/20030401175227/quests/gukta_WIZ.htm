            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Gukta. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), and restricted to FRG/WIZ 
              only. These no-fail combines will grant you low level smithing skillups. 
              Currently, only some of the end results are no drop. This is believed 
              to be an error, as all armor pieces should be no drop. 
            <p>Hail the shaman trainer, Jin Master Sergug, in Gukta. He will give 
              you an Arcane Crucible in which to make your armor. As you ask about 
              each armor piece, he will hand you the no drop mold for that armor 
              piece.</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Jin Master Sergug' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Jin Master Sergug says 'Welcome back, young Jin. I hope your 
                training is going well. Unfortunately, I have been unable to keep 
                up to date on your progress, but should you need advanced training 
                in any individual skills, for I am never too busy to enlighten 
                one of my kin. You may have chosen a life of adventure, a life 
                that will take you far from our home, but never forget your duty 
                to your blood. The Guktan Army needs your growing powers. To remind 
                you of this and school you in the way of our people, I will tell 
                you something of [this place].' </p>

            <p>You say, 'what about this place?</p>
            <p> Jin Master Sergug seems to be in deep contemplation of the matters 
              at hand, but then sighs and speaks with ____</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Jin Master Sergug says 'The fetid land we now live on of holds 
                many evils. Trolls and other evil ilk still wander the Innothule 
                Swamp, ready to feast on Froglok flesh. Their allies, the ogres, 
                infest the Feerrott to the south, vying with the cursed Lizard 
                men in a lasting contest of evil. Our lands stand distant from 
                the other good races, separated by wastelands and deserts. Our 
                army is our only defense. But that is enough. I am the teacher 
                of young [froglok wizards]. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'I am a froglok wizard'</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Jin Master Sergug keeps a steady watch, eyes roving even as 
                the conversation with Vierganku unfolds. <br>
                Jin Master Sergug says 'That is your path? Good. Then we must 
                begin immediately for time is short. The arcane path ahead of 
                you is fraught with dangers, many of them of your own making. 
                I will guide you as I can, so [listen well]. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'I will listen well' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Jin Master Sergug seemingly ignores ____, while reveling in the 
                miracle of Marr's, blessing then turns to listen. <br>
                Jin Master Sergug says 'This Arcane Crucible will allow you to 
                combine [various components] to form a basic magical mesh. This 
                mesh, when combined with the proper mold and worked in a forge, 
                will allow you to create your own Armor of the Jin Initiate.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Make sure you have a container slot free, as he will hand you the 
              Arcane Crucible at this time.</p>
            <p>You say, 'what various components' </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Jin Master Sergug seems to look into the distance, but suddenly 
                blinks as ___ unapologetically interrupts this silent meditation. 
                <br>
                Jin Master Sergug says 'These are not the usual components used 
                in spells. Look instead in Innothule Swamp for your pieces. The 
                many enemies and vermin that stalk that bog hold items which are 
                only trash to others. But to you they will eventually become treasures. 
                When you are ready to attempt making your armor, return and tell 
                me what you [wish] to make and I will instruct you. I can teach 
                you the recipes and give you the proper molds for the Armor of 
                the Jin Initiate [Headband], [Vestment], [Armwraps], [Bracer], 
                [Handwraps], [Leggings], and [Sandals]. </p>

                to craft the initiates headband, and what materials are needed. 
                <br>
                Jin Master Sergug says 'Wise. Your mind is your greatest weapon 
                and you must protect it. You'll need a Malleable Bleeder Skin, 
                a Pristine Bleeder Skin and two Mushroom Spores. Combine these
