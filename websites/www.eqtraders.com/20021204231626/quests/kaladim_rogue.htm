            <h3>Apprentice Miners Chainmail Armor - Kaladim Rogue Quest</h3>
            <P><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in 
              Kaladim. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, DWF/ROG 
              only. They are no-fail smithing combines. This armor looks like 
              grey chain. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the 
              bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you 
              get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <P>You say, 'Hail, Crovsar Dirkbringer'<BR>
              Crovsar Dirkbringer says 'Gud to meet ye there Kenworth. Me names 
              Crovsar Dirkbringer and I run dis here mining operation. Anyone 
              else that tell ye different simply aint telling da truth! I like 
              to spend most of me time minin but I also like to help our young 
              miners pick dere way to glory as a great rogue! Er I mean a great 
              miner! Aye, dats it. If ye are a [young minin rogue] of Kaladim 
              den I might just have some things for ye to do.'</P>

              full I will be happy to explain to you the [training exercises]

            <P>You say, 'what training exercises'<BR>
              Crovsar Dirkbringer says 'Well den it must be obvious that not just 
              any young miner can git his things and venture out into da world 
              without the proper armor to protect dem Aye? Dis is why I have developed

              Kit to collect various magical items that can be combined in da 
              kit to create the armor materials that I spoke of earlier. You will 
              then take the material to a forge along with patterns that I will 
              present ye with to create da specific armor piece ye asked for.
