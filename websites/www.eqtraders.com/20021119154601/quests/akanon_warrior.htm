            <h3> Akanon Initiate's Watchman Armor Quest (Warrior)<br>
            </h3>
            <p><i>One of many new youngling armor quests, this one is for gnome 
              warriors. Some minor smithing skillups have been seen from this 
              quest. Armor is lore (other than bracer), no drop, and GNM/WAR only. 
              Graphic is a grey plate. Please note that while the bracers are 
              not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer 
              before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>Hail the guy in gemchopper hall (Narron Jenork), and tell him you 
              are a gnome warrior, then you are ready to be tested. He'll give 
              you the assembly kit (which you must combine all the ingredients 
              in), then when you ask about the specific piece (ie &quot;i want 
              to craft a breastplate&quot; , he'll give you the mold. First you 
              combine all your bronze, legs, mace, scalp whatever in the assembly 
              kit, and you get &quot;*piece* material&quot;. And then to the forge 
              (not the Ak'anon forge, use the one over by the clockwork merchant 
              on the other side) with the mold and material. Combines are trivial 
              at skill 21, but give skill increases until that point.</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Narron Jenork' </p>
            <p>Narron Jenork says 'Pleased to meet you ______! I am Narron Jenork 
              High Watchman of Ak'anon. I am one of the most skilled Watchmans 
              in all of Ak'anon and I pride myself on training the most promising 
              young warriors that Ak'anon has to offer. Are you a young gnome 
              warrior?' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a young gnome warrior' </p>
            <p>Narron Jenork says 'Well we can never get enough warriors around 
              these parts as far as I am concerned! Now if you are a new warrior 
              then you must go through the training to become a true watchman. 
              I have a series of tests that will require you to test both your 
              hunting and navigational skills. These tests will not leave you 
              with nothing to show for your work because upon completing them 
              you will be outfitted with a full suit of Initiate Watchmans armor. 
              Are you [ready to be tested]?' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I am ready to be tested' </p>
            <p>Narron Jenork says 'Well then lets get you started! First I will 
              present you with this Watchmans Mail Assembly kit to gather assorted 
              items from both your training grounds of the Steamfont Mountains 
              and in our great town of Akanon. You will then combine the different 
              recipes of components in your kit to create a material that will 
              be used with a mold in a forge to create your Watchman armor. When 
              you are ready to craft a specific piece all you must do is tell 
              me what armor piece you [want to craft] and I will present you with 
              the recipe for the material along with the mold. I have the material 
              recipes necessary to make Initiate Watchman [Helms], [Bracers], 
              [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].' 
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft boots' </p>
            <p>Narron Jenork says 'I certainly wouldn&#146;t advise any watchman 
              to be on patrol without proper boots on, we aren&#146;t halflings 
              you know! Therefore our obsession should be with our tactical attacks, 
              not our foothairs. To create your boot material you will need to 
              combine 3 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Aviak Beak, 2 Wolf Meats and 
              1 Red Wine in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper 
              material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your 
              very own Initiate Watchmans Boots.' <br>

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft greaves' </p>
            <p>Narron Jenork says 'Pants are a must young ____. As a Watchman 
              of Ak'anon you should be known for your noble deeds and commitment 
              to defending your home, not a gnome that runs around with no pants 
              on. To create your greaves material you will need to combine 4 Bricks 
              of Crude Bronze, 1 Coyote Pelt , 1 Rusted Blackbox and 1 Bottle 
              in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material 
              take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own 
              Initiate Watchmans Greaves.'</p>

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a helm' </p>
            <p>Narron Jenork says 'No watchman can even think of going into battle 
              without the proper helmet and I think this one will do the job for 
              you ____. To create your helm material you will need to combine 
              2 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Piece of Scrap Metal, 1 Ruined Cat Pelt 
              and 1 Raw Bamboo in your assembly kit. Once you have created the 
              proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion 
              your very own Initiate Watchmans Helm.' <br>

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a bracer' 
            <p>Narron Jenork says 'Always a wise idea to keep your wrists well 
              protected because if you don&#146;t you might have a difficult time 
              swinging your weapons! To create your bracer material you will need 
              to combine 1 Brick of Crude Bronze, 1 Rusty Mace, 1 Kobold Tooth 
              and 1 Bottle of Milk in your assembly kit. Once you have created 
              the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft gauntlets' </p>
            <p>Narron Jenork says 'Having the necessary protection on your hands 
              and wrists will prevent any serious injuries that would make you 
              unable to defend yourself. To create your gauntlet material you 
              will need to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Runaway Clockwork 
              Gearbox, 1 Young Ebon Drakewing, and 1 Minotaur Scalp in your assembly 
              kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a breastplate' 
            <p>Narron Jenork says 'I am very pleased to see that you have progressed 
              so quickly in your training Gearsword! I do also agree that you 
              are ready to gather the items necessary for crafting your Initiate 
              Watchmans Breastplate. To create your breastplate material you will 
              need to combine 5 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Runaway Clockwork Motor, 
              1 Brownie Brain, 1 Rusty Long Sword, 1 Grikbar Kobold Scalp and 
              the evil Diloperia`s Bracer in your assembly kit. Once you have 
              created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold 
              to fashion your very own Initiate Watchmans Breastplate. When you 
              are finished with your breastplate please come back to see me, I 
              have a [final task] for you to complete.' <br>

            <p>You say, 'I want to craft armguards' </p>
            <p>Narron Jenork says 'One always has to be able to really pack a 
              punch with their attacks so preventing any injuries on your arms 
              ahead of time is good planning! To create your armguards material 
              you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 2 Brownie Legs 
              , and 1 Short Beer in your assembly kit. Once you have created the

              recruits with weapons that symbolize their devotion to Ak'anon. 
              I am in need of a [few items] from the mountains to make this weapon.
