      <span class="headers">Gukta Wizard (Jin Initiate) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Gukta. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), and restricted to FRG/WIZ only. These no-fail combines will grant you low level smithing skillups. Currently, only some of the end results are no drop. This is believed to be an error, as all armor pieces should be no drop.
</p>
<p>
Hail the shaman trainer, Jin Master Sergug, in Gukta. He will give you an Arcane Crucible in which to make your armor. As you ask about each armor piece, he will hand you the no drop mold for that armor piece.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Jin Master Sergug' 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Jin Master Sergug says 'Welcome back, young Jin. I hope your training is going well. Unfortunately, I have been unable to keep up to date on your progress, but should you need advanced training in any individual skills, for I am never too busy to enlighten one of my kin. You may have chosen a life of adventure, a life that will take you far from our home, but never forget your duty to your blood. The Guktan Army needs your growing powers. To remind you of this and school you in the way of our people, I will tell you something of [this place].' 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'what about this place?
</p>
<p>
Jin Master Sergug seems to be in deep contemplation of the matters at hand, but then sighs and speaks with ____
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Jin Master Sergug says 'The fetid land we now live on of holds many evils. Trolls and other evil ilk still wander the Innothule Swamp, ready to feast on Froglok flesh. Their allies, the ogres, infest the Feerrott to the south, vying with the cursed Lizard men in a lasting contest of evil. Our lands stand distant from the other good races, separated by wastelands and deserts. Our army is our only defense. But that is enough. I am the teacher of young [froglok wizards]. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I am a froglok wizard'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Jin Master Sergug keeps a steady watch, eyes roving even as the conversation with Vierganku unfolds.
</p>
<p>
Jin Master Sergug says 'That is your path? Good. Then we must begin immediately for time is short. The arcane path ahead of you is fraught with dangers, many of them of your own making. I will guide you as I can, so [listen well]. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I will listen well' 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Jin Master Sergug seemingly ignores ____, while reveling in the miracle of Marr's, blessing then turns to listen.
</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Make sure you have a container slot free, as he will hand you the Arcane Crucible at this time.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what various components' 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Jin Master Sergug seems to look into the distance, but suddenly blinks as ___ unapologetically interrupts this silent meditation.
</p>
<p>
Jin Master Sergug says 'These are not the usual components used in spells. Look instead in Innothule Swamp for your pieces. The many enemies and vermin that stalk that bog hold items which are only trash to others. But to you they will eventually become treasures. When you are ready to attempt making your armor, return and tell me what you [wish] to make and I will instruct you. I can teach you the recipes and give you the proper molds for the Armor of the Jin Initiate [Headband], [Vestment], [Armwraps], [Bracer], [Handwraps], [Leggings], and [Sandals]. 
</p>
