<p>
Racknine has decided to upgrade the server the the message boards are on.  There is no specific ETA but they said it should not take too long.  I also did not recieve enough warning to close the boards so there MAY be some data loss (I.E. some posts may be missing)
Thank you for your patience.<p>
<b>edit</b><br />
And it looks like they managed to kill the main sites DNS while they were at it!</p>

<p><span class="headers">August 06, 2003 - Patch Day</span>
<p>
Well, my brain patched a bit later than the game did, so this update is a wee bit belated.<p>

Today's patch had a few things that were tradeskill-specific:
<ul><li>Mass Enchant spells corrected - The mass enchant spells for Adamantite, Brellium, Mithril and Steel now create the 5 enchanted blocks that they should.</li> 
<li>Silk String - This item is now stackable.</li>
<li>New Fletching recipes added - We've added several new Karana-only fletching recipes to help round out that skill. </li></ul><p>
Sources for Surefall Glade have been added for the new vendor and the new forge. Recipes will go in later. Meanwhile, you can find many of the recipes, as well as what trivial information we know, in <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&threadid=9459">a post in the fletching forum</a>.<p>
I'd also like to take 2 seconds to thank the anonymous guild who sent me a present earlier this week. I'm getting much enjoyment from it. At first, I tried smelling the teddy bear and hugging the roses, but then I unscrambled my brain enough to reverse to process and things were much more cuddly (and less thorny!).

<p><span class="headers">July 30, 2003 - Glerp!!!</span>
<p>
As most, if not all of you, have noticed by now, things were crazier than usual around here for the last couple days.<p>
We ended up moving the boards to a new software package to handle the myriad of bugs that we couldn't address before. The timing sort of took me by surprise, but we're managing.  95% of everything came over just fine, but the other 5% is causing some problems.  (Avatar sizes are still only half-fixed, the nav buttons are gone, the logo needs replacing, and so forth.) We'll get there, but, it will take time, especially with other stuff going on in our lives.<p>
The hard-working folks at Racknine also realized we weren't joking about the extra load when the database went live. We apologize for some flakiness today as they copied the site over to a new server (with newer SQL server software for more "oomph" as well), and then flipped the DNS over. I lost edit access for a bit, as did all the folks doing updates to the site, but we should be good now ... I hope.<p>
I do apologize for all the chaos due to growing pains and the like, and we'll continue our clean-up efforts over the next week or two. This wasn't as seamless as we'd like, but the longer we waited on getting all this out the door, the more likely it was that it would never get done, and I'd just shelve the whole site. :/ I suspect that most of you would be a tad unhappy with that option, so we muddle along as best we can. {tired grin}</p>

<p><span class="headers">July 25, 2003 - Stray Updates</span>
<p>
Just a few things, before I finally go get some sleep.<p>
<ul><li>The mass enchant spells for cultural metals (adamantite, mithril, steel, brellium) are currently not working as intended. It is fixed on Test. Unfortunately, even after more than one warning from EQTC staff, the message board thread regarding this issue degenerated into SoE-bashing, and will not be revived, so take this as your warning that there's a problem until the next patch.</li>
<li>The serverwide.eqtraders channel is pretty much MIA. Someone passworded it, nobody seems to know who did it or what the new password is. Since I've never had (nor wanted) ownership of that chat channel, there's not a lot I can do about it. There's a <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/upload/showthread.php?s=&threadid=8917">message board thread</a> discussing alternative channel possibilities.</li>
<li>The database forum is up and running. Again, I ask that you please keep the commentary there, and NOT in DenMother's Corner, direct PMs to me, etc. I'm feeling very extremely overloaded, if you couldn't tell from the last front page update from me, and I am literally cringing every time I hit the boards right now. Please, folks, ease up on the PMs, the feature requests we've already said to WAIT on, and such.</li>
<li>Gukta trade supplies fell through a crack, and I've not slept in about 22 hours. I'll finish them after sleep.</li></ul>
I want to add my thanks to Ngreth's to all of you who have helped make this database a reality. I'm not coherent enough to go through a list without missing someone and likely offending them horribly, so I'll just say a huge thank you to all of you at once for now.  {exhausted halfling hugs}</p>

</p>
<p><span class="headers">July 21, 2003 - Welcome to the database!</span>
<p>
If you're reading this, you're now seeing the database version of the site. (For the non-beta testers, this means that we've finally recovered from exploding computer power supplies, sorted out the issues with backing up a far-too-large dev versoin of the item database, and so on.)<p>
It's been a rough year, getting all of this ready, and we're not done with it yet. At the rate this game changes, we may never be fully done with it. It is, however, done enough for the public to come play.  I'm excited, I'm relieved, I'm very burnt out on the entire EQ tradeskill thing, and this site.<p>
To go along with the burnt out thing, here's <b>a few things to note before you post a single, solitary thing about the database:</b>
<ul><li>We'll have a database bug forum in place for true-blue bugs (incorrect trivials, incorrect recipes, etc.) within 24 hours of the database launching.  We'll set up some posting rules so it doesn't turn into total anarchy, and you'll want to read the sticky there before posting to it.</li>
<li>Don't PM me with bugs. Don't email me with bugs.  Don't post in the DenMother's Corner with bugs. See the above about the bug forum. I won't be the only person tackling bugs, and addressing something personally to me adds unneccessary grief. Drop it in the proper forum so it can be tackled as someone has time for it.</li>
<li>Not all quest recipes are in the database. It will take time, and the primary focus has been on main tradeskill recipes, not quest recipes. <b>This means do NOT submit a bug report if you find a quest recipe missing from the database!</b> If the actual quest is missing from the quests writeup, then you can submit a writeup for the quest, but it is not yet considered a "bug" if we don't have every single quest recipe in the db.</li>
<li>Not all item prices are in place. Not even close. Once the dust settles, we'll likely be looking for some help with getting that fleshed out now, but please, don't be helpful and flood the forums, or my mailbox, with offers.  When/if we want volunteers, we'll say so. Until then, you're making more work with your offers, not helping with the problem.</li>
<li>Not all mob sources are in the database. I take full blame for that. I am working on it, slowly. It's an ugly set of lists, it's a messy collection of mobs, and I'm having to triple-check a lot of stuff before adding the 13 zillionth form of cat to yet another zone, for example.</li>
<li>Hold all feature requests! Do not put them in the bug forum, do not put them in DenMother's Corner, do not PM me with them, do not submit them to us in any way until we say so!  I repeat: <b>do not give us feature requests, requests to change display formats, search formats, etc., etc. at this time.</b> When the dust has settled, and Ngreth is ready to tackle some requests, we'll set up a submission method.  We will gladly ignore any and all people who feel they must ignore this and flood us with requests.  Those of you who turn your requests into demands or orders, will find I am a very burnt out and frazzled redhead who is not amused with the folks who are "instructing" me on what I must do for my site. Please remember that we cannot please everyone, some requests simply may be either technically impossible, or too resource-intensive. We reserve the right to say no if something is beyond the scope of what we can/want to do.</li></ul>
<p>I really hate having this much negativity on the front page, but as we learned from the beta phase, even with things spelled out this much, folks will still ignore all this and post whatever the blazes they feel like, and my tolerance is very, very thin right now. This has been a year-long nightmare, and the straw that broke the camel's back, and I've totally stopped playing EQ, as the game has been turned from play into "work" for me.  No, I'm not looking for sympathy, or another several dozen emails, posts, etc. of support, I'm just telling it like it is. Those who decide to <b>demand</b> more than I can give, or who decide that the forum rules are not meant for them, will find I'm a lot less tolerant of such things now that this has turned from a "labor of love" to simply "hard labor". While I hope folks will find the new format more helpful than the old static pages, I'm no longer going to stress because I can only please 95% of a far-too-large population.

It seems I was premature in promising that the next update would be from the new site. There was just a loud BANG from downstairs ... the House Ogre's computer literally blew up ... it'll be a few days before the replacement power supply is here. <i>(And we mean literally blew up!! I almost fell out of my chair in startlement. - Ngreth)</i> You guessed it ... there's irreplaceable info on that machine that we need in order to move the DB from the test site to the production side. We'll give a new ETA when able.</p>

<p>
I am beyond swamped right now. I'm not even sure I am coherent. But I need to give you folks some updates, so bear with me, please. 

The next update you see, Bristlebane willing, will be from the new database-driven site. Yes, there will still be extra features added, and things changed once we launch. Patience, grasshoppers! :) 

While the multi-yield mana vial spells and the like are quite happy (spell vendor in the EC tunnel), the <b>multi-yield cultural metal enchants are not working as intended</b>. This is acknowledged as a known bug, and will be fixed with the next patch. (Currently requires 5 metal, returns only 1). 

As an FYI, the basic mana vial spells are now sold in High Keep as well as in the brownie village in Lesser Faydark - this should save some creative contortions when shopping for these spells. 

For those who have been flooding me with private messages of concern, yes I am alive, no you have NOT seen me much, if at all, in game. Currently, the game is just too much like work, partly due to the demands of the site and the database, partly due to the demands of too many folks who want to make small-talk within 30 seconds of me logging on. I need a break. Badly. Just leave me be to destress, please. I'll still be in when the devs ask me to test something, but other than that, don't expect to see me for a bit -- even on my bazaar mule, since several folks have taken to tell-spamming him demanding that I come play, etc., etc. It's just too much hassle and very unfun for me. </p>

<p><span class="headers">June 13, 2003 - Beta!</span>
<p>
The <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=62364#62364">cat saga</a> is finally done, and I'm pleased to announce the beta launch of our database. Over the next couple of hours, I'll be wandering through the various forums, doing last-minute trivial updates to the main site, then dropping sticky topics into each appropriate forum for folks to post new trivial and stat updates. Posts will stay in that thread for the next month and NOT be updated on the main site, as I want the site to be stable while testers are cross-referencing what's on the current site with what's in the database. Updates will go into the database, of course, but folks are going to have to rely more heavily on the message boards until the database is launched to the public in a month or so.
<p>As we start this final phase, let me do something that hearkens back to my days as a Project Manager ... "managing expectations."
<p>When the database finally goes live, you WILL see:
            <ul>
              <li>Over 6000 tradeskill recipes -- all general tradeskill recipes currently known, as well as some of the quest recipes</li>
     <li>Over 8000 items -- everything that we know is used in or produced by tradeskills</li>
              <li>Over 2500 mobs -- including all known tradeskill vendors and mobs with tradeskill drops</li>
              <li>Around 2000 sources -- tying the mobs, plus fish and forages to the appropriate items that they supply.</li>
              <li>Varying ways to search the above for recipes, sources, and more</li>
              <li><i>Hopefully</i> speedier updates to the site, as it takes less time and effort to make updates to the site and it is easier for us to set up limited access rights to volunteer editors.</li>
</ul>
<p>What you will NOT see:
            <ul>
              <li>Those rassenfrassen 
                advertisements that seem to be on almost every site you hit these 
                days.</li>
              <li>The even 
                more annoying (in my book) messages that say you must be a paying 
                member to access certain content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We continue to fund the site out of our own pockets, assisted by <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g206">generous donations from the community</a>. Fates willing, we can continue to work this way without it becoming too draining on our resources, though we'll definitely never make it rich off the site! ;) Here's to a successful beta!  I truly hope you'll all be pleasantly impressed with the results of all this hard work, muss and fuss.

<p>
<p>Today's front 
              page update will hopefully make up for the fact that there's not 
              been a front page update in almost a month.</font>
            <p>The patch has 
              several items of interest to tradeskillers. Below are some of the 
              highlights (discussion and details <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=8427">can 
              be found on the boards</a>):</font>
            <ul>
              <li>They stack?! 
                Valor crystals, ceramic lining, holgresh fur, casks. All of these 
                may seem like minor things to non-tradeskillers, but there's a 
                lot of rejoicing around here.</li>
              <li>Shared bank 
                space! Two more bank slots have been made available that are shared 
                across all characters on an account. (No no drop or no rent items, 
                and watch those lore tags!) This will be a boon for those who 
                need to mule tradeskill supplies around on a single account.</li>
              <li>The Kunark 
                catfish croak sandwich quest is finally in working order. The 
                reclusive sewer catfish are back in the waters of East and West 
                Cabilis, and that ever-hungry Klok Foob will happily accept donations 
                of two of his munch break favorites, those yummy catfish croak 
                sandwiches. Once the servers are stabilized today, hopefully someone 
                can provide us with information on the completion of this quest.</li>
              <li>Veksar. 
                A new zone! So far, there's only a few forages, that are shared 
                with other zones, and no zone specific fish, but one never knows 
                what else might be in there.</li>
              <li>Tradeskill 
                item tag. This one is viewed with mixed reactions around here, 
                and may still need a few kinks ironed out. For now, our database 
                will NOT be tracking this new flag, as it would delay our launch 
                by quite a bit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What's this 
              about the database?! Only a true follower of Bristlebane would be 
              excited about announcing a database beta launch for a Friday the 
              13th ... I don't know where that leaves me, as I'm alternately excited, 
              and stressed to the tips of my toes about this one. We'll have more 
              information about this later, and there will be a post on the message 
              boards in the DenMother's Corner if we find a need for more testers. 
              For now, the important information is: beta starting Friday, full 
              launch of this in a month or so if all goes well, and site updates 
              will be "locked" once Friday hits. (Once we're in beta, 
              we'll have special sticky threads to track new trivials and stats 
              and such, but we're going to stop with this time-consuming double 
              and triple-editing of information and focus all our energy on getting 
              the database updated.)

<p><span class="headers">May 14, 2003 - Patch Day</span>
<p>
<p>Today's patch contains a few items of interest to tradeskillers. My comments follow the patch items in bold italics:
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>GM Baking Spoon</strong> - On Firiona Vie, the Grandmaster's 
                Baking Spoon was not no-drop. This allowed players to give out 
                an unlimited number of 100% weight reduction bags. This obviously 
                was not the intention for that item, so we have made the Grandmaster's 
                Baking Spoon no drop on Firiona Vie. -<em> <strong>erm ... whoops?</strong></em></li>
              <li> <strong>NPCs returning bags empty</strong> - NPCs that return 
                items that they do not need were returning all containers empty, 
                regardless of what was inside the container. NPCs that refuse 
                unusable items will now also return bags with their contents intact. 
                - <em><strong>some of us tend to get ahead of ourselves when questing, 
                and hand the wrong item in to an NPC, or forget to hit the combine 
                button on the container before giving it to the quest NPC. This 
                should save us from some lost items</strong>.</em></li>
              <li><strong> NPCs returning multiple items</strong> - If a character 
                gave an NPC multiples of the same item, the NPC would only give 
                back one of them if he did not want them. We have fixed this so 
                that now those items will be returned. Such items will be stacked 
                on your cursor. Just click the item that is on your cursor into 
                your inventory and the next one will appear on your cursor. Keep 
                clicking them into your inventory until you have them all back. 
                BE WARNED that any of these items that you have not returned to 
                your inventory will be lost if you zone or go linkdead before 
                you get them back into your inventory. <em>- t<strong>his goes 
                hand-in-hand with the line item above it. Sometimes we're in such 
                a hurry to finish a frustrating tradeskill quest that we don't 
                pay as much attention to this as we should. Re-read this one carefully 
                to be sure you know how to get those multiple items back into 
                your inventory!</strong></em></li>
              <li><strong>Giant Yellow Jackets</strong> - The chance to find a 
                thorax on the corpses of these creatures seemed too low, so we 
                have increased it. - <em><strong>used in newbie armor quests, 
                this should lessen the frustration of those trying for this item</strong></em></li>
              <li> <strong>Added Honey Mush Bread to Cabilis Vendors</strong> 
                - This is an item needed for a quest that was unavailable. - <em><strong>We've 
                been trying for years to figure out this recipe! It's lovely to 
                hear that some lucky vendor has found a source for this bread. 
                <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q21&menustr=120030000000">The quest writeup</a> will be 
                updated as details become available.</strong></em></li>
              <li><strong> Combining Stacks of items</strong> - Attempting to 
                combine stacked items in a container will no longer work. The 
                items must be separated first. This change will prevent items 
                from being lost due to accidentally combining with them stacked. 
                A dialogue will pop up, warning the player to separate the objects. 
                -<em><strong> a partial fix for this went in a while back for 
                some tradeskill containers. This seems to be a continuation of 
                that fix. As usual, report on the boards if you find something 
                still accepting stacks of items in a tradeskill combine.</strong></em><br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Work on the database continues, thanks in no small part to the 
              database volunteers who have put large chunks of their time and 
              energy into the project. We're still not ready to give an ETA, as 
              the more we get done, the more we find needs to be done, but we 
              are making good progress.</p>
            </p>

</p>
<p><span class="headers">May 01, 2003 - At Long Last!</span>
<p>
<p>There are two items in the "at last" category today. Depending on what your tradeskill focus is, one, or both, may be of interest to you.
<p>Some of the "old cultural" armor sets that had the same name for more than one collection of normal vs imbued/enchanted vs enchanted set have had unannounced name changes. It will take a bit before we'vegot the site (and the database) updated accordingly, but we're <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=7150">gathering information here</a> on the new names. Note that sets that have multiple flavors of deity-specific imbues, such as imbued field plate and imbued steelsilk were <i>NOT</i> included in this name change.
<p>I'm sure the skeptics among you had long given up on this following annoucement, but we're finally ready to announce that our database is ready for alpha testing. (Sometimes, even <em>*I*</em> wasn't sure we'd ever hit this point, as it has been a very overwhelming task, and real life has thrown us many curve balls since we started this project.) We are NOT looking for added volunteers at the moment, so please, don't join the folks who have already swamped me with private messages containing well-meaning offers of help. I've given up even attempting to respond to them all at this point, as they're eating up far too much time that I <i>need</i> to be spending on the current site and on the database. When we are ready to announce beta (we have no ETA), we will either have a post asking for volunteers, or we will be contacting folks directly. 
<p>I can't stress this enough. Don't swamp us with tells. Don't send us private messages offering to help. Don't make unsolicited posts offering to help. Please, such "help" will only add to our workload instead of helping us. <i>(And it's very likely that we'll totally ignore you and that folks on the message boards will start quoting this front page update at you, since we want folks helping us that are willing and able to follow instructions, and if you're bugging us after seeing this post, you're NOT going to be someone we'll choose to help relieve our workload, hm?)</i>
<p>I truly don't want to seem ungrateful, as without all you wonderful folks that have volunteered information and encouragement over the years, not to mention the dedicated moderators and database volunteers who have kept me from going totally insane, but I'm a very overwhelmed redhead right now, and until this thing is fully launched, I'm fighting a very strong urge to hide in some deep dark corner and tell the world to go away. Of course, if I did that, I'd never get the durn thing launched, <i>despite</i> all the hard work done by my husband and others to get all the technical requirements and searches sorted out.            </p>

<p><span class="headers">April 22, 2003 - Quest Update</span>
<p>
Thanks to some added quest text from VI, at long last the Planes of Power <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q57&menustr=120055000000">Aid Grimel quest</a> has been completely solved. The quest writeup has been updated, and the party platter recipe has also been added to the database and to the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=149&rsa=Baking&sub=pop&sb=item&menustr=080020060000">PoP Baking Recipes page</a>. My thanks to all who aided in deciphering this quest, and to Kronepsis in particular for maintaining an up-to-date quest summary that I could put on the site.
<p>There is some <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=6360">weirdness going on with DNCs and disconnects</a> lately, especially in high-lag  areas such as the bazaar. The folks at VI are aware of the problem, and are working on resolving it. In the meantime, I'd recommend doing any important combines in quieter zones, and to do a quick camp and return after your most important skillups/successful combines so that you don't lose anything vital.            </p>

<p><span class="headers">April 08, 2003 - Patch Day</span>
<p>
<p>I'm slowly recovering from the Fan Faire and a week-long visit from my in-laws that started almost as soon as I returned from Vegas and am trying to catch up on both my sleep and site updates. as long as I don't try to do updates in my sleep, we should be all set. ;)
<p>Today's patch has a few items of specific interest to tradeskillers. In the "small but still important" category is the fact that saltwater seaweed, used for a human <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=37&rsa=Brewing&sb=item&sub=tempers-tannins&menustr=080030030000">smithing temper</a>, is finally stackable. This won't affect a ton of folks, but it's still very good news. Of more major note is the fact that how illusions affect faction has changed, and it has caused some unexpected problems when <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=45">obtaining the enchanter mana vial series of spells</a>. The powers that be have been alerted as to the specific issues with obtaining those spells, and will be looking into it. For now, your best bet if you need to acquire the spells is to use druid/ranger wolf form (enchanter illusion spirit wolf will NOT work).
            </p>

<p><span class="headers">April 08, 2003 - ... One More Thing!</span>
<p>
<p>If you are one of the many folks confuzzled about which of the new spell research drops should be saved for whom, you may want to keep the listing of drops for <a href="http://eqtraders.com/sources/source_trade_page.php?st=Spell%20Research&menustr=110120000000">LoY spell research</a> near at hand. (A huge thanks go out to Verdandi for whipping this new section into shape so quickly!!)
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> All right, so I was wrong. It wasn't just "one" more thing today, but two. I'd like to add a quick reminder that pre-registration for the Fan Faire in Las Vegas ends on Monday, March 10th. After that time, you'll have to pay the higher rate of $100. Attendees  must book their own travel and hotel reservations. SOE has made arrangements for EverQuest Fan Faire attendees with the Las Vegas Hilton, Alexis Park Hotel, Embassy Suites Convention Center, and Southwest Airlines for special rates. For more information, please visit the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/index.jsp" target="_new">official EverQuest Fan Faire website</a>. Hope to see some of you there! </p>

<p>
<p>For those of you, like me, that seem to be perpetually lost, the new LoY map feature is a godsend. However, if you're like me, pretty much all you were seeing were blank maps at first, even for zones folks were saying "look at the map!" Turn off the height filter and zoom out, and you'll likely find it much easier to, for example, find your way through the frozen sameness of Everfrost paths. ;)
<p>With EQ having hit an all-time high of more than 118,000 simultaneous users recently, they've announced the launch of another new server, named Maelin Starpyre. For a limited time they will allow folks (for a fee) to movelog from other servers, complete with all their gear. Details can be found on <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=54511" target="_new">EQLive</a>. </p>

<p><span class="headers">March 28, 2003 - Vegas Bound!</span>
<p>
<p>No, you won't find me running around screaming "show me the money!"or anything silly like that, but those bound for the Fan Faire in Vegas this weekend might find a redhead wandering around that answers to Niami, Denmom and other such silliness. I hope to see some of you there! (No, the House Ogre can't make it this time - someone has to stick around to watch the store.) 
<p>While I'd <em>hoped</em> to be able to announce that our database was in alpha testing this weekend, events conspired against us (including a hardware failure of the database server, my own energy levels, etc.). With my in-laws 
arriving a couple days after I get back from the Faire, I likely won't be making any such lovely announcement for a few more weeks.

<p><span class="headers">March 13, 2003 - Patch Day</span>
<p>
<p>Today's patch contains a variety of things of interest to tradeskillers. I'll include the relevant parts of the patch message, with my added comments in italics. I'll also include a few things that are expected to have been in this patch, though they didn't end up in the patch message. 
<p><strong>Spells</strong>
<ul>
<li> Added the ability for any caster to research dropped priest spells using the research books found in Gunthak. The research notes for these spells can be found in the Plane of Knowledge. Wizards, Enchanter, Magician, and Necromancers are able to create any of the researchable priest spells. - <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=124&rsa=Spell%20Research&sub=deity&sb=item&menustr=080105100000"><em>recipes are on the site</em></a></li>
<li> The recipe to create Familiar Enhancement will now actually create Familiar Enhancement instead of Firetree's Familiar Augment. - <em>fixed on the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g83&menustr=080105000000">INT caster Loy Research page</a></em></li>
<li> Changed the recipe for Form of the Great Bear, both in text and in practice. Please read the appropriate research book for the new recipe. -<em> new recipe NOT in place on the site. I'll get it up as soon as someone reports in the new recipe</em></li>
<li> Shaman of Mithaniel Marr will now be able to scribe the Imbue: Diamond spell <em>- I suspect that shaman of Innorruuk are now able to scribe imbue: sapphire now, as well.</em></li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Items</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Corrected an issue with foldable medicine bags and foldable bearskin potion bags. Items should now combine properly. <em>- these items were not combining pre-LoY recipes, but should be happy now. Also, the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=32&rsa=Alchemy&sb=item&sub=chargedpotion&menustr=080010030000">5-dose illusion potions and the 5-dose focus effect potions</a> should now be working (they were DNC)</em></li>
<li> Clockwork Observer legs and boots should now recharge<em> - this is a happy thing</em></li>
<li> Class 3 Wood Point Arrows now have a range of 5 instead of 0<em> - added range is good </em></li>
<li> Changed Blessed Scout Arrows, Blessed Warrior Arrows, Mithril Scout Arrows, Mithril Warrior Arrows, Mithril Champion Arrows and Blessed Champion Arrows to be ammo instead of ranged. <em>- yepyep, these really are ammo items ;)</em></li>
<li> These pottery sketches are now stackable: Barbarian Template, Gnome Template, Troll Template and Animal Template. <em>- this puts these cookie cutter sketches in line with other pottery sketches</em></li>
<li> Added Shaman to all small patchwork and tattered pieces. -<em> this is to allow the one and only small/med shaman race, froggies, to wear small as well as medium patchwork</em></li>
<li> Fixed bugs in the text of Toharon's Memoirs.<em> - the recipe for markar's discord should now be correct. I'm not sure what else got fixed</em></li>
<li> Corrected the recipe for Tae Ew Chain Bracer to use a Bracer Sectional Mold instead of a Plate Bracer Mold.<em> - for a while, we thought the bracer was a total DNC, until someone tried using the plate mold. <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=59&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=armor&menustr=080100100000">Cazic-Thule recipe page</a> has been updated.</em></li>
<li> Smithed Silver Weapons will sell to merchants at a lower price. <em>- we'll eventually collect buyback data using max CHA, but it's a low priority right now</em></li>
<li> Changed the inventory icon for the Fier'Dal Fletching Kit and Knuckle Dusters.<em> - not earth-shattering, but good to know if you're a wood elven fletcher.</em></li>
<li> Swirling Shadows are no longer NO RENT. -<em> Woooohoooo! This will let those using <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=129&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=lplate&menustr=080100140000">shadowscream armor</a> as a skillup path have a bit easier time collecting supplies.</em><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Zones</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Moved the Koada'Dal Forge so that it does not extend into the hallway on the second floor of the building. <em>- I don't think it was moved far, just enough to get it fully in the room in which it belongs</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, it's likely that I'll add/edit this listing as the day goes on.</p></p>
