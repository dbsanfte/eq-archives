<p>
<p>There are many details still missing from the guide for this race.  What we have so far is either here or waiting in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/forumdisplay.php?f=100">DoN Data Submissions Forum</a>.  Please look there if you do not find the detail you need.  But keep in mind, it simply may not have been reported yet.  If you have some details that aren't here or there, please post them and we'll get them updated!</p>

<p>This is the quest for half elves to acquire the books necessary to make the cultural armor that is available with the Dragons of Norrath expansion.  For more information on the general details, see the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q182&menustr=120030000000">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Armor Quest Overview</a>.</p>

<p>While half elves can start in several different cities, these quests are available only from either Qeynos or Kelethin.  You should be able to go to either city, regardless of your class, diety, or starting city.</p>

<p align="center"><i><a href="#qeyn">Qeynos</a> - <a href="#kele">Kelethin</a></i></p>

<p><a name="qeyn"><b><i><u>Qeynos</u></i></b></a></p>

<p>You start in North Qeynos, with Vor Westrider at 55, 204, near the Priest of Discord and Crow's Pub & Casino.  The books do not need to be acquired in any particular order, as Vor will give you all of them at once if you ask.</p>

<h4>Ancestral Book Quest:</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Vor Westrider'</p>
<p>Vor Westrider says ''And hail to you as well, traveler. What news? It's nice to hear from someone of mixed heritage like myself. I often fear our kind will never be fully understood by either elves or human. Though we pass through their lands, we are always a little [uncomfortable] in either community. At least we half elves understand each other.'</p>
<p>You say, 'uncomfortable'</p>
<p>Vor Westrider says ''You know what I mean. When traveling through elven communities, we must duck under their doorways and when visiting our human kin, we receive skeptical stares at our pointed ears. Not to mention, it's impossible to find armor from either race that fits properly. Human clothing is baggy in the shoulders and elven armor tends to chafe in the . . . well. . . you know what I mean, [right]?'</p>
<p>You say, 'right'</p>
<p>Vor Westrider says 'Tell you what -- I contracted a half elven artisan to make me a pattern book for armor specifically for us. I made a suit and it fits perfectly. If you'd like, I can make you a copy of the pattern [book]. I also have some advanced armor [patterns] you may be interested in.'</p>
<p>You say, 'book'</p>
<p>Vor Westrider says 'Excellent, I can make you a pattern book, but first I'm going to need some materials. Bring me a fire beetle carapace for the cover, a patch of zombie skin for the pages, a golden bandit tooth for the clasp, and a lion tail to grind down and make a salve which will protect and preserve the finished product. I have heard these resources can be found in Western Karana. Once I have these things, I can create the pattern book for ya.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quest Summary: Collect and hand in Fire Beetle Carapace, Zombie Skin, Golden Bandit Tooth, and Lion Tail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vor Westrider says 'Well done, Landargo. Here's your pattern book. It may take some practice to learn to master these designs, but, in time, I'm sure they will serve you as well as it did me. I'm still working on new designs so be sure to stop by later. I may have some more for you.''</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Receive: Ancestral Half Elven Armor</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'patterns'</p>
<p>Vor Westrider says 'These, I cannot give away, but I can share them with you provided you are willing to help make Norrath safe for us wanderers again. I'm currently working with the city of Qeynos to secure trade routes outside the city gates. We need someone to lead expeditions into [Erud's Crossing], [Kedge Keep],the [Dragon Necropolis] or, if you've got the metal for it, the [valley] on the other side of the lavastorm mountains. Interested? The more difficult the expedition the more powerful the armor pattern, I can provide.'</p>

That should curb their attacks on our sailors. When you've finished dispatching the creatures, bring me four lake pebbles from their stomachs as proof of your kills.'</p>

Sure enough, the wreckage inevitably washes up near Kedge Keep. Swim into that keep and kill fifty mermaids. Return to me with several vials of ocean ink.

<p>Ancestral Half Elven Armor:<br />
"Gifted with the characteristics of two races, half elves can adapt to either human or elven society with relative ease.
Despite this, half elves have no free-standing culture of their own and often fear they are doomed to be perpetual awkwardness among either of their parent races. For this reason, Vor Westrider traveled the world and consolidated this book of uniquely half elven armor designs. These designs are light-weight enough to allow for a half elf's innate elven nimbleness, but are also heavy enough to take advantage of half elves' human-inherited heartiness. The patterns in this book can be copied many times, but eventually they will wear out and you can tell that if you use the patterns enough you will need to replace the book. To create pattern for tailoring armor templates based on these patterns you will need this book, a large bottle of ink, a roll of plain parchment, a quill and a compacted backpack to hold the patterns you will make. You'll also need a book binding to do the work. If you wish to use the patterns to make molds you'll need a kiln to work in as well as a high quality firing sheet, sculpting tools, a huge block of clay and a compacted backpack to hold the molds when you're done."</p>

<p>Books of Half Elven Culture:<br />
"Half elven armor symbols borrow heavily from the characteristics of both elven and human symbols. Many of the half elven armor symbols are based on high elf designs, but incorporate human 'suffixes' and elaborations. The result is a hybrid language of armor runes and an evolved art form distinct from either of its parent branches. This book contains the intermediate half elven armor symbols. Although they offer a fair degee of protection, they are difficult to decipher and wear and are therefore only usable by trained half elves. Ideally, half elven warriors will have some battle experience before attempting to utilize any of these runes. You know that you will be able to reproduce this [sic] pattern many times before the book becomes worn and you must replace it. To create pattern [sic] for tailoring armor templates based on these patterns you will need this book, a large bottle of ink, a roll of good quality vellum, a quill and a compacted backpack to hold the patterns you will make. You'll also need a book binding to do the work."</p></p><p>
