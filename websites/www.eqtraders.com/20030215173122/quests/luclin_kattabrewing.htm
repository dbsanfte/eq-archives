            <h3> Luclin - Katta Brewing Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This quest originates in Katta Castellum, with a pair of dwarves 
              in the tunnels. Items in </i><b><i>bold italic</i></b><i> are <a href="../secrets/recipes_brewing.htm">player-brewed</a> 
              items. Note that it results only in xp and faction. There is no 
              coin/item reward for this quest.</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Rowle Shieldson'</p>
            <p>Tack Shieldson says 'Oi there, friend!</p>
            <p>Rowle Shieldson says 'Sure'n this one came from Norrath, eh Tack? 
              One wonders if'n a bottle o' one on o' the finer things in life 
              might be in our future, if we were to ask politely?</p>
            <p>Tack Shieldson says 'Yar, Rowle. So whadda ye say? We stand around 
              drinkin' water on duty all day, and that ain't no life fer a dwarf. 
              Now we bin hearin' bout all these new ales and suchnot comin' up 
              from Norrath. Ye think ye might be so kind as to share a pint and 
              raise our spirits?</p>
            <p>You say, 'I will share a pint'</p>
            <p>Rowle Shieldson says 'That'd be great! By Brell, a short beer or 
              a honey mead'd be a nice change from?</p>
            <p>Tack Shieldson says, 'Shhhhhh!!' He runs over and kicks Rowle in 
              the kneecap and chuckles under his beard in your direction. Speaking 
              under his breath to Rowle, 'Don' be such an idjit, now this lad 
              came all the way from Norrath, why not try some of the fabled ales 
              we'd heard our pappy's talkin' of?' Subtlety is not the strength 
              of the dwarven race.</p>
            <p> Rowle Shieldson catches on slowly, 'ahhh, roight! Good show, Tack! 
              D'ye think 'e would go te that kinda trouble fer us?'</p>
            <p> You say, 'I'd go te that kinda trouble fer you'</p>
            <p>Rowle Shieldson clears his throat and flashes a broken-toothed 
              grin your way, 'Ye know, me dwarven heart longs for me first taste 
              o' some <i><b>underfoot brown</b></i>, a reputed fine stout not 
              available 'ere on Luclin... Ye know, if ye can manage it that is.'</p>
            <p>Tack Shieldson says 'Ahhh, worthy o' Brell hisself or so they say. 
              Ye know when I was just a pup, back before the exodus, me uncle 
              used te talk about stompin' trolls and then sitting back with a 
              <i> <b>Boot Beer</b></i> te celebrate the day's victory. I, ummm, 
              really would be able te get in touch with me heritage were I able 
              to sample some o' that fine stout. Ye'd be a true friend to the 
              Validus Custodus fer helpin' us out friend. My thanks to ye in advance.</p>
            <p>~~~</p>
            <p>You will find the recipes for boot beer and underfoot brown on, 
              yep, you guessed it, the <a href="../secrets/recipes_brewing.htm">brewing 
              recipes page</a> of this site.</p>
            <p>~~~</p>
            <p>Handing the appropriate brews to Rowle and Tack results in the 
              following:</p>
            <p>Tack Shieldson gingerly takes the boot from you, handling it as 
              though it were a fine porcelain. With a look of thanks to you he 
              slowly lifts it to his lips and suddenly tips it back to empty it 
              in one gulp, frothing his beard in the process. 'Yar! That's the 
              ticket! Damn fine stuff that is, just like me uncle always said. 
              A service to the Validus Custodus have ye done, my friend... And 
              I'd be happy to assist ye in that service again sometime. HAR!'</p>

              Your faction standing with Katta Castellum Citizens got better.<br>
              Your faction standing with Magus Conlegium got better.<br>

            <p><br>
              Rowle Shieldson takes a wee sip and smacks his lips together, proclaiming, 
              'Ahhh, a finer stout has never passed my lips, ' before draining 
              the mug in one gulp. 'Yer a saint amongst us, I say. Feel free to 
              keep 'em coming, Mendan!'</p>
