<I><SMALL>(Background: &nbsp;On alt.games.everquest, a customer who had recently
destroyed some valuable loot asked for a confirmation button to pop up when
combining items in containers. &nbsp;Much debate ensued, until Gordon Wrinn,
Verant's Internet Relations Manager, posted the following and sent everyone
into laughter. )</SMALL></I>
<P>
&nbsp;
<P>
&gt; What we need is a Confirm box for "combine", so we don't accidentally<BR>
&gt; destroy our loot. Of course, we sould be able to tunr the confirmation<BR>
&gt; on or off on the main options, so we don't need to confirm every time<BR>
&gt; when we get down to a serious baking session.
<P>
Though I could explain how I feel about confirmation boxes, this bit of<BR>
humor I picked up pretty much describes it :)
