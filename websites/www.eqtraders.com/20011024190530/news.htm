                    <b>What's New?</b> New baking recipes are still pouring in 
                    from a horde of happy cooks, and I'm sure it will take a while 
                    before we figure out all the new fish dishes. Expect some 
                    shuffling to be done on the baking recipes page in a few days 
                    to try to better organize the new recipes, but for now, I'm 
                    just trying to make sure they all get listed as we find them. 
                    Smiths are reacting with a mixture of pleasure and frustration. 
                    Enchanted chain jointing is now working for high elves and 
                    dark elves, as are their racial chain boots, and stats are 
                    starting to come in for many of these armor items. However, 
                    human cultural smithing recipes for imbued field plate boots 
                    and the enchanted antonian longsword still appear to be nonfunctional. 
                    Tailors are still pulling their hair out, as they're trying 
                    to find the hinted-at new recipes, and not having much success, 
                    as the only new &quot;recipes&quot; that have been found are 
                    for the 5th Thurgadin Shawl quest.</p>

                    <b>Patch Day!</b> Most folks know the drill - it's going to 
                    take time to process everything that went in during this patch 
                    to see what affects us. Please be sure to check message board 
                    threads before you start yet another totally new thread on 
                    a topic that's covered in 6 other places - it makes it really 
                    hard for folks to follow what's going on with all the repetition. 
                    :) The below information will be updated later today, once 
                    we know for sure how things are going on the live servers.</p>
                  <p>Here's what I know about today's patch and how it will affect 
                    tradesfolk:</p>
  
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a problem making it hard to loot really large NPCs 
                    - if this works as stated, it should make it easier to loot 
                    Terrorantula for silk.</li>
                  <li>Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows - the details 
                    are VERY vague on this, and I'm sure everyone will have their 
                    own pet theories or ideas on how this &quot;should&quot; work 
                    in the forums. Only time will tell how significant a change 
                    this truly is.</li>
                  <li>Not only the party, but the person looting, will now see 
                    a text message saying what the person looted - at the least, 
                    this will make those folks hunting cat pelts in the Karanas 
                    happier, as you can tell which quality pelt you looted without 
                    having to peer at each pelt as you're looting.</li>
                  <li>You can move items in and out of containers in your bank 
                    without having to remove the containers from the bank - a 
                    great boon to space-impaired tradesfolk!</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>Other things not in the patch message that are expected in 
                    this patch. (We won't be able to check any of it out until 
                    things are up and running again, of course)</p>
                </blockquote>
                <ul>
                  <li>&quot;Some&quot; new tailoring recipes. No word yet on what 
                    form these will take, but this message will be updated accordingly 
                    as we know more.</li>
                  <li>New baking recipes, mainly for the seafood lovers amongst 
                    us. Unfortunately, the text for these recipes didn't make 
                    it in this patch, though, so unless we succeed with some creative 
                    experiments, we may not actually see these until the next 
                    patch.</li>
                  <li>Several fixes were made to bugged recipes (enchanted adamantite 
                    chain, enchanted/imbued adamantite leggings, stats on the 
                    velium hound moccasins, etc.), but we don't know if they managed 
                    to get added to today's patch, or if they're waiting on the 
                    next patch.</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote> 
                  <p>I've also added a <a href="learn/learn_velious_nontailors.htm">lovely 
                    guide</a> for all the non-tailors out there who want some 
                    of the Velious tailored armor, giving information on the relatively 
                    difficulty of obtaining the needed items for your local tailor. 
                    It will hopefully raise a bit of awareness amongst non-tailors 
                    in just why it's so difficult to get a tailor to &quot;just&quot; 
                    make and sell them some pieces.</p>

                    tradeskill guide editor went awry for a while, but they're 
                    fixed now. </p>
                  <p>It's a quiet week on the tradeskill front since there's no 
                    patch, but experimentation and discussion continue on the 
                    boards. Slowly, we're getting more <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">stats 
                    for various cultural smithing items</a>, as more folks try 
                    out various enchanted variations.</p>

                    <b>We're back!</b> It was a rollercoaster day for the site, 
                    with a lot of ups and downs, but things look stable now. I'll 
                    keep my fingers crossed that the hard-working folks at Refplace 
                    have got things well in hand now.</p>
                  <p>I'll get more up tomorrow, as I'm sort of busy in Hate right 
                    now, but a quick note to let folks know that while the tier'dal 
                    version of enchanted adamantite chain jointing is misbehaving 
                    (Yakatizma's looking into it), enchanted tier'dal plate works! 
                    I'll get the appropriate recipes onto the dark elven smithing 
                    page tomorrow . For now, you'll find out how I did it on <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=2160.topic">this 
                    message board thread</a>, plus stats of the piece I made.</p>

                  <p>A few quick notes in the meantime. <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">Baking 
                    recipes</a> have been updated with several new recipes, as 
                    well as food type information and know stat information. Once 
                    the boards are back up, I'll ask folks to scan the recipes 
                    page and see what I've missed. Since this <i>is</i> a tradeskill 
                    site, you'll only find information on there for player-made 
                    food, not for any of the purchased stuff. It's also been officially 
                    confirmed that right-clicking on foods will NOT give any of 
                    the listed stat changes for that food, and will only last 
                    half-duration.</p>
                  <p>A few pieces of <a href="secrets/recipes_tailoring_erudite.htm">steelsilk 
                    armor</a> (erudite cultural tailoring) have been made. Due 
                    to the rarity of the spawn, and the extreme expense involved, 
                    we don't expect to quickly have complete stats for this tailored 
                    plate-class armor.</p>
                  <p>Thanks to the changes in enchanting metals for smithing, 
                    we're gradually learning more about the various enchanted 
                    cultural armors. The <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_armor_stats.htm">armor 
                    stats page</a> has been updated and slightly revamped to make 
                    it easier to find out what we know.</p>

                  <b>Patch Day!</b> It's that time again, and there are several 
                  known tradeskill changes in it:</p>
              </blockquote>
              <ul>
                <li>Durations on food items have changed. We've got a thread on 
                  the baking message boards tracking meal/snack status on various 
                  goodies. Some foods also have stat bonuses listed, however, 
                  these bonuses are NOT actually showing up when you right-click 
                  to eat the food.</li>
                <li>Ovens have been added to Grobb. I'll get info on where, and 
                  put it on the proper Trade Supplies pages.</li>
                <li>Buying stacks of items off merchants has been implemented. 
                  This, of course, only works if the item is stackable. Also, 
                  merchants have improved their inventory retention program, and 
                  fully count stacks of items that are sold to them, so that they 
                  can sell all the items back to someone else. (Before, if you 
                  sold a stack of items to a merchant, the merchant paid for them 
                  all, but would then only think he/she had one of the item to 
                  sell back.)</li>
                <li>World (stationary) trade containers have been fixed. This 
                  <i>should</i> fix the crash to desktop problem folks were having 
                  on a combine, and solve the confusion generated when folks thought 
                  their ingredients were disappearing after an incorrect combine 
                  (from a wrong recipe). This likely does NOT address the tailoring 
                  issues we're seeing, and once the dust has settled, we'll need 
                  to start getting in feedback if the DNC problems are still continuing 
                  for portable trade containers such as sewing kits.</li>
                <li><b><i>Cooking spits have had their weight increased to 3. 
                  Contrary to the patch message, skewers are still weight 0.1</i></b></li>
                <li>Last, but <i>definitely</i> not least, enchanting metals for 
                  cultural smithing no longer requires gems during the enchanting 
                  process. This is a great boon to cultural smiths, and should 
                  allow us to experiment a bit more easily with some of the enchanted 
                  armors and weapons. There's already been much rejoicing over 
                  the news that this was on Test, and I expect we'll see a lot 
                  of the &quot;gaps&quot; in our enchanted cultural armor stats 
                  information filled in over the next week or two.</li>

                  <b>Thanks folks!</b> Thanks to feedback from various folks who 
                  follow these boards, the QA folks may have nailed down the crash 
                  to desktop problem with tradeskill containers. I'm still not 
                  sure if the DNC message folks have been getting on valid recipes 
                  are linked (i.e., &quot;phantom&quot; items still in the container 
                  from a failed combine) or not, but they've at least found part 
                  of the problem, and are working to resolve it. For those of 
                  you unaware of what I'm talking about, here's a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000032.html">link 
                  to the thread over on the SONY boards</a>. </p>

                  <b>One Million ... Plus!</b> Thanks to Ragefire not showing 
                  up for a few days on my server (just when I'm one of the prime 
                  people &quot;camping&quot; for hours on end to try to get him 
                  for a guildmate), I'm even more behind on things than normal. 
                  However, since today's a banner day, of sorts, it deserves some 
                  sort of post. The message boards topped the 1 million hit mark 
                  today, since their rebirth a year ago January. (That's a half 
                  a million hits just since this January.) I wish I had better 
                  stats for the main website, which is tracked separately from 
                  the boards, but we only have stats for the last couple of months 
                  since I moved hosting providers. If March's traffic is any indication, 
                  I'd expect that the main site will get over a million hits this 
                  month, on top of all the heavy volume on the message boards. 
                  Welcome to the mainstream, folks! It's only going to get busier 
                  from here, with all the changes/additions to tradeskills that 
                  have been happening.</p>
                <p>Other mini-updates. Thanks to Khrolan and his raids, I was 
                  able to test out two more pieces of the ice burrower silk (&quot;ice 
                  silk&quot;) armor this week, as well as verify stats on two 
                  more pieces of haze panther armor. As soon as I get more haze 
                  panther pelts, I'll try to get stat verification for the final 
                  piece of that set, then will be trying to avoid my sewing kit 
                  except for testing the rest of the ice silk and the velium hound 
                  armor as parts are available. It's STILL taking folks about 
                  10 tell bombs to get it to sink in that I'm not tailoring for 
                  other folks anymore, but eventually folks will either accept 
                  that no means NO, or I'll be clearing out and refilling my /ignore 
                  list every half an hour because of all the folks who think I 
                  &quot;owe&quot; them civil conversation on tradeskills in the 
                  middle of a raid. ;)</p>

                <b>FanFest = one exhausted halfling!!!</b> I'll likely have more 
                of an update on Monday, after I sleep, deal with an in-game wedding 
                tomorrow, etc., etc. Meanwhile, as soon as I got home, I went 
                in-game and verified two recipes that other players gave me at 
                the FanFest: <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=449.topic">pickled

                eggs</a>. I'll get them onto the recipe pages later. Sleep is 
                my friend. Meanwhile, the message board links are included for 
                folks. I also added a comment in the huge thread about <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=215.topic&amp;start=81&amp;stop=100">tradeskill 
                containers</a> with an idea that has been brought up to Yakatizma. 
                There are NO promises it will go anywhere, but at least the idea 
                has been aired. There are also <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=446.topic">changes 
                afoot in baking sometime soon</a>, and I'll talk about that, and 
                other experiences from the FanFest (including my interview for 
                the <i>Avatars Offline</i> documentary) ... but likely not until 
                Monday. The same goes for the multitude of posts with trivials 
                and other site updates that I've not dealt with - it likely will 
                be Monday before I tackle much more. Sleeeeeeeeep <i>&lt;thuddddd&gt;</i></p>

                  Tradeskill experimenters rejoice! One of the things that has 
                  always hindered significant experimentation with the myriad 
                  of recipes that we've been told are &quot;out there somewhere&quot; 
                  but that have been undiscovered has been resources. It's painfully 
                  hard to throw what can be hundreds of platinum pieces' worth 
                  of items and/or hours worth of collection time, into a tradeskill 
                  container on an &quot;experiment&quot; that will fail and destroy 
                  the items. Currently live only on the test server is a change 
                  that will make tradeskill containers NOT destroy items that 
                  &quot;do not combine&quot; (DNC), making the lives of curious 
                  experimenters a lot easier. On the downside, many portable tradeskill 
                  containers will given a weight increase, making it harder for 
                  packrats like myself to lug about multiple different containers 
                  for tradeskilling in the field. (My worst packrat is my shamaness, 
                  who regularly carries around a spirit pouch, bearskin potion 
                  bag, Coldain Tanners Kit *and* a cooking spit.) Message board 
                  threads were popping up all over regarding this change, and 
                  I'm trying to get them funneled into <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=215.topic" target="_new">one

                <b><u>PART TWO:</u></b> I promised some happier stuff in Part 
                One of today's update (written earlier today). Since then, I've 
                managed to get stats for one piece of ice burrower silk armor, 
                and one of the three velium hound recipes. Eventually, more will 
                follow, but these are high-level mobs, and the parts are hard 
                for any of us tradesfolk to come by, since we're generally so 
                busy huddled over our sewing kits as to not be of a high enough 
                level to hunt these beasts for ourselves. ;)</p>
              <p>I also sent in feedback via the new Sony process for their message 
                boards, regarding today's patch message. I'm sure I'm not the 
                only one that caught the newest &quot;oops&quot; with the note 
                about specialized tradeskill containers telling folks to rely 
                on in-game information and NPC text, then the statement that the 
                Velious tailoring now has to use the Coldain Tanners Kit ... but 
                they forgot to add the note about the kit to the proper recipe 
                book (i.e., Velium Leathers) and/or to any NPC that folks have 
                hailed in Thurgadin. It's been submitted, we'll see where it goes 
                from there. In the meantime, I'll continue to keep on verifying 
                recipes, and making sure that functioning ones are listed here, 
                even when that conflicts with information in the books, etc.</p>
              <p>(<font color="#FF0000"><b>Corrected update:</b></font> the crystalline 
                silk still works in the large tailoring kit. Ice burrower silk 
                and all the Velium Leathers are confirmed to need the Coldain 
                Tanners Kit. The Fine Furs have not yet been tested in both kits. 
                Also note that <b>these tanning kits are MISSING on the Zeb server</b>, 
                possibly others. It has been bugged. One of these years someone 
                will remember to bring down Thurgadin on that server and patch 
                it in.)</p>
              <p><b><u>PART ONE:</u></b> The &quot;About&quot; page has been updated 
                at long last. I'm not happy to have to spell things out as bluntly 
                as I did there, and I fear it will give the wrong message to the 
                99.9% of you who are truly emjoying/using this resouce, while 
                the 0.1% of the ingrates that have spurred the change blithely 
                ignore it, and try to hound me until I get fed up enough to throw 
                in the towel and close all this down.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, once we've got some more positive news on tradeskills 
                (such as after I get my hands on the ice burrower silk and velium 
                hound fur that folks in one of the bigger guilds on my server 
                are risking life and limb to obtain for recipe verification and 
                testing), I'll be glad to balance all this depressing stuff with 
                happier celebration. ;)</p>
              <p><b>Time will tell:</b> if the changes to the SONY boards means 
                that they are continuing their recent track record of ignoring 
                anything that is uncomfortable to them, or if it will truly mean 
                that there will be more positive change and improvement on things 
                that are currently broken (and repeatedly reported as bugs) ... 
                if something to bridge the 131 to 230+ tailoring gap will be put 
                in within a few weeks, or take months, if it ever goes in at all 
                ... if the steelsilk recipes (aka Terrorantula silks) that have 
                been in-game for a few weeks will be actually functional, with 
                all parts dropping in reasonable amounts (more than 2 or 3 silks 
                per server per day) on the live servers within a month ... if 
                the sense of &quot;community&quot; that was on the SONY boards 
                has been totally destroyed by the sudden changes on the SONY boards 
                just at a time when a noticeable chunk of the EQ community can't 
                stay connected due to the recent patch or if folks will continue 
                to be forgiving, even though the timing on the board revamp was 
                horrific ... whether recipe books will be updated to be correct 
                any time in our lifetime (this includes not only the Velium Leatherworking 
                book which doesn't make any mention of Coldain Tanner's Kit and 
                never has, but also things like the several baking recipe books 
                that have been incorrect for well over a year) ... whether other 
                tradeskill improvements that were promised and/or hinted at many 
                months ago will be seen any time, *in a fully working order* will 
                be seen any time in the next half a year.</p>
              <p>I won't hold my breath, but life goes on. So do tradeskills. 
                There's always something more that needs verification, more stats 
                that need to be scrounged, etc., etc. You can play a passive part 
                and simply slurp up the wealth of information provided here, or 
                you can dive in, pitch in, and instead of saying &quot;I can't 
                believe she doesn't have <i>X</i> yet, since it's out on the net&quot;, 
                spend the extra few minutes to go out on &quot;the net&quot;, 
                find it, and post it here. </p>
              <p>The message boards are, as expected, seeing a higher load than 
                ever before. A second message board admin has been added, but, 
                as always, this is a labor of love for the folks that help out 
                around here and stomping around finding fault with stuff instead 
                of rolling up your sleeves and helping out is, and always has 
                been, considered bad form on in <i>this</i> community.</p>

                <b>Velious recipes now need the Coldain Tanner's Kit</b>. Imagine 
                that. Almost 4 months AFTER the recipes are put in game, they 
                retroactively &quot;fix&quot; the recipes to not work in a normal 
                sewing kit, wait a day, then announce they were supposed to use 
                a different kit all along, then they bring down Thurgadin on all 
                servers to patch in said Tanner's Kit. Oh, SO sorry for the inconvenience 
                folks, this is what we intended all along, but had to do bass-ackwards 
                &quot;fix&quot; before we bothered telling anyone about the fix, 
                nor before we fixed the recipe books or put the kit in place. 
                That's no way to run a business.</p>
              <p>Before this patch, earlier today, I posted about the Velious 
                tailoring problems, and counseled patience, since I had faith 
                that Verant would find the problem and fix it. Foolish halfling. 
                My rose-colored glasses are now ground into dust, and the only 
                thing I have faith in is that they've finally pushed me over the 
                edge. Even when I've been upset at how things are working, and 
                upset with snerts in-game, I've tried VERY hard to put a positive 
                spin on things and not degenerate into Verant-bashing, but right 
                now I am SO steamed at the folks responsible for this mismanaged 
                &quot;fix&quot; that it isn't funny. It's taken two years, but 
                I've lost my faith in them ... but not in the wonderful folks 
                in this tradeskill community, so I'll keep plugging along, somehow, 
                for your sake.</p>
              <p>That having been said -- loyal visitors to this site and the 
                message boards, please brace yourselves, the worst is to come. 
                Verant's tired of folks getting mad at them when they mess up, 
                have pretty much taken away their message boards, and I expect 
                a large backwash of angry folks here.</p>
              <p>I know we're all going to want to rant and rave here, since they've 
                taken away places where issues can be raised elsewhere. Just remember: 
                This site is not connected to Verant. This site is at best viewed 
                by them as a &quot;fan&quot; site and at worst as a &quot;spoiler&quot; 
                site, and some of them would probably like nothing better than 
                to see it go under. If you use my boards as the dumping ground 
                for everything you're pissed at <i>them</i> about, it just might 
                go under as I hit total burnout and total frustration. Remember: 
                yes, folks here want to know about things that don't work BUT 
                if you're reporting something broken here, you'd better report 
                it to Verant through their lovely new submission process too. 
                Oh, and don't mention you got the recipes from here, else they're 
                likely to ignore you as working from &quot;spoiler&quot; recipes.

              (Someone's already posted to the SONY boards about it.) </p>
            <p>In the meantime, yes, the Velious tailoring section has been re-done. 
              I know it confused a lot of folks when it was done, and I wasn't 
              able to announce it properly because there was a bit of a fibercut 
              problem yesterday and I couldn't get to the site when I had time 
              for updates. However, there really are buttons once you get to the 
              Velious tailoring recipes section that lead you to the Fine Furs, 
              the Silks (crystalline and ice burrower) and the Velium Leathers. 
              I apologize for the confusion, but hope the information is a bit 
              more manageable in smaller chunks, rather than all thrown together 
              like it was before. :)</p>
            <p>One LAST time, before I start having my mail forwarding service 
              start flinging email back at folks with a message telling folks 
              to tell it to the message boards instead of to me. Screen shots 
              of tradeskill fashions go to <a href="mailto:fashion@eqtraders.com">fashion@eqtraders.com</a> 
              (yes, if she stays missing much longer, I'll find another fashion 
              editor volunteer and this email will go to them instead). Trade 
              guides go to <a href="mailto:guides@eqtraders.com">guides@eqtraders.com</a>. 
              Information on trivials, new recipes, new merchants and &quot;how 
              do I ...&quot; and &quot;where can I ...&quot; and &quot;what is 
              the recipe for ...&quot; go to the message boards. I can and will 
              delete email from folks that think that one little halfling has 
              the time and energy to deal with the flood of folks who seem to 
              expect personal attention in email for things that are better handled 
              by the tradeskill community at large. Yes, there are things that 
              should be directed to me in email, but the above are not part of 
              that list. Folks, I know, there are many of you who think I'm now 
              a &quot;bitchy, whining, redhead&quot; for repeating this, but it's 
              just NOT sinking in to some of you, and, believe it or not, I'm 
              as tired of repeating this as you are of hearing it. One of the 
              many reasons I created this website was so that I would NOT get 
              hammered with the junk that folks are still trying to insist I handle 
              all by myself. There's a huge pile of information on this site, 
              and an active community on the message board. Use them instead of 
              trying to burn me out even faster by sending me email questions/comments 
              that should be handled here.</p>
            <p>More once I'm coherent. I have a ton of recipe pages to fix now.</p>

              Even though folks were told to &quot;check your books&quot; by Verant, 
              scouring the lands high and low has found nothing new in any books. 
              The jewelry book text has been modified a bit, but contains nothing 
              new. The only other &quot;book&quot; is the Terorantula silk stuff, 
              which was live a week ago, and is totally useless until the silk 
              is in game. Arctic wyvern armor doesn't count as new, because the 
              recipe has been in-game since Velious launched, just nonfunctional. 
              There are a couple of new things, but not from any book we've found 
              ... a) there's a new <a href="secrets/recipes_pottery.htm">pottery 
              recipe</a> for a Thurgadin quest, that can be used to make a no 
              drop Thurgadin Gate potion. b) at least one velium weapon can now 
              be smithed, possibly more. It wasn't found from a book, but from 
              experimentation. Keep up the good work on trying stuff out and <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=1787.topic">posting 
              results</a>, folks!</p>
            <p>Bah ... the children are loose on the message boards without their 
              babysitters again. Please ignore them, the more you respond to them, 
              the more likely they are to continue here with their antics. Nuff 
              said.</p>
            <p>I'm pretty fed up/burnt out due to a lot of things right now, and 
              will be taking several steps back to take a few deep breaths. I'll 
              likely be less visible in-game for a while, which means less speedy 
              verification of some information for the site. Hang in there, folks, 
              the idjits may have me down, but I'm not giving up yet.</p>

              <b>Patch Day.</b> After seeing the patch message, I know folks are 
              going to be screaming through here at Mach 20 hoping for news. The 
              front page will be updated as information comes in, but a couple 
              things before the floodgates are opened. Questions, comments, discoveries, 
              etc. go to the message boards, please. Do NOT send me email with 
              patch information - <i>six</i> people have already felt the need 
              to email me telling me there's new tradeskill stuff in this patch 
              (I know folks mean well, but, seriously, I <i>do</i> check patch 
              messages myself). Do NOT tell bomb me to give me information OR 
              to ask if something has been found. I will be BEYOND swamped today 
              trying to verify things, and the more you bother me, the slower 
              you and everyone else, will get the information you want. Nuff said. 
              I shouldn't have to repeat myself on this.</p>
            <p><b>Cod</b> is in game and fished in Cobalt Scar. The <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">arctic 
              wyvern armor</a> makes shaman-only armor. Yes, we've got full stats. 
              No, you don't want to know how much money my guild and I spent to 
              make that many studs and such in prep for today. (And yes, there 
              was an &quot;oops&quot; in the recipe page for a couple hours. It 
              really does need arctic wyvern hides, and the page has been fixed 
              accordingly.)</p>
            <p>As for the many &quot;other&quot; new recipes that were mentioned 
              for the patch ... none have been found. The Terrorantula Silk (aka 
              &quot;steelsilk&quot;) recipes were actually available on a merchant 
              since <i>last</i> patch ... and the silk isn't dropping in-game 
              yet. Since the message said to check our &quot;books&quot;, folks 
              are scrounging recipe books left, right, center and diagonally from 
              all across the lands and have yet to find any of the new recipes 
              in old books, much less in new books. Hmmm ... further discussion 
              is on the message boards. Something may turn up yet, but I'm understandably 
              burnt out from the &quot;sewing bee&quot; earlier today, so I'm 
              taking the rest of the night off from tradeskills ... really. I 
              can do it. I won't try out anything more tonight, even though I

              in during tomorrow's patch. Mind you, they've told her this before, 
              and it's not gone in, but I'm going to cross my fingers, toes and

              <b>Patch Day.</b> A happy note for tradesfolk who can never remember 
              what their skill is in a certain tradeskill. Your skills listing 
              will now list your skill level, if it is above 100.</p>
            <p>The frustrating hunt for cod begins .. again. This <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessage?topicID=816.topic" target="_new">message 
              board thread</a> will contain updates on our search. Feel free to

              for yourself, then post the information to the boards.</p>
            <p>There is new silk tailoring now to be found on Velious, using crystalline 
              silk and ice burrower silk. All stats are verified for the crystalline 
              silk, but the ice burrowers are not only a higher level mob (Western 
              Wastes), but a lot more expensive, too. :) Soooo, expect it to be 
              a while before we have verified recipes for those. In the meantime, 
              recipes can be found on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious 
              recipes page</a>. Sometime this week I hope to revamp all the tailoring 
              pages, including this one, but at least you can get to the recipes 
              while I'm doing so.</p>

              <b>She's ba-a-a-ck!</b> I'm back in town, though it will take me 
              a few days to catch up on everything. I can now say from personal 
              experience, though, that even a 1-hour flight is a total nightmare 
              when flying with an ear infection. (Ugh) Othmir fur is finally dropping 
              in-game. A few new pieces of the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">velious 
              tailored armor</a> have had recipes/stats verified. A few more stats 
              are in place for imbued jewelry. The enchanted seafarer's weapons 
              for <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_human.htm">human cultural 
              smithing</a> that have been listed as bugged since the September 
              smithing patch may have been changed/deciphered. (The NPC source 
              for this is now apparently asking for enchanted sheets that are 
              made from HQ ore, instead of the original request for enchanted 
              MQ sheets). And ... cod is still totally, 100% believed to be missing. 
              CodFest 2001 was a bust, fishermen and women have thrown down their 
              fishing poles in frustration, and I'm praying something about it 
              will appear on the SONY boards sometime with a confirmation or an 
              ETA.</p>
            <p>As mentioned below, if you have questions, and can't find the information 
              on the site, please post to the message boards instead of filling 
              up my mailbox. You're far more likely to get a response if you post

              <b>Patch Day ... and the DenMother runs away!</b> Murphy and his 
              laws caught up to me again, and instead of having a &quot;leisurely&quot; 
              24 hours in which to verify patches to tradeskill stuff before going 
              out of town, I ended up with far less time. (Tunare was down for 
              the count for a while this afternoon, and once it was back up, and 
              I'd fished my way through a couple hundred bait, it was time for 
              me to go down for the count and take a nap!)</p>
            <p>I've managed to verify only a few things today: gator rolls (had 
              been bugged since launch, I think) now work with the in-book <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">recipe</a>, 
              holgresh fur cap and boots are working (email verification from 
              someone on the cap, though it failed; I made the boots, and stats 
              are on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious tailoring</a> 
              page). Some stealth-additions to <a href="secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">imbued 
              jewelry</a> went in, and while I'm very under-impressed with the 
              Karana imbue (and many other imbues from Jan 31, such as Niami's 
              Bristlebane imbue), I'm ecstatic over the Tribunal imbue.</p>
            <p>Sadly, our cod fishing expedition met with no luck. We only had 
              time to test 40 to 60 fish in each of the following zones before 
              we put away our fishing poles in frustration, but either these fish 
              are somewhere really odd in Velious, or they've broken the pattern 
              of all other Velious tailoring recipes, and need a spawn from another 
              continent. (Iceclad, Eastern Wastes, Kael Drakkel, Great Divide, 
              Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Skyshrine, Sirens Grotto and Western 
              Wastes were all fish-tested today.) Soooo, the 40 velium bits and 
              dozen arctic wyvern hides that my guild helped me collect will have 
              to sit in the bank a while longer, and we have an entire suit of 
              tailored armor that still can't be made. If anyone finds cod (and 
              please, no &quot;friend of a friend of a friend of mine&quot; stories) 
              PLEASE post to the message board ... there's a thread in the tailoring 
              section about our most recent attempts.</p>
            <p>A lot of the patch stuff is not yet verified ... and I'm running

              how many times I get email on things that are stated on the recipes

              questions about it. Seriously, folks ... there's a HUGE tradeskill 
              community discussing things on these message boards, and if you're 
              relying on one single halfling for your information via email instead 
              of going to the message boards and relying on all the folks there, 
              you're not only overloading the wee halfling, but there's an increasingly 
              high chance that your questions will not get answered. (Especially 
              if you join the 30+ folks who believe I'm holding back some &quot;secret&quot; 
              to finding the yew leaf ground spawn, and that by sending me email, 
              my answer posted on the recipes page will change. Random means just 
              that ... we can't find a pattern or specific area of Wakening Lands. 
              Asking me over and over again in email won't change that answer. 
              /bonk) For those of you great folks who are reporting in trivial 
              levels and such, much as I LOVE getting such confirmations, if you 
              could start posting that stuff to the message boards instead of 
              mail-bombing me, it makes it easier for others to see the info, 
              and gives me a chance to address it when I'm dealing with site updates,

              Recipes for these pieces are found on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious

              Do not ask me for them, I can't give them to you if I don't have

              keep a guildmate of his alive in Kael. Errrmmm. Hopefully word will 
              eventually go out that my tolerance for tell nukes in game is gone.

              The <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">holgresh fur</a> cap and 
              boots that were to be fixed are also still broken. Some <a href="secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">imbued 
              jewelry</a> combinations were implemented, and we've heard that 
              there is more in the works. There is also supposedly something in 
              the works so that the &quot;missing link&quot; between non-cultural 
              tailoring and the extremely difficult velium tailoring will be implemented 
              eventually.</p>
            <p>This brings me to an interesting point, and yes, it means you get 
              to hear another mini-vent here. &lt;g&gt; I was treated rather condescendinly 
              by someone on my server the other day because I am &quot;wasting&quot; 
              my time on the velium tailoring before my halfing racial tailoring 
              was maxxed. (Mind you, this same fellow then tried to hound me into 
              giving/selling/trading haze panther skins, so that he, with his 
              lesser skill, could have the chance to make these items, but that's 
              another story.) I am working on velium tailoring for one reason, 
              and one reason only ... all you folks. I, at least, am enough of 
              a stubborn redhead to keep trying until all the recipes are verified, 
              and the stats are known. There is nothing more frustrating to a 
              tailor to make repeated expensive and time-consuming attempts at 
              making armor, only to find that when you <i>do</i> end up with a 
              success, that the item you've made is nowhere near worth the work 
              you put into it. By collecting as much information as possible on 
              DNCs and stats, I hope that many of you tailors can focus on trying 
              to make the pieces that <i>are</i> worth your while. (Each set seems 
              to have some great items, and some items that no person over level 
              20 would want.) For those of you who are going to sneer at me as 
              being &quot;foolish&quot; by &quot;wasting&quot; my time on this 
              stuff, while being hypocritical enough to then try to get me to 
              collect pelts for you ... keep it up and you'll find that while 
              I've been the soul of politeness so far, I am well capable of using 
              /ignore ... and the rest of my guild is too. You ARE making use 
              of the fruits of my research on this site, and as such, you have 
              no right to snipe at how that research is done.</p>
