<p>
It seems I was premature in promising that the next update would be from the new site. There was just a loud BANG from downstairs ... the House Ogre's computer literally blew up ... it'll be a few days before the replacement power supply is here. <i>(And we mean literally blew up!! I almost fell out of my chair in startlement. - Ngreth)</i> You guessed it ... there's irreplaceable info on that machine that we need in order to move the DB from the test site to the production side. We'll give a new ETA when able.</p>

<p>
I am beyond swamped right now. I'm not even sure I am coherent. But I need to give you folks some updates, so bear with me, please. 

The next update you see, Bristlebane willing, will be from the new database-driven site. Yes, there will still be extra features added, and things changed once we launch. Patience, grasshoppers! :) 

While the multi-yield mana vial spells and the like are quite happy (spell vendor in the EC tunnel), the <b>multi-yield cultural metal enchants are not working as intended</b>. This is acknowledged as a known bug, and will be fixed with the next patch. (Currently requires 5 metal, returns only 1). 

As an FYI, the basic mana vial spells are now sold in High Keep as well as in the brownie village in Lesser Faydark - this should save some creative contortions when shopping for these spells. 

For those who have been flooding me with private messages of concern, yes I am alive, no you have NOT seen me much, if at all, in game. Currently, the game is just too much like work, partly due to the demands of the site and the database, partly due to the demands of too many folks who want to make small-talk within 30 seconds of me logging on. I need a break. Badly. Just leave me be to destress, please. I'll still be in when the devs ask me to test something, but other than that, don't expect to see me for a bit -- even on my bazaar mule, since several folks have taken to tell-spamming him demanding that I come play, etc., etc. It's just too much hassle and very unfun for me. </p>

<p><span class="headers">June 13, 2003 - Beta!</span>
<p>
The <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=62364#62364">cat saga</a> is finally done, and I'm pleased to announce the beta launch of our database. Over the next couple of hours, I'll be wandering through the various forums, doing last-minute trivial updates to the main site, then dropping sticky topics into each appropriate forum for folks to post new trivial and stat updates. Posts will stay in that thread for the next month and NOT be updated on the main site, as I want the site to be stable while testers are cross-referencing what's on the current site with what's in the database. Updates will go into the database, of course, but folks are going to have to rely more heavily on the message boards until the database is launched to the public in a month or so.
<p>As we start this final phase, let me do something that hearkens back to my days as a Project Manager ... "managing expectations."
<p>When the database finally goes live, you WILL see:
            <ul>
              <li>Over 6000 tradeskill recipes -- all general tradeskill recipes currently known, as well as some of the quest recipes</li>
     <li>Over 8000 items -- everything that we know is used in or produced by tradeskills</li>
              <li>Over 2500 mobs -- including all known tradeskill vendors and mobs with tradeskill drops</li>
              <li>Around 2000 sources -- tying the mobs, plus fish and forages to the appropriate items that they supply.</li>
              <li>Varying ways to search the above for recipes, sources, and more</li>
              <li><i>Hopefully</i> speedier updates to the site, as it takes less time and effort to make updates to the site and it is easier for us to set up limited access rights to volunteer editors.</li>
</ul>
<p>What you will NOT see:
            <ul>
              <li>Those rassenfrassen 
                advertisements that seem to be on almost every site you hit these 
                days.</li>
              <li>The even 
                more annoying (in my book) messages that say you must be a paying 
                member to access certain content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We continue to fund the site out of our own pockets, assisted by <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g206">generous donations from the community</a>. Fates willing, we can continue to work this way without it becoming too draining on our resources, though we'll definitely never make it rich off the site! ;) Here's to a successful beta!  I truly hope you'll all be pleasantly impressed with the results of all this hard work, muss and fuss.
            <p></p>

<p><span class="headers">June 11, 2003 - Wheeeee!</span>
<p>
<p>Today's front 
              page update will hopefully make up for the fact that there's not 
              been a front page update in almost a month.</font>
            <p>The patch has 
              several items of interest to tradeskillers. Below are some of the 
              highlights (discussion and details <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=8427">can 
              be found on the boards</a>):</font>
            <ul>
              <li>They stack?! 
                Valor crystals, ceramic lining, holgresh fur, casks. All of these 
                may seem like minor things to non-tradeskillers, but there's a 
                lot of rejoicing around here.</li>
              <li>Shared bank 
                space! Two more bank slots have been made available that are shared 
                across all characters on an account. (No no drop or no rent items, 
                and watch those lore tags!) This will be a boon for those who 
                need to mule tradeskill supplies around on a single account.</li>
              <li>The Kunark 
                catfish croak sandwich quest is finally in working order. The 
                reclusive sewer catfish are back in the waters of East and West 
                Cabilis, and that ever-hungry Klok Foob will happily accept donations 
                of two of his munch break favorites, those yummy catfish croak 
                sandwiches. Once the servers are stabilized today, hopefully someone 
                can provide us with information on the completion of this quest.</li>
              <li>Veksar. 
                A new zone! So far, there's only a few forages, that are shared 
                with other zones, and no zone specific fish, but one never knows 
                what else might be in there.</li>
              <li>Tradeskill 
                item tag. This one is viewed with mixed reactions around here, 
                and may still need a few kinks ironed out. For now, our database 
                will NOT be tracking this new flag, as it would delay our launch 
                by quite a bit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What's this 
              about the database?! Only a true follower of Bristlebane would be 
              excited about announcing a database beta launch for a Friday the 
              13th ... I don't know where that leaves me, as I'm alternately excited, 
              and stressed to the tips of my toes about this one. We'll have more 
              information about this later, and there will be a post on the message 
              boards in the DenMother's Corner if we find a need for more testers. 
              For now, the important information is: beta starting Friday, full 
              launch of this in a month or so if all goes well, and site updates 
              will be "locked" once Friday hits. (Once we're in beta, 
              we'll have special sticky threads to track new trivials and stats 
              and such, but we're going to stop with this time-consuming double 
              and triple-editing of information and focus all our energy on getting 
              the database updated.)

<p><span class="headers">May 14, 2003 - Patch Day</span>
<p>
<p>Today's patch contains a few items of interest to tradeskillers. My comments follow the patch items in bold italics:
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>GM Baking Spoon</strong> - On Firiona Vie, the Grandmaster's 
                Baking Spoon was not no-drop. This allowed players to give out 
                an unlimited number of 100% weight reduction bags. This obviously 
                was not the intention for that item, so we have made the Grandmaster's 
                Baking Spoon no drop on Firiona Vie. -<em> <strong>erm ... whoops?</strong></em></li>
              <li> <strong>NPCs returning bags empty</strong> - NPCs that return 
                items that they do not need were returning all containers empty, 
                regardless of what was inside the container. NPCs that refuse 
                unusable items will now also return bags with their contents intact. 
                - <em><strong>some of us tend to get ahead of ourselves when questing, 
                and hand the wrong item in to an NPC, or forget to hit the combine 
                button on the container before giving it to the quest NPC. This 
                should save us from some lost items</strong>.</em></li>
              <li><strong> NPCs returning multiple items</strong> - If a character 
                gave an NPC multiples of the same item, the NPC would only give 
                back one of them if he did not want them. We have fixed this so 
                that now those items will be returned. Such items will be stacked 
                on your cursor. Just click the item that is on your cursor into 
                your inventory and the next one will appear on your cursor. Keep 
                clicking them into your inventory until you have them all back. 
                BE WARNED that any of these items that you have not returned to 
                your inventory will be lost if you zone or go linkdead before 
                you get them back into your inventory. <em>- t<strong>his goes 
                hand-in-hand with the line item above it. Sometimes we're in such 
                a hurry to finish a frustrating tradeskill quest that we don't 
                pay as much attention to this as we should. Re-read this one carefully 
                to be sure you know how to get those multiple items back into 
                your inventory!</strong></em></li>
              <li><strong>Giant Yellow Jackets</strong> - The chance to find a 
                thorax on the corpses of these creatures seemed too low, so we 
                have increased it. - <em><strong>used in newbie armor quests, 
                this should lessen the frustration of those trying for this item</strong></em></li>
              <li> <strong>Added Honey Mush Bread to Cabilis Vendors</strong> 
                - This is an item needed for a quest that was unavailable. - <em><strong>We've 
                been trying for years to figure out this recipe! It's lovely to 
                hear that some lucky vendor has found a source for this bread. 
                <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q21&menustr=120030000000">The quest writeup</a> will be 
                updated as details become available.</strong></em></li>
              <li><strong> Combining Stacks of items</strong> - Attempting to 
                combine stacked items in a container will no longer work. The 
                items must be separated first. This change will prevent items 
                from being lost due to accidentally combining with them stacked. 
                A dialogue will pop up, warning the player to separate the objects. 
                -<em><strong> a partial fix for this went in a while back for 
                some tradeskill containers. This seems to be a continuation of 
                that fix. As usual, report on the boards if you find something 
                still accepting stacks of items in a tradeskill combine.</strong></em><br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Work on the database continues, thanks in no small part to the 
              database volunteers who have put large chunks of their time and 
              energy into the project. We're still not ready to give an ETA, as 
              the more we get done, the more we find needs to be done, but we 
              are making good progress.</p>

</p>
<p><span class="headers">May 01, 2003 - At Long Last!</span>
<p>
<p>There are two items in the "at last" category today. Depending on what your tradeskill focus is, one, or both, may be of interest to you.
<p>Some of the "old cultural" armor sets that had the same name for more than one collection of normal vs imbued/enchanted vs enchanted set have had unannounced name changes. It will take a bit before we'vegot the site (and the database) updated accordingly, but we're <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=7150">gathering information here</a> on the new names. Note that sets that have multiple flavors of deity-specific imbues, such as imbued field plate and imbued steelsilk were <i>NOT</i> included in this name change.
<p>I'm sure the skeptics among you had long given up on this following annoucement, but we're finally ready to announce that our database is ready for alpha testing. (Sometimes, even <em>*I*</em> wasn't sure we'd ever hit this point, as it has been a very overwhelming task, and real life has thrown us many curve balls since we started this project.) We are NOT looking for added volunteers at the moment, so please, don't join the folks who have already swamped me with private messages containing well-meaning offers of help. I've given up even attempting to respond to them all at this point, as they're eating up far too much time that I <i>need</i> to be spending on the current site and on the database. When we are ready to announce beta (we have no ETA), we will either have a post asking for volunteers, or we will be contacting folks directly. 
<p>I can't stress this enough. Don't swamp us with tells. Don't send us private messages offering to help. Don't make unsolicited posts offering to help. Please, such "help" will only add to our workload instead of helping us. <i>(And it's very likely that we'll totally ignore you and that folks on the message boards will start quoting this front page update at you, since we want folks helping us that are willing and able to follow instructions, and if you're bugging us after seeing this post, you're NOT going to be someone we'll choose to help relieve our workload, hm?)</i>
<p>I truly don't want to seem ungrateful, as without all you wonderful folks that have volunteered information and encouragement over the years, not to mention the dedicated moderators and database volunteers who have kept me from going totally insane, but I'm a very overwhelmed redhead right now, and until this thing is fully launched, I'm fighting a very strong urge to hide in some deep dark corner and tell the world to go away. Of course, if I did that, I'd never get the durn thing launched, <i>despite</i> all the hard work done by my husband and others to get all the technical requirements and searches sorted out.            </p>

<p><span class="headers">April 22, 2003 - Quest Update</span>
<p>
Thanks to some added quest text from VI, at long last the Planes of Power <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q57&menustr=120055000000">Aid Grimel quest</a> has been completely solved. The quest writeup has been updated, and the party platter recipe has also been added to the database and to the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=149&rsa=Baking&sub=pop&sb=item&menustr=080020060000">PoP Baking Recipes page</a>. My thanks to all who aided in deciphering this quest, and to Kronepsis in particular for maintaining an up-to-date quest summary that I could put on the site.
<p>There is some <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=6360">weirdness going on with DNCs and disconnects</a> lately, especially in high-lag  areas such as the bazaar. The folks at VI are aware of the problem, and are working on resolving it. In the meantime, I'd recommend doing any important combines in quieter zones, and to do a quick camp and return after your most important skillups/successful combines so that you don't lose anything vital.            </p>

<p><span class="headers">April 08, 2003 - Patch Day</span>
<p>
<p>I'm slowly recovering from the Fan Faire and a week-long visit from my in-laws that started almost as soon as I returned from Vegas and am trying to catch up on both my sleep and site updates. as long as I don't try to do updates in my sleep, we should be all set. ;)
<p>Today's patch has a few items of specific interest to tradeskillers. In the "small but still important" category is the fact that saltwater seaweed, used for a human <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=37&rsa=Brewing&sb=item&sub=tempers-tannins&menustr=080030030000">smithing temper</a>, is finally stackable. This won't affect a ton of folks, but it's still very good news. Of more major note is the fact that how illusions affect faction has changed, and it has caused some unexpected problems when <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=45">obtaining the enchanter mana vial series of spells</a>. The powers that be have been alerted as to the specific issues with obtaining those spells, and will be looking into it. For now, your best bet if you need to acquire the spells is to use druid/ranger wolf form (enchanter illusion spirit wolf will NOT work).

<p>
<p>If you are one of the many folks confuzzled about which of the new spell research drops should be saved for whom, you may want to keep the listing of drops for <a href="http://eqtraders.com/sources/source_trade_page.php?st=Spell%20Research&menustr=110120000000">LoY spell research</a> near at hand. (A huge thanks go out to Verdandi for whipping this new section into shape so quickly!!)
<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> All right, so I was wrong. It wasn't just "one" more thing today, but two. I'd like to add a quick reminder that pre-registration for the Fan Faire in Las Vegas ends on Monday, March 10th. After that time, you'll have to pay the higher rate of $100. Attendees  must book their own travel and hotel reservations. SOE has made arrangements for EverQuest Fan Faire attendees with the Las Vegas Hilton, Alexis Park Hotel, Embassy Suites Convention Center, and Southwest Airlines for special rates. For more information, please visit the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/index.jsp" target="_new">official EverQuest Fan Faire website</a>. Hope to see some of you there! </p>

<p>For those of you, like me, that seem to be perpetually lost, the new LoY map feature is a godsend. However, if you're like me, pretty much all you were seeing were blank maps at first, even for zones folks were saying "look at the map!" Turn off the height filter and zoom out, and you'll likely find it much easier to, for example, find your way through the frozen sameness of Everfrost paths. ;)
<p>With EQ having hit an all-time high of more than 118,000 simultaneous users recently, they've announced the launch of another new server, named Maelin Starpyre. For a limited time they will allow folks (for a fee) to movelog from other servers, complete with all their gear. Details can be found on <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=54511" target="_new">EQLive</a>. </p>

<p><span class="headers">March 28, 2003 - Vegas Bound!</span>
<p>
<p>No, you won't find me running around screaming "show me the money!"or anything silly like that, but those bound for the Fan Faire in Vegas this weekend might find a redhead wandering around that answers to Niami, Denmom and other such silliness. I hope to see some of you there! (No, the House Ogre can't make it this time - someone has to stick around to watch the store.) 
<p>While I'd <em>hoped</em> to be able to announce that our database was in alpha testing this weekend, events conspired against us (including a hardware failure of the database server, my own energy levels, etc.). With my in-laws 
arriving a couple days after I get back from the Faire, I likely won't be making any such lovely announcement for a few more weeks.

<p><span class="headers">March 13, 2003 - Patch Day</span>
<p>
<p>Today's patch contains a variety of things of interest to tradeskillers. I'll include the relevant parts of the patch message, with my added comments in italics. I'll also include a few things that are expected to have been in this patch, though they didn't end up in the patch message. 
<p><strong>Spells</strong>
<ul>
<li> Added the ability for any caster to research dropped priest spells using the research books found in Gunthak. The research notes for these spells can be found in the Plane of Knowledge. Wizards, Enchanter, Magician, and Necromancers are able to create any of the researchable priest spells. - <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=124&rsa=Spell%20Research&sub=deity&sb=item&menustr=080105100000"><em>recipes are on the site</em></a></li>
<li> The recipe to create Familiar Enhancement will now actually create Familiar Enhancement instead of Firetree's Familiar Augment. - <em>fixed on the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g83&menustr=080105000000">INT caster Loy Research page</a></em></li>
<li> Changed the recipe for Form of the Great Bear, both in text and in practice. Please read the appropriate research book for the new recipe. -<em> new recipe NOT in place on the site. I'll get it up as soon as someone reports in the new recipe</em></li>
<li> Shaman of Mithaniel Marr will now be able to scribe the Imbue: Diamond spell <em>- I suspect that shaman of Innorruuk are now able to scribe imbue: sapphire now, as well.</em></li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Items</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Corrected an issue with foldable medicine bags and foldable bearskin potion bags. Items should now combine properly. <em>- these items were not combining pre-LoY recipes, but should be happy now. Also, the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=32&rsa=Alchemy&sb=item&sub=chargedpotion&menustr=080010030000">5-dose illusion potions and the 5-dose focus effect potions</a> should now be working (they were DNC)</em></li>
<li> Clockwork Observer legs and boots should now recharge<em> - this is a happy thing</em></li>
<li> Class 3 Wood Point Arrows now have a range of 5 instead of 0<em> - added range is good </em></li>
<li> Changed Blessed Scout Arrows, Blessed Warrior Arrows, Mithril Scout Arrows, Mithril Warrior Arrows, Mithril Champion Arrows and Blessed Champion Arrows to be ammo instead of ranged. <em>- yepyep, these really are ammo items ;)</em></li>
<li> These pottery sketches are now stackable: Barbarian Template, Gnome Template, Troll Template and Animal Template. <em>- this puts these cookie cutter sketches in line with other pottery sketches</em></li>
<li> Added Shaman to all small patchwork and tattered pieces. -<em> this is to allow the one and only small/med shaman race, froggies, to wear small as well as medium patchwork</em></li>
<li> Fixed bugs in the text of Toharon's Memoirs.<em> - the recipe for markar's discord should now be correct. I'm not sure what else got fixed</em></li>
<li> Corrected the recipe for Tae Ew Chain Bracer to use a Bracer Sectional Mold instead of a Plate Bracer Mold.<em> - for a while, we thought the bracer was a total DNC, until someone tried using the plate mold. <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=59&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=armor&menustr=080100100000">Cazic-Thule recipe page</a> has been updated.</em></li>
<li> Smithed Silver Weapons will sell to merchants at a lower price. <em>- we'll eventually collect buyback data using max CHA, but it's a low priority right now</em></li>
<li> Changed the inventory icon for the Fier'Dal Fletching Kit and Knuckle Dusters.<em> - not earth-shattering, but good to know if you're a wood elven fletcher.</em></li>
<li> Swirling Shadows are no longer NO RENT. -<em> Woooohoooo! This will let those using <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=129&rsa=Smithing&sb=item&sub=lplate&menustr=080100140000">shadowscream armor</a> as a skillup path have a bit easier time collecting supplies.</em><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Zones</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Moved the Koada'Dal Forge so that it does not extend into the hallway on the second floor of the building. <em>- I don't think it was moved far, just enough to get it fully in the room in which it belongs</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, it's likely that I'll add/edit this listing as the day goes on.</p></p>

<p><span class="headers">February 27, 2003 - Spell Research</span>
<p>
With the launch of LoY, spell research combines began to be used for other tradeskill combines (tailoring). While I had always resisted tracking spell research on the site, due in part to various caster sites already containing the information, and in part from way too much on my plate already, I've decided to bend a little on this one. I will be tracking <a href="http://eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g83&menustr=080105000000">new spell research combines</a> that came out with the LoY expansion, and only those combines. For those of you doing the happy-dance over this news, make sure to <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=4456">stop by the boards and thank Earenhylle Erlkoenig</a> for compiling a master-list of the new spell combines. ;)</font> </p>

<p><span class="headers">February 26, 2003 - Patch Update</span>
<p>
Some new bugs were fixed today, more are slated for the next patch. The bazaar bug that was giving folks an error message when they tried to buy stacks of items from player-vendors appears to be fixed. I believe the cast time on the charged spirit shift potion has also been fixed. Scheduled for the next patch is the fix to the collapsible bearskin potion bag and the collapsible medicine bag, which currently are only working for the new LoY alchemy. Also in the works for the next patch is the fix so that the 5-dose version of some of the LoY potions works properly 

We've made good progress on narrowing down trivials on the new recipes, and it's been a pretty productive week already. Now, if I could just beat my bank space into submission and magically juggle all the trade supplies onto 3 mules across the 2 accounts without having to character hop a gazillion times ... </p>

      <p>While others might wax enthusiastic about frogloks as a playable race,
      new things to see, new mobs to kill, I suspect that the majority of
      tradeskillers are most excited about the doubling of their bank space. (I
      swear, even my mules have mules right now!) Of course, that's not to say
      that we're not eagerly awaiting the other bells and whistles that are in
      this new expansion, but the bank space thing tends to overshadow the rest.</p>

<p><span class="headers">February 17, 2003 - Less than a week to go!</span>
<p>
<p>That's right, folks, less than a week until the Legacy of Ykesha expansion goes live. As usual, you can expect things to be crazed around here once the day hits, as folks are scrambling all over the place finding new recipes, new drops, and cackling gleefully over the expanded bank space. I'll definitely be joining in the cackling for glee, in between gibbering as I try to do 30 different things at once. I'll try to get things up here on the main site, with links from the front page to the new recipes, as quickly as possible so that folks don't feel the need to hit the boards every 2 minutes for updates. ;)
<p>I'm also going to try to squeeze in some time, somehow this week, to get
another chunk of the ever-growing database ready before I have to stop to put
all my attention back into the boards and the main site for the flood of LoY
information. Yes, we're still working on the database; yes, it's going to be
very large and very comprehensive; no, we have no release date yet, but I hope
to have it into beta before I go to the Fan Faire at the end of March ... I
hope. {crosses fingers, toes and eyes}</p>

<p><span class="headers">February 07, 2003 - Evening Update</span>
<p>
<p>The trolls that were lugging along the cultural forge from Grobb to Neriak have
finally arrived at their destination, complied with local fire codes, and set up
the troll forge in Neriak's Foreign Quarter. Meanwhile, the frogs are settling
in nicely, and have industriously replaced all the stationary tradeskill
containers that were damaged during their claiming of Grobb with ones that are
more suited to their more diminutive statures.
<p>I suspect there will still be some changes to be seen, as both groups settle
into their new homes, but this will hopefully settle down some of the more ...
feisty ... tradeskillers a bit. ;) <i>(translation: Primal Scream has gotten a
bit overheated lately. Settle down in there and remember your manners! Just
because you're having a bad week and are upset is no need to ignore the "no
personal attacks" rule, and many of you seem to have forgotten that a) this
is "just a game", and b) there are real people with real feelings and
opinions behind those other personas. If you're THAT steamed about something,
take several steps back AND self-censor yourselves before we get fed up enough
to start doing more bannings, or temporarily close that forum until folks
remember common courtesy.)</i>

<p><span class="headers">February 07, 2003 - Bad Froggies, Naughty Froggies!</span>
<p>
<p>It seems there is no end of troubles for the troll race right now. Not only have
they been kicked out of Grobb, and been forced to go bother the dark elves, but
along the way, they forgot to some very important items. (Trolls aren't known to
be the smartest of creatures, after all!) Among the things forgotten is their
cultural forge, which seems to have been uprooted from their old home, but which
hasn't yet shown up anywhere else. I expect it's going to take time for the dust
to settle, so, for now, things like the trade supplies listings for Grobb ... or
<a href="http://eqtraders.com/sources/source_zone_page.php?article=g89&menustr=110000000000&sz=1054">Gukta</a> ... or whatever
it's called today, are NOT going to be up-to-date. I'll make some temporary
pages as the weekend progresses, but I expect there will still be a lot of
changes incoming before things finally settle down.

<p><span class="headers">February 06, 2003 - Another Patch</span>
<p>
<p>This is another day with a variety of things of interest to tradeskillers. As
usual, I'll add my commentary after each item:
<blockquote>
  <p>- Many Planar Recipes can now be used in collapsible containers. Some
  Planar Tailoring can only be done in the Tanaan Loom as opposed to the Planar
  Sewing Kit. Nothing that was previously made in the Loom was added to the
  collapsible tailoring kit. Skills changed were Baking, Sewing, Jewel Craft,
  and Fletching. <i>(Wheee! This is definitely a happy change for those packrats
  who have invested in collapsible containers. For those wondering, the only
  thing I can think of that specifically requires the PoK loom are parts for the
  planar armor quests</i><br>
  - Added gnome cultural recipe book to Ak'Anon. <i>(Using clockwork armor as a
  base, these are <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=140&rsa=Tinkering&sub=armor&sb=item&menustr=080120040000">tinkered
  armors with some brewing and imbuing required</a>.)</i><br>
  - Changed the weights on Spiritstones to be more in line with Faithstones. <i>(Spiritstones
  were changed from weight 20.0 to weight 0.1 to match the weights on the cleric
  faithstones. Additionally, ogre and troll shammies, please note that the
  Spiritstone of Innothule is now Spiritstone of the Banished, and it ports you
  to Nektulos, not Innothule. We expect to see the storyline explanation for
  this change "soon")</i><br>
  - Changed Collapsible Jeweler's Kit to 6 slots from 4. <i>(The planar
  jeweller's kit has 6 slots, so this is just fixing it to match)</i><br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>- Fixed a bug that caused merchants to charge a little extra or less (1
  copper).<i> (We've long known that vendors do creative rounding when you're
  buying multiples of items. I suspect that this might fix that.)</i><br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll likely have further updates to this later in the day, once I am more
caffeinated.
