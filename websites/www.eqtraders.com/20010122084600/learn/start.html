  from <A HREF="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">Niami</A> (Tunare Server) </b></font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="-1">If you've never 

  tried a trade skill before, there are a few things you should know. </font></font>

<UL>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Remember that training 
    points can only be spent on trade skills early on. Once you hit a skill of 
    20 in the standard trade skills, you MUST gain skill increases through hands-on-practice.</font>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While tradeskills in 
    EQ increase with practice, trade skills cost you money (in supplies), regardless 
    of success or failure. For the more expensive skills, it's wise to not only 
    stockpile some money in advance, but also spend as many training points as 
    you can before trying the skill.</font> 
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Low-level players: 
    Before you even train in a trade skill, you should check to be sure that the 
    materials you will need to practice your skill <a href="../master_list.html">are 
    available nearby</a>. &nbsp;If they are not easily available, you have to 
    make a hard decision -- do you want to try the skill anyway or do you want 
    to try another trade skill? &nbsp;For example, basic smithing supplies are 
    not available in Halas, and if you look at a map, you'll realize you're going 
    to be running through a <I>lot </I>of zones to get things such as sharpening 
    stones and ore. This isn't meant to discourage you, but to make sure you don't 
    spend a lot of training points before you realize the scope of the task ahead 
    of you. (Higher level players tend to move around a lot, so this is less of 
    an issue for them.)</font> 
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Keep close eye on the 
    failure&nbsp;messages that you get when you attempt to combine items. &nbsp;<I>"Those 
    items do not combine in those quantities ..." </I>means just that. Those items 
    don't work together, or not in the ratio you're trying. Give up with those 
    items, or try different amounts of them <I>"You lack the skill to ..."</I> 
    means you've actually got the right items, in the right quantities, but that 
    you failed to make anything. Try, try again. Practice makes perfect, as we 
    well know. And if you're getting a failure rate that will rapidly bankrupt 
    you, then either spend more training points, or find something simpler to 
    practice on. (i.e., don't try to make a silver sapphire necklace the first 
    time you try jewelcraft).</font> 
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> For everything but 
    fishing, sell your goods to other players as opposed to NPC merchants where 
    possible. If you sell to NPCs, you rarely will be paid what the raw materials 
    cost you, much less the value of the item. For example, you'd get slightly 
    over 1 gold for a piece of patchwork armor, when sold to an NPC merchant. 
    The going rate when selling directly to players is generally 2 gold or so, 
    depending on supply/demand and individual whimsy.</font> 
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When a recipe calls 
    for two or more of a single item, <b>DO NOT STACK</b> the items. Have two 
    (or more) piles of the item in your forge, brew barrel, etc., not one pile 
    of two.</font>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Most trade skills are 
    not level-capped, meaning that with enough time and raw materials, you could 
    master the tradeskill at level 1. Other skills, such as fishing and alchemy 
    are limited based on your level, just like your combat and other skills.</font>
  <LI><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When you see mention 
    of a &quot;trivial&quot; on a chart, it means that at that skill level, you 
    will no longer gain skill increases from making the item. You will, however, 
    still continue to fail quite a bit when making the item. Just because something 
    is trivial does not mean you can do it in your sleep. Eventually, as your 
    skill improves, your chance of failing at making the item will decrease, but 
    there's generally <b>always</b> a chance of failure. <i>(silk swatches and 
    silk thread seem to be the exception to this)</i></font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="-1">First off, I feel 

  strongly (as my own experiences attest!) in agreement with what I have read 

  elsewhere-- two skills to a certain degree VERY much seem to influence trades 

  skills in general: </font></font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Intelligence governs how 

  quickly one will learn a skill. Folks with high intelligence seem to learn more 

  from their experiences learning a trade, and learn trades more quickly as a 

  result. I have an intelligence of 127 and I seem to have risen rather quickly 

  in my skills without spending as much money as most folks I know. </font>

<P> 

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> And Charisma (of course!) 

  very much affects the prices of raw materials obtained from merchants. 'Nuff 

  said. </font>
