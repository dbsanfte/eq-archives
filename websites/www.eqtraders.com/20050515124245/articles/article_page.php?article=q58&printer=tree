<span class="headers">Neriak Cleric (Initiate Darkpriest) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests based out of Neriak. The results are DEF CLR only, lore (other than bracer) and no drop. Stats for the pieces have not yet been provided, but the resulting armor is pink in color. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>

High Priestess Alexandrian says 'Greetings child, what business do you have here? I'm sorry but I will only deal with Clerics that are willing to prove their loyalty to Innoruuk. I cannot deal with every single heathen that feels it is necessary to bid me a good day. If you are a [Cleric of Innoruuk] I might be able to aid you in your training.'

You say, 'what magical relic'
</p> 
<p>
High Priestess Alexandrian says 'I have a box that I have been keeping for quite some time and have been waiting to present it to someone like yourself. Someone that I had faith would be strong enough to use it's power to their benefit. This magical box can be used to refine certain metals into a magical compound that is used in crafting Initiate Darkpriest armor pieces. I have the molds necessary to craft Initiate Darkpriest [Helms], [Bracers], [Boots], [Armguards], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. However there are some [important items] that you will need to collect before the molds will be of any use to you. One thing to keep in mind is that I suggest you craft your Breastplate last due to the difficulty of obtaining the items needed for that specific recipe.
