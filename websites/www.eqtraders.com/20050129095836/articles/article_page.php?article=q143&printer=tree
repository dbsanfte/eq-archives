<p>
<p>This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.</p>

<p>The completion of this quest allows you to progress to an alchemy skill as high as 54 without spending any money <b>provided that your character level will allow you to progress to skill 54</b>. (Remember that alchemy is level capped, and that this quest can only be completed once per character; if you finish the quest before you are allowed to progress to skill 54, you cannot go back later and get the rest of the skill points for free.). Each step requires that you hand in enough completed items before you can progress to the next step. When you complete step four, you will be taught how to process the alchemy-specific ingredients, Samples of Taelosian Sludge and Sample Of Highland Sludge. However, please note that at this time there are no recipes that use the results, so the processing ability is not yet useful.</p>

<p>This quest starts with Lita Hegeway, an alchemy vendor. As you start the first step, she will also give you a book containing instructions on making some Gates of Discord recipes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Lita Hegeway'</p>
<p>Lita Hegeway says, 'May your ancestors watch over us all.  I am glad to see you.  I have need of assistance.  I only ask because there is much to do and much at stake.  Can you help me with some simple alchemical [chores]?'</p>
<p>You say, 'What chores?'</p>
<p>Lita Hegeway says 'It is my duty to ensure that the minor needs of those aboard are attended to.  Primarily this means making dye.  You may have noticed that our brotherhood enjoys showing off somewhat and the scouts have always desired colored arrows to help them distinguish their success from that of their fellows.  I just don't have the time to make the dye, I am far too busy trying to discover the components and uses of a very unusual [sludge] that comes from the continent.  Can you [help out]?'</p>
<p>You say, 'What sludge?'</p>
<p>Lita Hegeway says 'I'm not really sure what happened in those mountains in the past, but the runoff there is different and has affected the water and mud.  If you find any of the highland sludge, please bring it to me. I can filter it properly and give you the majority of the concentrate.  In exchange, I'll keep a small portion for my own use.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STEP ONE: <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=13092&menustr=">Wayfarer Black Dye</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'help out?'</p>
<p>Lita Hegeway says 'May your loved ones live on in your heart.  I just can't keep up with the wasteful desires of our smiths, alchemists and scouts.  They use dye as though it were salt water.  I'd be grateful if you could help me by making some of the basic black dye that we use most.  Take this squid ink and add one vial of resin to thicken it.  Use your medicine bag.  Please hurry back with the dye, I haven't the patience to deal with these demands any longer.  If you can help me enough, I might be able to teach you the secret of the Taelosian sludge.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lita gives you enough materials to make 20 Wayfarer Black Dye.  Combine them in a medicine bag and turn in your successess unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 100 Wayfarer Black Dye, when she will move to step two.</p>
<p>STEP TWO: Wayfarer Green Dye</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'help out?'</p>
<p>Lita Hegeway says 'Bless your kin and all their forefathers.  Green dye is very useful and isn't too hard to make.  Why don't you make some for me?  The recipe is fairly simple, using your medicine bag add one vial of this resin to an equal volume of this simple plant extract.  Return with the dye when you are done.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lita gives you enough materials to make 20 Wayfarer Green Dye.  Combine them in a medicine bag and turn in your successess unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 100 Wayfarer Green Dye, when she will move to step three.</p>
<p>STEP THREE: Wayfarer Blue Dye</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'help out?'</p>
<p>Lita Hegeway says 'Thanks to you and yours.  You have been of great assistance.  Right now I have need of blue dye.  This recipe is a little more difficult than green dye, berry juice is notoriously difficult to work with, but you should be able to do the job.  Use your medicine bag to mix this simple berry extract with this resin to thicken it.'</p>

<p>STEP FOUR: Wayfarer Red Dye</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'help out?'</p>
<p>Lita Hegeway says 'Your lineage is that of the most noble family.  You have been of great service to the Wayfarers Brotherhood.  I think I can trust you with the most difficult dye that I need made.  Not only is red dye difficult to make, but the ingredients are noticeably harder to find.  But I think you can do the work.  Take these rare cactus beetles and crush them in your medicine bag with this resin to create the red dye.  Bring them back to me when you are done.'</p>

<p>When you are done:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'help out?'</p>
<p>Lita Hegeway says ''You've been a great help already.  I sense that you have greater tasks to attend to, and there are fledglings about that can continue your work.  As a reward for you assistance, please allow me to teach you the secret of filtering the Taelosian sludge. '  Lita leans forward and whispers directly in you ear.  What she tells you makes sense, and you believe that you can now filter the sludge.  All you need to do is put the Sample of Taelosian Sludge into your medicine bag and combine.  This will return a 'Sample of Filtered Taelosian Sludge.  You believe that with continued work on filtering the sludge you may be able to improve your results.'
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>That's it!  You now have the ability to turn Samples of Taelosian Sludge into Samples of Filtered Taelosian Sludge in your medicine bag.  For more information on the conversion process see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.  Right now, there's no real use for the filtered Taelosian sludge, outside of the collect version of this quest, but that may change, in time.</p></p><p>
