            <p>Originally<a name="Top"></a>, I was just making a web site to make 
              trade skills easier, but I know there are a lot of roleplayers scattered 
              across the servers who are interested in more than just skills. 
              There are also a couple tips in here that may make life easier for 
              the true &quot;newbies&quot; among us. This section is not edited/updated 
              very often, as it's rather low on my priority list.</p>

            <p class="headers"><b>Character Description<a name="Character"></a></b></p>
            <p>While I personally dislike all the folks who walk up without a 
              word and start inspecting my equipment (I feel like there's a bunch 
              of peeping toms staring down my bodice), there is a way to add to 
              the eyeful folks get when they do that. For those of you who don't 
              mind the folks who spam-inspect you, and then harass you trying 
              to buy the clothes off your back, it's a good spot to put any info 
              about yourself that you want to share.</p>
            <p>Take a good long look at yourself from an external view (i.e., 
              press the f9 key a time or two, so you can see yourself on your 
              screen). Right click on yourself, and it should bring up a picture 
              of you, with a blank area below it. Type in a brief character history 
              (or whatever you prefer) that will show when anyone looks at your 
              equipment. ("If you're done staring, kindly remove your eyeball 
              from my bodice" was one of the ones I heard of that got a giggle 
              out of me.) </p>

            <p class="headers"><b>Hunting Tips <a name="hunting"></a></b></p>
            <p><b>"Hail a sand giant"</b> - By now, if you've done much group 
              hunting, you've probably hear this one, however, here's some RP 
              justification/explanation for it. Your group just got done beating 
              on something nasty, and most of the spellcasters are busy meditating. 
              Something nasty comes over the hill, and you need to get out a timely 
              warning before it stomps on your party. You can try, "Guys, look 
              out, there's a ..." followed by the sounds of one or more party 
              members getting blindsided. There's a faster way to warn, them, 
              however, to make up for the time that it's slower to type a warning 
              than it is to physically say it. Target the critter and hit the 
              "h" key to hail it. Think of this as the RP equivalent of pointing 
              at it and blurting a warning. Once you've hailed it, <b>then</b> 
              you can give more accurate information about where it is and who 
              is in danger ... as you yourself either backpedal out of it's path, 
              or move to defend your group's spellcasters. For those of you busy 
              meditating with your noses in your spellbooks, if you hear someone 
              hail a nasty critter, get your nose out of that book and be ready 
              to move or fight. It might just save your life and the lives of 
              those with you.</p>
            <p><b>Corpse fetching</b> - You died somewhere you should not have 
              been ... again. And, well, you would die ... again ... if you tried 
              to loot your body in that particular spot. If you're unable to become 
              invisible, or you died somewhere that creatures can see through 
              invisible, then get yourself, and a couple bodyguards into the general 
              area where you died. Then <b>carefully</b> edge your way closer 
              to your body, trying a /corpse every step or two. The moment the 
              command works, BACK up many steps, and /corpse again. Repeat this 
              process until you've got your body somewhere that is a little safer. 
              Think of this as the RP equivalent of grabbing your corpse and dragging 
              it to somewhere you can loot it in safety. You have to get close 
              to it to "grab" it, and can only drag in tiny spurts because, well, 
              have you ever tried dragging something that is as heavy, or heavier 
              (due to gear) than yourself? Not a fun process for distance-dragging, 
              is it? You can also do this with other people's corpses as well, 
              as long as they have given you /consent. It helps to have /corpse 
              pre-mapped to a socials button in advance, to speed up the dragging 
              process.</p>

            <p class="headers"><b>Language lessons?<a name="language"></a></b></p>
            <p>All the races, other than human, know at least one language other 
              than Common Tongue when they start out. You can learn other languages 
              as you go along, both for the pure fun of it, and for things like 
              reading odd books in various languages (several of the poison tomes, 
              spell research books, etc. are written in other languages.).</p>
            <p>There are two main ways to learn other languages, and you can intermix 
              them.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>As you progress in levels, your trainer will offer to teach 
                you various languages, should you wish to spend the training points 
                (and pp at higher skill ratings).</li>
              <li>Find someone who speaks the language, listen to them talk the 
                language a while, and then practice the language yourself.</li>
            </ol>
            <P>This second method is a great way for a group to pass 10 or 15 
              minutes while they are waiting for someone or something to happen. 
              Make sure you are grouped, and in close physical proximity to each 
              other. Each member of the party should change their language to 
              something that at least 1 other in the group does not know, or knows 
              to a much lesser degree than you. (<i>/lang #</i>, where &quot;#&quot; 
              is a language number from your list changes your spoken language 
              to that language. A full listing of the languages that you know 
              and can attempt to speak can be found by using <i>/lang help</i>) 
            <P>Then go to your <b>socials</b> menu and program up some macros 
              for language lessons. Due to the potential lag issues caused by 
              &quot;spamming&quot; lots of text quickly, it's recommended that 
              you use either single-letter lines of text or program in some pauses. 
              Party members can also turn off groupsay in the chat filter so that 
              they don't see all the language spam, but only the skill improvment 
              messages (&quot;Your language skills have improved&quot;). However, 
              if folks have groupspeak off, remember to work out signals in advance 
              for getting everyone else's attention so they remember to turn it 
              back on when you're done. 
            <P>With the /lang command making it easier to quickly change languages, 
              you can also use macros to change languages, send some text, and 
              change languages back again, so you don't forget to switch back 
              to Common later on. 
            <P>Example social text 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>/lang 2<br>
                /pause 5,/gsay blah<br>
                /pause 5,/gsay blah<br>
                /pause 5,/gsay blah<br>
                /lang 1</p>
            </blockquote>
            <P>Put that socials button onto one of your hotkeys that is currently 
              unused. <b>Turn off group say</b> (in your chat filter section of 
              the options menu) so that you don't see the spam that the others 
              are saying, only the skill increases and your own babble. <b>Remember 
              to turn group say back on in the chat filters when you're done with 
              the lesson.</b> 
            <P>Take a deep breath, and then everyone begin babbling at once, via 
              the hotkeys, in the various languages. (This is called "spamming") 
              Have one person ready to switch back to Common (/lang 1) at the 
              drop of a hat and spam "HOLD!" in normal say until everyone stops 
              if there is danger approaching (alternately, have someone jump up 
              and down or do some other action to get people's attention). At 
              random times, you will see a message flash across your screen that 
              says <font color="#0066FF"><b>"Your language skills have improved."</b></font> 
              However, <b>you won't see those improvements on your skill list 
              until you zone or log off and back on.</b> You also will be unable 
              to teach anyone else your newly-learned language skills until you 
              have zoned or camped. It's amazing how quickly you can become very 
              multilingual, with a few good friends from other races to assist 
              you. 
            <P>If you cannot find someone who is excellent in a given language, 
              you and a friend can slowly skill up in the language, as long as 
              it is offered by a trainer. One of you put 1 skill point into the 
              language. Then spam the other person using that language until they 
              see TWO <font color="#0066FF"><b>"Your language skills have improved."</b></font> 
              messages (you can train them to 1 point above your current skill). 
              Zone. Have the person who just got the two skill increases spam 
              the language back, until the first person gets two increases. Zone. 
              Rinse. Repeat. 
            <P>&nbsp;
            <P>The current languages available in-game are:
            <ol>
              <li>common</li>
              <li>barbarian</li>
