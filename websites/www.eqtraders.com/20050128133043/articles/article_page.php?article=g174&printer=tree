<p>
<p>Q: Is there an EQTraders chat channel in-game?<br><br>

<p>A: Sort of. When chat channels were added to EQ, several fans of the site created a channel named for EQTC. <br></br>
<UL>
<li>To join in: /join serverwide.eqtraders</li>
<li>To autojoin: /autojoin serverwide.eqtraders</li>
<li>To autojoin more than one channel, with passwords, on other servers:<br> /autojoin serverwide.eqtraders,karana.tradeskills,karana.greenbeans:password</li>
</UL></p>

<p>  <i>Some Notes:</i> You will not immediately join those channels after using the /autojoin command.  Autojoining only happens as you log in, so you'll have to either join them manually or log off and back on in order to join.<br><br>
  In order to join a channel that belongs to a specific server (one that isn't serverwide) does <i>not</i> require you to actually be on that server. Anyone can join any channel based on any server, as long as they know the server name, channel name, and password if any. Heck you could be on the Karana server and make your channel with all your Karana buddies "brell.greenbeans" and still all be able to get into it just fine. 
Not that there's any good reason to do such a thing, but it can be done.</p><br>

<p>To talk in any channel you simply type "/*channel number* *Your message*" - dropping the quotes and the asterisks.</p><br>

<h3>A note from DenMom</h3>
