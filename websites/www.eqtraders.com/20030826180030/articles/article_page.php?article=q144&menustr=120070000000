<p>You say, 'I am interested in crafting my own armor' </p>

Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Divine Protector's Greaves.' </p>
<p>You say, 'I wish to craft gauntlets' </p>

Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Divine Protector's Breastplate. Return to me for one [final task] after you have completed your breastplate.' </p>
<p>You say, 'what final task' </p>
<p>Alimaja Shanthun says 'We have been seeking someone to carry a weapon that we wish to provide all new clerics with. I do not trust simply anyone to have the first one but you have shown to me that you are willing to assist our house. If you collect a few [specific things] I will present you with the magical staff that I speak of.' </p>
<p>You say, 'What specific Things' </p>
<p>Alimaja Shanthun says 'I seek 1 Twilight Bloom, 1 Poachers Head, 1 Plague Rat Tail and 1 Large Fire Beetle Sternite. Bring me these items as soon as possible. ' </p>

<p>Some drop information:<br>
Skunk Parts - if not found in Toxxulia, drops from Butcherblock will work <br>
Crude Bronze - kobolds have this, or drops from elsewhere will work <br>
Twilight Bloom - numerous creatures, including fire beetles <br>
Kobold Head - doesn't seem to exist anywhere<br>
Rat Teeth - the correct tooth does not seem to be dropping<br>
Spider Venom - not a drop - crafted with <a href ="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=3012&menustr=035000000000">this recipe</a>. it is a rogue poisonmaking recipe but is easy enough that anyone can do it, with a few tries<br>
Kobold Skull - drops in the Warrens in the cavern bisected by the river which you have to swim across. <br>
Skunk Tail and Skeleton Tibia - may not be dropping in Toxxulia, but drops from Butcherblock will work <br>
Giant Wood Spider Thorax - may not be dropping in Toxxulia, drops from N Ro off desert tarantulas work<br>
Large Fire Beetle Sternum - large fire beetles are very rare in Tox, killing giant fire beetles helps spawn the large ones </p></p><p>
