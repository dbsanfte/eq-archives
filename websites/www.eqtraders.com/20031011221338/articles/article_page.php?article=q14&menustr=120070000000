<span class="headers">Qeynos Rodcet Paladin (Lightbringer) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. Armor
pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, PAL/HUM, HEF and allow the young
human paladin to gain a small amount of smithing skill. Color of the armor is
Grey/Silver. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer
materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a
second one</i>

Armor. I can present you with the material recipes along with the correct armor
molds for each armor piece once you are [ready to begin your exercises].'</p>

supplies. I need someone to [gather the necessary supplies] for me.'</p>

you a weapon together for your trouble.'</p>
