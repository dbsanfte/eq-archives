<p>
<p>This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.</p>
<p>This quest allows the aspiring chef to obtain skill 54.  It will also allow you to learn to process the baking-specific raw materials, taelosian wheat and taelosian mountain wheat.  However, please note that at this time none of the new GoD baking recipes require the use of these materials, so the processing ability is not as important as the skillups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Tylida Eraldi'</p>
<p>Tylida Eraldi squints and looks at you with a slight grin on her face.  'Hello.  I don't suppose you're a baker by profession, or perhaps you're [interested] in learning?  I have several jobs that I need done, but I just don't have time to do them myself.  Are you interested in helping out?'</p>
<p>You say, 'interested?'</p>
<p>Tylida Eraldi says 'This crew needs a lot of food.  My specialty is long-lasting food items that can be taken on long journeys.  Obviously a lot of Wayfarers are taking a lot of long trips these days.  I was wondering if you would mind [helping me] out?  I really want to spend more time working with the newly discovered strain of local wheat.  There's a wild variety of wheat that only grows in the mountainous areas, which is a very odd place for any wheat to grow, But this stuff grows there, if sparsely.  The thing is, there are some very odd properties to this wheat, and with the proper technique it can be made into a very [unique flour].  So if you have a chance, I would be pleased if you could [help out].  Unfortunately, the recipes I'm working on require the use of Taelosian Wheat Flour.  If you can find some Taelosian Wheat, Ordin can make flour from it.  Bring that to me, and I'll have plenty of tasks for you to do.'</p>
<p>You say, 'unique flour?'</p>
<p>Tylida Eraldi says 'I'm still a bit shocked that wheat is growing on the side of mountains.  They even say that some of the creatures up there eat it by the handful like a snack.  Obviously we'd prefer to make baked items from it.  If you can get me some of that Taelosian Mountain Wheat, I'll make flour out of it.  I'll only keep a little of it for myself.'</p>
<p>You say, 'I can help out'</p>
<p>Tylida Eraldi says 'I can definitely use your help. I need some Taelosian Wheat Flour for the tasks I want you to do. Ordin can make flour from the raw wheat if you have any. If you bring me some flour, we can get started. You'll have to sweat a bit before we're done, but if you're up to the task I can reward you with the secret of milling the local wheat. Because I'll be asking you to find your own supplies, I can reward you a bit sooner than Ordin will.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STEP ONE: Wayfarer Wheat Crackers</p>
<p>Ordin Wheasly is right next to Tylida.  Give him a Taelosian Wheat and he will convert it into two Taelosian Wheat Flour. (You will also need to do this every time you run out of Taelosian Wheat Flour and need more for this quest.)  Hand one of those flour to Hiloan to begin her quest to learn the process needed to make Taelosian Wheat Flour for yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tylida Eraldi says 'Thanks for helping me.  The first thing I need you to do is bake some Wayfarer Wheat Crackers.  These are one of the staples of our scouts, and I don't like letting them leave without as many as they can carry.  So take a Small Sack of Taelosian Wheat Flour and Wayfarer Spice and put them in the oven.  Don't be tempted by their wonderful smell.  Eating them isn't really part of the task.'  Tylida smiles.  'Bring them right back to me when you're done.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tylida then gives you enough materials to make 10 Wayfarer Wheat Crackers.  Combine them in an oven and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Wayfarer Wheat Crackers.  When you give her the next Taelosian Wheat Flour, she will move on to step two.</p>
<p>STEP TWO: Wayfarer Loaf</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tylida Eraldi says 'Hello!  Great, thanks for helping.  We need to stock up on Wayfarer loaves.  They keep a good long time, so I hope to get ahead today and stay that way.  Take a Small Sack of Taelosian Wheat Flour, a Wayfarer Spice, and Crushed Nuts and bake them in the oven.  A Wayfarer Loaf won't rise much, so don't worry about that.  Just bring them back here to me and I'll store them.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tylida then gives you enough materials to make 10 Wayfarer Loaf.  Combine them in an oven and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Wayfarer Loaf.  When you give her the next Taelosian Wheat Flour, she will move on to step three.</p>
<p>STEP THREE: Wayfarer Cookie</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tylida Eraldi says 'You've been a big help, thank you.  This time I need some Wayfarer cookies.  These are sort of tough, but very flavorful and tasty.  They travel real well, so they're a big hit with Wayfarers, hence their name.  Just take a Small Sack of Taelosian Wheat Flour, Wayfarer Spice, and two Pinches of Sugar and bake them up.  Please don't try to eat them hot.  They really hold onto heat and you'll probably burn yourself.  Just bring them to me and I'll get them to those that need them.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tylida then gives you enough materials to make 10 Wayfarer Cookies.  Combine them in an oven and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Wayfarer Cookies.  When you give her the next Taelosian Wheat Flour, she will move on to step four.</p>
<p>STEP FOUR: Wayfarer Fruitcake</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tylida Eraldi says 'May Brell bless you!  I could really use some Wayfarer Fruitcake right now.  I know, you've heard that fruitcake is more like wood than food.  Well, ours are a little better than wood, but just as durable.  I'm not going to make you eat them, that's for the others to accomplish.  All I need you to do is put a Small Sack of Taelosian Wheat Flour, Wayfarer Spice, and Heavy Fruit into the oven and bake up some fruitcakes.  Bring them back here, use a cart if you must, and I'll see that they find homes.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tylida then gives you enough materials to make 10 Wayfarer Fruitcakes.  Combine them in an oven and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Wayfarer Fruitcakes.  Give her one more Taelosian Wheat Flour.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tylida Eraldi says 'You've been of great assistance.  I owe you my thanks.  I'll find others to do these tasks now.  Go over and talk to Ordin and he'll give you your reward.  Make sure to tell him that you were of great [assistance].'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow her instructions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'I was of great assistance'</p>
<p>Ordin Wheasly says 'You have been a big help around the kitchen!  I wouldn't feel right continuing to abuse your kindness.'  Ordin glances around. 'Take a quick peek into my recipe book.  This is the way you grind the Taelosian Wheat into flour.'  He quickly shows you the last page of his coveted recipe book.  It only takes you a moment to see what the trick is.  From now on, all you have to do is put the Taelosian Wheat or Taelosian Mountain Wheat into your mixing bowl and combine it to get the flour.  In fact, you are certain that if you work at it long enough, you can produce more usable wheat with practice.'</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>You now have the ability to turn Taelosian Wheat into Taelosian Wheat Flour, as well as Taelosian Mountain Wheat into Taelosian Mountain Wheat Flour.
