<span class="headers">Ak`Anon Shadowknight (Plague Knight) Armor </span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests. This one originates in Ak'Anon and results in armor for gnome SKs. The armor should be lore (other than the bracer), no drop, and GNM/SHD only. Armor appears as a dark green plate. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
Similar structure to the other evil melee class-specific quests - you get a note from the quest giver (Garret Zethkog) which you have to give to a secondary NPC (Mimtia Zethkog) who will then give you a kit (a Mail Assembly Kit). She will then tell you the recipe for each item and give you a mold (Crude [xxx] Mold) when prompted. The primary quest giver gives out the class-specific weapon quest.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Garret Zethkog' 
</p>
<p>
Garret Zethkog says 'Hail ____! I am Garret Zethkog, first Shadowknight of the Dark Reflection. Long ago I made the journey far to the west to the human city of Qeynos. In the catacombs of the Bloodsabres, human disciples of the Plague Lord, Bertoxxulous, I studied the ways of the Shadowknight. I have returned to Ak'Anon with this knowledge and now tutor young gnomes that have [heard the calling] of the Dark Reflection in the ways of a Dark Knight of Bertoxxulous.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I have heard the calling' 
</p>
<p>
Garret Zethkog says 'Bertoxxulous has gifted his faithful with the sight of the Dark Reflection, the ability to recognize the power of disease and decay and its importance as a catalyst of change and progress. We Shadowknights of the Dark Reflection are the champions of the Plague Bringer. It is our duty to embrace our gifts and use them to act as the agents of Bertoxxulous, doing his bidding unquestioningly. There are many however who oppose the Plague Lord and his servants. They do not understand the importance of our existence and we must [defend ourselves] against these foes lest they would have us destroyed.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'how do we defend ourselves?' 
</p>
<p>
Garret Zethkog says 'Every young Knight of the Dark Reflection must first learn the basics of combat and acquire a suit of armor to help turn aside the weapons of our enemies. Take this parchment to my sister Mimtia Zethkog and she will assist you in acquiring a set of suitable armor for a young shadownknight. Once you have been suitably outfitted return to me and I will instruct you on your [next task].' 
</p>
<p>
Go to Mimtia, she's in the Mines as well, though more difficult to find. Gave her the letter (missed the text), she lists the kinds of armor available.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I wish to craft a plague knight helm'
</p>
<p>
 Mimtia Zethkog says 'To assemble a Plague Knight Helm you will need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Helm Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Helm with a Ruined Cat Pelt and two Clockwork Spider Eye Lenses in the Mail Assembly Kit.'
