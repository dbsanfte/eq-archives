<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As I sit, fishing 
        and foraging, I muse over the events of the last few days, feeling I've 
        made some turning point in my life. What it will lead to, I do not know.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Spiritwalkers 
        have been wonderful to me, and I am now better armored and wielding a 
        bow. I am slowly improving in it, though I've already had to run to buy 
        more arrows, as I tend to lose them in the grass. It has spurred an interest 
        in me to learn how to make arrows on my own, though I think I will wait 
        a bit longer until I have more coin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I learned how to 
        hand in the teeth from my enemies, the gnolls, for a moonstone. Breda 
        also taught me how to trade in the moonstone for something worth more 
        coin. It makes me uneasy, handling alcohol even briefly like that, given 
        what it did to my mother, but the more coin I have, the better equipped 
        I can be to exterminate gnolls.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I am disheartened 
        with my foraging. Try as I might, I've only managed to find two small 
        fishing grubs so far. How am I to feed myself, much less my hunting partners, 
        if I cannot improve? At least I am having moderate success in turning 
        some of my hunting spoils into barely edible food.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yesterday I did a 
        good deed which reminded me of what it means to be a Spiritwalker. Though 
        I yearned greatly to try out my archery skill, I heard a plaintive cry 
        for help and heeded it, instead. A paladin of 5 trainings had decided 
        to explore the bear caves in Surefall Glade, and wandered too close to 
        a grizzly's den. The grizzly stood so firmly upon his corpse that he could 
        not drag it away without re-angering the bear. After convincing him of 
        the honor of any Spiritwalker, he consented to let me loot his corpse. 
        I gave the grizzly a scritch behind his ears, rescued the fellow's gear, 
        and when he tried to pay me, asked him to pass on a favor to one in need. 
        Yet another convert, I pray.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This morn seemed 
        to be the time for others to stun me with gifts. A ranger of only 2 trainings 
        more than I tried to sell me arrows. When he learned that I was busy fishing 
        to get any coin at all in the bank after paying Joril for the bow last 
        night, he peered more closely at me. Something about what he saw must 
        have moved him, for he ran off, returning 5 minutes later with a leather 
        collar. He gifted me with it, saying I needed it more than he needed to 
        sell it. I insisted on gifting him some fish for his breakfast, at which 
        point he insisted on paying me 4 times their worth. Stubborn men!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I decided to run 
        over to Qeynos to find some new adventurer to gift my cloth choker to, 
        knowing how much every little bit of protection helps. Along the way, 
        I saw an elder druid in wolf form, and bowed to show my respect before 
        running off on my errand. A few minutes later, she found me in Qeynos 
        Hills, and gifted me with a wolf form for a while.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Oh, the joy of feeling 
        the wind in my fur, the freedom of feeling the ground fly beneath my paws. 
        The exquisite joy of running and howling with the pack. I felt a sense 
        of kinship, of family, that I have never known before. A heady feeling 
        indeed for one who has no known family left in the world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I know, the Spiritwalkers 
        are my family now, but it's not quite the same. Sometimes I have to turn 
        my face away to hide the tears when I see Unkle with his niece and nephews, 
        the longing is so great. I will never know that feeling of blood kinship.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Even if my father 
        is still alive out there, and I ever found him, I expect he'd be disappointed 
        in his tomboy daughter. Why, twice in the past two days, I have been mistaken 
        for a male. I know the close-cropped hair confuses them, but it's much 
        easier to wander the wilds without worrying about it tangling, or leaving 
        tell-tail strands behind for some gnoll tracker to find. Do I <i>really</i> 
        look that masculine? Mayhaps it's just as well that I'm not likely to 
        ever find him. I'd just disappoint him, like I did Mother.</font> </p>

        I tried to push too hard, too fast. I can barely see to write through 
        the tears, barely write due to the shaking of my hand.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I couldn't 
        be satisfied with another training, some small success in making arrows, 
        success in foraging, and surviving 3 gnoll watchers attacking me at the 
        same time. I just <b>had</b> to try Blackburrow ... alone.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I nearly 
        died as the memories that washed over me blinded me to the danger of an 
        incoming horde of elite gnoll guards. I lived, but barely, dodging out 
        of the way at the last moment, and picking off a scrawny gnoll from the 
        pack. In the next 5 minutes, I killed another 2 small gnolls, almost died 
        again, and saved two lives with well-placed arrows. Then I had to flee, 
        like the coward I am.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Unkle 
        didn't say so in so many words when he heard of the rout, but the thought 
        was there &quot;I told you so.&quot; </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I am 
        just too weak to brave that place yet.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">However, 
        until I can face that place, face the fears and the nightmares it regularly 
        brings me, I cannot let go of the sight of my mother lying dead in that 
        foul place. I must face it, so I can let go my deathgrip on those memories.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I must

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Much has happened 
        since I last updated this journal. I have worked long, hard hours, striving 
        to improve my skills. Striving to prove myself. Many days I have spent 
        regardless of the weather, tracking and killing those vile Darkpaws. I've 
        fletched enough arrows so that I feel I can make the simple class 1 wooden 
        arrows in my sleep. I'm learning how to adjust for wind and movement of 
        my target when I shoot my arrows. I'm even learning how to dodge some 
        blows.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've made progress 
        on facing my Blackburrow nightmares as well, although I had quite a setback 
        in there yesterday. I've been to that vile place several times since August, 
        each time gaining a bit more confidence and wandering a bit deeper into 
        the lair. At long last, I made my way to the vile pit where I had found 
        my mother's body, and stood lost in memories until a gnoll came along 
        and took offense to my presence. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So I killed him.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I found a group of 
        hunters down there who wished me to join their party. Feeling I had been 
        too much of a loner in my hunts, I agreed. All seemed well at first, as 
        we slew anything that got in our path. Then other party members got impatient 
        and cocky and started straying from the group, oft returning with several 
        gnoll &quot;friends&quot;. All was fine until two of them brought back 
        a pack of gnolls each. There were at least 10 of them when I started counting, 
        but by that time, most of my party was dead, and one had gated out, saying 
        he had reached his training goal, and, oh, good luck with that train of 
        gnolls. I tried so hard to protect the remaining party member, a shamaness 
        of one less training than I. She fell, however, leaving me so surrounded 
        with gnolls that I could not see a single landmark. They bashed against 
        me, stunning me, spinning me in circles, punching and stabbing, until 
        I could not tell which end was up, much less where I was. I tried to move, 
        not caring what the direction was, hoping I could break free enough to 
        find a landmark. I fell, taking a mere two of the beasts with me into 
        death.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Our group returned 
        separately to Blackburrow from our various bind points, and heedless of 
        my request that we stick together, all ran off on their own to find their 
        bodies. I know not which ones fell and which ones succeeded anymore, and 
        I care not, so disgusted am I. Alone I went, seeking my falling place, 
        knowing that I had few landmarks to work with other than that I'd been 
        in a long hallway, made it through a door, and to a flat area before I 
        died. A gnoll commander saw this lone unarmed ranger, and proved to me 
        that while my kick might be rather powerful, I need much more training 
        in hand to hand combat in order to do more than bruise him. Then he summoned 
        friends, and I fell again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I admitted defeat 
        at this time, and, ashamed and afraid, asked the guild for aid. Joril 
        came running to my aid.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ah, Joril. What to 
        say about that blue eyed barbarian ranger that will not make these pages 
        singe from smoldering heat, or make me so distracted that I run headlong 
        into a tree ... again.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He's been there every 
        time I've begun to doubt in myself - keeping me company, teaching me how 
        to fletch and how to shoot, making me bows (this last a lovely carven 
        one with a bear head on it), celebrating my successes, and offering positive 
        encouragement when I seem likely to dwell on my failures. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">At first, I feared 
        he thought of me as a pesky younger sister, and that he was just indulging 
        me. I was quite disheartened by this thought, as he stirred very unsisterly 
        feelings in me. I'd much rather be cousins ... kissing cousins. Lately, 
        however, he seems afflicted with the same malady as I -- a distinct difficulty 
        in concentrating on a given task when the other is around. I've lost track 
        of how many arrows he's broken, how many times I've tripped over my own 
        two feet. Let's not even <i>think</i> about what happened when he changed 
        into that near-transparent linen tunic while he fletched. <i>&lt;several 
        illegible scrawls follow and are crossed out, as if the writer was trying 
        to write while not looking ... perhaps staring off into space?&gt;</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I know not where 
        it will lead ... and I refuse to commit to parchment my hopes on this 
        aspect of my life, for fear I will jinx everything.</font></p>

        There's so much that I want to share with him, and his absence has made 
        me realize how quickly he has become part of my life. Not just for rescuing 
        me when I get in over my head, or teaching me fletching, but just for

        him of my accomplishment, he congratulated me, but sounded wistful that 
        he had no magics of his own. No magic indeed! It must be magic, how he

        and to give him the gift of my meager buffing spells. Then I remembered

        him. He had known an elven brewer named Kavanna, and he admitted that, 
        upon reflection, he had dallied with her at one point. He seemed as stunned 
        as I, as he had not known that a child had come of the dalliance. Mother 
        had tried to lure him to stay, but being a footloose monk, he had been 
        gone again before she knew she was carrying me.</font></p>

        father, of knowing at long last that he did not leave mother because of 
        me, but that he had not known of me. While I get the feeling that he is 
        not the paternal sort, just knowing he is out there is enough.</font></p>

        me to no end last night when she calmly asked in the middle of a hunt

        brushfire right then and there in the plains from my blush. I spluttered 
        a denial, but didn't have the courage to let her know that I'd never bedded 
        anyone ... she's so worldly ... and I felt like a gangly drab buzzard 
        next to her for a moment. However, Joril proved to me later last night 
        just how appealing I am to him. Oh my poor fermented hormones. Talk with

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Dread news I scribe 
        this day. Mayhaps later I will make a proper recounting of it, but for 
        now, the bare details -- Morrighan is possessed by a daemon most foul, 
        and has defeated several of us in battle this day. At the time when she 
        vanquished me, we did not know of the daemon, but only that she was acting 
        oddly. I ran from East Karana to Qeynos after she bragged of killing a 
        merchant, worried about something in her tone. While she's always had 
        a sense of the macabre, I was unused to such blatant viciousness that 
        she expressed. I tried to reason with her, after delivering a gift to 
        one of our new &quot;refugees&quot;, a lass named Ellen, but there was 
        no reasoning to be had, only madness and destruction. I fell most easily 
        to her, as I was stunned with shock over the brutal attack of her and 
        her giggling pet. Poor Ellen watched, horrified, as I struggled to defend 
        myself from the glowing-eyed woman who is my sister-to-be.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After Mortekai was 
        consulted a bit later, we found that he had entrusted a circlet to her, 
        in which was bound a daemon, and after seeing her, he was convinced that 
        the daemon had possession of her. It was a sad day indeed as Aleayha was 
        the next to find and attempt to reason with that which used to be Morri, 
        and fell. Gyro barely escaped, collapsing at our feet, while she continued 
        with vicous taunts until Mortekai could stand it no longer. He leapt into 
        the fray ... and was also defeated.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Later that eve she 
        also stalked young Ellen, playing cat and mouse with her for a long while 
        before striking the poor lass down before my very eyes ... and then disappearing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I fear what this 
        threat from within will do to the Spiritwalkers, and to the family that 
        I am marrying into soon, and pray that we can find a way to free Morrighan 
        from the daemon before her soul is lost.</font></p>

        to Faydwer for a few days, and while parts of it were good, and necessary, 
        I can't say I'll be sorry to say goodbye to that continent. My elven cousins 
        are very ... flighty.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While we were here, 
        we made journeys into Crushbone. Not only did Unkle need Dvinn's heart 
        for a ceremony he was working on, but Joril needed to face that foul den, 
        and the memories it brought, head-on. It was not easy for him, revisiting 
        the place of his capture and torture, and once I saw the slave pits where 
        he had been imprisoned, I could understand why. I can't even begin to 
        imagine how he survived it without totally shattering beyond hope of recovery. 
        I went back later on my own, under cover of night, and managed to free 
        a few of the slaves still held there. Once things have settled down, I 
        hope to go back there and free more. Nobody, man nor beast, should have 
        to suffer that way.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We left there with 
        Dvinn's still-beating heart in Joril's possession. Gory, I know, but after 
        seeing what I saw, and imagining what they did to my beloved when he was 
        young, I could almost wish I'd sliced off a few trophies of my own ... 
        including a lower part of that foul fiend's anatomy. </font></p>

        daemon win today. Not with weapons or magic, but with words. It frightens 
        me how close I came to true defeat, and only time will tell how these 
        fresh wounds will heal on my already scarred soul ... and how similar 
        wounds will heal on my beloved Joril.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The daemon possessing 
        Morrighan taunted Joril until he did battle with it this day, and I was 
        next to useless. No matter how hard I tried to pull the bony pet off Joril, 
        so that he had a chance at touching Morrighan, I could not seem to land 
        a single blow ... I could not guard my beloved's back, and he fell in 
        front of my eyes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I went berserk with 
        rage and despair, maddened beyond all logical thought, and launched myself 
        at the foul fiend. I finally dispatched the bony pet, and launched myself 
        at Morrighan, only to find her slipping in and out of the shadows so much 
        that I kept losing sight of her, and could not follow her trail. The ground 
        was already too trampled and blood-soaked from her combat with Joril for 
        me to find a clear trail. I bandaged my wounds hurriedly, while trying 
        to find her, and was set upon by a second bony minion of hers. That too 
        was dispatched, as she stood at a distance and lobbed spells at me, robbing 
        me of breath, stealing my lifeforce. It felt like it was trying to tear 
        my very spirit from me. In a blind rage I rained blows down upon the form 
        of Morrighan, suddenly uncaring, unthinking that in destroying the form 
        of my future sister-in-law, I might destroy her utterly, but free the 
        daemon. I damaged it quite a bit, with a strength born of fury, but in 
        the end, I too was struck down, to lie not far from my beloved Joril.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I cannot fully explain 
        the deep despair I fell into, as I truly thought I had finally become 
        secure in my own sense of self-worth. Somehow, though, all that crumpled 
        in an instant.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Vicious taunts from 
        the daemon rang in my head as I regained consciousness, preying on every 
        single self-doubt I'd ever had. The words themselves are gone from my 
        mind now, but the meaning behind them still burns painfully fresh. I was 
        worthless, I was useless. I was unworthy of being anyone's wife, I was 
        good for nothing other than being a scullery maid. Variations on the many 
        hurtful things my mother had said to me, her unworthy daughter, when I 
        was young. On and on, hitting raw nerves I thought had healed during my 
        time with the Spiritwalkers, with Joril. They continued, almost beyond 
        bearing -- I should crawl into a bottle like my mother did and give up 
        and die. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Oh, giving up was 
        such a tempting thought at that moment. I had failed, utterly. I had been 
        vanquished a second time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The daemon made a 
        miscalculation, though, as it became more gloating and overconfident. 
        It threatened to kill my father and make me stand by and watch ... just 
        as I watched my mother die. I remember protesting that my mother had died 
        all alone after leaving me behind, but to my own ears, my protests were 
        hollow. I should have tried harder to stop her from going, even though 
        I'd been such a wee lass at the time. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The daemon sensed 
        my impending total emotional defeat. &quot;Poor Ru, all alone.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Joril, who had been 
        lost in his own pain and self-doubts, roused himself to my defense. I 
        was not alone, I had him, and all the rest of the Spiritwalkers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">and that is when 
        the daemon made a bad miscalculation, one that made us see where our strength 
        against this thing lies. It verbally started attacking Joril. Bad idea.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As Joril looked ready 
        to throw his beloved Langseax of the wolves in the ocean, I found the 
        energy and the inspiration, from Karana knows where, to launch a counterattack. 
        It had not studied us as much as I had thought. While my own worth was 
        still in doubt, I knew full well Joril's worth, his strengths. &quot;Have 
        you not realized yet, foul beast, that adversity makes men like my father 
        and Joril stronger? Joril carries Dvinn's still-beating heart as proof 
        of what happens when you try to defeat them. They return, stronger, more 
        powerful than before to exact vengeance.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I thank the gods 
        for that inspiration, as I watched Joril re-arm himself with his beloved 
        blade and stand straighter, launching himself into a full verbal offensive.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So close ... we had 
        been so close to utter defeat, when all along, we should have remembered 
        that together we are strong, and that adversity makes us stronger.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But has it? I still 
        feel hollow inside, as if something vital, something precious, had been 
        torn from me in that battle. So hollow ... so weak. I only pray that whatever 
        inner damage was done, I can be strong enough to be at the final battle 
        against this daemon ... though I doubt I can withstand another such battle, 
        mayhaps I can buy enough time for the others to unite, and save Morri's 
        soul, and the world, from this foul beast.</font></p>

        for a ways. Much to our surprise, a werewolf leapt out at us, claws extended. We'd heard horrible stories of attacks 
        and maulings by these foul beasts, but it was no match for the pair of 
        us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And oh, what a pair 
        we are. Our love seems to get stronger, our passion ever hotter and deeper, 
        with every passing day. We've been through so many difficulties together, 
        and they've brought us even closer together. Mmmmm, and how I do love 
        to get close to that wonderfully wicked gentleman!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We find our thoughts 
        turning often to the wee meek slave I rescued from Crushbone. Now that 
        we're back on the right continent, we may have to do some searching, to 
        ease our consciences by finding out how she is faring and ensuring that 
        she has all she needs. The weather is getting colder, winter is just around 
        the corner, and she was such a thin little thing!</font></p>
