<span class="headers">Freeport Cleric (Armor of the Ordained)</span>
<p>
<p>This is one of several armor quests for younglings that was recently added. This one is for Freeport human clerics, and will be HUM/CLR, no drop and lore (other than bracer). The bracers are not lore, but the bracer mold is, so make your first bracer before you get the mold for a second one.</p>

<p>The items to make each piece of the armor must be combined in the Gem Encrusted Mail Kit obtained by talking to Salinsa Delfdosan outside the Temple of Marr.</p>

<p>Each item is made from the special material obtained by combining the correct items in the kit, and the specific mold, also obtained from Salinsa Delfdosan, combined in a forge. Trivial at 6<x<=21 smithing skill and are no-fail combines. Armor is grey with a slight purple tinge. The weapon has the Rusty Mace graphic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Salinsa Delfdosan'</p>

<p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Pleasure to meet you ______, I am Lady Salinsa Deifdosan of House Marr. I have spent many hours on the battlefield in service of our glorious god however these days I spend my time training new [recruits].'</p>

<p>You say, 'what recruits'</p>

<p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Well you see, since I am such a well seasoned adventurer my knowledge is very helpful to the young members of our house. That is why I have developed a system of hunting and gathering assignments that reward the new recruit with a set of armor that they work very hard to craft themselves. Are you a [young cleric of House Marr]? If so I will be happy to offer my assignments to you.'</p>

<p>You say, 'I am a young cleric of House Marr' <i>(you receive a </i>Gem Encrusted Mail Kit<i>)</i></p>

<p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Great! Let me first begin by explaining how you will be creating your own armor. You will use this magical kit I have presented you with to gather numerous [recipe components]. Your magical kit will be used to gather specific materials that will form together in certain numbers and quantities to create an armor material. You must then take the material you have fashioned to a forge along with armor molds that I will supply you with to create your armor.'</p>

<p>You say, 'what recipe components'</p>

<p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'There are many different items that you will need to collect for your material components in all areas surrounding Freeport and our temple. I will be able to supply you with the mold for any armor piece you [want] to craft. I have the molds and recipes necessary for [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. When you are ready to craft a piece simply tell me what piece you would like to craft. For example if you wanted to create boots you would say, 'I want to craft boots'.'</p>

<p>You say, 'I want to craft a helm' <i>(you receive </i>An Enchanted Helm Mold<i>)</i></p>

<p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'Any cleric should always be very selective about what headpiece they choose for it can mean the difference between life and death. To create your helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Leaf Scarab Carapace , 1 Armadillo Tooth and 2 Fish Scales in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Helm of the Ordained.'</p>

<p>Salinsa Delfdosan says 'As you must already know the Freeport Militia has been a thorn in our side ever sense they were trusted to care for our city during the crusade. Things have never been the same sense then and things are actually starting to get worse. There have been numerous reports of Freeport Militia soldiers harassing all those that do not follow their rules of tyranny. My sister was bringing me a newsletter from qeynos when she was abducted. She escaped but [Deisnak] stole the newsletter she was delivering to me.'</p>
