<p>
<p>
This is one of several quests for young frogloks in Gukta. The no-fail combines provide some minor smithing skillups. The armor pieces should all be lore (other than the bracer), no drop, and restricted to FRG/WAR.
</p>
<p>
The quest begins with your paladin trainer, Dar Master Griblok
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Dar Master Griblok'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'Welcome back, young Dar. I hope your training is going well. Unfortunately, I have been unable to keep up to date on your progress, but should you need advanced training in any individual skills, I am here to help you with that. Also, though you've chosen a life of adventure, remember that you may still be called upon to defend your homeland. To do this, you must be well prepared for war. Let me tell you what little I know of this land and aid you in your [first steps].' 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'what first steps'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok looks somewhat startled at the sight of the figure standing nearby, however, continues in conversation with ____.
</p>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'The city is a place of sanctuary for all Frogloks. We count many friends among the good races of the land, but we have few true allies yet. We are bordered by the evil Feerrott to the south and the desolate Southern Desert of Ro to the north. Even Guk, the city-dungeon whose entrance you will see as you wander the swamp, has its darker aspects. We will need to build our might if we are to survive. Are you by chance a [new warrior]? 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I am a new warrior'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok looks somewhat startled at the sight of the figure standing nearby, however, continues in conversation with ____.
</p>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'Ah, good. The Army and its reserve are always in need of fresh courage. Every new warrior must attempt the training I personally oversee. I say attempt because these exercises will test you to the very limit. Now, if you have enough of the courage we seek, we [may begin]. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'we may begin'
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok seems to be in deep contemplation of the matters at hand, but then sighs and speaks with ____.
</p>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'Good. Take this Field Armorer Kit. It will allow you to use the [looted valuables] and even bodies of your enemies to form basic armor materials. These basic materials will prove quite valuable. When placed into a forge along with the proper mold, it will allow you to craft your own Armor of the Dar Initiate. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'what looted valuables'
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok appears to be in silent prayer to Lord Marr, only speaking to ____ after concluding the reverent petition.
</p>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'As I said, spoils of war and bodies will provide the supplies you need. Innothule Swamp, the murky land just beyond the city gates, holds some of the items you seek. You may also have to talk to local merchants to locate the odd piece. When you are ready to attempt these quests, you need only tell me what you [want] and I will provide further instruction. I can teach you the recipes and give you the armor molds for the Armor of the Dar Initiate [Helm], [Breastplate], [Armplates], [Bracer], [Gauntlets], [Leggings], and [Boots]. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a helm'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok engages in a conversation with ___ on how to craft the initiates helm, and what materials are needed. </p>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'A warrior's second skull, I always say. You'll need an Alligator Hide, a Ball of Pulpy Fungus, a Cracked Skeleton Skull and a Giant Moccasin Fang. Combine these ingredients in your kit. When you have the proper basic material in hand, take it to a forge along with this mold to finish your Helm of the Dar Initiate. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a breastplate'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'The final shield. Yes. But its construction will not be easy. Go and seek some Pristine Moccasin Scales, Burly Kobold Ears, a Pristine Alligator Hide and some Moccasin Poison. Combine these ingredients in your kit. When you have the proper basic material in hand, take it to a forge along with this mold to finish your Breastplate of the Dar Initiate. Once so armored, you'll be well prepared for a [greater task]. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft armplates' 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'To make your armplates, you'll need some Moccassin Eggs, Bleeder Wings, Moccasin Scales and a Kobold Talisman. Combine these ingredients in your kit. When you have the proper basic material in hand, take it to a forge along with this mold to finish your Armplates of the Dar Initiate. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft bracer'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok engages in a conversation with ____ on how to craft the initiates bracer, and what materials are needed.
</p>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'Ah, the quick defense against bloodthirsty blades. You'll need a Crab Spider's Carapace, two Spiderling Silks and a Malleable Bleeder Skin. Combine these ingredients in your kit. When you have the proper basic material in hand, take it to a forge along with this mold to finish your Bracer of the Dar Initiate. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft gauntlets'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'You'll need a Bleeder's Poison Sack, Blackened Fungus and two Bleeder Carapaces. Combine these ingredients in your kit. When you have the proper basic material in hand, take it to a forge along with this mold to finish your Gauntlets of the Dar Initiate. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft leggings'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok engages in a conversation with Tanthus on how to craft the initiates leggings, and what materials are needed.
</p>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'Wise. To make the leggings you'll need a Giant Moccasin Eye, two Kobold Livers and a Larval Carapace. Combine these ingredients in your kit. When you have the proper basic material in hand, take it to a forge along with this mold to finish your Leggings of the Dar Initiate. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft boots'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'A soldier's life is a life of travel. For your boots you'll need a Kobold Scalp, two Chunks of Digested Earth, and an Undead Froglok Talisman. Combine these ingredients in your kit. When you have the proper basic material in hand, take it to a forge along with this mold to finish your Boots of the Dar Initiate. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'what greater task'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok coughs softly, working over the remains of breakfast, finding the breath to reply to ____s inquiry.
</p>
<p>
Dar Master Griblok says 'War often brings out the worst, it is said. Sadly one of our very own grew greedy when he saw the trolls' treasure. Sergeant Herptol fell to temptation, ignoring the voice of our Lord that had commanded us to ignore the tainted loot. He fled the city and his rightful punishment. I've learned he's hiding out in the northern reaches of the Innothule. Go. Find him. Slay him and recover what he stole. Bring me a Larvae Skin and some Bull Alligator Spines. When you return the recovered loot and these items, I shall craft you a sword. 
</p>
