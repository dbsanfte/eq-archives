<p><b>Q: What sort of success rate should I expect?</b></p><br>

<p>A: To answer that, I've taken a re-cap of the success rate discussion and posted it here. Thanks Ishwar for the the summary.</p><br>

<p>Quote:</p><br>

<p>The theory that explains it all is the following</p><br>

<p>Success* = Skill - 0.75*Trivial + 51.5 (rounded up, for Trivial>= 68)</p>
<p>Success* = Skill - Trivial + 66 (for Trivial < 68)</p><br>

<p>Of course we all know that</p><br>

<p>Success = max(5,min(Success*,95?))</p><br>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><br>

<p>The underlying mechanics is that each item has a difficulty and the success is given as</p><br>

<p>Success* = Skill +50 - dificulty.</p><br>

<p>Trivial = Dificulty + 16 (for Dificulty <=50) </p>
<p>Trivial = 4/3 * Dificulty + 2 (for Dificulty > 50) </p>

<p>So far almost all trivial numbers are attainable this way (and the few that are not, are very hard to verify). The popular trivials correspond to rounding difficulties. And last, the hardest difficulties attainable (255) gives around 50% succes with max skill, consistent with what people report on infused cultural.</p><br>

<p>There is some speculation that the function is really a step function for low success rates (<60) and some data supporting this, but this is still an open question.</p><br>

<p>The upper limit (the "95%" limit) is also not excatly determined.</p><br>

<p><b>For those with difficulty remembering the order of operations: </b></p><br>

<p>Percentage = (skill - (trivial*.75)) + 51.5 </p><br>
