<span class="headers">Gukta  Shaman (Yun Initiate) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Gukta. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop (or should be - not all may be flagged right at this time) and restricted to FRG/SHM. These are no-fail smithing combines and grant low-level smithing skillups.
</p>
<p>
Hailt text and NPC name are not available at this time, but it should be your main shaman trainer in Gukta. Follow through his hail text and he will give you a no drop assembly kit. He will also hand you the appropriate molds as you ask about each armor piece. (Your requests should go something along the lines of "I want to craft ____")
</p>
<p>
Combine the ingredients listed for each piece in your assembly kit, then combine the result with the appropriate mold in a forge. <em>All items must be unstacked when combined in your assembly kit.</em>
