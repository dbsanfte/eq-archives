<span class="headers">Paineel Cleric (Templar of Fright) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Paineel. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ERU/CLE only. They are no-fail smithing combines. While stats were not provided, we have been told that the graphic for the armor is black plate. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one </i>

</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'Salutations. I am Sadorno Chomosh, Templar of Terror. The path of terror taught to us by Cazic Thule is a dangerous way of life. The perils are great but the rewards are unimaginable power. In order to harness the powers of fear you must first know that which you seek to control, terror, dread, and fright. I presume that you are still young and have much to learn. If that is the case I will assist you in acquiring [armaments] to aid you on your journey to power.'

You say, 'What armaments?'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'You will require this Mail Assembly Kit that has been prepared in advance for the construction of Templar of Fright Armor. The materials required for the armors construction vary according to the section you desire to craft. When you have acquired your suit of armor return to me and perhaps you can assist me with a [pending task]. Do you desire to craft a [templar of fright helm], a [templar of fright bracer], [templar of fright gauntlets], [templar of fright boots], [templar of fright vambraces], [templar of fright greaves], or a [templar of fright breastplate]?'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What pending task?'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'The Tabernacle of Terror has many enemies here on Odus who oppose our teachings our patron deity, Cazic Thule. The Priests of Prexus and Quellious in the city of Erudin seek to purge Odus of our kind, for they view us as a disgrace to the Erudite race. Behind their disdain however, lies fear. It is this fear that allows us to prosper and become more powerful than the closed minded fools of Erudin. In the Toxxulia forest you will find such a fool, a priest by the name of Terago Omath. This priest has been attempting to ward the Toxxulia Forest from the presence of the undead. Seek this Terago Omath and return to me with his head.'
