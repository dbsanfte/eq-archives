<p>This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.</p>
<p>The completion of this quest will allow you to progress to smithing skill 54. It will also allow you to learn how to process aligned ore and shimmering aligned ore, which are used in the GoD smithing recipes.</p>
<p>Bring Snokin Breaksteel on the Queen of Thorns some aligned steel, and he will convert it into bars of aligned steel. Hand one of those bars to Esunta to begin her quest. In return for helping her out, she'll teach you the process needed to make bars of aligned and shimmering steel, that are needed for many, many new smithing recipes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Esunta'</p>
<p>Esunta says 'We is workin all day and night to make tings for da Wayfarers.  Can you help us wit all dis [work]?  We wants time to play wit da new ore.'</p>
<p>You say, 'what work?'</p>
<p>Esunta says 'We been gettin da new ore an I wants ta take it to da forge.  Near da mountains dere is ore dat shines.  It's da same aligned ore dat is found everywhere, but gots augment bits in it, and dat makes it shine.  I wants time ta work wit it.  Dere is too much work to do here, an you look like you can do some of it.  If you can do dese [tasks] for me, den I can work wit da [Shimmering Ore].'</p>
<p>You say, 'what shimmering ore?'</p>
<p>Esunta says 'Da ore is pretty.  Da bits of da augmentation stuff makes da stuff more magical.  It only found in the mountains.  Dey say dat's because some magic ting happen up dere long time ago.  Dem magic types will do stuff wit da ore, for sure.  I figured out how to smelt it, wit help from Snokin.  If you bring da shimmering ore ta me, I will give you da shimmering steel.'</p>
<p>You say, 'what tasks?'</p>
<p>Esunta says 'Lot a work ta do here.  You help us out, work hard like real ogre, an I show you da secret of making steel from da ore.  I needs to make stuff out of da aligned steel, so you needs to bring me some.  Find da aligned ore an have Snokin make da steel, den bring to me an I will give you work.  I reward you sooner dan Snokin if you help me.  Jus bring da aligned steel to me when you ready to work.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STEP ONE: Simple Aligned Steel Skewer</p>
<p>Give an Aligned Ore to Snokin and receive back two Bars of Aligned Steel.  (Repeat this process during the quest whenever you are out of Bars of Aligned Steel and need more.)  Give one of those bars to Esunta.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Esunta says 'Good, you is ready to work.  We need skewers.  Da more we make, da more we gets to eat!  Da new steel makes skewers that last long time an don't make food taste bad.  So you take dis stuff and forge skewers.  Bring dem to me when you done.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then gives you enough materials to make 10 Simple Aligned Steel Skewers.  Combine them in a forge and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 40 Simple Aligned Steel Skewers.  When you give her the next Bar of Aligned Steel, she will move on to step two.</p>
<p>STEP TWO: Simple Aligned Steel Spike</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Esunta says 'Dere is much work for you.  We use steel spikes for lots of tings here, an dey asks me to make some wit da new steel.  It easy job, so maybe you do it.  Just take da metal an da mold to da forge an make da spikes.  Bring dem to me when you is done.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then gives you enough materials to make 10 Simple Aligned Steel Spikes.  Combine them in a forge and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Simple Aligned Steel Spikes.  When you give her the next Bar of Aligned Steel, she will move on to step three.</p>
<p>STEP THREE: Simple Aligned Steel File</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Esunta says 'Lots more work for you to do. Da iron files dat we use don't last long. For da special work dey asks me to make dem files from da new steel. So now you is going to make files from da new steel. Take dis stuff to da forge an make da files. Bring dem to me when you gets dem done.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then gives you enough materials to make 10 Simple Aligned Steel Files.  Combine them in a forge and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 40 Simple Aligned Steel Files.  When you give her the next Bar of Aligned Steel, she will move on to step four.</p>
<p>STEP FOUR: Simple Aligned Steel Needle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Esunta says 'You good helper.  Dis time we need needles.  Da peoples dat sews stuff likes da needles made wit da new metal, an my fingers is too big for making needles good.  You take this stuff to da forge an make needles for us.  Bring dem to me when you is done.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then gives you enough materials to make 10 Simple Aligned Steel Needles.  Combine them in a forge and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Simple Aligned Steel Needles.  Give her one last Bar of Aligned Steel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Esunta says 'You do enough already.  No do more.  Go talk to Snokin, he will tell secret for making aligned ore into steel.  Tell Snokin dat you do much [silly work] for me and he will show you secret.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow her instructions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'silly work'</p>
<p>Snokin Breaksteel says 'No more work now. Snokin happy wit what you do already. Snokin show you secret now. You not tell anyone!' Snokin looks around furtively, as if everyone on the ship doesn't hear everything he says. He hands you a piece of paper with some very precise writing on it. You can only guess that he did not write it. You look it over and you understand the methods for smelting the aligned ore and the shimmering aligned ore. It's not a complicated process, but you would have needed information that only that Wayfarers have to uncover it. Now all you need to do is place the ore into a forge and you will be able to make the steel. However, you are certain that you can improve the process if you work with the ore long enough. Snokin takes the paper back and pulls out a ledger. You see him carefully note your name on the ledger with clear and concise penmanship that matches that on the paper you just read.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>You now have the ability to turn an Aligned Ore into a Bar of Aligned Steel, as well as a Shimmering Aligned Ore into a Bar of Shimmering Steel.
