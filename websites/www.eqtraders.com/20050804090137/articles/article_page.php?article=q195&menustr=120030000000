<!--"both give the exact same quests with the same dialogue, with the only exception of to whom you return the items"-->

<p>There are many details still missing from the guide for this race.  What we have so far is either here or waiting in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/forumdisplay.php?f=100">DoN Data Submissions Forum</a>.  Please look there if you do not find the detail you need.  But keep in mind, it simply may not have been reported yet.  If you have some details that aren't here or there, please post them and we'll get them updated!</p>

<p>This is the quest for erudites to acquire the books necessary to make the cultural armor that is available with the Dragons of Norrath expansion.  For more information on the general details, see the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q182&menustr=120030000000">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Armor Quest Overview</a>.</p>

<p>While erudites can start in several different cities, these quests are available only from either Erudin or Paineel.  You should be able to go to either city, regardless of your class, diety, or starting city. But you will, of course, have to be non-kos.</p>

<p align="center"><i><a href="#erud">Erudin</a> - <a href="#pain">Paineel</a></i></p>

<p><a name="erud"><b><i><u>Erudin</u></i></b></a></p>

<p>You start in Erudin, with Gorion Telld'mare at -120, 30, in the building near the dock, with the teleporter to the city area.  The books do not need to be acquired in any particular order, as Gorion will give you all of them at once if you ask.</p>

<h4>Ancestral Book Quest:</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Gorion Telld`mare'</p>
<p>Gorion Telld`mare says ''Hello, Enchantur. If you'll excuse me, I'm trying to study these [inscriptions] and you're blocking my light.''</p>
<p>You say, 'what inscriptions?'</p>
<p>Gorion Telld`mare says ''These inscriptions are from a stone tablet that was found in the bottom of the Hole. They detail a forgotten methodology for making Erudite armor. These patterns were created by our ancestors before our race was divided. It staggers my mind to think what we Erudites could have lost such a great legacy. These armor [designs] are unlike anything I've ever seen before.''</p>
<p>You say, 'what designs?'</p>
<p>Gorion Telld`mare says ''Yes, it's difficult to explain without the actual armor patterns to look at. Would you like a copy of these ancestral armor patterns? I can create a pattern [book] for you, provided you can bring me the necessary ingredients. I may also have some additional armor [patterns] provided you are willing to help me with my research.''
<p>You say, 'I would like a book'</p>
<p>Gorion Telld'mare says, 'Very well. I will need a belt pouch for the cover, a bamboo wakizashi bo for the spine, a kobold finger bone for the clasp, and a bathide wristband to grind down and make a salve which will protect and preserve the finished product. I have heard these items can be found in the Warrens. Return with them and the pattern book shall be yours.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quest Summary: Collect and hand in Belt Pouch, Bamboo Wakizashi Bo,  Kobold Finger Bones, and  Bathide Wristband.</p>
<p><i>Tips:</i>All of these drops are found in The Warrens. The Belt Pouch and Kobold Finger Bones are uncommon off of kobolds. The Bamboo Wakizashi Bo is a rare drop off of higher level kobolds. The Bathide wristband is rare off of mischievious (sic) batlings. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gorion Telld'mare says, 'Excellent work Manina. Here are the armor patterns worn by our ancestors. May they serve you well. It will take me some time to decipher the entirety of these patterns. Return to me later and we'll talk of what more can be gleaned from these artifacts.'</p></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Receive:  Ancestral Erudite Armor</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'what pattern?'</p>
<p>Gorion Telld`mare says 'The meanings of the more advanced inscriptions continue to elude me. I've long ago exhausted this city's vast libraries. Now, I require a field agent to seek out new information and artifacts. Would you be interested in leading expeditions to [Kerra Isle], the [Stonebrunt], [Siren's Grotto], or the newly-discovered [valley] beyond the lavastorm mountains? If you are able to recover more information for me, I can further my studies and reward you with more armor patterns drafted by our ancestors. What say you?'</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Journeyman's Book Task: More Than One Way to Skin a Cat</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Kerra Isle'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'More Than One Way to Skin a Cat'.</p>
<p>Gorion Telld`mare says 'There is another librarian who delved into the study of ancient runes. After contacting his family, I have learned that he was attacked and killed by kerrans several months ago. His family has agreed to grant me his notes if I can avenge his death. Kill twenty kerrans and return to me with four catman skins that I can use to quell the grief of the librarian's family.'</p>

<h4>Expert's Book Task: Writ in Stone</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Stonebrunt'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Writ in Stone'.</p>
<p>Gorion Telld`mare says 'Excellent, there are rumors of old Erudite hieroglyphs on the rocks in the Stonebrunt mountains. These hieroglyphs may help further my studies of the forgotten language of our ancestors. Unfortunately, many of the markings in the area lie in the territory of the eldar pandas. Kill fifty of them and return to me with twenty eldar panda pelts. Once you have cleared the way, I can journey to the Stonebrunt Mountains and investigate the markings myself.'</p>

<p>Gorion Telld`mare says 'I acquired some ancient tablets in Velious that should prove most helpful in the translation process. Unfortunately, the ship that was to deliver the tablets was attacked and sank by the sirens along the continent's southern cost. I'll be ****ed if those sirens will have my tablets! Journey to the sirens' grotto and slay eighty bulthar. Return to me with forty of their trunks as proof that the way is clear.'</p>

<p>Gorion Telld`mare says 'Hmm, a most dangerous mission you have volunteered for. Your assistance will not go unrewarded. To further my studies I need some of the draconic powers used by the storm dragon's followers. Seek out and slay the denizens of Thunder Crest isle. Return to me with their claws which I can use as spell components for my draconic spells. You may wish to seek out some operatives in Lavastorm to aid you in tracking down these rare items.'</p>
