<p>
<p>
<i>One of many new quests for young adventurers, this one is for human Wizards, Enchanters and Mages in Freeport. Pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop and WIZ/MAG/ENC, HUM only. Robe is orange, other pieces are a red leather graphic. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
Shana Liskia in the Academy in West Freeport gives out quests for Mages, Wizards and Enchanters. She gives you an enchanted sewing kit and a pattern for each of the pieces that you can get. Molds are given as you ask her about the specific armor piece. These items are reported to look like reddish leather when worn.
</p>
<p>
Combine each of the following in and enchanted sewing kit, then combine the result and the proper mold, in the loom, to get the proper armor piece.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Liskia says 'Hail and well met ______. I am Shana Liskia, Enchantress of Freeport. I have studied my art for years here in our wonderful academy. I am also delighted to meet and teach those that come here to gain knowledge. My specialty however lies in Beguiling so I like to train young enchanters. Are you an enchanter?'

Let me be the first to tell you that your training here will be top notch and you will learn all that is to be known about being an enchanter should you put forth the willingness to learn. I will walk you through your early training and assist you in your hunting and gathering skills. I have created a [special sewing kit] that I present to all of the new initiates.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What special sewing kit' 
</p>
<p>
Shana Liskia says 'This kit that I speak of is one that is able to magically infuse different components into materials used for creating Arcane Scientists Armor. The components that you use will be collected from numerous different areas and shops in Freeport. You will use these materials along with patterns that I will present you with to create your armor. Once you are [ready to begin] I will present you with your Enchanted Sewing Kit.' 
</p>

</p>

When you are ready to attempt a specific piece you must tell me what piece you [want] to craft. For example if you had intent on crafting a cap you would say, “I want to craft a cap”. I can offer you the recipes for Arcane Scientists [Caps], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. I must also suggest that you attempt your robe last due to the difficult nature of collecting the correct components.'
