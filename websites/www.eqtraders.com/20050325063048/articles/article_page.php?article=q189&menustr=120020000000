      <span class="headers">Garsen's Brewing List</span>
<p>
<p>This quest does not actual require tradeskills, but earns you a copy of <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7457&menustr=">Garsen's Brewing List</a>, which contains some basic brewing recipes.  (The book can also be bought in Shar Vahl, if you'd rather take the short route to ownership.)</p>

<p>Start by talking to Thadres Thyme in Halas.  She is on the Qeynos rogues faction, so she may be borderline hostile, especially to followers of the Tribunal.  She is inside McQuaids Bar & Stout, at 104 -209.  To get there from the entrance to Halas: cross the lake, go right at the entrance sign, and enter the first building on the right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail Thadres Thyme'</p>

<p>Thadres Thyme says 'Hello, Runengetum ! It's hard to believe just how cold it gets here! It really has been wearing me down. Especially after the [journey] from Qeynos.</p>

<p>You say, 'what journey?'</p>

<p>Thadres Thyme says 'I have been traveling the face of Norrath to unravel the mystery of why my beloved [brother] attacked a group of traveling bards. He didn't survive the fight. It's been so long, I can't really remember what he looked like! I miss him so much... Now all I have are his [diary] and some brewing recipes he sold before his death.</p>

<p>You say, 'what brother?'</p>

<p>Thadres Thyme says 'My brother was Delius Thyme. I think he was a great man. Runengetum , have you ever lost someone close? I don't know if I can ever forgive myself for letting him travel on his own after his sanity began to fade. Oh, Delius, please forgive me!</p>

<p>You say, 'what diary?'</p>

<p>Thadres Thyme says 'The diary? It's one of the two connections I still have to my brother. Sadly, [pages] are missing from it. I've been looking for them.</p>

<p>You say, 'what pages?'</p>

<p>Thadres Thyme says 'I believe the pages contain the events that drove my brother to insanity. I have been searching for the remaining three missing pages. There is some hope; I found a couple of pages over in Everfrost Mountains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be advised that the drops you will be collecting are all No Drop.  Don't go after them until you have the time to spend gathering all three and turning them in.</p>

<p>Follow Thadres' hint and head out into Everfrost.  From Halas, head down the ramp and out into the snow.  You are looking for the vengeful musicians, namely the vengeful lyricist, the vengeful composer, and the vengeful soloist.  Follow the right-hand path, avoiding the dead-end branches, as it leads to Blackburrow.  (A good map is strongly recommended if you are unfamiliar with the area.)  You may also find the vengefuls on the next set of paths to the west, also between Halas and Blackburrow.  However they are not found out on or very near the open plains of Everfrost.</p>

<p>If you can track, this may cut your time spent quite a bit.  Otherwise just wander back and forth along these paths and eventually you'll find yourself getting whammed (or missed, if you're high level) by one of the vengefuls.  They always attack, no matter how much higher than you they are.  It may be that only one is up at a time, and that another spawns immediately when the one that is up is killed.  They aren't all over, but aren't rare either.  When you do find them, they reportedly range in level from 8-10.  They may be tough for their level.  Each one always drops a particular page from Delius Thyme's diary.  (Composer drops page 74, lyricist drops page 75, and soloist drops page 76.)  As with most collection quests, you may end up killing several of one or two of the vengefuls before you finally get the third.</p>

<p>When you finally get all three, take them to Thadres in Halas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thadres Thyme says 'Thank you, thank you. Let me read them. Oh! How could I want these brewing recipes after they made my brother insane? Where are they? I think this is all of them. Take them away from me! Delius can smile upon me now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She gives you your very own copy of:</p>
