<p>You say, 'Hail, Barodreth Firefingers' </p>

<p>Barodreth Firefingers says 'Greetings Azelene, are you a [young initiate] of the Craft Keepers? If you are then I might have some great news for you. We are currently in the process of training up all new recruits so this might be your lucky day. ' </p>

<p>You say, 'I am a young initiate' </p>

<p>Barodreth Firefingers says 'Excellent Azelene. Many have passed before me and said they wished to be the greatest practicioner of the arcane to ever set foot in these halls. Many of those same people didn't amount to much but I think you are different. If you are [ready to begin your training] I will be happy to get you started.' </p>

<p>You say, 'I am ready to begin my training' </p>

<p>Barodreth Firefingers says 'Fantastic, I will be delighted to get you started. Toxxulia forest is where the majority of your training will be held. There are many [important components] I will need you to [gather] out in the forest and also in town.' </p>

In this sewing kit you will combine a number of recipes that will be used for creating your Craft Keepers armor. When you are ready to craft a certain armor piece all you must do is tell me which piece you [want] to craft. I will then present you with the component recipe along with the applicable pattern for Craft Keeper [Caps], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. When you have completed the material for whatever piece you asked for you will combine it in a sewing kit with the appropriate pattern to fashion your armor piece. Its as easy as that, I suggest though that you attempt your robe last as the components are more difficult then any other piece to collect.' </p>

Please return to me once you have fashioned your robe for I might have a [final task] for you to complete.' </p>

<p>Barodreth Firefingers says 'There are a few items that I need for my studies and I was hoping that you could retrieve them for me. If you are willing to [seek out my items] I will be happy to reward you with my personal walking staff once you return.' </p>

<p>You say, 'I will seek out your items' </p>
