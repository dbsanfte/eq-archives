<p>
This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.<p>
The completion of this quest will allow you to progress to make poison skill 54. It will also allow you to learn how to process muramite blood and muramite bile. Please note, however, that there are currently no recipes that use these, so the main goal of this quest is to gain skillups to skill 54<p>
Find poisonmaking vendor Viliani I`Xvoyt in the hold of the Queen of Thorns.<p>
<hr>
<blockquote>You say, 'Hail, Viliani I`Xvoyt'
<p>Viliani I`Xvoyt says 'Hail to you.  I don't have a lot of free time.  If you're going to stand around here and pretend you have something interesting to say, how about you let me put you to [work] instead.  I know my ears would approve of the silence.'
<p>You say, 'work?'
<p>Viliani I`Xvoyt says 'There is plenty for you to do, even if you are almost completely incompetent. I only need you to do the simple things to allow me to work on things that are more worthwhile. I am collecting the contents of internal organs pulled from the Muramites. Killing them appears to be a difficult task, so their organs are hard to come by. The only one that we've been able to figure out at all seems to be a waste-product storage organ. I haven't seen one inside one of the creatures, so I can't confirm what function is serves for them, nor do I really care. We have decided to call that waste product, bile. The bile can be extremely toxic, even more so than some of the Muramite blood we've found. So, if you can do some [simple things] for me, I can investigate the [Muramite bile].'
<p>You say, 'muramite bile'
<p>Viliani I`Xvoyt says 'Muramite bile is a complicated substance. I have, however, discovered a way to extract the bile from the organs that hold it in such a way that it is not spoiled. It's interesting that the different races all have this dangerous bile. It appears that this organ is underdeveloped in many of these creatures, though.  I suspect it has to do with their maturity.  I believe that it develops much more slowly than the rest of their bodies. Only the older ones will have bile sacks. Bring me a bile sack and I will extract the bile for you and give it to you stored properly. I will keep a portion of the bile for my own research as payment for my efforts.'
<p>You say, 'simple things?'
<p>(NPC response not available at this time)</blockquote>
<p>Ignore her mention of muramite bile, and hunt around until you have some mob-dropped muramite blood. Bring the blood to Uiyaniv Tu'Vrozix for conversion, and then hand her one of the converted blood (exact name not available at this time) in order to progress to step one.<p>
STEP ONE<p>
<blockquote>Viliani I`Xvoyt says 'It looks like you're ready to get started. Good. Take a small vial of Muramite blood distillate and Wayfarers Secret Suspension and combine them in your mortar and pestle to create a simple contact poison. The Muramite blood makes it pretty potent, so don't leave it lying around. Bring it right back to me when you're done.'</blockquote>
<p>She will give you enough supplies for ten combines of Simple Invader Blood Contact Poison. Hand her the finished poison, hand her another processed blood, and continue to make the poison until you have given her thirty of them. The next time after this that you hand her a processed blood, she will progress to step two.<p>
STEP TWO<p>
<blockquote>Viliani I`Xvoyt says 'There is plenty for you to do. Don't just stand around gawking. Take a small vial of Muramite blood distillate and Wayfarers secret anti-coagulant and combine them in your mortar and pestle. If you aren't a completely incompetent creature, you should be able to produce a reasonable quantity of simple Muramite blood-injected poison. Bring it to me when you're done.'</blockquote>
This is a repeat of step one, only with new ingredients and a new result. Once you've given her 30 completed poisons, she'll progress on to step three the next time that you hand her a processed blood.<p>
STEP THREE<p>
<blockquote>Viliani I`Xvoyt says 'There is no lack of work for you. Take this small vial of Muramite blood distillate and simple paralytic and combine them in your mortar and pestle. Don't screw it up and you'll be able to make some simple Muramite blood paralytic. Handy stuff when you don't want to kill someone, but you don't want them killing you either. Bring to me whatever you can make.'</blockquote>
This is a repeat of step one, only with new ingredients and a new result. Once you've given her 30 completed poisons, she'll progress on to step four the next time that you hand her a processed blood.<p>
STEP FOUR<p>
<blockquote>Viliani I`Xvoyt says 'Good. For now I am in need of some atrophic. Don't ask why, just combine a small vial of Muramite blood distillate and simple wasting poison in your mortar and pestle. Don't lick your fingers while working on this or you'll find yourself unable to beg for my help in the future. Bring me the atrophic when you have it finished.'</blockquote>
This is a repeat of step one, only with new ingredients and a new result. Once you've given her 30 completed atrophic, hand her another processed blood and she will send you back over to Uiyaniv to learn how to process the blood and bile yourself.<p>
<blockquote>Viliani I`Xvoyt waves her hand at you. 'Take this back. I don't need your help any more. Go to Uiyaniv and he will reward you, I'm far too busy. Just tell him that I said you were [useful] to me. Now leave me to my work.'</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, there is currently no real use for the self-processing process for the blood and the bile, as there are no recipes that require them.
