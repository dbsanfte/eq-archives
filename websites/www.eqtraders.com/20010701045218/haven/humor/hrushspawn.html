Obviously, Rush is a rare spawn in Innothule, who occasionally pops up<BR>
in place of Dark Deathstinger the Bard. He's a shaman of approximately<BR>
the same level as Dark. Beware though, he is defended a large swarm of<BR>
Dittoheads that spawn whenever he is attacked. They are numerous, very<BR>
high level, and are aggressive to all PCs. A Dittohead train is worse<BR>
than a Mistmoore train, and can clear a zone full of L50s. Its not fair<BR>
to the newbie trolls to spawn one in their newbie zone, the swamp.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
The interesting thing about Dittohead faction NPCs is, that unique among<BR>
MoBs, they never refer to a PC's race when attacking. Instead they<BR>
substitute the word "Liberal" into the standard stock MoB phrases i.e.<BR>
"Liberals like you have ruined your own lands..." or "Liberals like you<BR>
are better left dead...". Occasionally, they also use the battlecry<BR>
"DittoDittoDitto", but only immediately after Rush finishes a section of<BR>
his monologue.
<P>
&nbsp;<BR>
Rush will despawn on his own after 3 EQ hours if he is ignored and left<BR>
undisturbed. During this time, he will recite a white text monologue,<BR>
similar to the bards in certain inns and taverns in parts of Norrath.<BR>
"Listening" provides an insight into the culture and beliefs of some<BR>
trolls, and hints regarding certain troll-only quests and items.
<P>

The wand is not so hot. It's no-drop, troll shaman only, and adds +25<BR>
charisma, but only with respect to other trolls. Killing Rush to get<BR>
the wand makes you KOS to the Dittohead faction group and gives you<BR>
positive faction with a few other troll factions. This is not worth the<BR>
bother, because Dittoheads turn up in surprising places, and are often<BR>
disguised as other NPC races, or even as PCs. And trolls have terrible<BR>
faction problems to begin with. If you actually bother to get the wand,<BR>
you can no longer sell or train in Grobb without being attacked by a<BR>
wandering Dittohead. And visiting ANY zone can be very dangerous.<BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
My advice is to leave Rush alone and ignore him. The danger presented<BR>
by Dittoheads make even discussing him dangerous. And only Trolls will<BR>
really be interested anyway.<BR>
