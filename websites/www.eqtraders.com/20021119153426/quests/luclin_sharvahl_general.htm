            <h3> General Shar Vahl Quest Advice by Arou</h3>
            I have been working on a variety of the trade skill quests in Shar 
            Vahl, advancing a Vah Shir of each class and doing them on my own. 
            Combining my experiences there with some of my old ones as well as 
            reading the boards, I have some simple suggestions that may help. 
            <p>First, if you are looking for a creature and dont see it, your 
              best option for getting it to spawn is a scorched earth policy. 
              That is, kill everything in the area... I mean everything. Many 
              creatures seem to have place holders or be semi-random spawns. Killing 
              everything makes sure that the area has the maximum chance of respawning 
              the things you are looking for. This is a good policy if you are 
              looking for a particular creature or a particular kind of drop off 
              a type of creature.</p>
            <p>This policy works especially well in places like the Shar Vahl 
              pit. Don't wait for young rockhoppers to show up on their own. Kill 
              everything and very quickly you will see them start showing up more 
              and more.</p>
            <p>Second, if you kill everything and still dont see what you want 
              within a couple of hours, you are probably looking in the wrong 
              place. I have not seen very much that has a longer spawn time or 
              more difficult place holder. Certianly not for something that characters 
              below level 30 would attempt. Verant has seemed to realize with 
              the newer expansions that excessively long spawn times are not the 
              way to limit access to items; people simply camp until it comes 
              up or learn the exact time and pop in just at the right moment. 
              They seem more interested in triggered spawns in recent expansions. 
              So, if you dont see at least some progress in the given time, begin 
              looking for alternate sources or more information, maybe even in 
              another zone.</p>
            <p>Again, in the pit around Shar Vahl, there are &quot;areas&quot; 
              where certain creatures are more common. If you are looking for 
              xakra larva, try under the south bridge for example.</p>
            <p>Third, take some notes and ask some questions. Its really easy 
              to have a pad of paper and a pencil next to you when you are playing. 
              When you talk to an NPC, write down his name and location and maybe 
              a few of his keywords or quest details. Hunting up some of the components 
              for these quests or working your trade skill up to an acceptable 
              level may take a long time and you could easily forget who it was 
              gave you the quest or what that person wanted. This practice is 
              also very helpful for coming back to these boards and sharing what 
              you know with everyone... they will think very highly of you if 
              you can give good information! Remember too that someone in that 
              zone is probably working or has worked on the same quest, so asking 
              questions in /ooc is a good bet too.</p>
            <p>An example of this is the Rogue vah shir quest for boiled rockhopper 
              eggs. You will have to spend a goodly amount of time killing hoppers 
              until you get the eggs, then find a merchant who sells spices, skill 
              up in baking, make the product, go to another zone to find an NPC, 
              and return. This can easily take a few hours, but asking for locations 
              of the NPCs (and being able to share the ones you know) helps a 
              lot.</p>
            <p>Fourth, if you find something and it is &quot;No Drop&quot;, you 
              can bet it is used by someone for some quest somewhere. Since these 
              things arent going to earn you any cash, you probably want to think 
              twice about looting them. Instead, asking what they are for and 
              offering them to those that can use them helps everyone involved.</p>
            <p>Young rockhoppers in the Shar Vahl pit drop gravel tea leaves, 
              claws, eggs, and other things useful to several different classes. 
              You will get more claws for yourself if you offer the rest to the 
              people looking for those items.</p>
            <p>Hope some of this basic information helps you get your beginning 
              quests done more smoothly!</p>
