            <p class="headers">What<a name="What"></a> is smithing all about? 
              - by <a href="mailto:smedis@noxware.se" class="header">Larien</a> 
              (Lanys T'Vyl server)</p>
            <p>Many months ago, I started on a jewelry career with a dark elf 
              Enchanter. It turned out to be extremely expensive, so I decided 
              to put all trading aside for a while and concentrate on hunting 
              with my friends instead. Then I started a new character on the fairly 
              new server Lanys T'Vyl, a troll shadowknight called Gorth. Before 
              The Age Of Gorth, I mainly played spell casting characters, but 
              as Gorth grew stronger and more potent, I got more and more aware 
              of the potential for a blacksmith. Well, Gorth is as stupid as he 
              is strong, and I wanted a totally different type of character for 
              a smithing career. So, one late night around New Years Eve, Larien 
              was born in the distant island of Odus.</p>
            <p>Larien is a highly intelligent enchanter, which makes him learn 
              quickly. His skill level increased rapidly, and has now reached 
              142. Another important factor for a smith is wisdom. The higher 
              the wisdom, the less you fail. Larien uses enhancing items such 
              as a Black Iron Medallion that improves his intelligence and wisdom 
              by 3.</p>
            <p>As an Erudite, Larien soon discovered that the worst place to be 
              in for a smith is Erudin. So the first thing to do was to make the 
              long journey to Freeport. In Freeport you can find all components 
              you need to become a Master Smith. You find sharpening stones and 
              ore in North Freeport, close to the Bard's Guild. You can buy rusty 
              weapons in a shop in East Freeport, and another shop there has almost 
              all the molds you need. To reach a skill level of 142, Larien used 
              the following stategy:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Train in the Guild until 21.</b> Easiest way. I often have 
                a lot of unused skill points on my characters, because I usually 
                practice my skills while I'm fishing. So I have a lot of skill 
                points available for getting a head start on trades. </li>
              <li><b>Sharpen rusty weapons until 31.</b> I got sharpening stones 
                from North Freeport and went to East Freeport to buy rusty weapons 
                there. Rusty 2H swords will get you to skill level 31. To sharpen 
                a rusty weapon, find a forge and left click on it. Put a sharpening 
                stone and a rusty weapon in the container that shows up and click 
                on 'Combine'. If you succeed, you will lose the stone and the 
                weapon and get a tarnished weapon instead. If you fail, you will 
                only lose the stone. Note that you can hold down the <i>CTRL</i> 
                key while left clicking on a stack of sharpening stones to pick 
                only one at a time. </li>
              <li><b>Made scalers until 41.</b> This is when you start making 
                those millions of metal bits you've probably heard other people 
                curse about. To make metal bits, you will need two small pieces 
                of ore (which you find in North Freeport) and a flask of water. 
                <i> <b>NEVER STACK ANYTHING</b></i> in the forge; always put the 
                two small pieces of ore in separate slots in the forge and the 
                flask in the third slot. Hit Combine. When you have made about 
                one million of metal bits, head over to East Freeport and buy 
                scaler molds. Put one metal bit, one scaler mold, and one flask 
                of water in the forge to make the scalers. </li>
              <li><b>Made lanterns until 68.</b> Same as for scalers, but the 
                recipe is: metal bit, lantern mold, bottle, and a flask of water. 
                You can find bottles in Trader's Holiday in East Freeport, the 
                merchant next to the one who sells the molds. </li>
              <li><b>Made skewers until 115.</b> Metal bit, skewer mold, and a 
                flask of water. </li>
              <li><b>Made pots until 122.</b> Metal bit, pot mold, standing legs 
                mold, and a flask of water. When Larien reached a skill level 
                around 120, he started making banded armor to get more money for 
                the practicing. He quickly got back the 100pp (about) he first 
                spent on practice. </li>
              <li><b>Made small sewing kits until 135.</b> Metal bit, needle mold, 
                thimble mold, and a flask of water. You get the needle and thimble 
                molds from North Ro, at the Inn. </li>
              <li><b>Made banded armor to 142.</b> No more metal bits! Instead, 
                you buy metal sheets in East Freeport. At this time, most banded 
                armor are trivial to make for you, except gauntlets, mantle, leggings 
                and cloak. I have heard that cloaks will get you to 168. After 
                that, there is nothing more that can increase your skill level. 
                Because most items are trivial to you now, your intelligence aren't 
                as important as your wisdom, so start maxing out wisdom with magic 
                items! To make <i>MEDIUM</i> sized banded armor, you get the molds 
                in East Freeport. To make <i>SMALL</i> armor, you can go to Neriak 
                or Rivervale to get the molds. To make <i>LARGE</i> armor, you 
                have to go to Feerott or the Karanas.</li>

              banded armor, just look up Larien on the Lanys T'Vyl server! </p>
