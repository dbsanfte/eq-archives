            <p> <b>An Overview of Foraging - by Niami DenMother</b></p>
            <p>Foraging is not really a tradeskill. However, since foraged items 
              are used for several tradeskills, I felt it wise to finally say 
              something about it here.</p>
            <p>Foraging is an ability that is granted to three character classes 
              (ranger, druid, bard), and two races (wood elf, iksar). Some of 
              these races/classes can forage &quot;zone specials&quot; (see below) 
              and others cannot.</p>
            <p>If you have gained the ability to forage only due to your race, 
              you will never see a skill increase in your forage ability. (I believe 
              racial forage is at a skill level of 50 for both iksar and wood 
              elves, though I may be wrong.) If you are a ranger, druid or bard, 
              you will be able to increase your foraging by practice, with 5 added 
              points gained per level until you reach your maximum ability. (Bards 
              have a very low forage cap, while druids and rangers have a higher 
              forage ability.)</p>
            <p>There are several basic items that can be foraged from almost any 
              zone in the game: pod of water, vegetables, fruit, berries, rabbit 
              meat, fishing grubs. Other than the fishing grubs, these items cannot 
              be sold to merchants, but can be used as drink and food, as well 
              as used in various other recipes. (The pods of water can be <a href="../secrets/recipes_brewing.htm">brewed</a> 
              into water flasks for use in other tradeskills. The veggies, fruit, 
              berries and rabbit meat can all be <a href="../secrets/recipes_baking.htm">cooked</a>, 
              and the veggies, fruit and berries can also be <a href="../secrets/recipes_brewing.htm">brewed</a> 
              into drinks.)</p>
            <p>Many non-city zones have one or more <a href="../location/foraged.htm">specific 
              items</a> that can be foraged from that zone, but not from any other 
              zone. In order to have a chance to randomly forage these items, 
              you must have a forage skill of over 100 <i>or</i> be an iksar. 
              Some of the foraged items can be eaten, some can be sold to merchants 
              for cash, some are for quests, some are used for tradeskills (brewing, 
              tailoring, smithing), and some just plain ... perplex ... me. (Like 
              the iksar phalange [dagger] foraged in Field of Bone)</p>
            <p>While having a character that can forage is NOT a requirement for 
              practicing tradeskills, it makes several of them, especially baking 
              and brewing, much easier and cheaper to accomplish.</p>
            <p>Of course, those of us who <i>can</i> forage, such as my ranger, 
              tend to run out of pack space quickly, as I tend to press the forage 
              button every time it pops, whether I need more food and drink or 
              not. Others tend to leave &quot;druid&quot; droppings all over the 
              place, foraging an item and instantly dropping it on the ground 
              if they don't like/want the item. ... this leads to an interesting 
              way for a non-tracker to find a druid or ranger ... just follow 
              the trail of foraged goodies on the ground. ;)</p>
