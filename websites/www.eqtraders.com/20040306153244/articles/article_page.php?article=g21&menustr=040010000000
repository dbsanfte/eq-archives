<p>Well, they say you are what you eat.  This is a list of folks belonging to playable races throughout Norrath and Luclin that drop parts you can either <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=33&rsa=Baking&sub=oldworld&sb=item&menustr=080020020000">bake</a> for a tasty treat, or <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=31&rsa=Alchemy&sb=item&sub=potion&menustr=080010010000">alchemize</a> into a potion granting you the ability to look like that race.</p>

<p> This is not a complete list of every single being who drops racial meat. With plenty of easy sources for most of them, I don't think anyone really wants to go after the guildmasters deep in their respective cities. Keep in mind that some of the named folk listed here are not necessarily up all the time. There are some inconsistencies in the name of the parts - some will be called meat, the rest will be called parts. If you find anything called "flesh" it will not work. <i>(Chunks of ogre flesh and high elf flesh do not have any known use in tradeskills at this time.)</i></p>

<p> If you have corrections or know of additional drop locations, please report them in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=2">General Forum</a>. <b>Please only report drops that you can personally confirm</b> because not every creature of a given race will drop parts. For example, the halflings in Nektulos Forest do NOT drop halfling parts. Also, this list does not include brownie parts (or frost giant or siren, etc.) because they are not playable races. You can still discuss how to find them in the forums. Be sure to run a search first, as you're probably not the first person who wants to know.</p>

<p>As a last tip, just because they taste good or look appealing doesn't mean that they might not be good neighbors, right? So if you want to stay in the good graces of the race in question, it is important to be selective about which of their kin you pursue. You can often find rebels and bandits who have been outcast by their home city, or monsters in the area that prey upon that race.  Sometimes you will even become better liked in their home city for having taken out these enemies.  Likewise, if you have no desire to enter the city but would like to be able to associate freely with the outcasts, center your hunting efforts on the more respectable members of that race. I recommend considering the people in question before you attack. If they hate you while their brethren back home love you, or vice versa, chances are the folks back home won't get too upset to have them gone. Just remember that cities with larger and more, ah, ethically diverse populations may have more complex faction systems. And of course, don't forget to check vendors in the area of the creatures that drop the meat you want in case another hunter sold some. For example, vendors in East Karana almost always have some halfling parts off of the spiders, while wood elf vendors in Kelethin often have wood elf parts from the bandits nearby.
