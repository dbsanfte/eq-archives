      <span class="headers">Neriak Cleric (Initiate Darkpriest) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests based out of Neriak. The results are DEF CLR only, lore (other than bracer) and no drop. Stats for the pieces have not yet been provided, but the resulting armor is pink in color. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p> 
<p>
High Priestess Alexandrian says 'Greetings child, what business do you have here? I'm sorry but I will only deal with Clerics that are willing to prove their loyalty to Innoruuk. I cannot deal with every single heathen that feels it is necessary to bid me a good day. If you are a [Cleric of Innoruuk] I might be able to aid you in your training.'
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'what magical relic'
</p> 
<p>
High Priestess Alexandrian says 'I have a box that I have been keeping for quite some time and have been waiting to present it to someone like yourself. Someone that I had faith would be strong enough to use it's power to their benefit. This magical box can be used to refine certain metals into a magical compound that is used in crafting Initiate Darkpriest armor pieces. I have the molds necessary to craft Initiate Darkpriest [Helms], [Bracers], [Boots], [Armguards], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. However there are some [important items] that you will need to collect before the molds will be of any use to you. One thing to keep in mind is that I suggest you craft your Breastplate last due to the difficulty of obtaining the items needed for that specific recipe.
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a initiate darkpriests bracers'
</p> 
<p>
High Priestess Alexandria says 'To fashion your own Initiate Darkpriest's Bracer you will need to collect 1 Helm of the Lifebringer, 1 Deathfist Scout Scalp, 1 Snake Egg and 1 Red Wine. Combine these in your box to create the correct Refined Sheet of Holy Metal that you will place in any forge along with this mold to craft your Initiate Darkpriest`s Bracer.'
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's armguards'
</p> 
<p>
High Priestess Alexandrian says 'Excellent ____! To create the correct compound in your Dark Blessed Box that will be need to be placed into a forge with this mold to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's Armguards you will need to collect and combine the following items. 3 Helms of the Lifebringer, 1 Garter Snake tounge, 2 Ash Drakeling Scales and 2 grapes. '
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's gauntlets'
</p> 
<p>
High Priestess Alexandrian says 'To fashion your own Initiate Darkpriest's Gauntlets you will need to collect 3 Helms of the Lifebringer, 1 Halfling Blood, 1 Leatherfoot Raiders Skullcap, 1 snake scales and 1 glass shard. Combine these in your Box to create the correct Refined sheet of Holy Metal that you will place in any forge along with this mold to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's Gauntlets. '
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's greaves'
</p> 
<p>
High Priestess Alexandrian says 'Take this mold _____. You will need to place this in a Forge along with the correct Refined sheet of Holy Metal to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's Greaves. The correct Refined sheet of Holy Metal for these greaves can be fashioned by combining 4 Helms of the Lifebringer, 2 Spiderling Eyes, 2 Deathfist Legionairre Scalps and 1 bottle of kalish.'
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's boots'
</p> 
<p>
High Priestess Alexandrian says 'I would definitely agree that you will need some decent Boots if you wish to last long in any extreme climates like Lavastorm! Combine 2 Helms of the Lifebringer, 2 Fire Beetle Legs and 2 Flasks of Water to fashion the correct Refined sheet of Holy Metal. Once you have done this place the Refined sheet of Holy Metal along with this mold in any forge to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's Boots. '
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's Helm'
</p> 
<p>
High Priestess Alexandrian says 'A Helm you say ______? This should be a good test for you to see if you are able to gather the correct items and annihilate those disgusting clerics that follow that worthless God Rodcet Nife. Seek out 1 Helm of the Lifebringer, 1 Low Quality Wolf Skin, 1 Black Mamba Skin and 1 Short Ale. After you have combined these in your Dark Blessed Box take your Refined sheet of Holy Metal along with this mold to the nearest forge to craft your very own Initiate Darkpriest`s Helm. '
</p> 
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's Breastplate'
</p> 
<p>
High Priestess Alexandrian says 'So, the time has come for you to gather the items necessary for your most important piece of Armor _____. You will need to combine 5 Helms of the Lifebringer, 1 Deathfist Templar Scalp, 1 Embalming Dust, 1 Matted Halfling Hide, 1 Woven Grass Amulet and <i>1 Halfling Skull</i>** Once you have prepared this final Refined sheet of Holy Metal place it in a forge along with this mold to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's Breastplate. After you have done this return to me when you are ready for your final test of loyalty. ' <i>**note: testing has found that the BP successfully combines <b>without</b> the halfling skull.</i>
