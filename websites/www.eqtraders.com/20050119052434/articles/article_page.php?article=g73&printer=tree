<p>
High elves, who will be quick to insist that they are <i>nothing</i> like their dark elven counterparts, share similar cultural tradeskills with them. They are able to smith a variety of chain and plate armors, as well as an extremely light caster-wearable chain. In addition, they have 6 unique tailored robes that they can make.
</p>
<p>
As with all cultural tradeskills, race-restricted combines must be performed by folks of the proper race. (In this case snot, erm, high elves.) Illusions won't do the trick, though I'm sure some of you will refuse to believe me even after repeating this in each and every cultural recipe section. Feel free to try to find a way around this restriction if you must, but don't come complaining to us when you can't find one.  ;)
