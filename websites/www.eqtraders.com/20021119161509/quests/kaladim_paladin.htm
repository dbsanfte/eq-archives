            <h3>Underfoot Defenders Chainmail Armor - Kaladim Paladin Quest</h3>
            <p><b>***All information concerning this quest is verified and accurate***</b></p>
            <P><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in 
              Kaladim. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, DWF/PAL 
              only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Armor has a &quot;grass 
              green&quot; plate graphic when worn. Please note that while the 
              bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your 
              first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <P>You say, 'Hail, Brenthalion Aleslammer'<BR>
              Brenthalion Aleslammer says 'Lo dere Kenworth! I be Brenthalion 
              Aleslammer Holy Defender of Brell! I can see that ye found my temple 
              of Brell that I have resided over for many years. I have been appointed 
              by da King Kazon himself to make sure dat all our young paladins 
              get da [training] dey need before dey go out to explore da world. 
              Aye.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'what training'<BR>
              Brenthalion Aleslammer says 'Ye see Kenworth, learning all the correct 
              fighting tactics along with learning your way around your homeland 
              can be no easy task for a young one new to Kaladim. That is why 
              I have developed a series of training exercises that help me monitor 
              our young ones as they progress through the ranks of the Paladin 
              on their path to true enlightenment! If you are a [young paladin 
              of Brell] I would be happy to explain to you how the exercises work 
              and I would also recommend that you take part in them!'</P>
            <P>You say, 'I am a young paladin of Brell'<BR>
              Brenthalion Aleslammer says 'Well I would be lyin if`n hearing dose 
              words didn't bring a smile to me face every time that I hear dem. 
              First thing you will need a Magical Mail Assembly Kit that you will 
              use to combine different magical items in that will create an armor 
              material. Once you have created a armor material you can then take 
              it to a forge along with a armor mold to fashion an armor piece. 
              If you are able to collect all the items for them you will have 
              the potential to make a full set of Underfoot Defenders Platemail! 
              If`n ye are [ready to begin] collecting yer items I will be happy 
              to give you your Magical Mail Assembly Kit and git you started!'</P>
