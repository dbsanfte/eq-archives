            <p class="headers">Fletching by <a href="mailto:rip_ford@cavalry.com" class="header">Quon</a>, 
              Tunare Server</p>
            <p>I have good news for fletchers. I have designed a clockwork fletching 
              kit, which will not only make bows and arrows for you but actually 
              go out and gather the necessary raw materials based on how you have 
              set a series of selection levers. Sadly, ever since an unfortunate 
              incident in which my first prototype suffered a malfunction involving 
              King Ak'anon, his favorite feather duster, two score drunk dwarves, 
              and a rather large clump of dough, I have been unable to find a 
              patron willing to fund my research. Until that blessed day arrives, 
              it will continue to be necessary to craft one's bows and arrows 
              by hand. To that end I have come here to provide you with instruction. 
            </p>
            <p>The first thing every fletcher should know is that arrows are for 
              learning and bows are for selling. As arrows are much cheaper to 
              make than a bow of similar difficulty level, you can make many more 
              arrows, and thus have many more chances to improve your skill at 
              fletching, than bows for the same amount of money. Thus, when trying 
              to improve your skill, you should always work on arrows instead 
              of bows. </p>
            <p>Fletching is a very easy skill to learn in terms of time spent 
              on it. Everything you need to master the skill is available from 
              a merchant so that you don't have to run around hunting creatures 
              that no longer provide you experience in order to gather needed 
              components. There are really only two recipes to learn, one for 
              arrows and the other for bows, so you don't have to keep a lot of 
              different recipes straight. Difficulty levels for crafting items 
              rises in a logical progression removing a certain degree of guesswork 
              in deciding what to work on next after mastering a particular item. 
              The more expensive the components used to make a particular arrow 
              or bow, the more difficult that item is to make. At present we don't 
              even need any items crafted by another trade skill. <i>(Niami's 
              note: however, smiths have learned how to fashion arrowheads that 
              match what we could buy from a merchant.)</i></p>
            <p>Arrows are composed of four parts; tip, shaft, feathers, and nock. 
              To make an arrow, simply place one of each component type in your 
              fletching kit and press the combine button. For each successful 
              attempt you will receive five arrows back. <i>(Ed: With the upgrade 
              to silver arrowheads, you get ten arrows from recipes using them.)</i> 
              Each component has a  specific effect on the arrows. The more 
              expensive the tip and/or shaft used, the more damage the arrow will 
              do. Furthermore, silver tips will make the arrows magical in nature 
              so that they can hit willowisps and similar creatures. The smaller 
              the nock, the greater the range of the arrow. Feathers affect both 
              range and damage with parabolic feathers increasing the range and 
              shield cut feathers increasing the damage. Vanes take the place of 
              feathers in the higher end arrows and increase <i>(Ed: or decrease)</i> 
              both range and damage. </p>
            <p>Bows, at their most basic, are composed of a bow staff and a string. 
              The more expensive the staff is, the greater the bow's base damage, 
              range, and delay will be. The more expensive the string is the lower 
              the bow's damage and delay. There are several other items such as 
              whittling knives, planing tools, and cams that are completely optional. 
              Each of these optional items has the effect of further lowering 
              the bow's damage and delay. Note that you can't use both a whittling 
              knife and a planing tool on a bow. It has to be one or the other. 
              Also note that you can't use one of the optional items on a bow 
              staff that is cheaper than the optional item. You cannot, for example, 
              use a whittling knife on a hickory bow staff. </p>
            <p>With that knowledge under your belt, you are now ready to begin 
              practicing fletching. The very first arrow you should begin with 
              is with a field tip, wood shaft, round feathers, and large nocks. 
              This is the easiest and cheapest arrow to make and all subsequent 
              arrows that you make will be variations upon it. Once you've mastered 
              this particular arrow, visit your arrow merchant, make a list of 
              the remaining components, and order it by price. This is the order 
              in which you will work on mastering the remaining components. The 
              difficulty of making an arrow is based on the single most expensive 
              component of the arrow, not the sum of the components. Thus a field 
              tip, steel shaft, round feather, large nock arrow is the same difficulty 
              as a hooked tip, steel shaft, parabolic feather, small nock arrow. 
              Therefore you should only swap out one component from the basic 
              arrow recipe at a time when trying to learn. When mastering small 
              nocks, make field-wood-round-small. When mastering bone vanes, make 
              field-wood-bone vane-large. If you practice in this manner, you 
              will maximize your skill at the least cost. </p>
            <p>To repeat what I said earlier, do not practice with bows to raise 
              your skills. Bows are very expensive relative to arrows. If you 
              practice with bows you're just throwing your money away and if 
              you've got that much money to waste you ought to be giving it to 
              me instead so that I can complete my clockwork fletching kit research. 
            </p>
            <p>Now, if there are no questions, class is dismissed. </p>
