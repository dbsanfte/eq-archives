            <h3> Akanon Shadowknight Armor Quest<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests. This one originates 
              in Ak'Anon and results in armor for gnome SKs. The armor should 
              be lore (other than the bracer), no drop, and GNM/SHD only.
            <p>
            <p>
            <p>Similar structure to the other evil melee class-specific quests 
              - you get a note from the quest giver (Garret Zethkog) which you 
              have to give to a secondary NPC (Mimtia Zethkog) who will then give 
              you a kit (a Mail Assembly Kit). She will then tell you the recipe 
              for each item and give you a mold (Crude [xxx] Mold) when prompted. 
              The primary quest giver gives out the class-specific weapon quest.
            <p>Go to Mimtia, she's in the Mines as well, though more difficult 
              to find. Gave her the letter(missed the text), she lists the kinds 
              of armor available.</p>
            <p>You say, 'I wish to craft a plague knight helm'<br>
              Mimtia Zethkog says 'To assemble a Plague Knight Helm you will need 
              to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with 
              a Water Flask and this Crude Helm Mold. Once that is done combine 
              the Crude Bronze Helm with a Ruined Cat Pelt and two Clockwork Spider 
              Eye Lenses in the Mail Assembly Kit.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I wish to craft a plague knight bracer'<br>
              Mimtia Zethkog says 'To assemble a Plague Knight Bracer you will 
              need to obtain a brick of crude bronze and smelt it in a forge with

              the Crude Bronze Bracer with a Ruined Cat Pelt and a Clockwork Rat
