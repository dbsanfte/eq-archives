            <h3>Qeynos Bertoxx Shadowknight Armor Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several new armor quests for young humans that 
              originates in Qeynos. All pieces of this set should be lore (other 
              than the bracer), no drop, HUM/SHD only. Due to the location and 
              the faction of the NPC down in the sewers, it's not recommended 
              that you attempt this if you are not a worshipper of Bertoxxulous. 
              Armor has a red plate graphic when worn. Please note that while 
              the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make 
              your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Unmuz Tukore'</p>
            <p>Unmuz Tukore says 'Your eyes betray your eagerness and your naivety 
              young one. I am Unmuz Tukore, Scourge Knight of the Bloodsabers. 
              If you have come seeking the [training as a shadowknight] then I 
              will offer you guidance.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I seek training as a shadowknight.'</p>
            <p>Unmuz Tukore says 'We Scourge Knights of the Bloodsabers, often 
              refered to as shadowknights by those less knowledgeable of our sect, 
              are gifted by Bertoxxulous with prowess in combat and powers over 
              the spirits and bodies of the dead. It is through discipline, training, 
              and devotion to the Plague Lord that we are granted our powers. 
              You must first equip yourself with a [suit of armor] to defend you 
              in battle from the weapons of our [enemies].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'What suit of armor?'</p>
            <p>Unmuz Tukore says 'Take this note to Wellis Pestule. He will assist 
              you in obtaining your armor. Once you have been properly outfitted 
              return to me. I will allow you to assist me with a [pressing matter].'</p>
            <p><i>{Wander over to Wellis in the priest area in back of the temple}</i></p>
            <p>Wellis Pestule says 'Welcome to the Bloodsabers young Scourge Knight. 
              I will help prepare you for your spreading of the disease. You must 
              use this Mail Assembly Kit to construct the pieces of your armor. 
              Each piece will require different materials for its construction. 
              Will you craft [Gauntlets of the Scourge Knight], [Boots of the 
              Scourge Knight], a [Bracer of the Scourge Knight], a [Helm of the 
              Scourge Knight], [Greaves of the Scourge Knight], [Vambraces of 
              the Scourge Knight], or a [Breastplate of the Scourge Knight]?'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I wish to craft the Gauntlets of the Scourge Knight.'</p>
            <p>Wellis Pestule says 'To assemble scourge knight gauntlets you will 
              need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a [forge]
