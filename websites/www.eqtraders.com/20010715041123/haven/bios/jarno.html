<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Jarno was born to a typical 
  halfling family in a typical halfling village on a typical day with the typical 
  amount of fanfare that this typically accompanies. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As he grew, his parents 
  much to their disappointment realized that Jarno was anyhing but typical. He 
  was loud; boisterous; given to impulsive action; and generally not proper(Jarno's 
  mother blamed his father for these bad traits saying that it was from his side 
  of the family...but then, you know how families are). </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Jarno's future path was 
  really set when he was only 10 years old. He was out with his family working 
  on the farm as they were getting the yearly JumJum crop ready for harvesting, 
  when all of a sudden some goblins appeared. The goblins had chained black wolves 
  as attack pets with them. They let the wolves go to attack the family, but when 
  the wolves came to Jarno they stopped in their tracks. They wouldnt attack him. 
  In fact, they let him pet them. When the goblins came to drive their wolves 
  to attack, the wolves turned on the goblins and chased them away. With his family 
  dead, the village druid took Jarno to his Aunt Niami (who is related to him 
  through her cousin and his father Rupert). The village druid told her the story 
  of what happened at the village and Niami passed Jarno off to the Training Druids.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Thus has Jarno, friend 
  of wolves and bears, has begun his journeys through the Lands of Norrath. </font></p>
