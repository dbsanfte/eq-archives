            <h3> Initiate Darkpriest Armor Neriak Cleric Armor Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests based out of Neriak. 
              The results are DEF CLR only, lore (other than bracer) and no drop. 
              Stats for the pieces have not yet been provided, but the resulting 
              armor is pink in color. Please note that while the bracers are not 
              lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer 
              before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>High Priestess Alexandrian says 'Greetings child, what business 
              do you have here? I'm sorry but I will only deal with Clerics that 
              are willing to prove their loyalty to Innoruuk. I cannot deal with 
              every single heathen that feels it is necessary to bid me a good 
              day. If you are a [Cleric of Innoruuk] I might be able to aid you 
              in your training. '<br>
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'what magical relic'<br>
            </p>
            <p>High Priestess Alexandrian says 'I have a box that I have been 
              keeping for quite some time and have been waiting to present it 
              to someone like yourself. Someone that I had faith would be strong 
              enough to use it's power to their benefit. This magical box can 
              be used to refine certain metals into a magical compound that is 
              used in crafting Initiate Darkpriest armor pieces. I have the molds 
              necessary to craft Initiate Darkpriest [Helms], [Bracers], [Boots], 
              [Armguards], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. However 
              there are some [important items] that you will need to collect before 
              the molds will be of any use to you. One thing to keep in mind is 
              that I suggest you craft your Breastplate last due to the difficulty 
              of obtaining the items needed for that specific recipe.</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a initiate darkpriests bracers'</p>
            <p>High Priestess Alexandria says 'To fashion your own Initiate Darkpriest's 
              Bracer you will need to collect 1 Helm of the Lifebringer, 1 Deathfist 
              Scout Scalp, 1 Snake Egg and 1 Red Wine. Combine these in your box 
              to create the correct Refined Sheet of Holy Metal that you will 
              place in any forge along with this mold to craft your Initiate Darkpriest`s 
              Bracer.'<br>
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's armguards'<br>
            </p>
            <p>High Priestess Alexandrian says 'Excellent ____! To create the 
              correct compound in your Dark Blessed Box that will be need to be 
              placed into a forge with this mold to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's 
              Armguards you will need to collect and combine the following items. 
              3 Helms of the Lifebringer, 1 Garter Snake tounge, 2 Ash Drakeling 
              Scales and 2 grapes. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's gauntlets'<br>
            </p>
            <p>High Priestess Alexandrian says 'To fashion your own Initiate Darkpriest's 
              Gauntlets you will need to collect 3 Helms of the Lifebringer, 1 
              Halfling Blood, 1 Leatherfoot Raiders Skullcap, 1 snake scales and 
              1 glass shard. Combine these in your Box to create the correct Refined 
              sheet of Holy Metal that you will place in any forge along with 
              this mold to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's Gauntlets. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's greaves'<br>
            </p>
            <p>High Priestess Alexandrian says 'Take this mold _____. You will 
              need to place this in a Forge along with the correct Refined sheet 
              of Holy Metal to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's Greaves. The correct 
              Refined sheet of Holy Metal for these greaves can be fashioned by 
              combining 4 Helms of the Lifebringer, 2 Spiderling Eyes, 2 Deathfist 
              Legionairre Scalps and 1 bottle of kalish. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's boots'<br>
            </p>
            <p>High Priestess Alexandrian says 'I would definitely agree that 
              you will need some decent Boots if you wish to last long in any 
              extreme climates like Lavastorm! Combine 2 Helms of the Lifebringer, 
              2 Fire Beetle Legs and 2 Flasks of Water to fashion the correct 
              Refined sheet of Holy Metal. Once you have done this place the Refined 
              sheet of Holy Metal along with this mold in any forge to craft your 
              Initiate Darkpriest's Boots. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's Helm'<br>
            </p>
            <p>High Priestess Alexandrian says 'A Helm you say ______? This should 
              be a good test for you to see if you are able to gather the correct 
              items and annihilate those disgusting clerics that follow that worthless 
              God Rodcet Nife. Seek out 1 Helm of the Lifebringer, 1 Low Quality 
              Wolf Skin, 1 Black Mamba Skin and 1 Short Ale. After you have combined 
              these in your Dark Blessed Box take your Refined sheet of Holy Metal 
              along with this mold to the nearest forge to craft your very own 
              Initiate Darkpriest`s Helm. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a Initiate Darkpriest's Breastplate'<br>
            </p>
            <p>High Priestess Alexandrian says 'So, the time has come for you 
              to gather the items necessary for your most important piece of Armor 
              _____. You will need to combine 5 Helms of the Lifebringer, 1 Deathfist 
              Templar Scalp, 1 Embalming Dust, 1 Matted Halfling Hide, 1 Woven 
              Grass Amulet and <i>1 Halfling Skull</i>** Once you have prepared 
              this final Refined sheet of Holy Metal place it in a forge along 
              with this mold to craft your Initiate Darkpriest's Breastplate. 
              After you have done this return to me when you are ready for your 
              final test of loyalty. ' <i>**note: testing has found that the BP 
              successfully combines <b>without</b> the halfling skull.</i><br>
