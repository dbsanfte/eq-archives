How many Verant GMs does it take to change a lightbulb?
<P>
A: It doesn't get changed: <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
GM1: "We're sorry, we can't discuss lightbulbs, they may or may not be<BR>
implemented in the expansion." (But there's lightbulbs in EQ already?)<BR>
"Yes, and please buy our expansion!" <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
GM2: "There's nothing wrong with the lightbulb." (There's no light comingout
of it?) <BR>
"We can't reveal how the lightbulb is supposed to work." <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
GM3: "We have lightbulbs?" <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
GM4: "We've been working very hard on making the most realistic lightbulbs<BR>
in any multiplayer game yet!" (Why is there no light?) "Oh,<BR>
to give an air of mystery, we don't want players to worry about<BR>
mechanics." <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
GM5: "Look, quit asking us about lightbulbs. We have no plans on changing<BR>
the lightbulbs as currently implemented. It would affect gameplay." <BR>
&nbsp;
<P>
GM6: (The lightbulb seems to work now, and it didn't before) "No it<BR>
didn't, or we would've announced it in the patch message." (Well,<BR>
there's light coming out of it now). *poof* (Never mind...)
