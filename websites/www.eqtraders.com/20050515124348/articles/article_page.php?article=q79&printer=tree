<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Gukta. Armor pieces should lore (other than bracer), no drop and restricted to FRG/PAL. These quests start with your trainer, shin Master Grubbus, who also provides you with the assembly kit. As you ask about each piece of armor, he will give you the mold that you need for that piece.

<h4>GAUNTLETS:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
 Shin Master Grubbus says 'Gauntlets are a good choice. Gauntlets of the Shin Initiate are fairly simple to craft. You will need to gather one Small Mosquito Wing, one Large Snake Skin, two Zombie Skins, and one Small Brick of Ore from Innothule. If you cannot find any ore in the swamp, you might be able to find some ore for sale by visiting the local merchants. Once you have found these items, combine them in your assembly kit and take the newly created material to a forge, such as the one in the Gukta Exchange, along with this mold.'

<h4>BREASTPLATE:</h4>

Through great perseverance and piety we are able to overcome almost any obstacle.

If you cannot locate any ore in your travels, you might be able to find some ore for sale by visiting the local merchants. Once you have found these items, combine them in your assembly kit and take the newly created material to a forge, such as the one in the Gukta Exchange, along with this mold. After you have completed your Breastplate, come back to talk to me if you wish to perform your [final test].'

<h4>BOOTS:</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
Shin Master Grubbus says 'Very good. We, as paladins of Marr, have a duty to uphold Marr's teachings and be his voice to all who will listen. Though the crafting of Boots of the Shin Initiate are relatively easy to create, do not be idle in either thought or action. To craft your boots you will need to venture into the swamp and gather a few items. You will need to gather one Snake Fang, one Small Mosquito Wing, one Zombie Skin, and two Small Bricks of Ore. If you cannot locate any ore in the swamp, you might be able to find some ore for sale by visiting the local merchants.

You will need to venture to the Deserts of Ro and gather a Desert Tarantula Chitin, a Giant Snake Fang, a Pristine Giant Scarab Carapace, and three Small Bricks of Ore. If you cannot locate any ore in the swamp or desert, you might be able to find some ore for sale by visiting the local merchants.
