  I was just making a web site to make trade skills easier, but I <B>know</B> 
  there are a lot of us roleplayers scattered across the servers who are interested 
  in more than just skills. Until I figure out if there's much interest in this 
  little corner of the site, I'm not worrying much about &quot;prettying up&quot; 
  this section. Yell if you're truly using it, and I may try to clean it up a 
  bit. </font>

<P><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> While I personally dislike 
  all the folks who walk up and inspect my equipment by right clicking on me without 
  saying a word (I feel like there's a bunch of peeping toms staring down my bodice), 
  there is some way to add to the eyefull folks get when they do that to you. 
  Take a good long look at yourself from an external view (i.e., press the f9 
  key a time or two, so you can see yourself on your screen). Right click on yourself, 
  and it should bring up a picture of you, with a blank area below it. Click on 
  that area and it will let you type in a brief character history (or whatever 
  you prefer) that will show when anyone looks at your equipment. (&quot;If you're 
  done staring, kindly remove your eyeball from my bodice&quot; was one of the 
  ones I heard of that got a giggle out of me.)</font>

  Tips</A></font> </H3>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B><font color="#400000">"Hail 
  a sand giant"</font></B> - By now, if you've done much group hunting, you've 
  probably hear this one, however, here's some RP justification/explanation for 
  it. &nbsp;Your group just got done beating on something nasty, and most of the 
  spellcasters are busy meditating. Something nasty comes over the hill, and you 
  need to get out a timely warning before it stomps on your party. &nbsp;You can 
  try, "Guys, look out, there's a ..." followed by the sounds of one or more party 
  members getting blindsided. There's a faster way to warn, them, however, to 
  make up for the time that it's slower to type a warning than it is to physically 
  say it.&nbsp;Target the critter and hit the "h" key to hail it. &nbsp;Think 
  of this as the RP equivalent of pointing at it and blurting a warning. Once 
  you've hailed it, <B>then</B> you can give more accurate information about where 
  it is and who is in danger ... as you yourself either backpedal out of it's 
  path, or move to defend your group's spellcasters. For those of you busy meditating 
  with your noses in your spellbooks, if you hear someone hail a nasty critter, 
  get your nose out of that book and be ready to move or fight. It might just 
  save your life and the lives of those with you. </font>

<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1" color="#400000"><B>Corpse 
  fetching</B></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> - You 
  died somewhere you should not have been ... again. And, well, you really would 
  die if you tried to loot your body in that particular spot. &nbsp;If you're 
  unable to become invisible, or you died somewhere that creatures can see through 
  invisible, then get yourself, and a couple bodyguards into the general area 
  where you died. Then <B>carefully</B> edge your way closer to your body, trying 
  a /corpse every step or two. The moment the command works, BACK up many steps, 
  and /corpse again. Repeat this process until you've got your body somewhere 
  that is a little safer. Think of this as the RP equivalent of grabbing your 
  corpse and dragging it to somewhere you can loot it in safety. You have to get 
  close to it to "grab" it, and can only drag in tiny spurts because, well, <I>it</I> 
  has all your gear on it, so is heavier than the reborn you. You can now do this 
  with other people's corpses as well, as long as they have given you /consent.

    lessons?</A></font> 
</H3>
<P ALIGN=Left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> All the races, 
  other than human, know at least one language other than Common Tongue when they 
  start out. &nbsp;You can learn other languages as you go along, both for the 
  pure fun of it, and for things like spell research later on. <i>(At last count, 
  at least until the expansion pack, there are 24 languages available.)</i></font> 
<P ALIGN=Left> 
<P ALIGN=Left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> There are two 
  main ways to learn other languages, and you can intermix them. </font>
<P ALIGN=Left> 
<OL>
  <LI> 
    <P ALIGN=Left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> As you 
      get older, your trainer can teach you various languages, should you wish 
      to spend the training points. </font>
  <LI> 
    <P ALIGN=Left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> You can 
      find a native speaker, listen to them talk the language a while, and then 
      practice the language yourself. </font>
</OL>
<P ALIGN=Left> 
<P ALIGN=Left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> This second 
  method is a great way for a group to pass 10 or 15 minutes while they are waiting 
  for someone or something to happen. Make sure you are grouped, and in close 
  physical proximity to each other. Each member of the party should go to their 
  speech selection screen and change their language to something that at least 
  1 other in the group does not know, or knows to a much lesser degree than you. 
  Then go to your <B>socials</B> menu and reprogram one of your buttons to <I>/gsay</I> 
  two or three sentences. Put that socials button onto one of your hotkeys that 
  is currently unused. <b><font color="#400000">Turn off group say</font></b> 
  (in your chat filter section of the options menu) so that you don't see the 
  spam that the others are saying, only the skill increases and your own babble. 
  <b><font color="#400000">Remember to turn group say back on in the chat filters 
  when you're done with the lesson</font>.</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> 
  Take a deep breath, and then everyone begin babbling at once, via the hotkeys, 
  in the various languages. (This is called "spamming") &nbsp;Have one person 
  ready to switch back to Common at the drop of a hat and spam "HOLD!" in normal 
  say until everyone stops if there is danger approaching. Since the spamming 
  can be pretty intense, I recommend only sending across 2 or 3 sentences at a 
  time, with at a 1-second delay between your spams to the others, more if you 
  want to see what else is going on. At random times, you will see a message flash 
  across your screen that says <FONT COLOR="Blue"><B>"Your language skills have 
  improved."</B></FONT></font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&nbsp;However, 
  <B><font color="#400000">you won't see those improvements on your skill list 
  until you zone or log off and back on</font></B><font color="#400000">.</font> 
  It's amazing how quickly you can become very multilingual, with a few good friends 
  from other races to assist you. </font> 
<P ALIGN=Left><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Once you have 
  learned that language, you can also try to increase your skill by speaking it 
  to another, but it's much slower learning&nbsp;to laboriously try to pronounce 
  all those foreign words than it is to learn by listening. </font>
