            <P><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in 
              Paineel. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ERU/NEC, 
              Cazic-Thule only. They are no-fail tailoring combines. This armor 
              has dark leather graphic. Please note that while the bracers are 
              not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer 
              before you get the parts for a second one.</i></p>
            <P><i>Shwara can be found in the Abbatoir, up the first set of steps, 
              at 759, 837</i></p>
            <P>You say, 'Hail, Shwara Volerno'<BR>
              Shwara Volerno says 'Welcome to The Abattoir fellow Cazicite. I 
              am Shwara Volerno, Mistress of Necromancy. If you have just begun 
              to study the Necromantic arts I will assist you with obtaining some 
              [clothing] and a robe that will be most useful when conducting research 
              outside of The Abattoirs walls. We members of the Abattoir are the 
              most feared of the residents of Paineel by the citizens of Erudin, 
              to venture too far beyond the safety of our city unprepared would 
              be foolish.'</P>
            <P>You say, 'What clothing?'<BR>
              Shwara Volerno says 'You will require this Curing Kit that has been 
              specially prepared for the crafting of a suit and robe of Abattoir 
              Initiate Clothing. The components necessary to craft the clothing 
              vary according to the article that you desire to fabricate. Once

            You say, 'What important research?'<br>
            Shwara Volerno says 'We Cazicites of the Abattoir are the most advanced 
            Necromancers in all of Norrath. Our greatness is due to the diligence 
            and studiousness we apply to our research, and our powers over fear. 
            The foolish sorcerers in Erudin are afraid of the knowledge we possess. 
            They fear the magic we wield and control, for their minds are too 
            weak to harness it themselves. Despite our vast knowledge there is 
            always more to learn that can prove to be beneficial to The Abattoir. 
            I require your assistance in obtaining some [new information].' 
            <p>You say, 'What new information?'<br>
              Shwara Volerno says 'The Abattoir has recently discovered a Kobold 
              Spiritist that wields necromantic powers. We believe this unusual 
              kobold resides in the Warrens of Clan Kolbok as he has been sighted 
              entering and exiting those ruinous caverns. It is possible that 
              this kobold has somehow acquired this necromantic knowledge from 
              Paineel but I would not like to rule out the possibility that it 
              is a rare form of kobold sorcery. Find this Kobold Spiritist and 
              bring me whatever arcane parchments you discover in his possession.'</p>
