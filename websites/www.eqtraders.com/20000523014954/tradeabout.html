<P><BIG><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Just why did I make 
  this site anyway? Partly for myself, since I was gathering some of this knowledge 
  anyway; partly for others trying trade skills, and partly for those trying to 
  buy made items.</font></BIG><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><BR>
  </font>
<P>&nbsp; 
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>For myself:</B> I spent 
  a lot of time trying to find everything I needed to practice my trades in my 
  home city of choice ... and failed. After risking life and limb to get to another 
  city, I spent quite a bit of time hopping through 5 different zones to find 
  everything I wanted. It made sense to make notes, just like it makes sense to 
  share that information in hopes that other exploring traders will return the 
  favor for other zones.. </font>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>For others trying trade 
  skills:</B> There's a great feeling of accomplishment when you successfully 
  make your first trade item, but there can be a lot of frustration getting to 
  that point. I <B>don't </B>want to give you all the secrets of your trade, which 
  is why you won't find recipes, gem/metal combinations, etc. readily available. 
  What you will find are things to give you a helping hand -- basic information 
  on the skill, perhaps a tidbit or two to get you headed in the right direction, 
  some knowledge of how readily you will find trade items in your area, and an 
  opportunity to sell your finished product to a wider audience. &nbsp;Trade skills 
  will grow and change as the world grows and changes, merchant locations will 
  come and go, but at least I &nbsp;hope to give you a fighting chance at getting 
  that feeling of accomplishment as you hold your first homeade edible goo, that 
  first piece of handmade patchwork leather armor, those first metals studs, etc. 
  </font>
<P> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><B>For those who are simply 
  shopping: </B>Welcome! I hope to have more merchants listed soon. Once I've 
  got a better listing of folks for you to shop from, perhaps you'll be able to 
  squelch all that auctioning going on in your head in-game. &nbsp;I know that 
  other than the shopping page, most of this site <I>might</I> bore you. At the 
  same time, a bit of reading might give you a better understanding of why you 
  hear folks auctioning things in your head for prices you might initially feel 
  is high. Once you do the math, you may find that they're barely making a profit. 
  Then again, they may just be greedy, but you'll probably have a good feel for 
  which it is when you see the myriad of trade items they have to find for their 
  craft. </font>
