<span class="headers">PoP: Aid Grimel Quest - For multi-GM tradeskillers</span>
<p>
<i>This quest originates in the top of the Plane of Knowledge Library, with Aid Grimel. It requires advanced planar flags for PoP zones, multiple tradeskills over 200 (exact requirements listed below) and, of course, the Planes of Power expansion. At this time, the quest has not been fully completed, so additional details will be added to this page as they become available. Discussion of this quest can be found <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=76">on the new message boards</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
Each of the parts requires a different primary tradeskill at or above 220. The first (Smithing) can be pushed above 200 without any AAs expended, but after the first tradeskill is over 200 you must spend 3 AAs per skill to push them above 200. If you don't have the required tradeskill at or above 220, Aid Grimel will not give you the quest in question. Aid Grimel also requires that you have various PoP Flags to get the quest. Below is a summary of the Skill, the Flags and Zones involved in each step.
