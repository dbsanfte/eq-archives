              <p>If you are considering this quest, here is a checklist of things 
                to consider:</p>
              <p>
                <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
                &nbsp;

              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><i>Class:</i> If you are 
                a Bard or Rogue, give up now. You get nothing from this quest.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>
                <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
                &nbsp;

                </p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><i>Factions required</i>: Maximum 
                ally COV, apprehensive or better to Coldain, default Froststone. 
                Your OT faction may suffer as well if you are evil.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>
                <![if !supportEmptyParas]>
                &nbsp;
                <![endif]>
                </p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><i>Money</i>: 1050pp 
                minimum, plus tradeskill-related costs for skillups, plus purchasing 
                flawless diamonds if you don’t have any.</p>

              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><i>Trade skills</i>: 175 smithing, 
                128 pottery minimum. It’s hard to judge exactly, but we’ve been 
                told that there is an absolute chance of a 5% failure on ANY combines 
                in this quest. I think 175 skill will get you there. I think it’s 
                far easier to redo this quest if you fail than to try to raise 
                smithing any higher in any case.</p>

                  know the color of the slain dragon you are looking for. Tell 
                  him “black”. He will ask you for a 50 platinum rental fee for

                  there, you should be fine. Finding Froststone can be difficult 
                  if you are unfamiliar with the Crystal Caverns zone. As a cleric, 
                  I was able to hire a guide with the offer of free buffs. The 
                  zone is confusing, but if a member of your group has a levitation 
                  spell, it is much easier. (You can jump down almost all the

                it, and I hear a rumor that there is a banker and merchants down 
                there – totally unconfirmed rumor.)</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'> So station yourself with the book

                The Stalag Terrors are green to a high level player, but will 
                aggro you anyway. Train all that down to the room where Burdael 
                spawns. If you have sense undead, it will lead you right to him. 
                It’s the room down the left passage to a dead end with 5 or 6 
                Stalags.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Once you turn in the book to Historian 
                Baenek, the Ghost of Burdael will spawn in the Stalag Terror area. 
                He is an SK undead ghost, blue to 60. He is non-aggro and will 
                respond to hails with gibberish. He stays up only for a bit before 
                despawning. (I estimate 5 minutes, I didn’t time it.)</p>
              <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The fight with the ghost was easily accomplished with myself, 
                a level 58 (at the time) cleric, a level 60 warrior and a level 
                55 wizard. Burdael is a high HP mob considering the encounter 
                overall. I had the wizard take out Burdael’s pet and the warrior 
                and I focused on Burdael. If you don’t have the levels, you might 
                want to bring a full group of six. </p>
              <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent> Once you have slain Burdael, take the Axe from his corpse. If you cast

                Someone who can disarm traps is useful. If you have a small group, 
                this step takes a whopping 10 minutes from the time you zone in.

                at about +1500, +1100 and say “Remember, Garzicor”. Keep moving 
                around and spamming in that area, until you see a voice start 
                to speak. It will utter some stuff like “Must spill blood. Vengeance! 
                Home!” While the voice is talking, look on the ground and you 
                will see some bags spawn on the ground. There are 2 of them and

                  general notes on smithing this quest. I did this quest at 175 
                  skill, and I failed once the first time. I redid the quest and 
                  was successful the second time at 175. Both times I had 255 
                  Wisdom. The first time, I had only 185 Strength when I failed. 
                  The second time I had 255 STR with Shaman buffs. (Focus and

              <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3>I also want to say that this quest is 
                FAR easier to do now that incorrect recipes do not combine. Sometimes 
                the way the instructions are written, it’s unclear what the exact 
                steps are. But that’s ok because the forge won’t let you combine 
                the wrong parts. </p>

                only a small cash investment. (Far less than 50 pp.)</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;Now remember that if you fail almost 
                any of the smithing, (with the exception of just splitting the

                the Paebala tunnel and leave your army back where the tunnel makes 
                a bend to the left. I don’t advise brining your army right to 
                the spawn spot because someone may not have good COV faction or 
                someone may get a little too much bloodlust and attack the turn-in

                must go to the same spot you went to earlier and now you will 
                speak the phrase “You are one but two. Your vengeance shall find a home.”  Spam that around a bit and eventually an invisible 
                mob will spawn. It’s just a name floating there called “a ghostly 
                presence” and it has no model. If you have NPC names off, you 
                won’t be able to see it.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Give your Vial of Kromzek Blood to 
                “a ghostly presence”. There are a few other truly invisible mobs 
                with no names near the ghostly presence. Make sure that you see 
                the name “a ghostly presence” in your trade window. If the name 
                isn’t there, you are screwing up. If you do it wrong <a

                me for 140’s, if I recall correctly. Make sure your army understands 
                not to waste mana on Garzicor’s remains.</p>

                looking Phara Dar/Harla Dar. It hit in the 300’s and had an AE

                that he had around 150000 hit points.</p>

                drops. Once the Wraith is slain, get your rogue friend on the 
                traps and move down the tunnel.</p>
              <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>There will be 2 very green, COV faction 
                miniature Garzicors in the tunnel. Give a Flawless Diamond to 
                each. They will despawn upon turn-in and you get back two slightly 
                different diamonds. One is called something like a Magical Darkened 
                Diamond and the other is called something like a Golden Diamond.
