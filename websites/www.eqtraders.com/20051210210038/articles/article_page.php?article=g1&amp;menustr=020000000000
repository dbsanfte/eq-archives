      <span class="headers">Welcome to EQTC!</span>
<p>
Welcome!<p>
EQTraders Corner (EQTC) was created at the launch of EQ by a stubborn redhead named Niami DenMother (aka 'Mum), in an attempt to make sense of the often-bewildering world of EverQuest tradeskills. 
<p>
During the 5+ years that it has been running, there have been many changes to tradeskills as well as to this website. We've gone from being run on 'Mum's personal AOL webspace to a several million hits per month website and message board setup. We've gone from flat files tracking a few recipes and some vendor and mob drop information to multiple database tables tracking thousands of recipes, mobs, drops and so forth.
<p>
One thing hasn't changed, though. We're still privately owned and run by 'Mum (though now with the help of her husband and some phenomenal volunteer staff). Why is this point important? It means that this is basically a labor of love. It's not some huge profit-making site (often we barely get enough donations to cover hosting fees ... let's not even talk about the number of hours a week we put into it!). There is no premium membership. There are no annoying popups. There is no begging in your mailbox asking you to help keep us running. There's just this dedicated staff trying to make sure that tradeskill information is freely available to all and sundry.
<p>We're experimenting now with some targeted banner ads on the EQ2 forums, and depending on how they do, we may actually add some to the EQ site as well. Just a little extra space taken at the top of the page. Easy to ignore if you want. {grins}  However, it might make a huge difference on the stress levels of 'Mum and hubby Ngreth (aka the House Ogre). Running the two sites is getting pretty close to being a fulltime job, only without a paycheck going with it, and with the addition of the EQ2 site, expenses are about to outstrip our income from the site. We don't want to resort to begging. We absolutely refuse to go to a premium membership or "sell out" to a larger conglamerate (again, this goes back to our goal of making tradeskill information freely available to everyone).  Soooooo, we'll see how it goes.<p>
Please be aware that we do strongly monitor and moderate our message boards, and make sure to read the posts in the Visitor's Corner section of the forums before posting. While the tradeskill information on the site is freely available to all, we DO enforce rules of conduct on those using the message boards, and we can/will ban folks from posting if they can't accept our "our house, our rules" decision for the forums. We've seen too many message board forums turn into total chaos, and we're not going to let it happen here - especially now that we have SOE devs regularly stopping in to check on things, based on our reputation for relative sanity. ;)
