<span class="headers">Paineel Cleric (Templar of Fright) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Paineel. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ERU/CLE only. They are no-fail smithing combines. While stats were not provided, we have been told that the graphic for the armor is black plate. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one </i>
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Sadorno Chomosh'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'Salutations. I am Sadorno Chomosh, Templar of Terror. The path of terror taught to us by Cazic Thule is a dangerous way of life. The perils are great but the rewards are unimaginable power. In order to harness the powers of fear you must first know that which you seek to control, terror, dread, and fright. I presume that you are still young and have much to learn. If that is the case I will assist you in acquiring [armaments] to aid you on your journey to power.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What armaments?'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'You will require this Mail Assembly Kit that has been prepared in advance for the construction of Templar of Fright Armor. The materials required for the armors construction vary according to the section you desire to craft. When you have acquired your suit of armor return to me and perhaps you can assist me with a [pending task]. Do you desire to craft a [templar of fright helm], a [templar of fright bracer], [templar of fright gauntlets], [templar of fright boots], [templar of fright vambraces], [templar of fright greaves], or a [templar of fright breastplate]?'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What pending task?'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'The Tabernacle of Terror has many enemies here on Odus who oppose our teachings our patron deity, Cazic Thule. The Priests of Prexus and Quellious in the city of Erudin seek to purge Odus of our kind, for they view us as a disgrace to the Erudite race. Behind their disdain however, lies fear. It is this fear that allows us to prosper and become more powerful than the closed minded fools of Erudin. In the Toxxulia forest you will find such a fool, a priest by the name of Terago Omath. This priest has been attempting to ward the Toxxulia Forest from the presence of the undead. Seek this Terago Omath and return to me with his head.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a templar of fright helm'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'To assemble a Templar of Fright Helm you will need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Helm Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Helm with a Ruined Kobold Pelt and a Kobold Skull in the Mail Assembly Kit.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a templar of fright bracer'<br>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'To assemble a Templar of Fright Bracer you will need to obtain a brick of crude bronze and smelt it in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Bracer Mold. Once that is done, combine the Crude Bronze Bracer with a Ruined Kobold Pelt and a Kobold Ulna Bone in the Mail Assembly Kit.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a templar of fright gauntlets'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'To assemble Templar of Fright Gauntlets you will need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this crude Gauntlet Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Gauntlets with a Ruined Kobold Pelt and two Kobold Finger Bones in the Mail Assembly Kit.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a templar of fright boots'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'To assemble Templar of Fright Boots you will need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this crude Boot Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Boots with two Ruined Kobold Pelts, and two Kobold Foot Bones in the Mail Assembly Kit.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft templar of fright vambraces'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'To assemble Templar of Fright Vambraces you will need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Vambrace Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Vambraces with an Intact Kobold Pelt and two Kobold Humerus Bones in the Mail Assembly Kit.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft templar of fright greaves'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'To assemble Templar of Fright Greaves you will need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Greaves Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Greaves with two Intact Kobold Pelts and two Kobold Tibia in the Mail Assembly Kit.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft templar of fright breastplate'
</p>
<p>
Sadorno Chomosh says 'To assemble a Templar of Fright Breastplate you will need to obtain four bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Breastplate Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Breastplate with a Pristine Kobold Pelt, a Kobold sternum, and a Kobold ribcage in the Mail Assembly Kit.'
