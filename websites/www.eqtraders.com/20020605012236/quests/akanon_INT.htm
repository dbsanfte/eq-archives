            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><i>This is one of many youngling armor quests. This one, based 
              in Ak'Anon, is for &quot;good&quot; young gnomish INT casters (followers 
              of Bertoxx must use the <a href="akanon_evilcaster.htm">evil caster 
              armor quest</a> instead). Armor pieces will be lore (other than 
              bracer), no drop, GNM; MAG, WIZ, ENC</i></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Xalirilan Zarinokosalio'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'Oi there! Its nice to meet you Trincket, 
              you must excuse me for I am currently working on a special spell 
              for my studies. I would love to talk but I have to teach a class 
              very soon to the new [initiates] and I dont have my lesson prepared 
              yet. Are you also a [young initiate of the Eldritch Collective]? 
              If you are then I hope you will be ready for the lesson.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a young initiate of the eldritch collective'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'Excellent. You must understand that 
              I am very pressed for time but if you are a young initiate of the 
              Collective then I always have time to share my knowledge with you. 
              If you are interested I have some [training] for you to begin. These 
              tasks will help you prepare for the upcoming lesson as well!'</p>
            <p>You say, 'What training?'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'I have a number of tasks that I ask 
              new recruits of the Eldritch Collective to complete. These task 
              will test both your ability to fight as well as your navigational 
              skills, 2 very important factors on your road to infinite knowledge. 
              When you are ready to begin your journeys I will present you with 
              a Tinkered Sewing Kit that you will use to gather numerous [important 
              components].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'What important components?'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'All right then Trincket, here is 
              your Tinkered Sewing Kit. In this sewing kit you will combine a 
              number of recipes that will be used for creating your Eldritch Collective 
              Initiate Armor. When you are ready to craft a certain armor piece 
              all you must to is tell me which piece you [want] to craft. I will 
              then present you with the component recipe along with the applicable 
              pattern for [Caps], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], 
              [Gloves] and [Robes]. When you have completed the material for whatever 
              piece you asked for you will combine it in a sewing kit with the 
              appropriate pattern to fashion your armor piece. I do suggest though 
              that you attempt your robe last as the components are more difficult 
              then any other piece to collect.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a cap'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'A true initiate of the Eldritch Collective 
              must always have a trusty cap on to protect any blows to the head. 
              To create your cap material you will need to combine 2 Grikbar Kobold 
              Scalps, 1 Mountain Lion Pelt, 1 Wolf Meat and a Cloth Cap in your 
              assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it 
              to a sewing kit along with this pattern to fashion your very own 
              Cap of the Collective Initiate.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft sandals'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'Sandals are always a wise idea because 
              you never know what you where your adventures will take you. To 
              create your sandal material you will need to combine 3 Grikbar Kobold 
              Scalps, 1 Kobold Tooth, 2 Harpy Wings, 1 Russet Oxide and Cloth 
              Sandals in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material 
              take it to a sewing kit along with this pattern to fashion your 
              very own Sandals of the Collective Initiate.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft sleeves'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'Your sleeves will be a very important 
              part of your armor set. To create your sleeves material you will 
              need to combine 2 Grikbar Kobold Scalps, 2 Coyote Skulls and Cloth 
              Sleeves in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material 
              take it to a sewing kit along with this pattern to fashion your 
              very own Sleeves of the Collective Initiate.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a robe'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'I am very pleased to see that you 
              have progressed through your training in such a timely manner, you 
              should be very proud! To create your robe material you will need 
              to combine 5 Grikbar Kobold Scalps, 1 Young Ebon Drake Bile, 1 Brownie 
              Brain, 1 Diseased Bone Marrow, 1 Cloth Shirt and the evil Faeronoliop`s 
              Staff in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material 
              take it to a sewing kit along with this pattern to fashion your 
              very own Robe of the Collective Initiate. Please return to me once 
              you have fashioned your robe for I might have a few [final tasks] 
              for you to complete.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft gloves'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'Its is very important that your hands 
              are well guarded while you are attempting to practice magic because 
              your hands will channel your energies thus having them injured would 
              put a great burden on your training. To create your gloves material 
              you will need to combine 3 Grikbar Kobold Scalps, 1 Grikbar Kobold 
              Fur, 1 Giant Rat Pelt, 1 Giant Rat Ear and 1 Brownie Leg in your 
              assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it 
              to a sewing kit along with this pattern to fashion your very own 
              Gloves of the Collective Initiate.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft trousers'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'One will need to question your intellectual 
              abilities if they see you running around without any pants on so 
              let's make sure that doesnt happen. To create your trousers material 
              you will need to combine 4 Grikbar Kobold Scalps, 1 Aviak Beak, 
              1 Runaway Clockwork Motor and Cloth Pants in your assembly kit. 
              Once you have created the proper material take it to a sewing kit 
              along with this pattern to fashion your very own Trousers of the 
              Collective Initiate.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a bracer'</p>
            <p>Xalirilan Zarinokosalio says 'Bracers are a wise idea and will 
              keep you well guarded young Trincket. To create your bracer material 
              you will need to combine 1 Grikbar Kobold Scalps, 1 Plague Rat Tail 
              , 1 Minotaur Scalp and a Cloth Wristband in your assembly kit. Once 
              you have created the proper material take it to a sewing kit along
