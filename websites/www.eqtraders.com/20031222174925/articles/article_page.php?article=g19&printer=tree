<span class="headers">Guide to Power Baking</span>
<p>
<p class="headers">By Oakwood Moonblaze</p>
            
<p>This is a quick and dirty guide to getting your baking skill up as high as possible, as fast as possible. This is definitely a spoiler; so if you want to figure things out for yourself, stop reading now.  It is a very step-by-step, hold your hand guide to mastering baking in the shortest possible time. </p>

<p> First a few general things for all trade skills </p>

<p><b>Gather Space: </b>  Empty all your bag slots into the bank, so you are carrying no bags. Go to the gnome camp in Iceclad Ocean (get a port or take the boat from North Ro). Buy 8 deluxe toolboxes (10 giant slot, wt 4, perfect bank boxes, cost less than 2pp each).  Go back to your bank and switch the toolboxes for your normal bags.  You now have 80 giant slots in your bank, instead of 64 if you used all backpacks. </p>

<p><b> Boost Stats:</b>  Trade skills go up based on the higher of your int or wis. You may have heard rumors that one affects skill and the other affects success. Let me squash that right now.  The ONLY thing that affects <i>success rate</i> is your skill level.  Stats make NO difference of any kind. For skill up purposes the engine looks at either your wis or your int, whichever is higher.  The other can be 0 for all you care.  </p>

<p>  Based on your class and race, decide which is easier for you to raise. 
            <ul>
              <li>  For Magicians, Enchanters, Wizards, Necromancers, Shadow 
                Knights and Bards it is usually easier to boost int.</li>
              <li>  For Clerics, Shamans, Druids, Rangers, Beastlords, and 
                Paladins it is usually easier to boost wis.</li>
              <li>  For Warriors, Monks, and Rogues ... both stats will be 
                low, pick whichever one is easier for you to raise and boost it</li>
            </ul>
            
<p>You will see much faster skill ups with higher stats. Get a “training suit” with the most int/wis you can afford that you can keep in the bank, and put it on when you are working on trade skills. </p>

<p>Ok, on to the baking. </p>

<p>For all races <i>except</i> Iksar, the best place to power bake is the East Commonlands area. For Iksar you have 2 choices:  stay in the Cabilis area, or do a ton of faction work in Freeport or Neriak. Due to the lack of fresh fish on vendors near Cabilis, I recommend going to Freeport and getting faction or hiring a newbie/using a mule. </p>
