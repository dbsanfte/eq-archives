<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Kelethin. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ELF/HEF,WAR only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>

Young Emerald Warriors are often stationed on the forest floor beneath Kelethin to watch for these orc arsonists and stop them. Go now to the forest floor and should you catch one of these orcs slay him and bring me his orcish torch.'
