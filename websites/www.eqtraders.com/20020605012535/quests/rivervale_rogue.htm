            <h3> Slickfinger Armor Quests (Rivervale Rogues)</h3>
            <p><i>This quest allows the young halfling rogue to learn the very 
              basics of blacksmithing skill, while attaining some good starter 
              armor. It is believed that the combines are no-fail, and minimal 
              smithing increases have been seen from the creation of this armor. 
              The results are no drop, and are HFL/ROG only.</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Lendel Deeppockets' </p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'Its nice to meet you Placibo. Allow me 
              to introduce myself, I am Lendel Deeppockets master Assassin of 
              Rivervale. I am personally in charge of all [training] we have the 
              new recruits go through before they are sent out on specific missions. 
              '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what training'</p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'There are many steps that young rouges 
              must take on the road to stealth. The most important part of your 
              training is learning how to use the tools around you such as the 
              forge. From the looks of you I can tell you could use some more 
              [enchanted armor] as well so I think this would be a good learning 
              experience. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'what enchanted armor'</p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'I am pleased to hear that you are interested 
              in making your own armor Placibo. I have some instructions for you 
              so please listen closely. First, I will present you with your Dusty 
              Mail Assembly kit when you are ready. After that, simply tell me 
              what piece of Slickfinger Chainmail you [want] to craft and I will 
              give you a pattern along with a recipe for [Coifs], [Bracers], [Sleeves], 
              [Boots], [Legplates], [Gloves] and [Tunics]. The recipe I will give 
              you for specific items will need to me combined in the assembly 
              kit to create the magical material necessary. Once you have this 
              material and pattern that I gave you when you told me what item 
              you wanted to craft, put both in the nearest forge to create the 
              armor piece you asked for. Here is your Dusty Mail Assembly Kit. 
              '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to craft coif' ( had to be singular)</p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'Protecting the ole noggin is probably 
              the smartest move you will make young Placibo. Here is your pattern, 
              once you have combined 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Ruined Thorn 
              Drakeling Scales and 1 Carrot in your kit place it in a forge along 
              with this pattern to create your Slickfinger Chainmail Coif. '</p>
            <p>Completed coif is AC 5, STR 2, DEX 2, wt 1.7</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to craft bracer'</p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'Go out into the thicket and seek out 1 
              Brick of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Shattered Warbead, 1 Large Yellowjacket 
              Sternite and 1 Milk. Once you have combined them in your kit to 
              fashion the bracer material take it to a forge along with this pattern 
              to create your Slickfinger Chainmail Bracer. '</p>
            <p>Completed bracer is AC 4, STR 1, DEX 3, wt 1.0</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to craft sleeves'</p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'If sleeves are what you wish to craft 
              you will need to collect 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 3 Honeycombs, 
              2 Thorn Drakeling Scales and 2 Grapes then combine them in your 
              kit to fashion the necessary material. Take this pattern to the 
              nearest forge with that material to create your Sleeves of the Slickfinger. 
              '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to craft boots'</p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'Boots you say Placibo? Well I think I 
              heard you right but I had to check. Make sure you only wear your 
              boots in case of emergency. All other times you should showcase 
              your feet to the world with pride. You will need to combine 2 Bricks 
              of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Fire Beetle Eyes and 2 Giant Thicket Rat Skulls 
              in your kit to fashion your Slickfinger Boot Material. Once you 
              have done this take the material to a forge along with this pattern 
              to create your Slickfinger Chainmail Boots. '</p>
            <p>Completed boots are AC 5, STR 2, DEX 1, wt 2.0</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to craft legplates'</p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'I must say that pants are a good idea 
              young Placibo. Please gather 4 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Spiderling 
              Eyes, 2 Large Wood Spider Tarsus, 1 Bottle of Kalish and 1 Ruined 
              Wolf Pelt then combine them in your kit to create your Legplates 
              Material. '</p>
            <p>The completed legplates are AC 6 Str 2 Dex 2, wt 2.5</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to craft gauntlets' ( Keyword is different from 
              what he lists.)</p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'Your gauntlets may possibly be the most 
              important part of armor. One should always be sure that their hands 
              are not exposed, because taking a blow to the hand is a lot worse 
              then getting hurt anywhere else! To create the gauntlet material 
              please collect 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Bixie Wings, 1 Large 
              Snake Skin and 1 Red Wine. '</p>
            <p>The completed gauntlets are AC 5 Str 1 Dex 3, wt 1.5</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to craft tunic' ( had to be singular)</p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'I'm happy to see that your training is 
              coming along so well Placibo. I have no doubt in my mind that you 
              are ready to craft your tunic. Please collect 5 Bricks of Crude 
              Iron Ore, 1 Giant Wood Spider Femurs, 1 Embalming Dusts, 2 Dark 
              Elf Skins and 1 Giant Yellowjacket Thorax. Come back after you are 
              finished, I have a [job] for you. '</p>
            <p>The completed tunic is AC 12, STR 2, DEX 5.</p>
            <p>You say, 'what job'</p>
            <p>Lendel Deeppockets says 'Orcs is the job Placibo. Plain and simple 
              I cannot stand these homewreckers. They have moved into our land 
              and continue to storm our front gate. I seek out bone fragments 
              and fractured jawbones from these nasty Orcs. Once we have 1 of 
              each we will be able to create a weapon for you to use. ' </p>
