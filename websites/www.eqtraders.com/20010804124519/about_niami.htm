            <p><img src="pics/niami_purple.jpg" align="left"> What? Hm? Ye're 
              still curious aboot me? Och! I be jus' a simple halfling cleric 
              lass wi' a penchant frae trade skills, mischief, an' friendship, 
              in nae particular order. I hide o'er on that realm known as Tunare 
              most of th' time, an' timeshare wi' 7 other personas who help me 
              wi' me tradeskills, exploration, an' roleplay. I be th' creator 
              o' the famed <a href="haven/stories/tickled.html">Bristlebane Tickle 
              Res Technique</a> that brings folks back tae life wi' laughter (an' 
              a large feather!)</p>
            <p>Och, ye want tae know aboot the OOC human that sits behind me an' 
              tells me what tae do? She's a happily married redhead wi' a husband 
              who's almost as much of an EQ addict as she is (he's not matched 
              her 8 characters on a single server part yet, but give him time), 
              3 cats, o'er 220 days of in-game time (and over 340 cumulative levels) 
              in EQ since the final phase of beta. All else is subject tae change 
              on a whim. (As of June 2001, my two highest are level 56 and holding.)</p>
            <p>She's also MORE than a little overloaded by folks who feel they 
              need to demand, beg, harass, and/or cajole her into spending more 
              of her playtime personally attending to their questions, instead 
              of bothering to either look around the site for the answer, or post 
              something to the message boards. Please do NOT add to this load 
              by logging on and sending tell bombs (even tells from those folks 
              who create newbies on my server to &quot;thank&quot; me add up in 
              a huge hurry), or using EZBoards to send private messages asking 
              for answers to tradeskill questions. This is one of the many things 
              that should be going to the message boards, so that the first doesn't 
              interrupt playtime and the second gets answers from more than just 
              one overworked halfling.</p>
