<span class="headers">Felwithe Cleric (Sylvan Initiate) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Felwithe. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, HIE/CLE only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Armor has a green plate graphic when worn. (Please excuse the creative formatting. Information was provided by multiple sources, and I've not yet had a chance to sort it all out and make it "pretty") Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p> 
<p>
The Felwithe Cleric newbie armor quests are initiated with Terren Starwatcher (right behind the cleric guildmaster in the cleric guild in Felwithe) and the pieces are called Sylvan Initiate ___. Terren is your source for the mail assembly kit, as well as the molds needed for the various pieces of armor.
</p> 
<p>

<p>
You say, 'I am seeking guidance' 
</p> 
<p>
Terren Starwatcher says 'Tunare shall be pleased to have a new disciple amongst her Koada`Dal children. We Clerics of Tunare offer spiritual guidance to the citizens of Felwithe and when needed aid the Paladins of Tunare and the Keepers of the Art in the defense of our people and forest from those [creatures] that seek to cause us harm. Every young cleric should pursue acquiring a [suit of armor] to protect themselves when aiding those in need outside of the safety of Felwithes walls.'

You say, 'I want a suit of armor' 
</p> 
<p>
Terren Starwatcher says 'You will need this Mail Assembly Kit to craft your Sylvan Initiate Armor. The materials required for the armor vary according to which piece you desire to craft.

Do you desire to craft [Sylvan Initiate Gauntlets], [Sylvan Initiate Boots], an [Sylvan Initiate Bracer], an [Sylvan Initiate Helm], [Sylvan Initiate Greaves], [Sylvan Initiate Vambraces], or an [Sylvan Initiate Breastplate]?'

<p>
You say, 'I need further guidance' 
</p> 
<p>
Terren Starwatcher says 'If you are ready to put your life on the line for the citizens of our homeland than hear my words. The Crushbone Clan of Orcs are evil and strong adversaries of we Koada`Dal. Recently an orc scout assaulted a merchant from our city carrying a valuable amulet from the Fier`Dal city of Kelethin. Our seers have divined the name of the orc that is in possession of the amulet, Gurleg Bribgok. Find this despicable creature and return the amulet to me so that I may return it to its proper owner.' 
</p> 
<p>
Kill Gurleg Bribgok in Greater Faydark at loc 1987, 2304. He spawns with the Orc Arsonist. 
</p> 
<p>
Terren Starwatcher gives a you a Rusty Sylvan Morning Star for turning in the amulet from Gurleg Bribgok. You also receive minor experience and positive faction with: Clerics of Tunare, King Tearis Thex, and Anti-Mage. 
</p> 
<p>
Terren Starwatcher says 'You have done well young Ansley. If you continue to show such devotion to your people and your faith then perhaps one day you will serve in the chambers of King Tearis Thex himself. Take this Rusty Sylvan Morning Star and scrape the rust from it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may take several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done bring me the Refined Sylvan Morning Star, a Pristine Drakeling Scales, and an Arborean Amber.'
