            <p><b class="headers">Niami's Cooking Class (Tunare)</b></p>
            <p>A wee halfling lady stands atop an overturned vegetable crate, 
              lecturing to a small cooking class. She wields a large wooden meat 
              tenderizer as if it was a weapon, occasionally waving it at a student 
              for emphasis.</p>
            <p>"So, ye want tae be cooks, lads and lasses? Cooks are the unsung 
              heroes of any great war, as without food and drink, those brawny 
              warriors cannae keep up their fighting strength." She smiles impishly 
              up at a large barbarian warrior as she says this, her brown eyes 
              glinting with merriment.</p>
            <p>"What do ye need to bake? For the simplest of recipes, nothing 
              more than body parts off a couple critters that are found in many 
              low-level hunting areas ... and an oven. (Most every city has one 
              or two ovens, if not more.) For more complex things, you'll actually 
              need to buy some added ingredients, invest in some cookbooks, and 
              mayhaps some cooking pans."</p>
            <p>"I warn ye now, lads and lasses, that cooking is nae a fast road 
              to riches." She waggles the meat tenderizer at a daydreaming student. 
              "Rather, your rewards come in more intangible ways. Ye can feed 
              yourselves, your family, and your friends off items that, without 
              your expert touch, would be totally inedible. Ye can also add some 
              extra flair to events such as weddings and the like with some sweet 
              treat they'd be unable tae find in any shop ... and guarantee it's 
              freshness as well. Most importantly, ye can rescue folks from the 
              dire tedium of eating rations day in and day out." She shudders 
              expressively at this last.</p>
            <p>"Until I can be certain if certain foods are better for ye, and 
              therefore last longer, than other foods, I cannae give ye proper 
              recommendations on marketing. Such wonders as 'edible goo' sell 
              for less to a normal (NPC) merchant than that same merchant would 
              pay for the individual components. Other foods, such as 'fish rolls', 
              can be sold to that merchant for more than ye'd pay for a normal 
              food ration, and as such, ye can make a small profit. I've nae found 
              the rhyme nor reason tae it ... yet."</p>
            <p>"Now, ye bought yourself a cookbook, did ye lass?" Niami peers 
              quizzically at a young elf holding a large cookbook in her arms. 
              "I hope ye study that well and take careful notes on it. Once ye've 
              scribed the recipes contained in it (4 recipes - 8 pages - per book, 
              at the current time), ye no longer need the book. Ye can locker 
              it, sell it back, or whatever ye wish with it."</p>
            <p>"Mind ye, there are a LOT of recipe books available, and ye'll 
              rapidly eat away at your savings ... no pun intended ... if ye buy 
              all the books yuirself. Find a couple other would-be cooks and share 
              the expense of the books, and the recipes! But if ye're not one 
              of those large folks (ogres, trolls) who eat other (player) races 
              for dinner, then stay away from any recipe books written by that 
              'Ghumin' feller." Niami mutters something nearly inaudible and incomprehensible 
              about programmers and Hot & Spicy Toelings and then continues the 
              lesson. (Note also that some of the recipes contained in the books 
              have errors. Attempts have been made to make sure that this site's 
              recipes page contains working recipes, not just reprints of the 
              recipe book information.)</p>
            <p>"The main things to remember with the recipes are the ingredients 
              and the cooking implements needed. When in doubt, use an oven, but 
              if it says to do it over a roasting spit, mayhaps ye'll hae better 
              luck than I at finding one."</p>
            <p>"Ye <b>do</b> know how tae use an oven, don't ye?" One timid student 
              shakes their head and blushes. "Good grief, were ye orphaned at 
              birth?" At the small affirmative nod, the tiny halfling turns on 
              the motherly charm. "Ye poor lad, I be sorry. Forgive me runaway 
              tongue. Ye'll see brick ovens, with windows in the front door of 
              them and flames dancing inside of them hiding in odd spots in town. 
              But for the untrained, it is sometimes hard tae tell an oven from 
              a kiln . When in doubt, open it (stand in front of it and left click 
              on the flames) and inhale. Ye'll be able tae tell verra quickly 
              if it be used for baking food, clay or metals. Then ye just put 
              the proper ingredients inside, pray tae your favorite deity, and 
              bake. (press that 'combine' button.) Ye'll also find spits being 
              sold in various spots, an' they can be used tae bake as well. Think 
              of them as yuir own personal portable oven."</p>
            <p>"Oh, and make sure that when they ask for a flask of water that 
              ye use an actual flask of water, not one of those magical globes 
              of water."</p>
            <p>"That's all for this class, but feel free tae contact me if ye 
              need extra tutoring."</p>
            <p>She notes one student lagging behind. "What, ye want me tae give 
              ye all the recipes, too? Pshaw, lad, any good cook can tell ye that 
              experimentation is necessary. But I'll take pity on ye this much 
              -- yuir early attempts should be something simple. Why don't ye 
              try combining a fire beetle eye and a rat ear in that oven of yuirs 
              and see what comes of it?" </p>
