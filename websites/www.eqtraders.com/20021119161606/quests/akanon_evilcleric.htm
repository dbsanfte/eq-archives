            <h3> Akanon Evil Cleric (Bertoxx) Armor Quest<br>
            </h3>
            <p> 
            <p> 
            <p>This is one of many youngling armor quests based out of Ak'Anon. 
              It is meant specifically for young gnome clerics that worship Bertoxx. 
              <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials 
              often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for 
              a second one</i> </p>
            <p>Similar structure to the other evil melee class-specific quests 
              - you get a parchment from the quest giver (Derthix Gibblix) which 
              you have to give to a secondary NPC (Glerbella Gibblix), who will 
              then give you a kit (a Mail Assembly Kit, exactly the same one as 
              the evil warrior, rogue and shadowknight kits, and LORE so you can't 
              get one of each). Glerbella will then tell you the recipe for each 
              item and give you a mold (Crude [xxx] Mold) when prompted. These 
              molds appear to be exactly the same items as the evil warrior/shadowknight 
              Crude [xxx] Molds (i.e. they're interchangeable). The primary quest 
              giver gives out the class-specific weapon quest.</p>
            <p>Your Location is 2066.76, -453.64, -182.06, in Ak'Anon.<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'Hail, Derthix Gibblix'<br>
              Derthix Gibblix says 'Greetings Genumkin. It is my duty to train 
              young gnomes that have been called to they ways of Bertoxxulous, 
              the Plague Bringer, and wish to [serve as a cleric] of the Dark 
              Reflection. The faithful of the Plague Bringer are gifted with the 
              sight of the Dark Reflection. The ability to recognize the importance 
              of the powerful forces of disease and decay, and the role they play 
              in the cycles of deterioration and renewal, death and life, destruction 
              and creation.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'i serve as a cleric'<br>
              Derthix Gibblix says 'We have been blessed by Bertoxxulous with 
              the vision of the Dark Reflection. We are the prophet and protectors 
              of all who serve the Plague Bringer and have devoted our lives to 
              spreading disease and decay for the glory of Bertoxxulous and the 
              balances that must be maintained. Take this parchment to Glerbella 
              Gibblix, she will assist you with the construction of a suit of 
              armor to aid in protecting you from the weapons of those who would 
              see us destroyed. When you have been properly outfitted return to 
              me for your [next task].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what next task?'<br>
              Derthix Gibblix says 'We faithful of Bertoxxulous are misunderstood 
              even by the majority of the gnomes of Ak'Akanon. The Eldrich Collective 
              and the Deep Muses would have us chased from the Mines of Malfunction 
              and exiled from these lands. They are not gifted with the vision 
              of the Dark Reflection and thus are blind to the necessity of our 
              actions. In the Steamfont Mountains you will find a Cleric of the 
              Deep Muses, Vyntok Bonkle. Vyntok has been aiding others of our 
              enemies in their mission to eliminate the Dark Reflection from Ak'Anon. 
              Find Vyntok and slay him. When you have accomplished this task return 
              to me with Vyntok's Mace.'</p>

            <p>Glerbella Gibblix is found with Mimtia Zethkog, Rebbie Romblerum 
              and Windlebeck Tobokog, in the tunnels at 2159.36, -592.41, -182.06.
