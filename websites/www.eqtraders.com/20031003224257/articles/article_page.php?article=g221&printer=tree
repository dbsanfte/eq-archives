<p>
Tinkering is the hobby of Gnomes in Ak&#8217;Anon and beyond. Being over inquisitive and utterly reckless at times, Gnomes take great pleasure in &#8220;discovering&#8221; how things work. While many contraptions are merely fantastical, some are quite functional. Just beware of loaning a gnome anything, because you never quite know what they will decide to use in their next greatest invention.
