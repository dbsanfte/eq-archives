There are many expenses that come with running this site, and as the popularity of EQTC grows, so do the costs. It is no longer feasible for us to pay for the costs by ourselves, so we're asking for the help of those in the community who are able to contribute. <i>(FYI: All of the first two years      including domain name registrations, EZBoard fees, software and hardware costs were covered by the DenMother and House Ogre.</p>
<p>We really <i><b>DO</b></i> want to keep the boards ad-free, and help reward our overworked sneior staff, but we cannot do it without the support of the community.</p>
<p>Currently, the one method for donating to the site is via <b>Paypal</b> - donations go directly to the DemMother to help cover the hosting costs for the boards and the site, software/hardware expenses, as well as small stipends for our two senior staff, Verdandi and Krazick. If there's any left over (there usually isn't),it will go to cover things for Niami like painkillers, chocolate, massage therapy, ... and hair color to hide the grey hairs that the site has caused ... consider it her 'pay' for the amount of work put into this site over the last several years. ;)</p>
