            <h3>Silent Fist Armor - Qeynos Monk Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several new armor quests for young humans that 
              originates in Qeynos. All pieces of this set should be lore (other 
              than the bracer) no drop, HUM/MNK only. Please note that while the 
              bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your 
              first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>

              Once you have found and mastered it, your fists will be deadlier 
              than any blade. I am also currently in charge of training our new 
              recruits. If you are new monk of the Silent Fist I have some [tests] 
              for you to complete.'</p>

              Fist. You will place a number of items in this kit to created infused 
              armor materials. These magical armor materials can then be combined 
              in a loom with a magical pattern to create different Armor of the 
              Silent Fist pieces. When you are ready to collect the items for
