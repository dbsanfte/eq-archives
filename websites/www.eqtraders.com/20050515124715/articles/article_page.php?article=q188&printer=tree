<!-Shestar's Scaled Coif-></p>

<p>You may also gain a bit of skill in smithing while you're at it.</p>

<p>You start by talking to Trooper Shestar in East Cabilis.  He may be near the zone to Field of Bone, although we need confirmation of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Trooper Shestar'</p>
<p>Trooper Shestar says 'My father was a great blacksmith. He taught me how to make great items such as the [Shestar scaled coif]. Alas, smithing was not my rebirth, but rather the life of a warrior.'</p>
<p>You say, 'What is the Shestar Scaled Coif?'</p>
<p>Trooper Shestar says 'The Shestar scaled coif was a light coif my father would fashion out of loose scales from the scaled wolves. I have some scales on me and if you bring me three loose scales I will have enough to create the coif for you, but I require you to also pay a fee of five gold.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give him 5 gold pieces and 3 Loose Scale<!-Loose Scale->.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trooper Shestar says 'I asked for three loose wolf scales and my fee of five gold.'</p>
<p>Trooper Shestar says 'I asked for three loose wolf scales and my fee of five gold.'</p>
<p>Trooper Shestar says 'I asked for three loose wolf scales and my fee of five gold.'</p>
<p>Trooper Shestar quickly inserts the scales into a half finished coif and hands you the coif. 'I am afraid that is not enough and I cannot possibly complete the task while on duty. You must go and find an additional three scaled wolf scales and take them, along with the unfinished coif, to the nearest forge and complete the smithing yourself. I hope you are a blacksmith.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now you have your:</p>

<!-Shestar's Unfinished Coif-></p>

<p>Combine it in a forge with three more loose scales.  This is trivial at 23, so you may have some failures if you do not have much smithing skill.  However, your smithing may improve while you make the attempts.  You get the unfinished coif back if you fail, so that you'll just need to gather more scales.</p>
