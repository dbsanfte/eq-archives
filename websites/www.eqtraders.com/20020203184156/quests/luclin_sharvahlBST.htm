            <h3> Vah Shir Beastlord Claw Quests</h3>
            <p><i>As with many quests in Shar Vahl, this requires that you've 
              already completed the <a href="citizenship.htm">Vah Shir Citizenship 
              quest</a>. </i></p>
            <p><i>This quest results in progressive upgrades to VAH BST-only claws 
              for both hands that are hand to hand weapons, as well as several 
              cloak upgrades. It also requires that you work quite a bit on your 
              tailoring.</i></p>
            <p><i><font color="#400000">This page is under construction. Please 
              excuse any errors and omissions, as information needs to be pulled 
              from multiple sources.</font></i></p>
            <p><b>Phase 1.</b> Give your personal acrylia slate to Animist Poren 
              (you will get it back) to prove your citizenship. Animist Poren 
              will then hand you a small 4-slot stitching kit and a pattern. The 
              kit is no drop, and works just like a sewing kit. Kill xakra silkworms 
              or lesser shades to collect shadeline silks (worms in the pit in 
              Shar Vahl, and in Shadeweavers Thicket, shades are in Shadeweavers 
              Thicket). Combine 2 shadeling silks (unstacked, of course) in your 
              kit to make a shade silk thread. Then combine 2 shade silk threads 
              to make bandage. When you have 3 bandages, combine them and the 
              pattern, in your kit. Failure will return the pattern. Success will 
              return you a pair of gloves (Khati Shah handwraps, AC 2, lore, no 
              drop, trivial &gt;26) and some scraps. Bring the scraps back to 
              Animist Poren for the next phase of the quest. Threads are no-fail 
              trivial at 15, bandages are trivial at skill 21. </p>
            <p><b>Phase 2</b>-Your first set of claws. Chase down young rockhoppers 
              in the pit surrounding Shar Vahl for their no drop claws. Obtain 
              two claws from the beasts, and place them in your stitching kit 
              along with forged fasteners. </p>
            <p>Forged fasteners are obtained by asking Kagazz outside of the Armory 
              "What forged fasteners". He will give you a 4-slot bag, and ask 
              you to fill it with Scorpion Legs (his wife makes jewelry out of 
              them). (Remember to have a container slot free before getting the 
              bag, and remember to hit &quot;combine&quot; on the bag after you 
              fill it.) In return for the filled bag, he gives you the Forged 
              Fasteners. Scorpion Legs are a no drop item off the scorpions in 
              the Pit.</p>
            <p>Combine the forged fasteners with the rockhopper claws mentioned 
              above to create your first set of claws. (damage 5, delay 35). Trivial 
              is reported to be &gt;27.</p>
            <p><b>Phase 3.</b> Hand your newly-made claws and the cloak that you 
              received from the citizenhip quest to Animist Poren. He will give 
              you a your new Cloak of the Khati Shah Recruit (complete with a 
              1% modifier to tailoring), your upgraded claws and a seal. (claws 
              are now damage 6, delay 35). Bring the seal to Mahron Sood (diagonally 
              across from the bank in Shar Vahl). He will give you a map to bring 
              to Kery Miann (upstairs, at loc 294, -348 in Shar Vahl).</p>
            <p>Give the map to Kery and she will hand you a small stone blade 
              (no drop). Combine the blade and a high quality rockhopper hide 
              in your stitching kit to make some leather straps (no drop). Trivial 
              is &gt;41 for this portion. Give two leather straps, and your claws 
              to Kery, and you will be given new claws, and a note for Rittuh 
              Purrik. (Claws are damage 7, delay 28, STR 1, DEX 1)</p>
            <p><b>Phase 4.</b> Give the note to Rittuh, found in the Vah Shir 
              outpost in Hollowshade Moor, and she will give you a no drop pack 
              (remember to have a container slot free!), and will ask you to fill 
              it with 6 no drop hopper tails from the rockhoppers in that zone. 
              Combine the 6 tails and give the result to Rittuh to receive an 
              &quot;Exaggerated Report&quot; to bring back to Kery.</p>
            <p>Hand the report to Kery and she will give you a carved wooden box 
              (again, have a container spot free!). Zone in to Pauldal Caverns 
              from Hollowshade Moor and kill muckdiggers in that first tunnel 
              until a glowing muckdigger spawns (if there's not one up already). 
              Kill the glowing muckdigger and loot the glowing heart stone (lore, 
              no drop). Combine the stone and your Cloak of the Khati Shah Recruit 
              in the carved wooden box, and bring the result back to Kery.</p>
            <p>Kery will then present you with your Cloak of the Khati Shah Apprentice 
              (AC 6, STR 1, STA 2, HP 5, 2% tailoring modifier, lore, no drop, 
              VAH, BST)</p>
            <p><b>Phase 5.</b> Kery tells you to bring your claws to Kaam Rahiir 
              in the libraries near the palace, to learn how to upgrade them. 
              Don't forget to have a container slot free again! Hand him your 
              claws for inspection, and he will return them, and a bag. He will 
              ask you to collect 2 molars off the sonic wolflings in Hollowshade 
              Moor. Combine them in the bag, and bring the result back to Kaam 
              Rahiir, who will give you claw mounts and send you to Qua and Jimis:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Kaam Rahiir says 'Excellent, the spirits have returned you to 
                me with your tail intact! The foe that you encountered was a young 
                creature. Their elders are much less likely to allow your passage. 
                The packs of wolves that roam the moor have proven to be quite 
                a problem for our scouts. I will assist you in learning a method 
                that will allow you to build and assist others in building a weapon 
                that bites at the very spirit of those beasts. Take these claw 
                mounts and use them in conjunction with the tomes that Qua sells. 
                You'll need stretching dowels to treat the lashings. Jhimis usually 
                keeps them behind the counter of his shop. Get a set from him 
                and read through those tomes. Return to me with your new claws 
                and your apprentice's cloak when you have completed the task. 
              </p>
              <p>Your faction standing with Khati Sha got better. </p>
              <p>You gain experience!! </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>At this point, you begin the quest for the Sonic Wolf Bane Claws 
              <i>(to be detailed elsewhere and linked in)</i>, that requires the 
              cooperation of every class of Vah Shir.</p>
