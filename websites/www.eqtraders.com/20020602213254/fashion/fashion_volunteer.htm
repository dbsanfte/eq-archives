            <P CLASS=headers><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Before 
              you volunteer to &quot;help&quot; with this section</i></b></FONT></P>
            <p>For those of you who've been following this section for a while, 
              you know we've been through a LOT of volunteer fashion editors, 
              but that little in this section has changed (it's been made tons 
              worse by the change in graphics due to Luclin models). A lot of 
              folks have sent in images, only to have them <i>not</i> show up 
              here, even after waiting a couple of months. Unfortunately, I can't 
              handle the load of this section myself, and any volunteers that 
              I get are, well, volunteers. I can't force them to put things up. 
              While I apologize for the lack of updates, I'm likely <i>far</i> 
              more frustrated about it than you folks are, as I invest a <i>lot</i> 
              of time into getting new fashion editors settled in, getting them 
              access, forwarding them whatever backlogged images I've saved, playing 
              mail-tag with questions and answers, etc ... time I could have spent 
              working on the site. I understand about real life getting in the 
              way, really I do, but as sometimes months go by with nothing happening, 
              it makes me want to cry, scream, and/or just give up and delete 
              this section of the site.</p>
            <p>Please, please, please, don't volunteer unless you are <i>positive</i> 
              you are willing and able to commit <i>several</i> hours per week, 
              a lot of mailbox space, and some solid knowledge of image editing 
              and HTML coding, to the effort. Otherwise, you're wasting my time, 
              your time, <i>and</i> the time of all the folks who go to the trouble 
              of getting screenshots of their hard-made armor. (Additionally, 
              after some of the files I've seen in <i>my</i> mailbox recently 
              that claim to be images for the site, you'd better have a very good 
              virus program in place, and know how to spot suspicious files.)</p>
            <p>If you're <i>still</i> interested in helping, feel free to send 
              me an EZBoard private message and make SURE you include an email 
              address in the message ... then expect it to take at least several 
              days for me to respond, if it doesn't get totally lost in the flood 
              of spam that's hit there lately. :(</p>
