      <span class="headers">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Dark Elf Quests</span>
<p>
<p>This is the quest for dark elves to acquire the books necessary to make the cultural armor that is available with the Dragons of Norrath expansion.  For more information on the general details, see the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q182&menustr=120030000000">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Armor Quest Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You start in Neriak Commons, with Dosan Vis`Moor, at 88, -888, -38, inside the Blue Flame (coming from Neriak Foreign Quarter, once through the city wall it is the leftmost shop on the left). The books do not need to be acquired in any particular order, as Dosan will give you all of the quests at once if you ask.</p>

<p><h4>Ancestral Book Quest:</h4></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Dosan Vis`moor'</p>
<p>Dosan Vis`moor says 'So Lilandraa, the harsh light of the surface has finally driven you back to Neriak? Or have you returned to replace that pitiful [armor] that hangs from your sunburned frame?'</p>
<p>You say, 'what armor?'</p>
<p>Dosan Vis`moor says 'That's what I thought. Your current set looks like it fell from one of Innoruuk's zombies. If you are interested in some more eloquent designs, I have acquired some armor patterns designed by one of Lanys T'Vyl personal artisans. Never mind how I acquired them, what's important is that they can be yours, for a [price], of course. Then again, if you're interested in something even more [valuable] I might be able to help you there as well.'</p>
<p>You say, 'what price?'</p>
<p>Dosan Vis`moor says 'Well, the patterns are all in my head. If I had the actual pattern book, I'd be a hunted elf right now. So if you bring me the ingredients to make two pattern books, I'll give the extra one to you. I will need a raw-hide belt for the covers, a low quality cat pelt for the pages, a cutthroat insignia ring for the book clasps, and a snake venom sac to grind down and make a salve which will protect and preserve the finished products. I have heard these items can be found in the Oasis of Marr. South Ro and the Commonlands. Bring them to me and the extra book shall be yours.'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quest Details: Collect and hand in a Raw-hide Belt, Cutthroat Insignia Ring, a Low Quality Cat Pelt, and A Snake Venom Sac.</p>

<p><i>Tips:</i> Cutthroat insignia rings drop off of Dervish Cutthroats in West Commonlands, North and South Ro, and Oasis.  Raw-hide belts drops off of various orcs in the same zones plus East Commonlands.  Snake venom sacs are from cistern asps in North and South Ro and Oasis.  Low quality cat pelt are from a variety of places, including plains cats and pumas in East and West Commonlands, North and South Ro, and Oasis.  If you get a medium or high quality cat pelt first, it can be turned into a low quality pelt by combining with a skinning knife in a tailoring kit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dosan Vis`moor says 'Well done, Lilandraa. Here's your copy of the pattern book. Now let's keep this little arrangement between us. If Lanys gets wind that we have these designs, we'll find ourselves on the wrong end of a few too many swords. If you require some [valuable] patterns for those armor designs, I can provide them. . . for a price, of course. Otherwise, let's just forget we ever met. Do we have an understanding?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Receive: Ancestral Dark Elven Armor<br />
<i>It reads:</i>
These armor patterns are stolen copies of the designs made for Lanys T'Vyls elite guards. It is unclear how the artisans originally came to these designs, but it is obvious that they were dervived from many ancient sources. Some the patterns echo early dark elf armor crafting techniques which have been refitted with modern materials and flair. The designs are sleek and light-weight and tailored specifically to support the dark elf's lithe frame. Although it is unclear how Dosan Vis moor was able to steal these designs, his methods likely involved reckless treachery and prehaps more than a few shived ribs. It would be wise to keep your possession of these patterns a secret. The patterns in this book can be copied many times, but eventually they will wear out and you can tell that if you use the patterns enough you will need to replace the book.
To create pattern for tailoring armor templates based on these patterns you will need this book, a large bottle of ink, a roll of plain parchment, a quill and a compacted backpack to hold the patterns you will make. You'll also need a book binding to do the work. If you wish to use the patterns to make molds you'll need a kiln to work in as well as a high quality firing sheet, sculpting tools, a huge block of clay and a compacted backpack to hold the molds when you are done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'valuable?'</p>
<p>Dosan Vis`moor says 'It's my understanding that this armor can be adorned with symbols to increase its potential. If you'd be willing to do me a few favors, I might consider parting with the plans for these symbols. The more dangerous my errand, the more rewarding the symbol shall be. I've got tasks that need your attention in [Najena], [Solusek's Eye], [Sebilis], and the [valley] beyond the lavastorm mountains.'</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Journeyman's Book Task: Relics of Najena</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Najena'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Relics of Najena'.</p>
<p>Dosan Vis`moor says 'Some of our brethren have been less than hospitable to associates of mine. I wish for you to go and teach them a lesson. Travel to Najena and slay twenty ogre guards. Return to me with their whore's bane as proof of your kills'</p>
</blockquote>

<i>It reads:</i><br />
Many sets of dark elf armor can be adorned with power glyphs derived from a number of methods -- enchantments of the drained blood of vanquished foes, dark prayers of Innoruuk, or even etched designs made of woven spider web. This book delves into many unspeakable rituals and depicts the methodology behind creating such rare and precious glyphs. It would be wise to keep your possession of this book a secret as there are many dark elves that would kill for the secrets contained within. This book contains the most elementary of dark elf armor glyphs. These pages are dry and dusty to the touch and the red ink seems to pulse with the beating of your heart. Despite their apparentally fragile nature, you know that you will be able to use these patterns several times before they will need to be replaced. To create pattern for tailoring armor templates based on these patterns you will need this book, a large bottle of ink, a roll of plain parchment, a quill and a compacted backpack to hold the patterns you will make. You'll also need a book binding to do the work.</p>

<h4>Expert's Book Task: Looking into Solusek's Eye</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Solusek's Eye'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Looking into Solusek's Eye'.</p>
<p>Dosan Vis`moor says 'I'm running low on some resources. Carry your pathetic hide over to Solusek's Eye and slay some gnomes. Return with some gnomish meat. My war dogs are hungry and I'm training them to attack gnomes on sight. I hate those detestable creatures.'</p>

Only they carry the rarest strain.'</p>
