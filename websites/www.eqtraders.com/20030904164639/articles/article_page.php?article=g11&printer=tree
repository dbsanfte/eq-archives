<p class="headers">Frequently Asked Questions</p>
<p>
<b>Who can make potions with alchemy?</b>
</p>
<blockquote> <p>Alchemy is a shaman-only skill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>When can I start working on alchemy? When <i><u>should</u></i> I start working on alchemy?</b>
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
You can start once your shaman is level 25. However, many shaman wait until they are level 29. See our guide on <a
href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g6&menustr=040010000000">Beginning Alchemy</a> for more information.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Is there a skill cap on alchemy? What is the formula?</b>
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Yes. The formula for alchemy skill cap is:
</p>
<blockquote> <p>(Your level <i>minus</i> 24) times 5.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note, however, that alchemy currently cannot go over 200.  See our guide on <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g6&menustr=040010000000">Beginning Alchemy</a> for more information.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>What do the individual herbs cost?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>See our <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/menutest.php?menustr=070010000000">Herb Prices</a> guide for detailed prices on herbs throughout Norrath.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Where can I buy herbs?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>See our <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/sources/source_trade_page.php?st=Alchemy&menustr=110020000000">Herb Vendors</a> guide for a complete list of known herb vendors throughout Norrath.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Where do I find the recipes for known alchemy potions?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>See our <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=31&rsa=Alchemy&sb=item&sub=potion&menustr=080010010000">Recipes and Effects</a> page for detailed recipes and effects.</p> </blockquote>

<p><b>What are the best potions to make in order to increase my alchemy skill?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>Try to find a balance between potion trivial and herb component cost, taking into consideration those potions that sell best to players (Blood of Wolf, Invisibility to Undead and Shrink, etc.) </p>

<p>Also, see our guide on <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g8&menustr=040010000000">Beginning Alchemy</a> for more information.</p> </blockquote>

<p><b>What attribute has the greatest effect on alchemy success rates and skill increases?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>Wisdom. </p>
<p>See our guide on <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g8&menustr=040010000000">Beginning Alchemy</a> for more information.</p> </blockquote>

<p><b>Where do I find the various dropped ingredients used for certain alchemy potions?</b></p>
<blockquote> <p> For the most part, you can figure out what drops a given item by the name of the item itself.  Werewolves drop werewolf pelts and fire giants drop fire giant toes.  Some of them are not as obvious, however, or are downright misleading.  Vampire dust is only dropped by vampires in the Plane of Hate. Consult our guide to <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g16&menustr=040010000000">Dropped Ingredient Locations</a> if you're not sure. If you cannot yet kill that kind of creature or cannot easily get to them, try checking vendors near those creatures to see if players have sold some off. </p> </blockquote>

<p><b>What the recipe for regular Invisibility potions?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>There is currently no known recipe for making regular Invisibility potions in alchemy. However, they and other non-alchemy potions can be vendor purchased in virtually every city throughout Norrath at a potion merchant.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>What is the best price to charge players for potions?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>Market prices for one charge of a potion are typically twice the cost of the component herbs for one attempt.  Some shamans give a discount for customers buying 5 or 10 charged potions, or for potions that are hard to sell.  Others increase the price if they are have plenty of customers or if they are providing some extra service, such as selling the potions in a remote location. </p>

<p>See our guide to <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/menutest.php?menustr=070010000000">Alchemy Prices</a> for more information. </p> </blockquote>

<p><b>How do I make five-shot and ten-shot potions?</b></p>

<blockquote> 
<p>
Combine 5 or 10 of the same type of alchemy potion in a <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1824&menustr=">Bearskin Potion Bag</a> or a <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8271&menustr=">Foldable Bearskin Potion Bag</a> (which is obtained from a <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8270&menustr=">Folded Bearskin Potion Bag</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>How do I make extracts and dyes for Fine Steel Plate armor?</b></p>

<blockquote> <p>See the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=30&rsa=Alchemy&sb=item&sub=dye&menustr=080010020000">Dye Recipes</a></p></blockquote>

<p><b>What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?</b></p>

<blockquote><p>An intriguing and age-old question that is highly dependent upon whether one is speaking of the African swallow, or the European swallow. See Monty Python's "The Search for the Holy Grail" for further details.</p></blockquote></p><p>
