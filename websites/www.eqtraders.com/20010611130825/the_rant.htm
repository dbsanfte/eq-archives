              <b><font color="#FF0000">Tunare residents!! Read this, and read 
              this well. If you think the following does NOT apply to you, you 
              WILL find yourself on /ignore by the DenMother. Period. This is 
              BEYOND unacceptable, and I will say this once here, and once on 
              the message board. ENOUGH!!!! </font></b></p>
            <p>I have received tells from a DOZEN different people (and climbing) 
              while in the middle of a Hate raid tonight, asking about black panther 
              armor. This does NOT count the OTHER dozen folks who have sent tells 
              asking &quot;what does this pelt do?&quot;, &quot;what are the stats 
              for this?&quot;, &quot;what's the recipe for that?&quot;. If you 
              think I am exaggerating, ask my husband. Half the time I cannot 
              see ANYTHING but tell text on my screen, and it's to the point I 
              came VERY close to flat-out deleting Niami for the second time in 
              a week.</p>
            <p>IF AND ONLY IF you bring EVERY single solitary item needed to make 
              a tailoring attempt on ANY of the velious stuff, will I hit the 
              bloody combine button for you, and then, ONLY if you can collect 
              it all without tell bombing me asking for the recipes, the spawn 
              locations, etc. PERIOD. I WILL NOT SELL THIS ARMOR! PERIOD!! I WILL 
              NOT HAVE YOU BOTHER MY GUILD OR MY ALTS HANDING OVER BITS AND PIECES 
              OF PELTS AND SUCH AND EXPECT ME TO MAKE STUFF FOR YOU. HOLD THE 
              DANG STUFF UNTIL YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND LET ME PLAY!!!!!!</p>
            <p>AND YES, THE FAIL RATE IS UNGODLY HIGH! IF YOU BRING ME ENOUGH 
              OF EVERYTHING FOR 10 ATTEMPTS, YOU MAY GET NO PIECES, YOU MAY GET 
              1 OR TWO. DO NOT TELL BOMB ME OVER AND OVER ASKING ME THE FAIL RATE, 
              THE TRIVIAL, MY SKILL, ETC. READ THE BOARDS. SEE EXACTLY HOW DIFFICULT 
              THIS STUFF IS. DO NOT BRUSH IT OFF AS EXAGGERATION.</p>
            <p>PERIOD. THERE IS NO DISCUSSION ON THIS. THIS IS RUINING THE GAME, 
              TRADESKILLS AND THIS WEBSITE FOR ME, AND I AM THROUGH BEING NICE 
              ABOUT SELFISH FOLKS NOT RESPECTING MY RIGHT TO HAVE FUN. I know 
              most of you don't even realize how much stress you're putting me 
              under, but please, MANY folks want this armor, and frankly, I don't 
              want to spend all my time hunting down parts and making it for folks. 
              You may think it's just a &quot;quick&quot; tell that won't bother 
              me, but word has gotten around, and everyone and their cousin has 
              the same idea of &quot;just&quot; asking the DenMother.</p>
            <p>Find your local tailor, fund them to get <i>their</i> skill up. 
              Spend a couple days collecting all the parts needed for an attempt 
              or two. Put yourself in my oversized halfling shoes ... and whatever 
              you do, don't join the smug folks who jokingly say &quot;that's 
              the price you pay for being famous&quot; ... just don't go there. 
              It isn't funny anymore.</p>
            <p>For the rest of you folks who have been flooding my mailbox and 
              the message boards with your show of support ... thank you ... for 
              those of you Tunare folks who have wisely contacted me in email 
              first before asking me to help you, and those who find me free and 
              hand me sewing kit, components and all ... thank you. I'm not giving 
              up on the site or EQ yet, but I am going ballistic for a while.</p>
