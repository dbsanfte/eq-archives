            <h3> Myrron's Beginner's Guide to Smithing <i>(Post-June 5th Patch) 
              </i></h3>
            <p>Since June 5th, 2002, pretty much all smithing trivials were altered 
              in some way. As a result, this guide takes the new trivial levels 
              into consideration, as well as cost of supplies. Each of the steps 
              outlined below are suggested based on cheap cost and readily-<br>
              available supplies. These steps are designed for the beginner in 
              smithing, who wishes to increase his or her skill at a relatively 
              cheap cost to themselves. This guide suggests steps to a smithing 
              skill of about 110. </p>
            <p>First things first: increase your stats! If you are a caster, raise 
              your intelligence/wisdom (whichever is your primary stat) as high 
              as you can before attempting to smith. Melees can do this, but strength 
              may substitute for wisdom/intelligence. So get either wisdom, intelligence, 
              or strength as high as you possibly can. There is no need to max 
              out all three stats; just pick one that should be easy to increase. 
              Recall that spells may also alter stats, not just armor and weapons. 
            </p>
            <p>Why do you want to increase your stats? As your stat increases, 
              so does your chance of getting a skill-up in smithing. This is not 
              to be confused with the actual creation of a new item. Whether or 
              not you succeed when trying to create a new item depends on your 
              smithing skill level. If your smithing skill is 25, you have the 
              exact same chance of creating a steel boning whether your intelligence 
              is 120 or 180. However, with a 180 intelligence, you will be more 
              likely to improve your smithing skill to 26. </p>
            <p>The following is what I have done in order to master smithing. 
              My charisma (affects prices from merchants) has fluctuated between 
              75 and 92, and my wisdom (primary stat) fluctuated between the 120's 
              and 160's. Most merchants I dealt with were indifferent to me. </p>
            <p>(Begin Steps in Guide)</p>
            <p>Sharpen rusty weapons (sharpening stone + rusty weapon) until the 
              mid-20's. The first rusty weapons begin to trivial at a skill level 
              of 18, but you can take your skill up to 24 with a rusty longsword. 
              Sharpening stones may be bought in a few locations, including Erudin, 
              Ak'Anon, Felwithe, and Freeport to name a few. You can sharpen some 
              rusty weapons all the way to 26, but I think it's ok to move on 
              to steel boning at 24. You can sell tarnished weapons and recover 
              the cheap cost of the sharpening stones; you find enough rusty weapons 
              at low levels off of enemies so you shouldn't have to buy any. Alternately 
              you can make metal bits (2 small pieces of ore, flask of water) 
              to 18, but if so, you will need to buy the ore. Rusty weapons are 
              free.</p>
            <p>Create steel boning (small brick ore, file, flask of water) until 
              37. If you don't see a file for sale, you can make one (1 metal 
              bits, file mold, flask of water; trivial at 21). If you are also 
              interested in tailoring, you may alternately make studs (3 metal 
              bits, file, flask of water) until 35 and then boning until 37. However, 
              I tried this, and for whatever reason I got skill-ups with almost 
              every boning attempt, while studs took more time to prepare and 
              gave me fewer skill-ups. Steel boning may be saved if you are a 
              tailor, or sold back to recover some of the cost of the ore.</p>
            <p>Create lanterns (1 metal bits, lantern casing mold, bottle, flask 
              water) until 68. This is surprisingly cheap. It will take you a 
              while to make a few stacks of metal bits, but otherwise this is 
              not too costly (several plat). The lantern casing molds are not 
              stackable, <br>
              so have a few empty backpacks/containers with you. The only nuisance 
              here is that lanterns do not give you much money when you sell them 
              back to a merchant. </p>
            <p>Create dairy spoons (2 metal bits, scalar mold, flask of water) 
              until 74. Same as before; these sell back for even less than the 
              lanterns. However, they, too, are fairly cheap to make. </p>
            <p>Create banded gorgets (1 sheet metal, gorget mold, flask of water) 
              until 92. Finally, you can make something that you may actually 
              be able to sell; banded armor! I suggest making banded gorgets (these 
              are cheapest) until your skill hits in the mid-80's. At that point, 
              try auctioning your smith skills to other people. Offer to make 
              custom banded armor for whoever wants some and is willing to pay. 
              (Check with some people to find out what is a standard price for 
              banded armor on your server; the price varies.) Be fair; do not 
              ask for more money than what is fair. Why? No matter what, you're 
              going to get more money from players than from merchants, so why 
              be greedy? So not only are your customers gaining banded armor, 
              you may continue to get skill-ups while filling orders and you recover 
              more of your lost money than you would selling back to merchants. 
              It's a win-win situation. I have found that when your smithing skill 
              is in the mid-80's, you are able to make most banded pieces within 
              three attempts, so buy three molds per order and sell back any unused 
              molds to merchants. </p>
            <p>Continue with banded helmets (2 sheet metal, helm mold, flask of 
              water) until 106, or continue to fill orders for banded armor until 
              you trivial it. The only two banded pieces that trivial above 106 
              are the leggings (108) and the mail (110), but these take 3 sheets 
              of metal and their molds are more expensive than most. Sheets of 
              metal can be made (2 small bricks of ore, flask of water) and are 
              stackable; molds are not stackable. Sheets of metal can sometimes 
              be bought from merchants (Freeport, for example). I am planning 
              on stopping at 106 when the helmets trivial and moving on to more 
              expensive armor, rather than spending more money on leggings and 
              mail. </p>
            <p>(End Steps in Guide)</p>
            <p>Congratulations! At this point you have become a master smith! 
              I have bought most of my supplies from merchants and have probably 
              spent 200pp so far (my skill is 104 as of July 2nd). However, I 
              have been making a profit on banded armor, so I've only lost about 
              100pp total to get my skill up to master level. At this point you 
              can offer to make banded armor to people, studs and boning to tailors, 
              and tools such as skinning knives and filet knives to others. On 
              my particular server, a full suit of banded armor costs 92pp, and 
              considering I am out almost 100pp but now able to make banded armor 
              for profit, I am really surprised more people don't take the extra 
              time to smith. </p>
            <p>In general, you won't often see a profit as a smith. You certainly 
              will lose money up until the point that you can make armor, and 
              even now I don't see people wanting to buy banded very often. However, 
              smithing, like all tradeskills, is a fun way to take a break from 
              the normal routine of raids and soloing. </p>
