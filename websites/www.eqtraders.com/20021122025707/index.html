              thanks in large part to several volunteers, and the coding efforts

                Device. <i>- this is a happy thing</i></li>
              <li> Fixed the invisible forge in Felwithe <i>- forge is now <a href="location/felwithe.htm">located</a> 
                inside Emerald Armor in North Felwithe</i></li>
              <li> Added Collapsing Fletching, and Collapsing Mortar and Pestle. 
                Added recipe books for them.<i> -<a href="secrets/recipes_PoP_tinkering.htm"> 
                recipes on site</a></i></li>

                skill above 200 in tinkering.<i> - seems the newest classes for 
                gnomes couldn't quite get the hang of advanced tinkering at first 
                ...</i></li>

                destroy the Tanaan Smithing Hammer. <i>- our bank accounts thank 
                you! Those hammers are pricey!</i></li>

              and I have safely returned from the San Francisco Fan Faire. It 
              was a fun, if tiring weekend. While the weather was not the greatest, 
              we did manage to squeeze some time in at Muir Woods (yes, I hugged 
              a redwood), and crossed the Golden Gate Bridge (though we couldn't 
              even see the top of the bridge through the fog). I also met various 
              EQ community leaders, including <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com" target="_new">Allakhazam</a>, 
              <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/" target="_new">Baelish</a>, <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/" target="_new">Illia</a>, 
              and <a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org" target="_new">Vaslin</a>; 
              and various VI personalities I've interacted with electronically, 
              including Absor, Axgoreth, Frizznik, and Lyndro. (I also, of course, 
              spoke with Yakatizma, but we'd already been acquainted due to the 
              San Diego Fan Faire a while back.) I met a lot of great folks from 
              the EQTC boards, though I suspect that by the end of Saturday, I 
              likely had a slightly glazed look in my eye from all the names and 
              faces that flashed before me. At long last, I also finally got to 
              make good on a long-ago promise to bring &quot;Ester the Tester&quot; 
              chocolate. (After, of course, buying a second bar of the dark chocolate 
              with rapsberries for myself, to assure it was worthy of eating!) 
              While I had to start camping the line for the 6 pm Tradeskill panel 
              at 5 pm due to the two earlier sessions being filled to capacity, 
              I'm going to leave it to someone else to post some of the information 
              from the panel that I attended (as well as the 2 earlier full ones). 
              I need to go unsnarl my brain for a bit, spoil my frantic cats,

              issues with it, so I'd recommend holding off on questing it right 
              now. 2) Members report Anizok's gauze press is now happily summoning

              in the past that you should not be able to make a profit vendor-selling 
              tradeskill items, and it appears that at least the bow change was 
              thanks to notes about folks making a profit making and vendoring 
              these bows. 2) Civil rants, raves and whimpers belong in the Primal 
              Scream forum, <i>not</i> the Fletching forum, or any of the other 
              main tradeskill forums. Discuss things all you want, but if folks 
              start foaming at the mouth, expect posts to be locked. Should it 
              get too out of hand, we may ask certain reactionary elements to 
              leave the boards, at least until they can get themselves under control.

              of Knowledge</a> to carry the mana batteries for class one through 
              class five. We <i>should</i> also see an increase in the drops of

              recipes</a> continue to be verified in record time by a horde of 
              eager adventurers. Unlike with past expansions, I'm not giving myself 
              (more) grey hair by trying to personally verify a lot of these items, 
              but rather am working on processing all the data posted by various 
              folks, and beating the <a href="secrets/info/PoP_drops.htm">PoP 
              drop information</a> into shape for addition to the database. There 
              are also several new quest writeups in place, including the newly-solved 
              quest for <a href="quests/PoP_planar_armor.htm">PoP planar armor</a>. 
              I've also roamed over to the Safehouse and the Tinkering Compendium 
              several times to make sure that we're all working with the same 
              information on verified recipes, trivials, etc. Thankfully, this 
              has made this expansion a lot easier on this exhausted halfling, 
              though it's still been creative finding the time to do site updates, 
              tackle more chunks of this ever-growing database (the sheer volume 
              of information already in it ... and still to go ... is very boggling 
              at times), and get in a little play-time before I go redhead with 
              an oversized rolling pin IRL.</font>

              in the tradeskill discussions. <i>(I promise, Yakatizma, I'll leave 
              the rolling pin at home /grin)</i> Not only am I sure that others 
              there will be more than ready and able to ask thorny questions, 
              but a) I play email tag with the tradeskill team frequently when 
              there are issues to be addressed, and b) I need some &quot;downtime&quot;. 
              I know, I know, I'm not really escaping from EQ stuff, since I'll 
              be at an EQ con, but I'll be away from the computers and away from 
              the site for a couple days -- and that is a &quot;good thing&quot; 
              for someone who maintains something this massive day-in and day-out. 
              So, those of you who are going to be at the Fan Faire, feel free 
              to say hello, but <i>please</i> understand if my eyes start to glaze

              <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It's been a 
              week since the release of Planes of Power, and, at least from my 
              perspective, it's been the smoothest expansion launch yet. Those 
              of you grumbling in the corner, bear with me. Yes, there have been 
              some crashes, and more downtime than players would like, but all 
              in all, it's been a LOT more stable, we've been able to confirm 
              that a lot more of the recipes are in, and working, and so on. While 
              there has been the invariable trolling, and banning, on the boards, 
              there's been a lot less of the ill-mannered chaos than we saw with 
              the release of Luclin, even last Tuesday when we had over 100,000 
              page hits to <i>just</i> the message boards.</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This isn't 
              saying it's perfect, and I'm sure we're going to find nigglies as 
              time goes on - things that need to be adjusted one direction or 
              another in order to be &quot;balanced&quot;. It's looking good, 
              though.</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Speaking of 
              nigglies, and things that need to be adjusted, here's what we know 
              so far:</font> 
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The drop 
                rate on midnight stones (needed for jewelcraft, as well as for 
                a brewed smithing temper) is being adjusted - expect to see more 
                of them drop after the next time Plane of Nightmares is patched.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">After the 
                next server patch, the tinkered shrink and grow devices (Anizok's 
                Minimizing and Maximizing Devices) should be able to be recharged 
                with a class 6 mana battery</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Anizok's 
                Gauze Press (summon bandage item) will become a charged item after 
                the next patch. Before folks go screaming onto the forums and 
                in-game, this is still a <i>very</i> useful item. Basically, you 
                can zap out 20 stacks of 20 summoned bandages for 10pp and change 
                (recharges with a class 1 mana battery.) This is noticeably less 
                than that many stacks of real bandages would cost, and takes up 
                far less space in packs. I'll be definitely getting a second one 
                of these made (the first is on my monk) for my beastlord, along 
                with a collapsed toolbox for field recharging. Yes, those who 
                have sold these for insane prices are going to see less profit, 
                and yes, you may have some disgruntled customers. Such is the 
                life of tradeskills around the time of an expansion or a large 
                patch. (Such as, gee, what happened to prices after a week or 
                two of the PoTC craze? ;D)</font></li>

              what my &quot;laundry list&quot; normally looks like a week after 
              something large impacts tradeskills, things are looking pretty good 
              from my end. That doesn't mean I'm not dead on my feet, but I'm 
              definitely less frantic than is usually the case after something 
              like this. Still, I'm very much looking forward to a &quot;weekend

                This is why you're seeing a lot of ugly code in some people's

                notes</a> for more details, specifically the link about security 
                changes. There is also information there about added EZCode functionality 
                for those who need/want to convert their sig file into EZCode.

                EQTC is &quot;playing it by ear&quot; with regards to EZBoard 
                Gold renewal. The folks at EZBoards were kind enough to give us 
                a 1-month extension on our current subscription based on what 
                was in the community chest (which is separate from the paypal 
                donations that folks are sending donations to in order to help 
                pay for site costs), so we didn't have to worry about either renewing, 
                or moving to a new home for the boards in the middle of the PoP 
                chaos. This will give us a bit of breathing space to see what 
                EZBoards can/will offer us with regards to renewal, or prep for 
                moving to php boards via our site host.</font></li>

              <p>One of the new features included in the Planes of Power is a 
                new way for NPCs deal with Player Characters. It allows NPCs to 
                recognize certain actions taken by player characters. This may 
                mean that an NPC will not be interested in talking to you until 
                you've accomplished a certain task or until certain events have 
                occurred. So some NPCs may not have much to say to you upon your 
                first meeting, but might be more talkative later. This can also 
                apply to events and locations that might react differently to 
                a character that has accomplished a task than to one that has 
                not.</p>

                be deleted. As with any &quot;data only&quot; sticky threads in 
                the various forums, we will be actively enforcing this, as it 
                speeds up the process of getting information from the message 
                boards onto the main site.</font></li>

                Yes, this bears repeating ... and repeating ... and repeating. 
                If you're relatively new to the site, you may be surprised at 
                what happens on the site and the boards in the next week or so. 
                If you've been with EQTC for a year or more, you likely can guess 
                how crazed it's about to be around here.</font></li>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It's going 
              to be a horrifically busy time for the site, but with the help of 
              the community, it will hopefully be one of the smoother expansions 
              with regards to the level of chaos it brings to the site.</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For those who 
              hadn't noticed, the Oct. 16 patch had a stealth &quot;gift&quot; 
              for tradeskillers with regards to a new general AA ability. Those 
              tradeskillers that are level 51 or higher, are allowed to spend 
              3 AA points to train in New Tanaan Crafting Mastery. This allows 
              them to bring a <i>second</i> main tradeskill (baking, smithing, 
              brewing, fletching, jewelcraft, pottery, tailoring) above the 200 
              cap. With the expenditure of more points, GM tradeskillers can bring 
              others of these skills above the 200 mark as well.</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In other news,
