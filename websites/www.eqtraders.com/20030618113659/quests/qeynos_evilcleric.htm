            <h3>Qeynos Bertoxx Cleric Armor Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several new armor quests for young humans that 
              originates in Qeynos. All pieces of this set should be lore (other 
              than the bracer, no drop, HUM/CLR only. Due to the location and 
              the faction of the NPC down in the sewers, it's not recommended 
              that you attempt this if you are not a worshipper of Bertoxxulous. 
              Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials 
              often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for 
              a second one </i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Xeture Demiagar'</p>
            <p>Xeture Demiagar says 'I have much to do here for the defense of 
              our Temple and the appeasing of our patron Bertoxxulous, the Plague 
              Lord. If the Plague Lord has gifted you with the desire to [serve 
              his will] as a priest of the Bloodsabers I will assist in your training. 
              If not, then leave me now and do not interrupt me again.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I desire to serve his will.'</p>
            <p>Xeture Demiagar says 'By spreading the disease, decay, and destructive 
              powers of the Plague Lord you will in turn be gifted with great 
              insight and power. First however you must learn to survive in this 
              city, surrounded by those who would see you destroyed for your faith. 
              Take this note to Torin Krentar. He will instruct you on how to 
              acquire a suit of armor to protect you from the weapons of our [enemies].'</p>
            <p><i>{Wander over to Torin, near the Necromancer spell vendors}</i></p>
            <p>Torin Krentar says 'Well met young disciple of Bertoxxulous. Perhaps 
              one day you shall serve the Plague Lord in his realm, but for now 
              you will serve the Bloodsabers, his mortal agents on Norrath. The 
              armor you seek must be assembled using this Mail Assembly Kit. The 
              materials necessary to construct the armor vary depending on the 
              piece being crafted. Do you wish to craft [Gauntlets of the Pestilence 
              Priests], [Boots of the Pestilence Priests], a [Bracer of the Pestilence 
              Priests], a [Helm of the Pestilence Priests], [Greaves of the Pestilence 
              Priests], [Vambraces of the Pestilence Priests], or a [Breastplate 
              of the Pestilence Priests]?'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I wish to craft the Gauntlets of the Pestilence Priests.'</p>
            <p>Torin Krentar says 'To assemble pestilence priest gauntlets you 
              will need to obtain two bricks of crude iron and smelt them in a 
              [forge] with a Water Flask and this crude Gauntlet Mold. Once that 
              is done combine the Crude Iron Gauntlets with a Large King Snake 
              Skin and two Gnoll Finger Bones in the Mail Assembly Kit.'</p>

            <p>You say, 'who are our enemies?' </p>
            <p>Xeture Demiagar says 'The self-righteous ruler of this city, Antonius 
              Bayle IV, is backed by the Knights of Thunder, paladins and clerics 
              of the Storm Lord Karana, and the Temple Life, paladins and clerics 
              of the Prime-Healer, Rodcet Nife. Be wary when not within the security 
              of our temple here in the Qeynos Catacombs, should the Qeynos Guards 
              discover you allegiances they would have you executed. Once you 
              have been properly armored return to me and I will give you [further 
              instruction].' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what further instruction?' </p>
            <p>Xeture Demiagar says 'The Priests of Life, those who claim allegiance 
              to the Prime Healer, Rodcet Nife, have proven to be a large obstacle 
              in our conversion of the people of Qeynos to the ways of the Plague 
              Bringer. Lately a Priest of Life by the name of Rolon Banari has 
              been campaigning amongst the beggars and sickly, a social group 
              from which we have gained many converts. Find this meddling priest 
              and bring me his head.'</p>
            <p> Rolon was standing at around n30, n60 in North Qeynos, just before 
              the junction that leads West to the Temple of Life. As you'd expect 
              for a newbie quest, he was extremely green to 65 and had between 
              261 and 372 HP (my last hit was a 111 ) and I dunno if he was a 
              Cleric or a Paladin because he didn't get a spell off, obviously. 
              Either way, he dropped a Rusty Mace and his head, which I duly took 
              and sneak-handed in to the Guildmaster (had to re-hide VERY quickly 
              as he's got an ally behind him.) He took it at Indifferent with 
              no complaints: </p>
            
<p>Xeture Demiagar says 'You have done well ___. Take this Rusty Bloodsaber 
              Mace to a forge and clean it up with a Sharpening Stone. It may 
              take you several attempts to get all the rust off if you are not 
              familiar with the process. Once that is done take the Tarnished 
              Bloodsaber Mace to Torin Krentar with a Giant King Snake Skin and 
              he will put the finishing touches on the weapon.' </p>
            <p> I was given a Rusty Bloodsaber Mace (which is LORE but not Nodrop. 
              It's not a weapon, either: just a small, weight 0.1 ALL/ALL item 
              which cannot be equipped.) </p>
            <p>Details on the final weapon not available at this time.</p>
