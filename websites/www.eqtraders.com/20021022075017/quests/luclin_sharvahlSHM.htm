            <h3> Vah Shir Shaman Quests</h3>
            <p><i>As with many quests in Shar Vahl, this requires that you've 
              already completed the <a href="citizenship.htm">Vah Shir Citizenship 
              quest</a>. </i></p>
            <p><i>This quest is restricted to members of the shaman class only 
              and results in cloak and buckler upgrades as well as a ceremonial 
              strainer needed to make the shaman portion of the <a href="luclin_sonicwolfbane.htm">Sonic 
              Wolf Bane Weapons</a>. It relies heavily on the brewing tradeskill.</i></p>
            <p>Give your personal Acrylia Slate to Spiritist Fehril. He is in 
              the Shaman guild in Shar Vhal (loc 60, 140). He asks you to bring 
              him 3 hairless hopper hides. These hides drop from Needle Clawed 
              Hoppers in the Pit in Shar Vhal.</p>
            <p> Hand the 3 pelts to Spiritist Fehril. In return you will receive 
              a Hopperhide Buckler (AC 4, wt 2.0). Fehril will also hand you a 
              No Drop cask <i>(make sure to have a container slot free!)</i> and 
              tell you to fill it with 2 Sweet Waters. Sweet Water is made by 
              combining Xakra Bile, Scorpion Blood, and a flask of water in a 
              brew barrel. Xakra Bile drops from Xakra Larva in the Pit in Shar 
              Vhal. Scorpion Blood drops from Scorpions and Whiptail Scorpions 
              in the Pit in Shar Vhal. You can purchase the flask of water from 
              Chille, a merchant at the city side end of the South bridge in Shar 
              Vhal (or from other merchants that sell water). Brew up 2 of the 
              Sweet Waters and put them in the Cask. <i>(Note that the cask has 
              4 slots, but only 2 are required for the combine to be successful.) 
              </i></p>
            <p> Hand the combined Cask to Spiritist Fehril. In return you will 
              receive a vial of Hide Treatment. Fehril will ask you to do a task 
              for Merchant Ayyad and return Ayyad's seal to him. Merchant Ayyad 
              is located right outside of the Palace walls in Shar Vhal (loc 245, 
              0). Hand Ayyad your Acrylia Slate and you will be handed a bowl 
              and a reusable jar sketch <i>(don't forget to have a container spot 
              free for the bowl)</i>. You will be asked to create a Grey Clay 
              Bowl for Ayyad. First, you will need to create Grey Clay. This is 
              made by combining 2 grey mud (dropped from rhinobeetle hatchlings 
              in the Pit in Shar Vhal) with 1 Xakra Bile (dropped by Xakra Larva 
              in the Pit in Shar Vhal). Combine the Grey Clay in a pottery wheel 
              with the reusable jar sketch and a flask of water to create an unfired 
              gray jar. Combine the unfired gray jar with a firing sheet in a 
              Kiln to create the Gray Jar. Hand the Gray Jar to Ayyad and you 
              will receive his Seal.</p>
            <p>Hand Ayyad's Seal, the Hide Treatment, and your Initiate's Cloak 
              to Spiritist Fehril. You will receive a Treated Hopperhide Buckler 
              (AC 5, sv poison 2, wt 3.0) and a Cloak of the Dar Khura Recruit. 
              You will also be told to show your shield to Fharra Cawfeet to continue 
              your training. Fharra is located in the North District of Shal Vhal.</p>
            <p> Hand your Treated Hopperhide Buckler to Fharra Cawfeet (loc 460, 
              360). In return you will receiver your shield back as well as be 
              given a 4 slot container. (Again, have a container slot free.) Fharra 
              will ask you to create 4 soothing potions. Soothing Potions are 
              made by combining 2 Muck Digger Hearts (dropped by Muck Diggers 
              in Paludal Caverns) with a flask of water in a brew barrel. Combine 
              4 soothing potions in the 4 slot jar to create Fharra's Soothing 
              Tonic.</p>
            <p> Hand the Soothing Tonic to Fharra Cawfeet. She will hand you a 
              another treatment for your Treater Hopperhide Shield. She will also 
              ask you to speak with Mydi for further instructions. Hand Mydi your 
              shield and she will offer to help you treat your shield. She will 
              hand you a cloth and tell you to soak it in gray liquid and wrap 
              the cloth around the shield with the treatment. To do this, she 
              instructs you to first create the gray liquid by brewing a Dulfis 
              Mushroom in a flask a water. The Dulfis Mushrooms are a ground spawn 
              found near the Shadeweaver's zoneline in Paludal Caverns. Combine 
              1 mushroom with 1 flask of water in a brew barrel. Next, combine 
              the gray liquid with the cloth given to you by Mydi in the brew 
              barrel. This will change the cloth into a container. Place your 
              Treated Hopperhide Shield and your treatment into the cloth and 
              combine them. This will result in an upgraded shield. </p>
            <p> Hand Mydi your new shield and she will tell you she has another 
              task for you to complete. She will hand you an 8 slot bag and ask 
              you to fill it with Wetfang Eyes. These eyes drop from Large Wetfangs 
              in Paludal Caverns. Combine the 8 eyes in the bag.</p>
            <p> Hand the Bag of Wetfang Eyes to Mydi and she will give you her 
              Seal. Take this Seal back to Spiritist Fehril.</p>
            <p>Turn in the Seal, your Recruit Cloak, and your buckler to Fehril. 
              In exchange, he will give you an Apprentice Cloak and ask you to 
              speak to Jaima Seyel. Jaima is in the Shaman's Guild in Shar Vhal. 
            </p>
            <p>Hand Jaima your Apprentice Cloak. She will hand you a 4 slot bag 
              and ask you to fill it with Sonic Wolf Paws. These paws are the 
              stackable, droppable kind that drop from all kinds of Sonic Wolves 
              in Hollowshade Moor. Please do not confuse these with the No Drop 
              Sonic Pup Paws which also drop from Sonic Wolves. Combine 4 paws 
              in the bag to create a Bag of Sonic Wolf Paws. </p>
            <p> Hand Jaima the Bag of Sonic Wolf Paws. In return you will be given 
              a note and your Ceremonial Strainer. </p>
            <p>This concludes the part to get your strainer, but it does not conclude 
              the quest for the Sonic Wolf Bane weapons. To continue on, hand 
              the note given to you by Jaima to Amat Luziq. Amat is located in 
              the library right outside of the Palace in Shar Vhal. Amat will 
              give you a spear shaft and ask you to speak with Qua. Qua supplies 
              the books which describe how to make the different parts of the 
              Sonic Wolf Bane weapons, but you can save yourself the plat and 
              just read about them here at EQTraders.com. Qua also sells the weapon 
              kit which you will need to combine each of the parts in with the 
              spear shaft to create your Sonic Wolf Bane spear.</p>
            <p><a href="luclin_sonicwolfbane.htm">Further details on the Sonic 
              Wolf Bane weapons can be found here</a>.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Your completed sonic wolf bane spear is magic, lore, no drop, piercing, 
              4 dam, 21 delay, 3 bane damage vs sonic wolves, wt 4.0, VAH/SHM</p>
