            <h3> Qeynos/Bazaar - Unrefined Ore Quest</h3>
            <p><i>While this quest does not require any tradeskill ability, it 
              is the way to force the merchants that sells high quality ore to 
              restock their limited supply. As such, it is of great interest to 
              smiths.</i></p>
            <p>This quest can be done with three different vendors: Gliblixl Rocktok 
              in the Bazaar, Yakum Oreslinger in Qeynos, and Harnoff Splitrock 
              in Kaladim. The text will vary based on which vendor you choose 
              to restock, and the faction portion of the reward will also be different, 
              depending on which merchant you choose.</p>
            <p>Below is the text from the <i>original conversation**</i> with 
              Gliblixl. Text will vary a bit for the other two, but they all ask 
              for the same items.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Gliblixl Rocktok says 'Hail _____! I sell the finest quality 
                ore imported from the mines of Norrath! It's difficult to keep 
                enough ore available with the demands of the local smiths however 
                and could use some [assistance] restocking my supplies.'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This has apparently changed, according to recent reports, and he 
              no longer responds with the above text. In order to trigger this 
              quest, you may have to ask him &quot;What assistance?&quot; or &quot;May 
              I offer my assistance?&quot; to earn the following response:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Gliblixl Rocktok says 'Hooray! Fill this crate with either four 
                Small Bricks of Unrefined Ore or Four Large Bricks of Unrefined 
                Ore from Norrath and I will pay you for your assistance in keeping 
                me in business.'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Place either 4 large or 4 small bricks of unrefined ore in the 
              provided (no drop) box and combine before returning it to him. The 
              ore can be found dropping off most goblins in Permafrost, Solusek 
              A, and High Keep. Additionally, it can drop off the Janitor and 
              Sporali in Runnyeye.</p>
            <p>The quest results in xp, faction and some coin. The quest is still 
              quite new, and reports are varying on the coin reward. (anything 
              from 4pp to 40pp) Reward may vary based on which ore you give to 
              which merchant. Regardless, handing the combined box back to one 
              of the three men will cause them to despawn and respawn with a fresh 
              inventory of high quality ore.</p>
            <p>The Qeynos version of the quest results in positive faction with 
              the Citizens of Qeynos.</p>
            <p>The Bazaar version results in positive Traders of the Haven, House 
              of Fordel, House of Midst, House of Stout factions.</p>
            <p>The faction reward for the Kaladim version results in positive 
              Merchants of Kaladim, positive Storm Guard, negative Miners Guild 
              628, positive Miners Guild 249, and positive Kazon Stormhammer factions.</p>
