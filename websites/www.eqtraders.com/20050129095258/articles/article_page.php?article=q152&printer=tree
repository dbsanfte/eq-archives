<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Bansama Nysawi'</p>
<p>Bansama Nysawi  smiles at you and says, 'Hello.  It's always nice to have visitors, especially with all the work we have to do around here.  I'm grateful for the chance to take a break and talk.  Of course the work we do is important, so I can't spend too much time talking.'  Bansama looks at you for a moment, 'Maybe you could help me get some [work] done?'</p>
<p>You say, 'what work?'</p>
<p>Bansama Nysawi says 'Imildu and I are busy keeping the Wayfarers supplied with the arrows, bows and other supplies they need to battle their enemies.  The thing is, we've discovered some very odd stone that I would love to have time to research.  They find it only in the mountains, and it has a very unpleasant feeling to it.  I really want to talk to Nedaria about this.  This stone seems similar to the material that the Grozmok Stone is made out of, though I can't be certain, only Nedaria could determine that.  I've been calling this stone [Discord Stone] just because of the unusual properties it has.  I have been able to work with it with some good results, but I'd like to have more time at it.  If you could handle some of my other [duties] that might help.  If you help me out enough, I can teach you the secret for preparing both Taelosian Rock and the Discordian Rock that Imildu and I came up with.'</p>
<p>You say, 'what duties?'</p>
<p> Bansama Nysawi says 'I have many duties to perform before I can be free to do as I wish. If you can help me with them, I would be grateful. In order to get these tasks done, though, I'll need Taelosian Stone. If you can acquire some from Imildu and bring it to me, I can put you to work. If you work hard enough I will give you the secret for working with a Chunk of Taelosian Rock and a Chunk of Discordian Rock that Imildu and I discovered. And because I am asking you to provide the material for these tasks, I can reward you sooner than Imildu will.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STEP ONE: Simple Taelosian Honing Stone</p>
<p>Imildu Woodstreak is near Bansama on the Queen of Thorns. Give him a Chunk of Taelosian Rock and he will convert it into two Taelosian Stone. (You will also need to do this every time you run out of Taelosian Stone and need more for this quest.) Hand one of those stones to Bansama to begin her quest to learn the process needed to make Taelosian Stones for yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bansama Nysawi smiles brightly, 'Wonderful!  I need some honing stones for our work.  Just take a Small Taelosian Stone and a Simple Iron File and use your fletching kit to combine them.  These files are not very good, and the stone is hard.  So you'll need a new one with each attempt.  Bring me the honing stones when you have them ready.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bansama then gives you enough materials to make 10 Simple Taelosian Honing Stones.  Combine them in a fletching kit and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Simple Taelosian Honing Stones.  When you give her the next Taelosian Stone, she will move on to step two.</p>
<p>STEP TWO: Simple Taelosian Arrowhead</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bansama Nysawi says 'Fantastic!  I can use your help.  I need some simple arrowheads made from the Taelosian Stone.  This will be good practice for you, too.  Just take a Small Taelosian Stone, a Simple Iron File, and a Simple Iron Chisel and combine them in your fletching kit.  The file and the chisel won't survive the work, but that's acceptable.  Please bring the arrowheads to me when you are done. We have a lot archers that need them.'</p>

Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Simple Taelosian Arrowheads.  When you give her the next Taelosian Stone, she will move on to step three.</p>
<p>STEP THREE: Simple Jagged Taelosian Arrowhead</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bansama Nysawi says 'I think you can handle a more difficult task now.  There is some delicate work required to make the jagged arrowheads that our scouts prefer, but you can do it.  Just take the Small Taelosian Stone and Simple Tiny Chisel and combine them in your fletching kit.  Bring them to me when you have them done.  Thank you.'</p>

Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Simple Jagged Taelosian Arrowheads.  When you give her the next Taelosian Stone, she will move on to step four.</p>
<p>STEP FOUR: Simple Veined Taelosian Arrowhead</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bansama Nysawi says 'Hello!  Thank you for helping out.  I need some veined arrowheads.  They are very effective against certain targets.  Take the Small Taelosian Stone, Simple Iron Chisel and Basic Etching Compound and put them into your fletching kit.  It's a complicated task, but you can manage.  Bring the finished arrowheads to me.'</p>

<p>Bansama then gives you enough materials to make 10 Simple Veined Taelosian Arrowheads.  Combine them in a fletching kit and turn in your successes unstacked.  Repeat this process until you have handed in 30 Simple Veined Taelosian Arrowheads.  Give her one more Taelosian Stone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bansama Nysawi beams a glowing smile at you. 'You've done more than I could have expected.  Please, go enjoy yourself.  Before you leave, though, visit Imildu and let him know how much [aid] you have given me and he will share the secret for preparing the stones with you.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow her instructions</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'aid'</p>
<p>Imildu Woodstreak beams a bright smile at you, one that softens his usually dour face dramatically.  'May Tunare bless you, friend.  I can no longer keep you here.  Certainly you too wish to get back out under the sun and see the new land.  Your help has allowed me much freedom, and for that I thank you.  Look at this compound.  Using it when you work with the Chunks of Taelosian Rock and the Chunks of Discordian Rock will allow you to work them into the shapes you desire.'  The smell of the liquid leads you to understand what he has given you.  You will be able to incorporate that material into all of your fletching kits and work with this new stone easily.  In fact, you believe that in time you can improve on the compound and get better results.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>You now have the ability to turn Chunk of Taelosian Rock into Taelosian Stone in your fletching kit, as well as Chunk of Discordian Rock into Discord Stone.
