              More information keeps trickling in, and I'm getting updates onto 
              the site as my stamina allows. I've learned that if I don't reward 
              myself with a bit of play after every hour or three of solid site 
              work, I end up climbing the walls rapidly, so, at long last, Niami 
              is level 60. <i>{does the happy halfling dance}</i></p>
            <p class="black" align="left">For those of you who don't want to scour 
              the message boards and recipe pages, trying to figure out what's 
              new since Luclin launched, here's a brief update. If something sparks 
              your interest, then I'd recommend you take a closer look at the 
              message boards, and the temporary <a href="secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">Luclin 
              Tradeskills Recipes page</a>. (I'm not going to move things off 
              that temporary page, and onto their proper recipe pages until the 
              dust settles more in a week or three - it's changing too much still 
              to justify updating that many pages several times a day):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>trade supplies: most of the zones are now recorded so that you 
                can go to the Trade Supplies pages and look for what you need</li>
              <li>alchemy: several new recipes, including clarity-type potions. 
                Not for the faint of skill, or the weak of pocket</li>
              <li>baking: owlbear and sonic wolf sandwiches and steaks, as well 
                as a few quest recipes have been discovered</li>
              <li>brewing: two new tanning agents for tailoring, plus a couple 
                quest recipes</li>
              <li>fletching: new bows, new arrows, both above the 200 trivial 
                mark</li>
              <li>pottery: Vah Shir bard quests - details are sketchy still (pardon 
                the pun)</li>
              <li>smithing: studs, boning, arrowheads, arrow shafts, plus a youngling 
                quest armor, plus the start of details on other quest recipes</li>
              <li>sonic wolf bane weapons: we're still translating the recipe 
                into something workable, but it will require cooperation from 
                multiple Vah Shir of varying skills and professions</li>
              <li>tailoring: multiple types of armor, some with stats and trivials 
                of 189 and above, as well as bags, threads, etc.</li>
              <li>tinkering: + skill items for every tradeskill!</li>

              After much thought, we've decided to put up a PayPal button (it 
              <i>should</i> be over there to the left, under the other nav buttons 
              ...), so that folks who wish to help contribute to site expenses 
              can do so. The majority of this money will go to the lovely folks 
              at <a href="http://www.refplace.com" target="_new">Refplace</a>, 
              who have been eating the expense of hosting this lovely community 
              site for the past year. A smaller portion will go to the DenMother 
              to cover expenses of software, time, and hair color to hide the 
              extra grey hairs earned while playing mom to the site. ;) It <i>should</i> 
              be set to accept credit cards as well as transfers from other PayPal 
              accounts. Please whimper on the boards if you have problems with 
              it. </p>

              - Tailoring &quot;Bridge&quot; Found!</span></b><br>
              Kudos to Irrani from the Innoruuk server for successful experimentation 
              resulting in the discovery of two sets of tailoring recipes that 
              bridge the gap between Wu's Fighting Armor (158) and the Velious 
              tailoring (above 250 and expensive to fail!). Acrylia studded and 
              acrylia reinforced armor seem to have trivials above 159 and below 
              250 (at least for the one and two boning pieces). The recipes are 
              sitting on the <a href="secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">Luclin Tradeskills 
              Recipes page</a>, which has been growing by leaps and bounds lately 
              thanks to lots of contributions by all you lovely tradeskillers.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">You'll also find a bit of brewing, a 
              bit of baking, some smithing, new alchemy recipes, new tinkered 
              tradeskill items, and so forth on that page. Once things stabilize, 
              and I'm not making additions to the page a dozen times a day (literally), 
              I'll split the recipes out into their proper sections in the recipes 
              pages.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">The trade supply locations pages have 
              not yet been updated with all the findings from new zones. We've 
              gotten as far as posting the logs for a lot of the merchant information 
              on the message boards, but converting those logs into something 
              useful takes time, and a lot more alertness than I have after the 
              way this week has gone. It's almost midnight here, and I'm expecting 
              another hour or so of testing and experimentation before I topple 
              ... </p>

              I almost forgot to mention that sabertooth hides and brute hides, 
              for wood elf and halfling cultural tailoring, respectively, now 
              stack. There is MUCH rejoicing! Next on my wishlist is making the

              It will be weeks before the dust settles around here, but I know 
              folks are eager for information on the new tradeskill items, etc. 
              For now, I'll be concentrating on getting information up, and will 
              worry about splitting things onto to proper web pages and prettying 
              things up later. The <a href="secrets/recipes_luclin.htm">Luclin 
              Tradeskills Recipes page</a> will contain recipes as I can get them

              Tomorrow marks the launch of Shadows of Luclin, and it's sure to 
              cause a lot of chaos around here, as new things are discovered, 
              verified, etc. Because of the <i>huge</i> amount of work this is 
              likely to add to my plate during the holiday season, I'm going to 
              create a <i>temporary</i> <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm65">message 
              board forum just for Luclin tradeskill information</a>. Anyone with 
              news on tradeskill vendors, new recipes, new forages, and other 
              Luclin tradeskill information should post to that forum. It is only 
              temporary, to be used as a clearinghouse for information that needs 
              to make it onto the website. Please don't clutter it with chatter, 
              speculation and so forth. Hopefully, this will preserve what little

              This past weekend, with only a few days to spare, the final piece 
              of Velious tailoring for which stats were unknown (<a href="secrets/recipes_velious_silks.htm">ice 
              silk pantaloons</a>) was made, and the site updated ... just in 
              time for me to brace for impact when Luclin launches, and the possibility

            <p class="black" align="left"><b><font color="#400000">Site news:</font></b> 
              I never expected the site to be still this popular for this long 
              (over 1 million page hits to the site expected this month, not counting 
              message board traffic) ... and neither did the web hosting provider 
              who has graciously provided free web hosting this past year. It's 
              costing him a decent amount of money, and me a decent amount of 
              time, so I'll be looking into ways to fix that soon. I will NOT 
              subject you folks to popup ads, or turn this into a pay-site. However, 
              I may end up with some ads on the site, or a PayPal button to accept 
              donations to help recoup some of the costs. We'll see how things 
              go ...</p>

              We had a bit of a DNS issue, for those of you who had problems reaching 
              the site yesterday. All should be well now. Trivials, stats and 
              updates continue to trickle in, but don't expect the foraging pages 
              to be fully updated for a while. It seems that in some zones, anything 
              you can fish, you can forage now, and that's going to really enlarge 
              my forage listing, or make me redesign it.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">Other than that, I'm trying to conserve

              Several bits of info have been brought back from the Fan Faire of

              This includes making cultural tailoring pelts stack, yew leaves 
              possibly able to be foraged, mention that there IS a dwarven cultural 
              chain, and that it has Bristlebane and Brell imbues (not quite what 
              halfling clerics wanted to hear, but at least there actually <i>is</i> 
              a Bristlebane armor imbue!), upcoming robes for erudites (and others), 
              more tinkering, something to bridge the tailoring gap (chasm?), 
              there is supposedly a working recipe for <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=1189.topic" target="_new">chocolate 
              covered cherries</a> in-game, and much, much more. Much, of course, 
              will be waiting until after Luclin, but the tradeskill community 
              hopes it won't be <i>too</i> long a wait after that launch before 
              we start seeing some of this stuff! I've started a new message board

              There have only been a few things to note in the last few weeks. 
              First and foremost, brewers will be happy to note that, thanks to 
              Laurefin on the message boards, we now have <a href="secrets/recipes_brewing.htm">verified 
              brewing recipes</a> for Egg Nog and the more alcoholic version of 
              it, Egg Nog XXX. A few more trivials have been narrowed down in 
              other recipes around the site, but nothing too earth-shattering. 
              The post-patch version of the city newspapers had little to note 
              tradeskill-wise, other than a hint that bread might soon become 
              readily available again.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">On the ooc front, many already know 
              that I'm almost never in EQ anymore. This site <i>will</i> continue 
              to stay on top of up-to-date tradeskill information, but I will 
              continue to be pretty much &quot;retired from EQ&quot; until further 
              notice. Yes, in part this is due to <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com" target="_new">DAoC</a> 
              launching (and the fun I had doing tradeskills over there in beta 
              4), but only in part. Perhaps once the visit by the House Ogre's 
              mom is over, I'll post something to the message boards about my 
              decision, but I decided it was time to make an &quot;official&quot; 
              announcement. (I was all prepared to announce my retirement on September 
              11, well before DAoC beta was done, but events of that day made 
              me decide to delay such an annoucement...)</p>

              The internet is my friend. The internet is my friend. But my friend 
              seems unwilling to play nice today. If you can't reach the message 
              boards today, you're not alone. I can't reach any EZBoard site, 
              nor can I connect to ICQ, etc. Hopefully things will settle down 
              soon.</p>
            <p class="black" align="left">Nothing new of any tradeskill note in 
              yesterday's patch ... unless someone posted a find to the boards 
              late last night after I last read the boards. Somehow, I don't have 
              a lot of hope for stackable pelts for halfling and wood elf cultural 
              tailors, or the myriad of other nigglies that are still a bit awry, 
              and likely will stay that way, with Luclin taking up so much of 
              Verant's attention. Time will tell. Meanwhile, I'm going to take 
              a nap ...</p>

              We're back!! You never know how much you take something for granted 
              until it's gone ... such as my wonderful webhosting provider, who 
              was laid low for several days. (I never did find out why, but given 
              the timing, I presume it was that dratted Nimda.) Anyway, we're 
              back, and I'll have more of an update on Monday.</p>
