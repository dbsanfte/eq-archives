<span class="headers">Ak`Anon Bertoxx Caster (Plague Sorceror) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many youngling armor quests, originating in Ak'Anon. This one is meant for evil gnome casters. All pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, and restricted to NEC/WIZ/MAG/ENC, Bertoxx only. The robe is dark green in color. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
Similar structure to the other class-specific quests - you get a kit (Curing Kit) from the quest giver (Tilkzog Mournunder), who will then tell you the recipe for each item and give you a pattern (Tattered [xxx] Pattern) when prompted. It seems from the text that, unlike the good INT-caster recipes, you don't need a piece of cloth armour or a sewing kit to make the final piece. My understanding (untested as yet) is that all the ingredients are combined in the Curing Kit to make the final piece. You do need quite a few silk threads of course, which require either a loom or a sewing kit, but you could do those in one go at a loom and then just carry the curing kit and patterns around with you. And the spiderling silks to make the threads are a) readily available in Steamfont, and b) stackable unlike the cloth armour. And the threads are stackable as well of course.
<p>
Your Location is 2069.33, -453.37, -182.0606 (in Ak'Anon)

<p>
You say, 'Hail, Tilkzog Mournunder'
</p>
<p>
 Tilkzog Mournunder says 'Hail Genumkin. I am Tilkzog Mournunder, Necromancer of the Dark Reflection. It is my duty here to assist not only the young necromancers of the Dark Reflection but also those wizards, magicians, and enchanters that have been called into the service of the Plague Bringer. I will aid you in obtaining an outfit of [durable clothing] suitable for a young sorcerer of the Dark Reflection. Once you have been adequately outfitted for venturing beyond our homeland in service of the Plague Bringer return to me and I will assist you in obtaining a [staff of dark reflections].'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what durable clothing?'
</p>
<p>
 Tilkzog Mournunder says 'The sorcerous servants of Bertoxxulous, the Plague Bringer, are privileged with the sight of the Dark Reflection. This gift enlightens us to the powers of disease, decay, death, and destruction. Forces that are misunderstood and feared by the majority of Norrath, including our fellow gnomes of Ak'Anon. These forces are the catalyst of change, cleansing Norrath of the old and weak, and we are the agents of this catalyst. However, before you will be of much use to the Dark Reflection you must gather the [components] necessary for the outfit that will protect and aid you in your duties.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what components?'
</p>
<p>
 Tilkzog Mournunder says 'You will need this Curing Kit and varying components depending on the piece of clothing you wish to fabricate. Do you desire to craft a [plague sorcerer cap], [plague sorcerer wristband], [plague sorcerer gloves], [plague sorcerer boots], [plague sorcerer sleeves], [plague sorcerer pantaloons], or [plague sorcerer robe]?'

<p>
You say, 'and, without without wishing to encourage you to prattle on in any way, did you mention something about a staff of dark reflections?'
</p>
<p>
 Tilkzog Mournunder says 'The Dark Reflection has many enemies even within our home of Ak'Anon and the surrounding Steamfont Mountains. Many fear and oppose the beliefs that grant us our vision and powers. A wizard of the Eldrich Collective by the name of Winex Kloktik has been aiding members of the Deep Muses hunt and slay those loyal to Bertoxxulous and the Dark Reflection. Seek Winex Kloktik and eliminate her. When you have completed this task bring me Winex's Staff.'
