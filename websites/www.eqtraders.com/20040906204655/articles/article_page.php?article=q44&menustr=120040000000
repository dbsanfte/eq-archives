      <span class="headers">Katta Brewing Quest</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This quest originates in Katta Castellum, with a pair of dwarves in the tunnels. Items in </i><b><i>bold italic</i></b><i> are <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=35&rsa=Brewing&sb=item&sub=alcoholic&menustr=080030010000">player-brewed</a> items. Note that it results only in xp and faction. There is no coin/item reward for this quest.</i>
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Rowle Shieldson'
</p>
<p>
Tack Shieldson says 'Oi there, friend!
</p>
<p>
Rowle Shieldson says 'Sure'n this one came from Norrath, eh Tack? One wonders if'n a bottle o' one on o' the finer things in life might be in our future, if we were to ask politely?
</p>
<p>
Tack Shieldson says 'Yar, Rowle. So whadda ye say? We stand around drinkin' water on duty all day, and that ain't no life fer a dwarf. Now we bin hearin' bout all these new ales and suchnot comin' up from Norrath. Ye think ye might be so kind as to share a pint and raise our spirits?
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I will share a pint'
</p>
<p>
Rowle Shieldson says 'That'd be great! By Brell, a short beer or a honey mead'd be a nice change from?
</p>
<p>
Tack Shieldson says, 'Shhhhhh!!' He runs over and kicks Rowle in the kneecap and chuckles under his beard in your direction. Speaking under his breath to Rowle, 'Don' be such an idjit, now this lad came all the way from Norrath, why not try some of the fabled ales we'd heard our pappy's talkin' of?' Subtlety is not the strength of the dwarven race.
</p>
<p>
Rowle Shieldson catches on slowly, 'ahhh, roight! Good show, Tack! D'ye think 'e would go te that kinda trouble fer us?'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I'd go te that kinda trouble fer you'
</p>
<p>
Rowle Shieldson clears his throat and flashes a broken-toothed grin your way, 'Ye know, me dwarven heart longs for me first taste o' some <i><b>underfoot brown</b></i>, a reputed fine stout not available 'ere on Luclin... Ye know, if ye can manage it that is.'
</p>
<p>
Tack Shieldson says 'Ahhh, worthy o' Brell hisself or so they say. Ye know when I was just a pup, back before the exodus, me uncle used te talk about stompin' trolls and then sitting back with a <i> <b>Boot Beer</b></i> te celebrate the day's victory. I, ummm, really would be able te get in touch with me heritage were I able to sample some o' that fine stout. Ye'd be a true friend to the Validus Custodus fer helpin' us out friend. My thanks to ye in advance.
</p>
<p>
~~~
</p>
<p>
You will find the recipes for boot beer and underfoot brown on, yep, you guessed it, the <a href="http://eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=35&rsa=Brewing&sb=item&sub=alcoholic&menustr=080030010000">brewing recipes page</a> of this site.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Handing the appropriate brews to Rowle and Tack results in the following:
</p>
<p>
Tack Shieldson gingerly takes the boot from you, handling it as though it were a fine porcelain. With a look of thanks to you he slowly lifts it to his lips and suddenly tips it back to empty it in one gulp, frothing his beard in the process. 'Yar! That's the ticket! Damn fine stuff that is, just like me uncle always said. A service to the Validus Custodus have ye done, my friend... And I'd be happy to assist ye in that service again sometime. HAR!'

</p>
<p>
Rowle Shieldson takes a wee sip and smacks his lips together, proclaiming, 'Ahhh, a finer stout has never passed my lips, ' before draining the mug in one gulp. 'Yer a saint amongst us, I say. Feel free to keep 'em coming, Mendan!'
