            <h3> Stoutdeacon Armor - Rivervale Cleric Quests</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several new youngling armor quests based in Rivervale. 
              All results from this quest are HFL/CLR only, and are lore (other 
              than the bracer), no drop. Combines are no fail and do allow some 
              minor skill increases in blacksmithing. Armor is a greenish gold 
              in color. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer 
              materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the 
              parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>Thekela Meepup says 'It is a pleasure to meet you _____. I am Thekela 
              Meepup, one of the highest ranking Clerics in all of Rivervale. 
              I pride myself on being the mentor for all of the furryfooted that 
              are called upon by Bristlebane to give life. If you are a [Cleric] 
              I might have some training for you to complete if you so wish. '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i am a cleric'</p>
            <p>Thekela Meepup says '_____ the Templar. Well I suppose that does 
              have quite a nice ring to it don't you say? If you stick with your 
              training perhaps this could be what you are referred to one day. 
              Before that day though, you have a lot to learn and a lot of training 
              ahead of you! Do you want to [begin your training] at this time? 
              '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to begin my training'</p>
            <p>Thekela Meepup says 'Excellent! I will give you a variety of items 
              to collect and combine in this magical assembly kit to create a 
              material that you will use to craft armor. My hope is that as you 
              gather these items you will learn about your home and how to navigate 
              around the surrounding areas of the Vale. If you are ready to begin 
              your adventure I will present you with your Magical Mail Assembly 
              Kit and the instructions for collecting the necessary items to craft 
              your armor. Are you [ready to receive your Magical Mail Assembly 
              Kit]? '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i am ready to receive my Magical Mail Assembly Kit'</p>
            <p>Thekela Meepup says 'Here you are _____. Take this mail assembly 
              kit, it is what you will use to combine the different items necessary 
              to craft your own Platemail of the Stoutdeacon. Different combinations 
              of items will be required from both our town and the hunting grounds 
              in the thicket to create materials for specific armor pieces with 
              Crude Iron Ore being the basis for all of your armor materials. 
              When you are ready to receive a recipe for a specific material simply 
              tell me what armor piece you [want] to craft. I will then supply 
              you with the mold and recipe for Stoutdeacon Platemail [Helms], 
              [Bracers], [Boots], [Armguards], [Greaves], [Gloves] and [Breastplates]. 
              '</p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to craft Helm' ( must be singular)</p>
            <p>Thekela Meepup says 'Your Helm of the Stoutdeacon will indeed be 
              one of the most important pieces of your armor set. It is very important 
              that you are well protected from any blows to the head while you 
              are on the battlefield. To fashion together the material necessary 
              for making your helm gather 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Low Quality 
              Wolf Skin, 1 Chunk of Meat and 2 Water Flasks then combine them 
              in your assembly kit. Once you have the correct Helm material take 
              it to the closest forge, along with this pattern and combine them 
              to create your Helm of the Stoutdeacon. '</p>
            <blockquote>

            <p>You say, 'i want to craft Bracer'</p>
            <p>Thekela Meepup says 'You will be required to gather most of the 
              items for your bracer material from the Misty Thicket. You will 
              need to collect 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Bixie Stinger, 1 Runnyeye 
              Warbeads and 1 Turnip then combine them in your kit to create the 
              material necessary for crafting a Bracer of the Stoutdeacon. After 
              you have done this take the material to a forge along with the mold 
              I have given you to fashion together a Bracer of the Stoutdeacon.

            <p>Thekela Meepup says 'Well boots would be quite a good idea if I 
              do say so myself _____, for certain situations only though! You 
              should be proud of your feet and all the lovely hairs that they 
              have been blessed with by Bristlebane! However if you wish to create 
              a material that you will use along with this mold to create your 
              boots you will need 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Dark Elf Skins, 
              2 Bixie Wings and 1 Rat Foot. '</p>
