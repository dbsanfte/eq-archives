<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Kelethin. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ELF/HEF,ROG only. They are no-fail tailoring combines. Armor has a dark green chain graphic when worn. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
