                  <b>FanFest = one exhausted halfling!!!</b> I'll likely have 
                  more of an update on Monday, after I sleep, deal with an in-game 
                  wedding tomorrow, etc., etc. Meanwhile, as soon as I got home, 
                  I went in-game and verified two recipes that other players gave 
                  me at the FanFest: <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=449.topic">pickled 
                  bixie</a> and <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm55.showMessage?topicID=33.topic">fish 
                  eggs</a>. I'll get them onto the recipe pages later. Sleep is 
                  my friend. Meanwhile, the message board links are included for 
                  folks. I also added a comment in the huge thread about <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=215.topic&amp;start=81&amp;stop=100">tradeskill 
                  containers</a> with an idea that has been brought up to Yakatizma. 
                  There are NO promises it will go anywhere, but at least the 
                  idea has been aired. There are also <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerbaking.showMessage?topicID=446.topic">changes 
                  afoot in baking sometime soon</a>, and I'll talk about that, 
                  and other experiences from the FanFest (including my interview 
                  for the <i>Avatars Offline</i> documentary) ... but likely not 
                  until Monday. The same goes for the multitude of posts with 
                  trivials and other site updates that I've not dealt with - it 
                  likely will be Monday before I tackle much more. Sleeeeeeeeep

                  Tradeskill experimenters rejoice! One of the things that has 
                  always hindered significant experimentation with the myriad 
                  of recipes that we've been told are &quot;out there somewhere&quot; 
                  but that have been undiscovered has been resources. It's painfully 
                  hard to throw what can be hundreds of platinum pieces' worth 
                  of items and/or hours worth of collection time, into a tradeskill 
                  container on an &quot;experiment&quot; that will fail and destroy 
                  the items. Currently live only on the test server is a change 
                  that will make tradeskill containers NOT destroy items that 
                  &quot;do not combine&quot; (DNC), making the lives of curious 
                  experimenters a lot easier. On the downside, many portable tradeskill 
                  containers will given a weight increase, making it harder for 
                  packrats like myself to lug about multiple different containers 
                  for tradeskilling in the field. (My worst packrat is my shamaness, 
                  who regularly carries around a spirit pouch, bearskin potion 
                  bag, Coldain Tanners Kit *and* a cooking spit.) Message board 
                  threads were popping up all over regarding this change, and 
                  I'm trying to get them funneled into <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=215.topic" target="_new">one

              <li>More brewed egg oils have been discovered, though we've not

                combination they can, to see if they can find a use for these, 
                but as always, it will be expensive and time-consuming experimentation 
                since we have no &quot;clues&quot; as to if these are for any 
                implemented recipes, or if they are for future recipes, or if 
                they're just there for the sake of being there.</li>

                <b><u>PART TWO:</u></b> I promised some happier stuff in Part 
                One of today's update (written earlier today). Since then, I've 
                managed to get stats for one piece of ice burrower silk armor, 
                and one of the three velium hound recipes. Eventually, more will 
                follow, but these are high-level mobs, and the parts are hard 
                for any of us tradesfolk to come by, since we're generally so 
                busy huddled over our sewing kits as to not be of a high enough 
                level to hunt these beasts for ourselves. ;)</p>
              <p>I also sent in feedback via the new Sony process for their message 
                boards, regarding today's patch message. I'm sure I'm not the 
                only one that caught the newest &quot;oops&quot; with the note 
                about specialized tradeskill containers telling folks to rely 
                on in-game information and NPC text, then the statement that the 
                Velious tailoring now has to use the Coldain Tanners Kit ... but 
                they forgot to add the note about the kit to the proper recipe 
                book (i.e., Velium Leathers) and/or to any NPC that folks have 
                hailed in Thurgadin. It's been submitted, we'll see where it goes 
                from there. In the meantime, I'll continue to keep on verifying 
                recipes, and making sure that functioning ones are listed here, 
                even when that conflicts with information in the books, etc.</p>
              <p>(<font color="#FF0000"><b>Corrected update:</b></font> the crystalline 
                silk still works in the large tailoring kit. Ice burrower silk 
                and all the Velium Leathers are confirmed to need the Coldain 
                Tanners Kit. The Fine Furs have not yet been tested in both kits. 
                Also note that <b>these tanning kits are MISSING on the Zeb server</b>, 
                possibly others. It has been bugged. One of these years someone 
                will remember to bring down Thurgadin on that server and patch 
                it in.)</p>
              <p><b><u>PART ONE:</u></b> The &quot;About&quot; page has been updated 
                at long last. I'm not happy to have to spell things out as bluntly 
                as I did there, and I fear it will give the wrong message to the 
                99.9% of you who are truly emjoying/using this resouce, while 
                the 0.1% of the ingrates that have spurred the change blithely 
                ignore it, and try to hound me until I get fed up enough to throw 
                in the towel and close all this down.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, once we've got some more positive news on tradeskills 
                (such as after I get my hands on the ice burrower silk and velium 
                hound fur that folks in one of the bigger guilds on my server 
                are risking life and limb to obtain for recipe verification and 
                testing), I'll be glad to balance all this depressing stuff with 
                happier celebration. ;)</p>
              <p><b>Time will tell:</b> if the changes to the SONY boards means 
                that they are continuing their recent track record of ignoring 
                anything that is uncomfortable to them, or if it will truly mean 
                that there will be more positive change and improvement on things 
                that are currently broken (and repeatedly reported as bugs) ... 
                if something to bridge the 131 to 230+ tailoring gap will be put 
                in within a few weeks, or take months, if it ever goes in at all 
                ... if the steelsilk recipes (aka Terrorantula silks) that have 
                been in-game for a few weeks will be actually functional, with 
                all parts dropping in reasonable amounts (more than 2 or 3 silks 
                per server per day) on the live servers within a month ... if 
                the sense of &quot;community&quot; that was on the SONY boards 
                has been totally destroyed by the sudden changes on the SONY boards 
                just at a time when a noticeable chunk of the EQ community can't 
                stay connected due to the recent patch or if folks will continue 
                to be forgiving, even though the timing on the board revamp was 
                horrific ... whether recipe books will be updated to be correct 
                any time in our lifetime (this includes not only the Velium Leatherworking 
                book which doesn't make any mention of Coldain Tanner's Kit and 
                never has, but also things like the several baking recipe books 
                that have been incorrect for well over a year) ... whether other 
                tradeskill improvements that were promised and/or hinted at many 
                months ago will be seen any time, *in a fully working order* will 
                be seen any time in the next half a year.</p>
              <p>I won't hold my breath, but life goes on. So do tradeskills. 
                There's always something more that needs verification, more stats 
                that need to be scrounged, etc., etc. You can play a passive part 
                and simply slurp up the wealth of information provided here, or 
                you can dive in, pitch in, and instead of saying &quot;I can't 
                believe she doesn't have <i>X</i> yet, since it's out on the net&quot;, 
                spend the extra few minutes to go out on &quot;the net&quot;, 
                find it, and post it here. </p>
              <p>The message boards are, as expected, seeing a higher load than 
                ever before. A second message board admin has been added, but, 
                as always, this is a labor of love for the folks that help out 
                around here and stomping around finding fault with stuff instead 
                of rolling up your sleeves and helping out is, and always has 
                been, considered bad form on in <i>this</i> community.</p>

                <b>Velious recipes now need the Coldain Tanner's Kit</b>. Imagine 
                that. Almost 4 months AFTER the recipes are put in game, they 
                retroactively &quot;fix&quot; the recipes to not work in a normal 
                sewing kit, wait a day, then announce they were supposed to use 
                a different kit all along, then they bring down Thurgadin on all 
                servers to patch in said Tanner's Kit. Oh, SO sorry for the inconvenience 
                folks, this is what we intended all along, but had to do bass-ackwards 
                &quot;fix&quot; before we bothered telling anyone about the fix, 
                nor before we fixed the recipe books or put the kit in place. 
                That's no way to run a business.</p>
              <p>Before this patch, earlier today, I posted about the Velious 
                tailoring problems, and counseled patience, since I had faith 
                that Verant would find the problem and fix it. Foolish halfling. 
                My rose-colored glasses are now ground into dust, and the only 
                thing I have faith in is that they've finally pushed me over the 
                edge. Even when I've been upset at how things are working, and 
                upset with snerts in-game, I've tried VERY hard to put a positive 
                spin on things and not degenerate into Verant-bashing, but right 
                now I am SO steamed at the folks responsible for this mismanaged 
                &quot;fix&quot; that it isn't funny. It's taken two years, but 
                I've lost my faith in them ... but not in the wonderful folks 
                in this tradeskill community, so I'll keep plugging along, somehow, 
                for your sake.</p>
              <p>That having been said -- loyal visitors to this site and the 
                message boards, please brace yourselves, the worst is to come. 
                Verant's tired of folks getting mad at them when they mess up, 
                have pretty much taken away their message boards, and I expect 
                a large backwash of angry folks here.</p>
              <p>I know we're all going to want to rant and rave here, since they've 
                taken away places where issues can be raised elsewhere. Just remember: 
                This site is not connected to Verant. This site is at best viewed 
                by them as a &quot;fan&quot; site and at worst as a &quot;spoiler&quot; 
                site, and some of them would probably like nothing better than 
                to see it go under. If you use my boards as the dumping ground 
                for everything you're pissed at <i>them</i> about, it just might 
                go under as I hit total burnout and total frustration. Remember: 
                yes, folks here want to know about things that don't work BUT 
                if you're reporting something broken here, you'd better report 
                it to Verant through their lovely new submission process too. 
                Oh, and don't mention you got the recipes from here, else they're 
                likely to ignore you as working from &quot;spoiler&quot; recipes.

              <b> Patch update!</b> Today's patch has reports of one improvement 
              for tradesfolk (combine messages for your party members) and one 
              report of a problem. I've NOT had time to test the problem out personally 
              (I'm on the second floor of Hate at the moment), but several respected 
              tradesfolk are reporting <font color="#400000"><b>problems with 
              <a href="secrets/recipes_velious_leathers.htm">Velium Leathers</a> 
              recipes that have worked perfectly well up until this patch</b></font>. 
              So far, the cobalt drake belt, tigeraptor belt and cloak are reported 
              with problems for at least some folks on some servers. PLEASE be 
              careful on your combines until this can be investigated and addressed. 
              (Someone's already posted to the SONY boards about it.) </p>
            <p>In the meantime, yes, the Velious tailoring section has been re-done. 
              I know it confused a lot of folks when it was done, and I wasn't 
              able to announce it properly because there was a bit of a fibercut 
              problem yesterday and I couldn't get to the site when I had time 
              for updates. However, there really are buttons once you get to the 
              Velious tailoring recipes section that lead you to the Fine Furs, 
              the Silks (crystalline and ice burrower) and the Velium Leathers. 
              I apologize for the confusion, but hope the information is a bit 
              more manageable in smaller chunks, rather than all thrown together 
              like it was before. :)</p>
            <p>One LAST time, before I start having my mail forwarding service 
              start flinging email back at folks with a message telling folks 
              to tell it to the message boards instead of to me. Screen shots 
              of tradeskill fashions go to <a href="mailto:fashion@eqtraders.com">fashion@eqtraders.com</a> 
              (yes, if she stays missing much longer, I'll find another fashion 
              editor volunteer and this email will go to them instead). Trade 
              guides go to <a href="mailto:guides@eqtraders.com">guides@eqtraders.com</a>. 
              Information on trivials, new recipes, new merchants and &quot;how 
              do I ...&quot; and &quot;where can I ...&quot; and &quot;what is 
              the recipe for ...&quot; go to the message boards. I can and will 
              delete email from folks that think that one little halfling has 
              the time and energy to deal with the flood of folks who seem to 
              expect personal attention in email for things that are better handled 
              by the tradeskill community at large. Yes, there are things that 
              should be directed to me in email, but the above are not part of 
              that list. Folks, I know, there are many of you who think I'm now 
              a &quot;bitchy, whining, redhead&quot; for repeating this, but it's 
              just NOT sinking in to some of you, and, believe it or not, I'm 
              as tired of repeating this as you are of hearing it. One of the 
              many reasons I created this website was so that I would NOT get 
              hammered with the junk that folks are still trying to insist I handle 
              all by myself. There's a huge pile of information on this site, 
              and an active community on the message board. Use them instead of 
              trying to burn me out even faster by sending me email questions/comments 
              that should be handled here.</p>
            <p>More once I'm coherent. I have a ton of recipe pages to fix now.</p>
            <p><span class="dates">03/15/01-3/16/01</span><br>
              Even though folks were told to &quot;check your books&quot; by Verant, 
              scouring the lands high and low has found nothing new in any books. 
              The jewelry book text has been modified a bit, but contains nothing 
              new. The only other &quot;book&quot; is the Terorantula silk stuff, 
              which was live a week ago, and is totally useless until the silk 
              is in game. Arctic wyvern armor doesn't count as new, because the 
              recipe has been in-game since Velious launched, just nonfunctional. 
              There are a couple of new things, but not from any book we've found 
              ... a) there's a new <a href="secrets/recipes_pottery.htm">pottery 
              recipe</a> for a Thurgadin quest, that can be used to make a no 
              drop Thurgadin Gate potion. b) at least one velium weapon can now 
              be smithed, possibly more. It wasn't found from a book, but from 
              experimentation. Keep up the good work on trying stuff out and <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=1787.topic">posting 
              results</a>, folks!</p>
            <p>Bah ... the children are loose on the message boards without their 
              babysitters again. Please ignore them, the more you respond to them, 
              the more likely they are to continue here with their antics. Nuff 
              said.</p>
            <p>I'm pretty fed up/burnt out due to a lot of things right now, and 
              will be taking several steps back to take a few deep breaths. I'll 
              likely be less visible in-game for a while, which means less speedy 
              verification of some information for the site. Hang in there, folks, 
              the idjits may have me down, but I'm not giving up yet.</p>

              <b>Patch Day.</b> After seeing the patch message, I know folks are 
              going to be screaming through here at Mach 20 hoping for news. The 
              front page will be updated as information comes in, but a couple 
              things before the floodgates are opened. Questions, comments, discoveries, 
              etc. go to the message boards, please. Do NOT send me email with 
              patch information - <i>six</i> people have already felt the need 
              to email me telling me there's new tradeskill stuff in this patch 
              (I know folks mean well, but, seriously, I <i>do</i> check patch 
              messages myself). Do NOT tell bomb me to give me information OR 
              to ask if something has been found. I will be BEYOND swamped today 
              trying to verify things, and the more you bother me, the slower 
              you and everyone else, will get the information you want. Nuff said. 
              I shouldn't have to repeat myself on this.</p>
            <p><b>Cod</b> is in game and fished in Cobalt Scar. The <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">arctic 
              wyvern armor</a> makes shaman-only armor. Yes, we've got full stats. 
              No, you don't want to know how much money my guild and I spent to 
              make that many studs and such in prep for today. (And yes, there 
              was an &quot;oops&quot; in the recipe page for a couple hours. It 
              really does need arctic wyvern hides, and the page has been fixed 
              accordingly.)</p>
            <p>As for the many &quot;other&quot; new recipes that were mentioned 
              for the patch ... none have been found. The Terrorantula Silk (aka 
              &quot;steelsilk&quot;) recipes were actually available on a merchant 
              since <i>last</i> patch ... and the silk isn't dropping in-game 
              yet. Since the message said to check our &quot;books&quot;, folks 
              are scrounging recipe books left, right, center and diagonally from 
              all across the lands and have yet to find any of the new recipes 
              in old books, much less in new books. Hmmm ... further discussion 
              is on the message boards. Something may turn up yet, but I'm understandably 
              burnt out from the &quot;sewing bee&quot; earlier today, so I'm 
              taking the rest of the night off from tradeskills ... really. I 
              can do it. I won't try out anything more tonight, even though I 
              have more pel.... &quot;Step away from the sewing kit, DenMother 
              ...&quot;</p>

              <b>Poor Ester the Tester</b> is ill, but she managed to dig up some 
              information for us. Cod is still missing, but it's supposed to go 
              in during tomorrow's patch. Mind you, they've told her this before, 
              and it's not gone in, but I'm going to cross my fingers, toes and 
              eyes that tomorrow, at long last, we'll be able to finally see the 
              <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">arctic wyvern armor</a> that 
              has been dangling in front of our noses since the launch of Velious.

              <b>Patch Day.</b> A happy note for tradesfolk who can never remember 
              what their skill is in a certain tradeskill. Your skills listing 
              will now list your skill level, if it is above 100.</p>
            <p>The frustrating hunt for cod begins .. again. This <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornertailoring.showMessage?topicID=816.topic" target="_new">message 
              board thread</a> will contain updates on our search. Feel free to 
              grab a pole, several stacks of bait, and check out various zones 
              for yourself, then post the information to the boards.</p>
            <p>There is new silk tailoring now to be found on Velious, using crystalline 
              silk and ice burrower silk. All stats are verified for the crystalline 
              silk, but the ice burrowers are not only a higher level mob (Western 
              Wastes), but a lot more expensive, too. :) Soooo, expect it to be 
              a while before we have verified recipes for those. In the meantime, 
              recipes can be found on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious 
              recipes page</a>. Sometime this week I hope to revamp all the tailoring 
              pages, including this one, but at least you can get to the recipes 
              while I'm doing so.</p>

              <b>She's ba-a-a-ck!</b> I'm back in town, though it will take me 
              a few days to catch up on everything. I can now say from personal 
              experience, though, that even a 1-hour flight is a total nightmare 
              when flying with an ear infection. (Ugh) Othmir fur is finally dropping 
              in-game. A few new pieces of the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">velious 
              tailored armor</a> have had recipes/stats verified. A few more stats 
              are in place for imbued jewelry. The enchanted seafarer's weapons 
              for <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_human.htm">human cultural 
              smithing</a> that have been listed as bugged since the September 
              smithing patch may have been changed/deciphered. (The NPC source 
              for this is now apparently asking for enchanted sheets that are 
              made from HQ ore, instead of the original request for enchanted 
              MQ sheets). And ... cod is still totally, 100% believed to be missing. 
              CodFest 2001 was a bust, fishermen and women have thrown down their 
              fishing poles in frustration, and I'm praying something about it 
              will appear on the SONY boards sometime with a confirmation or an 
              ETA.</p>
            <p>As mentioned below, if you have questions, and can't find the information 
              on the site, please post to the message boards instead of filling 
              up my mailbox. You're far more likely to get a response if you post 
              there. :)</p>

              <b>Patch Day ... and the DenMother runs away!</b> Murphy and his 
              laws caught up to me again, and instead of having a &quot;leisurely&quot; 
              24 hours in which to verify patches to tradeskill stuff before going 
              out of town, I ended up with far less time. (Tunare was down for 
              the count for a while this afternoon, and once it was back up, and 
              I'd fished my way through a couple hundred bait, it was time for 
              me to go down for the count and take a nap!)</p>
            <p>I've managed to verify only a few things today: gator rolls (had 
              been bugged since launch, I think) now work with the in-book <a href="secrets/recipes_baking.htm">recipe</a>, 
              holgresh fur cap and boots are working (email verification from 
              someone on the cap, though it failed; I made the boots, and stats 
              are on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious tailoring</a> 
              page). Some stealth-additions to <a href="secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">imbued 
              jewelry</a> went in, and while I'm very under-impressed with the 
              Karana imbue (and many other imbues from Jan 31, such as Niami's 
              Bristlebane imbue), I'm ecstatic over the Tribunal imbue.</p>
            <p>Sadly, our cod fishing expedition met with no luck. We only had 
              time to test 40 to 60 fish in each of the following zones before 
              we put away our fishing poles in frustration, but either these fish 
              are somewhere really odd in Velious, or they've broken the pattern 
              of all other Velious tailoring recipes, and need a spawn from another 
              continent. (Iceclad, Eastern Wastes, Kael Drakkel, Great Divide, 
              Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Skyshrine, Sirens Grotto and Western 
              Wastes were all fish-tested today.) Soooo, the 40 velium bits and 
              dozen arctic wyvern hides that my guild helped me collect will have 
              to sit in the bank a while longer, and we have an entire suit of 
              tailored armor that still can't be made. If anyone finds cod (and 
              please, no &quot;friend of a friend of a friend of mine&quot; stories) 
              PLEASE post to the message board ... there's a thread in the tailoring 
              section about our most recent attempts.</p>
            <p>A lot of the patch stuff is not yet verified ... and I'm running 
              away!? Yep. I'll be out of town until next Tuesday. <font color="#400000"><b>If

              that read this site wait for days on end for me to process my email

              stuff that could be handled better on the boards. I can't tell you 
              how many times I get email on things that are stated on the recipes 
              pages, location pages, etc., or have been beaten to death on the 
              message boards, yet still, several folks have to send me email with 
              questions about it. Seriously, folks ... there's a HUGE tradeskill 
              community discussing things on these message boards, and if you're 
              relying on one single halfling for your information via email instead 
              of going to the message boards and relying on all the folks there, 
              you're not only overloading the wee halfling, but there's an increasingly 
              high chance that your questions will not get answered. (Especially 
              if you join the 30+ folks who believe I'm holding back some &quot;secret&quot; 
              to finding the yew leaf ground spawn, and that by sending me email, 
              my answer posted on the recipes page will change. Random means just 
              that ... we can't find a pattern or specific area of Wakening Lands. 
              Asking me over and over again in email won't change that answer. 
              /bonk) For those of you great folks who are reporting in trivial 
              levels and such, much as I LOVE getting such confirmations, if you 
              could start posting that stuff to the message boards instead of 
              mail-bombing me, it makes it easier for others to see the info, 
              and gives me a chance to address it when I'm dealing with site updates, 
              instead of keeping it in unread mail for days on end. :) </p>

              Recipes for these pieces are found on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">Velious 
              recipes</a> page. Stats for any pieces that have been made are listed. 
              If you don't see stats for the piece you want, I haven't made it 
              yet, and nobody else who has made it has reported it to me yet. 
              Do not ask me for them, I can't give them to you if I don't have 
              them. If you want something more up-to-date than the recipes pages 
              that I sometimes update several times a day, check the message boards. 
              Do NOT email bomb me asking for more details. There is an entire 
              HUGE community of tradesfolk on the message boards, several of whom 
              can likely answer your questions in a more timely manner than me. 
              To expect me to answer up to 100 pieces of email a day for information 
              that is either clearly printed on the recipes pages, or easily answered 
              on the message boards is silly.</p>
            <p>Those of you who have been loyal followers, and have been showering 
              the boards and my mailbox with your words of support, thank you. 
              I feel a bit better now. Last night was a bit more tolerable, with 
              only one person not wanting to accept my response to &quot;PLEASE 
              visit the website instead of asking me for info&quot;, and sending 
              me another dozen tells while I was, amazingly enough, trying to 
              keep a guildmate of his alive in Kael. Errrmmm. Hopefully word will 
              eventually go out that my tolerance for tell nukes in game is gone. 
              If not, I'll let my &quot;bodyguard&quot; take care of 'em. ;)</p>
            <p>A few more of the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">velious 
              tailoring recipes</a> have been verified, and Bristlebane smiled 
              upon me a bit. There were actually more successes than usual on 
              this extremely difficult and extremely frustrating armor ... and 
              some of the pieces may actually be worth wearing.</p>
              <p><b>02/04/01<br>
              </b> Weekend update: Post-patch news. <a href="secrets/recipes_smithing_human.htm">Field 
              plate</a> boots are now fixed, but imbued versions are still DNC. 
              The <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">holgresh fur</a> cap and 
              boots that were to be fixed are also still broken. Some <a href="secrets/recipes_jewlcraft_imbued.htm">imbued 
              jewelry</a> combinations were implemented, and we've heard that 
              there is more in the works. There is also supposedly something in 
              the works so that the &quot;missing link&quot; between non-cultural 
              tailoring and the extremely difficult velium tailoring will be implemented 
              eventually.</p>
            <p>This brings me to an interesting point, and yes, it means you get 
              to hear another mini-vent here. &lt;g&gt; I was treated rather condescendinly 
              by someone on my server the other day because I am &quot;wasting&quot; 
              my time on the velium tailoring before my halfing racial tailoring 
              was maxxed. (Mind you, this same fellow then tried to hound me into 
              giving/selling/trading haze panther skins, so that he, with his 
              lesser skill, could have the chance to make these items, but that's 
              another story.) I am working on velium tailoring for one reason, 
              and one reason only ... all you folks. I, at least, am enough of 
              a stubborn redhead to keep trying until all the recipes are verified, 
              and the stats are known. There is nothing more frustrating to a 
              tailor to make repeated expensive and time-consuming attempts at 
              making armor, only to find that when you <i>do</i> end up with a 
              success, that the item you've made is nowhere near worth the work 
              you put into it. By collecting as much information as possible on 
              DNCs and stats, I hope that many of you tailors can focus on trying 
              to make the pieces that <i>are</i> worth your while. (Each set seems 
              to have some great items, and some items that no person over level 
              20 would want.) For those of you who are going to sneer at me as 
              being &quot;foolish&quot; by &quot;wasting&quot; my time on this 
              stuff, while being hypocritical enough to then try to get me to 
              collect pelts for you ... keep it up and you'll find that while 
              I've been the soul of politeness so far, I am well capable of using 
              /ignore ... and the rest of my guild is too. You ARE making use 
              of the fruits of my research on this site, and as such, you have 
              no right to snipe at how that research is done.</p>
            <p><b>01/31/01:</b> LOTS of tradeskill changes/fixes/additions went 
              in with today's patch, and, frankly, I'm more than overwhelmed. 
              PLEASE have patience and do NOT harass the DenMother either in-game 
              or via email demanding stats/recipes, etc. on this stuff. The message 
              boards have threads about the imbued jewelry (I'm underwhelmed, 
              but at least my deity's gem finally makes ... something), stackable 
              velium &amp; mithril boning, etc. It's still going to take days/weeks 
              to verify that everything that was promised now works as planned. 
              To save a lot of duplication of effort, if you have verified something, 
              and you don't see it listed on the site as being verified/fixed, 
              post it to the message boards. This lets everyone else know that 
              it's working (or not, as the case may be), and saves me from multiple 
              pieces of email all saying basically the same thing.</p>
              <p><b>01/29/01</b>: I ended up NOT out of town 
              for the weekend, but still took a much-needed break from tradeskilling, 
              email and the message boards. It's gotten more than a little bit 
              crazed when I'm on my two primary personas, the sheer amount of 
              tells I'm getting from total strangers about the site, about the 
              new velium leathers, etc. While it's exciting to know my site is 
              so popular, it can be exhausting as well, especially when I'm in 
              the middle of a Hate raid, or something equally dangerous that requires 
              my full attention. To answer one of the more commonly asked questions: 
              No, I'm not selling my tailoring experiments right now, and I'm 
              not taking orders or setting prices, either. I'm sorry, but this 
              is far too much a time-eater right now, and my main focus is verifying 
              recipes, and then verifying stats on different pieces. Write down 
              those <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">recipes</a>, start the 
              hours of collecting all the pieces needed times ten, and find another 
              skilled tailor/smith/brewer to try it for you. You'll save yourself, 
              and me, a lot of extra grief. ;)</p>
            <p>Hopefully I'll get enough parts to verify a few more recipes in 
              the coming week. The tigeraptor is likely to be my main focus, thanks 
              to the foraging efforts of Tytania. Once I can snag several guildmates, 
              I also hope to have a couple more pieces of cobalt drake armor made 
              in the next week, and hopefully the monk boots. Rogue armor will 
              come as I manage to find haze panthers willing to drop their pelts.</p>
            <p>On another happy note, Niami is probably one of the most purple 
              female halflings on my server. I'd not realized how super rare female 
              halfling clerics were until I started randomly running amok in Hate. 
              She's got two more pieces to go, but if you see her up in Hate at 
              all in the coming week, it either means a) tradeskills got to be 
              too much again, or b) I got a chance I couldn't refuse. ;) </p>
            <p><b>01/23/01</b>: Velium tailoring is taking up a LOT of my attention. 
              For those of you who are finding this site due to mention of new 
              tailored monk, rogue, ranger, etc. armor on the net, it's a royal 
              bear to make and the stats you see on the <a href="secrets/recipes_velious.htm">recipes</a> 
              page are truly all we've discovered yet. There's also a lot of discussion, 
              and a few screen shots, on the Tailoring forum in the message boards. 
              Other folks are busy working on the new brewing recipes, as well 
              as muddling their way through the Thurgadin baking quests, etc. 
              I'll be out of town, and out of game from Thursday through Tuesday. 
              Site updates will be slow during that time. It may also give me 
              a chance to calm down more from a bad customer service experience 
              I had in-game, to where I can write up a proper complaint letter 
              instead of a flaming mad redheaded hissy fit.</p>
            <p>On a happier note, my personal thanks to my guild (<a href="haven/index.html">Voidrunners</a>, 
              on Tunare) for not only dealing with the crazed tailor-fest talk 
              in guildspeak, and their frenzied leader/DenMother, but also for 
              the massive, and I do mean massive, collection efforts. Thanks to 
              them, I was able to make many more attempts at armor today, and 
              got stats for several more monk pieces, and the rogue boots. (Droolific 
              boots ... makes me wish I had a rogue in my lineup.) Also thanks 
              to Tevren on Tunare for his kind financial &quot;sponsorship&quot; 
              of this experimentation. Hopefully he'll be pleased with the results.</p>
              <p><b>January 19:</b> A year ago today, EQ Traders Corner was considered 
              &quot;big&quot; enough to need a better message board, and the boards 
              were moved to EZ Board. The site was already about 9 months old 
              at that time, but still had a pretty small following. And I was 
              <i>still</i> kicking and screaming about making recipes available 
              on my site, since many folks still considered it a &quot;cheat&quot;.</p>
            <p>What a difference a year has made! There have been almost a half 
              million hits to <i>just</i> the message boards in that amount of 
              time. While traffic tracking on the website itself was hazy while 
              the site was hosted by Webcom, the numbers I did see were enough 
              to impress me. More recent surges in traffic, have, of course, increased 
              my workload yet again, and I am working on volunteers to take some 
              of the load off me.</p>
            <p>Recipes abound on the site now, and are regularly added to by an 
              active tradeskill community. These are not static recipes culled 
              from books and then forgotten, but recipes that are actively tested 
              and corrected by many folks across all the servers. I've been told 
              that it's likely the most complete and accurate collection on the 
              net. If this is true, then it's because of all you folks who stop 
              in, and take some time to add to the knowledge pool. I &quot;just&quot; 
              do the gruntwork of getting it all organized, run around testing 
              rumors and new stuff, and vent just like everyone else when I blow 
              several hundred plat only to find that a recipe that was supposed 
              to be patched is still broken.</p>
            <p>Several times I've hit tradeskill burnout, and almost given up, 
              not just on tradeskills, but on the site. However, we've built such 
              a wonderful supportive community here that it's been hard to stay 
              away. Yes, &quot;we&quot; have built ... I could not have done it 
              without all the information folks have helped cull, and, equally 
              important, all the warm fuzzies I've received from folks. While 
              I've received my share of annoyances from folks who would rather 
              tell bomb me in game insisting I teach them everything there is 
              to know about x, y, z while I'm in the middle of a dangerous hunt, 
              these have been counterbalanced by a LOT of lovely compliments and 
              moral support.</p>
            <p>Those of you who are active &quot;regulars&quot; on the boards 
              have proven to me what a strong, dedicated community EQ Traders 
              Corner really is. You come from every server, every race, every 
              class, joined together by a love/hate relationship with tradeskills. 
              You're, for the most part, well mannered, and willing to help out 
              others when they wander in with questions. (Really, all you newcomers, 
              it <i>is</i> ok to admit ignorance of tradeskills with this group, 
              we'll be gentle with you.) </p>
            <p>The rude snerts who wander through rarely last for long before 
              the regulars slap them down ... if I don't get to them first. Last 
              night, in fact, was the first time we had a serious case 100% inappropriate 
              personal attacks and outright filth in a post. It didn't last long, 
              and it's the first time I've used the EZBoard tools to block a user 
              from further posting. We are a tradeskill community. If you want 
              to do a personal flame against someone else, take it somewhere else, 
              as it has no benefit to us, and we just plain don't want to see 
              it. </p>
            <p><b>January 12: </b>Ouffff. The last several days have been exhausting, 
              to say the least, not only for myself, but my husband Adam. Round 
              one of the site redesign, and the move to site hosting under <a href="http://www.refplace.com">Refplace</a>. 
              Most of you folks won't even see this news update for a few days, 
              as we're still link-checking and such before doing the DNS change, 
              but it will be ready and waiting for you once everything goes &quot;live&quot;.</p>
            <p>A lot has been going on, in regards to the site, and there's still 
              plenty more to go. I appreciate everyone's patience as we get through 
              this set of growing pains, and look forward to providing you with 
              even more site enhancements as time goes on. Of course, as evidenced 
              by the message boards and my mailbox, I can't please everyone, and 
              no matter how hard I try, some small portion of folks are going 
              to complain because I don't have everything they want to see. Some 
              days it frustrates me, other days I just shrug and go on. I don't 
              put this much time and effort into this site for the ones who can 
              only complain, anyway ... I do it for the rest of you fabulous tradesfolk 
              who have enlivened the message boards, my mailbox, and the site, 
              with your comments, added information, suggestions, and just plain 
              &quot;warm fuzzies&quot;.</p>
            <p>Some of the holiday warm fuzzies came at just the right time, when 
              I was feeling pretty burnt out, and overwhelmed by the thought of 
              the site move (at the time I still had no &quot;home&quot; for it) 
              and the redesign. Lots of you helped in many ways, and a few bigger 
              emails really made me feel good about the site.</p>
            <p>First came Woody Hearn of <a href="http://www.gucomics.com">/gu 
              comics</a>. In the time that his site has been up, he's not only 
              had 2 million hits to his site, but made t-shirts from his more 
              well-known comics, and brought tears of laughter to myself and my 
              guild. It definitely helps add some perspective and humor to the 
              often-frustrating, but quite addictive, land of EverQuest. Little 
              had I known that he'd been a silent visitor to my site for longer 
              than he'd been doing /gu. His offer of artwork was gladly accepted 
              (the first pieces are currently up in the smithing and tailoring 
              portion of the Learn a Skill pages), and while I've been running 
              20 directions at once, I've got my eye on a few more pieces, and 
              have some ideas percolating that he may wish to turn into more comics.</p>
            <p>On the same day, came email from the wife of <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net" target="_new">Lum 
              the Mad</a>. It seems she is another another trade skill junkie 
              like myself. (&quot;Hello, my name is Niami DenMother and I am a 
              trade skill junkie.&quot;) While I didn't take her up on the site 
              hosting option, her warm fuzzies regarding the site were definitely 
              appreciated, and I'm sure we'll have many chats regarding trade 
              skills in days to come.</p>
            <p>Then came the mail from Rory from <a href="http://www.refplace.com" target="_new">Refplace</a>/<a href="http://www.eqportal.com" target="_new">EQPortal</a>, 
              with a site hosting offer that was too good to pass up. Turnaround 
              time has been wonderfully fast, and his help has been greatly appreciated. 
              He also hosts Fulcrum's Tinkering site, and the Tal Kor Jewelry 
              Academy (currently inactive, but a well done site).</p>
            <p>Yesterday came the happy news that the fledgling Fashion section 
              is going to be managed by my newly-appointed Fashion Editor, FeistyGirl. 
              (She made up the initial fashion pages, and has been hosting them 
              on her site until we could get settled in our new home. While she's 
              weaning herself away from EQ, she's volunteered to take on our cultural 
              fashion archive, and a <a href="mailto:fashion@eqtraders.com">mailbox</a> 
              should be set up shortly for submitting screen shots of cultural 
              armor.)</p>
            <p><b>January 6:</b> Happy Gnoll Ears! Um ... Gnu Fear ... um ... 
              something like that. The faster I go, the behinder I get, and while 
              I have the best of New Year's intentions to get caught up on things, 
              I know I'm likely to let a few things fall through the cracks. the 
              site hit another spurt of popularity, my mailbox is overflowing, 
              my old web hosting provider is no longer an option, and the site 
              will be moving and undergoing a redesign in the next few days. Thankfully, 
              the changes should be pretty seamless from a visitor point of view, 
              and you'll just wander here some day and find us with a slightly 
              new look, better navigation, and the same old URL.</p>
            <p>I had several folks offer webspace and hosting options and basically 
              got an offer that was too sweet to refuse. Advertising still may 
              be coming down the line, but won't be happening from day 1. When/if 
              the advertising becomes a reality, the message boards would have 
              to be moved, so that EQTC instead of EZBoard is making the profit 
              from my traffic, but we'll deal with that eventuality when/if it 
              happens.</p>
            <p> I <i>still</i> need to contact all the folks that volunteered 
              to do site work, and figure out who is going to help with what, 
              but it was hard to do much when I didn't know where the site was 
              going to be, etc. I hope to have email out to them this weekend 
              to coordinate things.</p>
            <p>The next news post you will see should be from the new webserver. 
              Wish me luck!</p>
