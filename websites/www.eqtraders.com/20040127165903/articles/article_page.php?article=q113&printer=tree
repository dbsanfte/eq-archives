<p>
<p>
This is one of several armor quests for younglings that was recently added. This one is for evil Freeport human clerics, and is HUM/CLR, Innoruuk, no drop and lore (other than bracer). <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
Questgiver is Zhem Xecia in East FP tunnel. The "Dismal Priest" armor is a matte dark rust color of fine plate, and the helm has little horns near the forehead.

Once you have been properly outfitted return to me and will offer you [further instruction].'

Do you plan to construct a [dismal priest helm], a [dismal priest bracer], [dismal priest gauntlets], [dismal priest boots], [dismal priest vambraces], [dismal priest greaves], or a [dismal priest breastplate].'

Zhem Xecia says 'So you think you are ready to face the enemies of the Dismal Rage? Be careful to not be blinded by your arrogance or anger. You must focus the rage in your soul and refine it into patient and insidious hatred. A cleric of the Sentries of Passion, Ulia Yovar, has been attempting to uncover our allies among the citizens of Freeport and is believed to be in hiding in the sewer tunnels under the western quarter of Freeport. Seek this enemy of the Dismal Rage and bring me her head.'
</p>
<p>
<i>Final quest reward unknown at this time. There have been reports that Ulia may not be dropping her head when killed.</i>
