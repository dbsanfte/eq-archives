<span class="headers">A Non-Tailor's Guide to Getting Tailored Velious Armors</span>
<p>
<p class="headers">by Starcryst (Seventh Hammer)</p>

            <p>For those non-tailors who are interested in Velious items, some 
              advice - some of the components needed are relatively easy to get 
              and others represent the real gating factor in getting that super 
              item you want. Having 25 Tigeraptor hides doesn't help a tailor 
              when the holdup is gathering 300 small pieces of velium (and buying 
              the 200 coldain tempers at 27 pp each) for the 25 studded Tigeraptor 
              hide cloaks you'd like attempted.</p>
            <p>Here is a list of velious armors and the relative difficulties 
              in acquiring components for them. If you are intent upon collecting 
              components so that your local tailor can make attempts at a specific 
              piece of armor, focus on getting the tough stuff first. </p>
            <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Tigeraptor Armor: Tigeraptor Hides (easy), Drake Eggs (hard), 
                Velium Studs(hard) </li>
              <li>Wyvern Hide: Wyvern Hides (easy), Codfish Oil (easy), Velium 
                Studs (hard)</li>
              <li>Cobalt Drake Armor: Cobalt Drake Hides (hard), Drake Eggs (hard), 
                Velium Boning (easy)</li>
              <li>Black Panther Armor: Panther Skins (easy), Yew Leaves (VERY 
                hard), Velium Boning (easy) </li>
              <li>Haze Panther Armor: Haze Panther Skins (very hard), Yew Leaves 
                (VERY hard), Velium Boning (easy) </li>
              <li>Othmir Fur Items: Othmir Fur (hard), Clear Vials of Mana (Easy), 
                Silver Thread (Very Easy)</li>
              <li>Holgresh Fur Items: Holgresh Pelts (hard), Distilled Vials of 
                Mana (hard), Gold Thread (easy) </li>
              <li>Velium Hound Items: Velium Hound Furs (hard), Purified mana 
                (hard), Platinum Thread (easy - but expensive!) </li>
              <li> Ice Silk Armor: Ice Burrower Silk (very hard), Purified mana 
                (hard), Platinum Thread (easy - but expensive!) </li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>
            <p>Velium Boning is easy because small velium bricks drop fairly frequently 
              off of miners in Crystal Caverns and each brick makes one boning 
              and requires only one coldain temper. </p>
            <p>Velium Studs are hard because small velium pieces drop slightly 
              less frequently than the bricks do and it take 6 pieces and four 
              coldain tempers to make two studs. (They can only be made two at 
              a time.) Therefore they are more than three times harder to acquire 
              than boning and cost twice as much. </p>
            <p>Othmir pelts should be easier to get, but few people choose to 
              hunt the cute little fez wearing bipeds, seeing as they are the 
              only merchants in Cobalt Scar and they give out nice quests to people 
              friendly to them</p>
            <p>If you focus on gathering, buying or stealing the hard components 
              for your friendly high level tailor, they will be able to make more 
              attempts at the armor you're after. If you collect the easy components, 
              then you're just asking to have your bank, mule and friends characters 
              all filled with hides for months while said tailor scrounges for 
              the hard items they need to use your pelts... </p>
