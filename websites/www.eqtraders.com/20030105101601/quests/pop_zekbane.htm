            <h3> Dark Courage (Zek-bane Weapons) Quests<br>
            </h3>
            <p>Special weapons are needed when facing the god of War (Rallos Zek). 
              Several folks have worked very hard to solve the quests, based on 
              very sketchy in-game hints. These items, of course, require the 
              Planes of Power expansion.
            <p>There are two types of Zek bane weapons, and there are at least 
              six varieties of each (1HS, 2HS, 1HB, Hand to Hand, 1H Piercing, 
              and Archery). Each variety of the first type is called &quot;Dark 
              Courage,&quot; regardless of which version you make. The second 
              type, which is made by forging your Dark Courage with a special 
              temper to turn it into a Black Insanity, is identical to the first 
              but with higher bane damage vs. Zek.
            <p>The source for the original information comes from NPC Eriak, an 
              ogre located deep in the Plane of Tactics. He responds differently 
              based on which of the Zek flags you have completed at the time. 
              Original hail text is not available.
            <p>The initial out-of-game spoiler, based on much research, <a href="pop_zekbane_poem.htm">was 
              provided in poem form to the EQTC message board community</a>. The 
              author of the poem has kindly provided the following information: 
            <p><b>DARK COURAGE </b></p>
            <p>To make a Dark courage, you must forge: <br>
              -drunder's steel (stackable, non-lore) <br>
              -a plusing blue vial (stackable, non-lore) <br>
              -appropriate molds to create the specific variety of Dark Courage 
              you want </p>
            <p>Trivial for this combine is between 11 and 28, and appears to be 
              a no-fail combine.</p>
            <p><b>Drunder's Steel </b><br>
              Drunder's Steel is made in a forge (verified to work in a Tanaan 
              forge, not tried in an older-expansion forge) by combining: <br>
              -Decorin Ore Shard <br>
              -Water Flask </p>
            <p>Decorin Ore Shards (non-stackable, LORE, NO DROP), come from Animated 
              Decorin Blades, which spawn only after Tagrin Maldric, the giant 
              troll in the depths of Tactics, has been aggro'ed. They continue 
              to spawn for the duration of the Tagrin fight, but it has been my 
              experience that only the first several will drop ore shards. We 
              have never been able to get more than 6 ore shards in one attempt 
              (although it's possible we had a few blades carrying ore shards 
              despawn) before all the rest of the blades dropped nothing but a 
              &quot;Useless Hunk of Metal&quot; (which really is useless, at least 
              as far as Zek banery goes). You don't actually have to fight Tagrin 
              to get blades to spawn, since their spawning is only tied to his 
              being aggroed, and they don't despawn immediately if he calms down 
              (making use of this tidbit of information is left as an exercise 
              for the reader). But there still seems to be a limit on the number 
              of shards you can get at one time. In an hour we got 6, and then 
              for two hours we a constant stream of useless hunks. In that time, 
              Tagrin had been aggroed and deaggroed dozens of times. Eventually, 
              we got tired and killed him. :p </p>
            <p>The steel is trivial at 250, and is not trivial at 193. It was 
              failed at 135, and succesfully made at 193. I have not failed in 
              14 sheets at 250. This means a high skill smith will have to loot 
              these NODROP, LORE items. The decorin blade corpses rot in 8 minutes. 
              You may want to take a lot of smiths. Or, if you're very clever, 
              you may be interested to know that player corpses (regular or duel-created) 
              return to the nice, safe zone-in/zone-out of Tactics in about 21 
              minutes, and that having a lore item on a corpse doesn't mean you 
              can't loot another. </p>
            <p><b>A Pulsing Blue Vial </b><br>
              This is made by combining, in a brew barrel (again, verified Tanaan, 
              unverified whether it works in others): <br>
              -valorium shards (stackable, no-drop, NON-lore) <br>
              -celestial solvent </p>
            <p>Valorium Shards come from just about everything in the desert in 
              the Plane of Valor. This combine is trivial at 250, and not trivial 
              at 187. I have never failed at 250, and I have had friends go 6 
              for 8 at 187, and 1 for 4 at 135-ish. </p>
            <p>Known Mold Combinations:<br>
              Dark Courage (1H Piercing version): Hilt Mold, Dagger Blade Mold 
              <br>
              Dark Courage (2H Slashing version): Hilt Mold, Heavy Steel Blade 
              Mold </p>
            <p><b>BLACK INSANITY </b></p>
            <p>Black Insanities are nicer than Dark Courages since they have higher 
              bane damage. To make them, you must forge: <br>
              -your Dark Courage <br>
              -a pulsing black vial </p>
            <p>Again, this is trivial at 11, non-trivial at 28, and is probably 
              a no-fail combine. </p>
            <p><b>A Pulsing Black Vial </b><br>
              To make this last temper, you must combine in a brew barrel: <br>
              -insanity fangs (stackable, no-drop, NON-lore) <br>
              -celestial solvent <br>
              -A vial of black blood (NODROP, LORE) </p>
            <p>Insanity fangs come from any of the four types of constructs in 
              the plane of Torment. This combine is trivial at 250, and I've never 
              failed it. That's all the information I have about trivials for 
              this step. </p>
            <p>A vial of black blood comes from Eriak deep in Tactics (in the 
              same room as Tagrin, in fact, right where the basement zone out 
              is). Ask him &quot;What Blood?&quot; and he'll give it to you. Remember, 
              it's NODROP and LORE, but the pulsing black vial is droppable. How 
              to get enough of these to your people with the nodrop insanity fangs 
              is left as an exercise to the reader. A rogue with shroud of stealth 
              who loots insanity fangs will have a particularly easy time. You 
              may or may not have to be a good brewer for this step. </p>
            <p>------------ </p>
            <p>Combines, in Brief: </p>
            <p>PULSING BLUE VIAL <br>
              Brew Barrel: Valorium Shards + Celestial Solvent </p>
            <p>PULSING BLACK VIAL <br>
              Brew Barrel: Insanity Fangs + A vial of black blood + Celestial 
              Solvent </p>
            <p>DRUNDER'S STEEL <br>
              Forge: Decorin Ore Shard + Water Flask </p>
            <p>DARK COURAGE <br>
              Forge: Pulsing Blue Vial + Drunder's Steel + Appropriate Molds </p>
            <p>BLACK INSANITY <br>
              Forge: Dark Courage + Pulsing Black Vial </p>
