            <p>Just why did I make this site anyway? Partly for myself, since 
              I was gathering some of this knowledge anyway; partly for others 
              trying trade skills, and partly for those trying to buy made items.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>For myself:</b> When I was a wee young halfling, I spent a lot 
              of time trying to find everything I needed to practice my trades 
              in my home city of choice ... and failed. It required a lot of searching, 
              running around, repeat zoning, and other things that made the trade 
              skills ... frustrating. As I finally found the supplies I needed, 
              it made sense to make notes and to share that information, in hopes 
              that others would also contribute their knowledge of zones I could 
              not yet reach. From that little kernel, this site has grown, and 
              grown, and grown.</p>
            <p><b>For others trying trade skills:</b> There's a great feeling 
              of accomplishment when you successfully make your first trade item, 
              but there can be a lot of frustration as well. In game recipes may 
              be vague, or incorrect. Trade supplies may be cleverly hidden, or 
              totally unavailable in your current area. You will find many items 
              on this site to give you a helping hand -- basic information on 
              the skill, knowledge of how to find trade items in your area, recipes 
              that have been tested and verified, forums in which to discuss your 
              tradeskill, and an opportunity to sell your finished product to 
              a wider audience. Trade skills will grow and change as the world 
              grows and changes, merchant locations will come and go, but at least 
              I hope to give you a fighting chance at getting that feeling of 
              accomplishment as you hold your first homeade edible goo, that first 
              piece of handmade patchwork leather armor, those first metals studs, 
              etc.</p>
            <p><b>For those who are simply shopping:</b> Welcome! We recently 
              changed over to a message board format for those selling, and buying, 
              player-made items. It may be a bit sparse for the first little while, 
              but I hope to have more merchants listed soon as word goes out. 
              Once your server has a decent-sized listing of folks for you to 
              shop from, perhaps you'll be able to squelch much ofthat auctioning 
              going on in your head in-game. Other parts of the site may also 
              be of interest to you: learning exactly what time, effort and materials 
              goes into that piece of racial armor you are drooling over might 
              give you a better understanding of why you hear folks auctioning 
              things in your head for prices you might initially feel is high. 
              Once you do the math, you may find that they're barely making a 
              profit. Then again, they may just be greedy, but you'll probably 
              have a good feel for which it is when you see the myriad of trade 
              items they have to find for their craft. You'll also likely find 
              the armor and weapon stats pages to be of interest, so you can see 
              what other player-made items might be of use to your specific race/class/deity.</p>
