            <ul>
              <li><b>Trivial listings, new recipes, additions, corrections</b> 
                - please post them to the message boards. This way others can 
                see the information while it's waiting to be added to the web 
                pages, and I don't get email-spammed with several copies of the 
                same information. ;)</li>
              <li><b>Tradeskill guides:</b> Erm ... our tradeskill guide editor 
                went MIA. We're working on a replacement ... hold that thought, 
                please. </li>
              <li><b>Screen shots of player-made armor:</b> Erm ... again, another 
                MIA volunteer ... we're working on it</li>
              <li><b>Locations for trade materials in each city and zone:</b> 
                If your favorite merchant is missing from the Trade Supplies list, 
                or they've started offering a trade skill item for sale that's 
                not on the list, please post merchant information to the message 
                boards. Make sure that you a) are looking in the proper zone listing 
                before you say they are missing (for example a merchant in East 
                Commons is listed in the East Commons listing, not in Freeport), 
                b) you mention in the post the zone name, merchant name, location, 
                and item sold. Vague &quot;someone in WK is selling some fishing 
                stuff&quot; means a lot of extra work by others, chasing needles 
                in haystacks.</li>
              <li><b>Merchants wanted!</b> You want to make money, I want to help 
                you hook up with players who need your goods. If you've got tradeskill 
                items to sell, or a skill to offer (i.e., wedding services, weapon 
                sharpening, guide services) go to the Marketplace message boards 
                with your ad. Please be sure to post under the proper server forum 
                and include all important information, specifically what you are 
                offering (i.e., not just "I'm a tailor", but what types of tailored 
                items you can/will make), and your in-game name. And if you wish, 
                include your contact information in the post. Make sure you are 
                NOT selling phat l00t, selling/trading accounts, etc. The Marketplace 
                is for tradeskills only, please.</li>
