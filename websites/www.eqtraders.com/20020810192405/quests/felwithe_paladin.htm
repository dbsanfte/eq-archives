              Seria Woodwind says 'Hail friend. I am Seria Woodwind of the Royal 
              Order of the Koada'Vie, the defenders of Felwithe. I assist young 
              Koada'Dal that are called into Tunares service as a paladin in learning 
              the ways of the Koada'Vie so that one-day they too may bear that 
              noble title. Do you [wish to become a member] of the Koada'Vie?'</P>

              Seria Woodwind says 'As a defender of Felwithe you will be required 
              to face much of the evil that inhabits the lands of Norrath. We 
              do not sit idle and wait for the enemy to arrive at our gates before 
              taking action towards the safety of our citizens. Every Koada'Vie 
              initiate should acquire a [suit of armor] to aid in protecting themselves

            <P>You say, 'what further instruction'<BR>
              Seria Woodwind says 'Our diviner in the Keepers of the Art have 
              discovered that a Teir`Dal agent of the Ebon Mask, the spies and 
              assassins of the Teir`Dal has been lurking around the Faydarks and 
              communicating intelligence to the orcs of Clan Crushbone. We believe 
              the spy can be lured out of hiding if his primary orc contact, a 
              crushbone centurion by the name of Relgle, is eliminated on route 
              to their rendezvous location. Find this Centurion Relgle, slay him 
              for his crimes against the Koada`Dal, then do the same to his Teir`Dal 
              ally. Bring me both their heads when the deed is done.' 
            <P>Killing the Centurion Relgie and an ebon mask spy and returning 
              the heads to Seria yields this
            <p>Seria Woodwin says' Good work. King Tearis Thex and the Royal Order 
              of Koada Vie shall be released. Take this Dull Felwithe Defender's 
              Sword to a forge and sharpen it with a sharpening stone. It may 
              take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. 
              Once that is accomplished bring me the Sharp Felwithe Defender's 
              Sword, a Pristine Forest Drakeling Scales, and an Arborean Amber 
              and i will put the finishing touches on the weapon.</p>
            <p>You receive a Dull Felwithe Defenders Sword (Lore). Combine that 
              in the forge with a sharpening stone (there is a skill check on 
              this, and the sword is returned on a failure) to receive a Sharp 
              Felwithe Defenders Sword (Lore). Further details on the completion 
              of this weapon quest are not available at this time.<br>
