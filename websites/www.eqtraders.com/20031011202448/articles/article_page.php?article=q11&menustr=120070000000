<span class="headers">Rivervale Cleric (Stoutdeacon) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several new youngling armor quests based in Rivervale. All
results from this quest are HFL/CLR only, and are lore (other than the bracer),
no drop. Combines are no fail and do allow some minor skill increases in
blacksmithing. Armor is a greenish gold in color. Please note that while the
bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer
before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'It is a pleasure to meet you _____. I am Thekela Meepup,
one of the highest ranking Clerics in all of Rivervale. I pride myself on being
the mentor for all of the furryfooted that are called upon by Bristlebane to
give life. If you are a [Cleric] I might have some training for you to complete
if you so wish. '
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i am a cleric'
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says '_____ the Templar. Well I suppose that does have quite a
nice ring to it don't you say? If you stick with your training perhaps this
could be what you are referred to one day. Before that day though, you have a
lot to learn and a lot of training ahead of you! Do you want to [begin your
training] at this time? '
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i want to begin my training'
</p>
<p>Thekela Meepup says 'Excellent! I will give you a variety of items to collect
and combine in this magical assembly kit to create a material that you will use
to craft armor. My hope is that as you gather these items you will learn about
your home and how to navigate around the surrounding areas of the Vale. If you
are ready to begin your adventure I will present you with your Magical Mail
Assembly Kit and the instructions for collecting the necessary items to craft
your armor. Are you [ready to receive your Magical Mail Assembly Kit]? '
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i am ready to receive my Magical Mail Assembly Kit'
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'Here you are _____. Take this mail assembly kit, it is
what you will use to combine the different items necessary to craft your own
Platemail of the Stoutdeacon. Different combinations of items will be required
from both our town and the hunting grounds in the thicket to create materials
for specific armor pieces with Crude Iron Ore being the basis for all of your
armor materials. When you are ready to receive a recipe for a specific material
simply tell me what armor piece you [want] to craft. I will then supply you with
the mold and recipe for Stoutdeacon Platemail [Helms], [Bracers], [Boots],
[Armguards], [Greaves], [Gloves] and [Breastplates]. '
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i want to craft Helm' ( must be singular)
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'Your Helm of the Stoutdeacon will indeed be one of the
most important pieces of your armor set. It is very important that you are well
protected from any blows to the head while you are on the battlefield. To
fashion together the material necessary for making your helm gather 2 Bricks of
Crude Iron Ore, 1 Low Quality Wolf Skin, 1 Chunk of Meat and 2 Water Flasks then
combine them in your assembly kit. Once you have the correct Helm material take
it to the closest forge, along with this pattern and combine them to create your
Helm of the Stoutdeacon. '
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Completed helm is AC 5, WIS 1, AGI 2, wt 3.0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'i want to craft Bracer'
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'You will be required to gather most of the items for
your bracer material from the Misty Thicket. You will need to collect 2 Bricks
of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Bixie Stinger, 1 Runnyeye Warbeads and 1 Turnip then
combine them in your kit to create the material necessary for crafting a Bracer
of the Stoutdeacon. After you have done this take the material to a forge along
with the mold I have given you to fashion together a Bracer of the Stoutdeacon.
'
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Completed bracer is AC 4, WIS 1, AGI 3, wt 4.0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'i want to craft Boot'
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'Well boots would be quite a good idea if I do say so
myself _____, for certain situations only though! You should be proud of your
feet and all the lovely hairs that they have been blessed with by Bristlebane!
However if you wish to create a material that you will use along with this mold
to create your boots you will need 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Dark Elf Skins,
2 Bixie Wings and 1 Rat Foot.'
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Completed boots are AC 5, WIS 2, AGI 1, wt 3.0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'i want to craft Armguard'
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'It is important that your arms are protected while you
are on the battlefield _____. To create your Armguards material make sure you
collect 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Giant Wood Spider Hairs, 2 Thorn Drakeling
Scales and 2 Lettuce then combine them in your kit. After you have your material
ready take it to the forge and combine it along with this mold to create your
very own Armguards of the Stoutdeacon.'

</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'i want to craft Greave'
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'Not a bad idea to get some pants on _____. Although we
are halflings and we have no real need for shoes, pants on the other hand are a
definite must. To create the material necessary to craft your greaves gather 4
Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Large Yellowjacket Tergites, 2 Deathfist Slashed
Belt and 1 Bottle of Kalish then combine the finished product in a forge with
this mold to fashion your Legplates of the Stoutdeacon.'
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Completed greaves are AC 6, WIS 2, AGI 2, wt 3.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'i want to craft Gauntlets' (<i>keyword is different from what she
lists</i>)
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'To create the necessary material for your gauntlets you
will need to collect 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Dark Elf Skin, 2 Bone Chips
and 1 Vegetables then combine them in your Kit. Once you have done this place
the gauntlet material in a forge along with this mold to fashion your Gauntlets
of the Stoutdeacon. '
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Completed gauntlets are AC 5, WIS 1, AGI 3, wt 4.0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'i want to craft Breastplate'
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'So the time has finally come for you to create your
final piece of armor I see _____. Seek out 5 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1
Deathfist Slashed Belt, 1 Giant Yellowjacket Sternites, 2 Dark Elf Skins and 1
Undamaged Mossy Rat Pelt then combine them in your kit. Take that material along
with this mold to the nearest forge and reap the rewards of your hard work. Come
back to see me when you are finished because I have a [special task] for you.'
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Completed breastplate is AC 12, WIS 3, AGI 5, wt 5.0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'what special task'
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'If you are asking me about this special task that I need
completed then you surely must have completed all the steps necessary to prove
yourself as a worthy servant of Bristlebane. Going forward I will need you to
gather some [research annals] from a Muddite in the Gorge of King Xorbb that
stole them from me.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what research annals'
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'The research annals that I need you to retrieve are very
important ones to me. King Tearis Thex of Felwithe presented them to me for
study. He entrusted me with them because he felt I could benefit from the
knowledge that they contained. Will you [seek out my annals ]? '
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i will seek out your annals'
</p>
<p>
Thekela Meepup says 'Please go to the maze of Beholder, otherwise known as
the Gorge of King Xorbb and slay the Muddite Recordkeeper. After you have
received the annal from him I will also need you to collect 3 Pristine Stingers.
Before these annals were stolen I remember him saying I needed those 3 stingers
for a special spell so please gather them for me. I hope to see you soon _____.'
