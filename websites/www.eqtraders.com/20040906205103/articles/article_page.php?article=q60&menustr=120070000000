The task I have to present you will take you into the [Crushbone Citadel] itself.'

Return the spellbook to receive a "Rough Art Keepers Initiate Staff" which has no stats and is not a weapon (and is a small item). He then asks you to return to him once you've found a pristine forest drakeling scale and an arborean amber.
