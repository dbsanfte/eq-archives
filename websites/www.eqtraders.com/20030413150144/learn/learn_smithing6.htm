            <p><em>by Richard Lawson (aka Monual Lifegiver on Drinal) </em></p>
            <p>Here's how my 60th-level Human Cleric became a GM Smith. During 
              the course of his blacksmithing he went up to 63, which made a couple 
              of things easier (hunting shadows in Twilight Sea, for instance). 
              Here is the underlying philosophy: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> I was not interested in making money. I simply wanted to become 
                a GM smith as quickly as possible. That meant I was willing to 
                attempt combines I'd surely fizzle on just so I could try and 
                get a skill-up. Everything I made I immediately sold to a vendor. 
              </li>
              <li>I didn't want to spend a lot of money. When I started my smithing 
                quest, I had 50,000 plat. During the course of my smithing my 
                account balance fluctuated as I sold outdated equipment and bought 
                peridots for grouping. 50,000 seemed a reasonable starting point. 
              </li>
              <li>I was willing to spend some time farming. That meant that I 
                had to turn down requests for groups as I farmed stuff for Shadowscream 
                armor. I'm in a raiding guild, so I always showed up for raids, 
                but afterwards, I'd disappear from sight as I farmed and farmed. 
                I could have dinged 65 and accumulated quite a few AA points if 
                I'd stopped. I sacrificed that to become a GM smith - you'll have 
                to be prepared to do the same. Normally if you explain to your 
                guild that you're working on smithing, they'll understand. Occasionally 
                I'd take a break to help with a shard camp or help get someone 
                through a Plane of Justice trial, just so I wouldn't fall completely 
                out of touch with my guildmates.</li>
              <li>I wanted to be self-reliant. That meant no chanters to enchant 
                my ore or summon vials of mana for me. As you'll see below, that 
                also meant not needing to find a grandmaster brewer. I wanted 
                to do everything myself and not have to waste someone else's time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Some general notes: </strong></p>
            <p>Whenever a recipe calls for two items - two metal bits, two swirling 
              shadows - you must but them into the forge <em>unstacked</em>. At 
              best, the combine will fail. At worst, the combine will eat your 
              entire stack when you only needed one. The latter happened to me 
              once; the forge ate an entire stack of ethereal energy bricks and 
              I was very sad. </p>
            <p>Get a Geerlok Automated Hammer. These player-made items cost 100pp 
              or less in the Bazaar. They add 5% to your smithing skill. Since 
              252 is the highest your adjusted smithing can go, that means you'll 
              only need to get to 240 in smithing to have the maximum allowable 
              skill. </p>
            <p>Always have your WIS or INT or STR maxed out when you attempt a 
              combine. This will maximize your chances of getting a skill-up. 
              Since I was a cleric, my WIS was near-maxed. Still, I made sure 
              I always had KEI cast on me before I attempted a combine. I preferred 
              KEI over other WIS/INT buffs because KEI lasts two and a half hours 
              - longer if the chanter has some focus items or AA abilities. That's 
              far longer than any other WIS/INT buff you can get. If you don't 
              have access to a friendly chanter that will cast this on you, you 
              can usually buy a casting of KEI from a chanter in the Nexus or 
              in the Bazaar for 100pp or less. </p>
            <p>Get Planes of Power. The Plane of Knowledge is a tradeskiller's 
              paradise - everything you need is right there. This guide was written 
              under the assumption that you have PoP installed. If not, you may 
              want to consult one of the other guides for alternatives to some 
              of the recommendations I make below. </p>
            <p>And, finally... do what you can to get your guild to raid and kill 
              Xerkizh the Creator in the Temple of Ssra. He sometimes drops the 
              Hammer of the Ironfrost which adds 15% to your smithing skill. With 
              that, you only need to get up to 220 in smithing which is a <em>tremendous</em> 
              savings in time spent getting skill-ups. Plus, with this hammer 
              you can take a shortcut from 192 to 212 (see below). I realize this 
              may not be an option for many folks, but if XtC is within your reach, 
              do what you can to try and get this nice Hammer. Another option, 
              if you can raid in Vex Thal, is to get the Gauntlets of Dark Embers 
              from Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyex; they also add 15%. </p>
            <p>Before I begin, I'd like to thank everyone at the EQTraders web 
              site and message boards, who provided me with the information I 
              used to create this guide and provided very helpful commentary on 
              this guide. Without their info, it would have taken me <em>much</em> 
              longer to become a GM smith. My sincere appreciation goes out to 
              all those folks who did the legwork that made smithing much easier 
              for the rest of us. </p>
            <p>OK, on with the show: </p>
            <h3>Step 1: Equipment </h3>
            <p>Make sure to get a smithy hammer and a smithy chisel, both of which 
              can be bought in the Plane of Knowledge (PoK). You'll also need 
              a file, which you'll have to make. Start by making a few metal bits. 
              Combine two small pieces of ore (which can be bought in PoK) in 
              a forge with a flask of water. Buy a file mold and put it in a forge 
              with 1 metal bits and a flask of water. It may take you several 
              attempts, but eventually you'll make a file. Keep this file; you'll 
              always find a need for it. </p>
            <h3>Step 2: Banded Armor </h3>
            <p>What... no metal bits or pots or needles as an intermediary step? 
              Nope... I started out by making Banded Armor. Some folks have maintained 
              that you're more likely to get skill-ups on items that you are close 
              to being trivial for you, but I didn't find that to be the case. 
              Sure, I failed the combines forty-nine times out of fifty at first, 
              but I still got skill-ups. And banded requires few ingredients that 
              are relatively cheap. </p>
            <p>Sheet metal can be bought in quantity in PoK for about 1pp each. 
              Buy lots. Also, buy lots of flasks of water. Then buy as many banded 
              boot molds (1.7pp each) as your inventory can hold. Go to a forge 
              and combine one sheet metal, one boot mold, and one flask of water. 
              This will produce banded boots. Repeat until your smithing skill 
              is 95. Then buy helm molds (0.6pp each) and combine those with two 
              sheets of metal and a flask of water. This will take you to 106. 
              Then you move on to mail tunics - combine a tunic mold (1.3pp) with 
              three sheets of metal and a flask of water. This will take you to 
              115. </p>
            <p>Gosh, you're halfway there already? Yup, and it will go quicker 
              than you might think. With everything within easy reach in PoK, 
              it's simply a matter of devoting time to clicking &quot;combine&quot; 
              over and over again. </p>
            <h3>Step 3: Fine Plate </h3>
            <p>For this you'll need &quot;medium quality folded sheets of metal&quot;, 
              lots of 'em. To make these, you'll need to combine one block of 
              medium quality ore (20.5 pp each), a flask of water, and your smithy 
              hammer in a forge. (Note that on success or failure, your smithy 
              hammer will be returned to you.) Medium quality ore can be found 
              on a vendor in the PoK. Make stacks and stacks of them. </p>
            <p>You'll also need leather padding. I had no trouble finding lots 
              of leather padding available for sale in the Bazaar off of player 
              traders, usually selling for 20-25pp each. I preferred buying these 
              off traders rather than farming pelts and making leather padding 
              myself. Yes, it can get a bit expensive, but you can also sell your 
              successful plate combines back to vendors and get some plat in return, 
              helping to offset your cost a bit. </p>
            <p>Combine a plate bracer mold (6.3pp), one medium quality folded 
              sheet, a flask of water, a leather padding, and your smithy hammer 
              in a forge to make a plate bracer. Continue making these until your 
              skill hits 168. Then move on to plate helms - a plate helm mold 
              (10.5pp), two medium quality folded sheets, a flask of water, a 
              leather padding, and a smithy hammer. When you hit 179, move on 
              to Fine Steel Breastplates: a plate breastplate mold (21pp), three 
              medium quality folding sheets, a flask of water, a leather padding, 
              and a smithy hammer. This will take you to 188. </p>
            <p>Your hand cramped yet? Well, take no comfort in the following fact: 
              the *easy* part is done now. After 188 it gets... complicated. However, 
              it gets much cheaper on the pocketbook, so you won't have to make 
              any more large investments. </p>
            <h3>Step 4: Shadowscream Armor </h3>
            <p>I spent a lot of time evaluating different methods for getting 
              my skill above 188. No matter what you do, you'll need to do a lot 
              of farming. I simply didn't have the resources to buy lots of stuff 
              from the bazaar or make mistletoe sickles. Shadowscream Armor requires 
              lots of farming of no-drop stuff, but once you know how and where, 
              it isn't so bad. And it's relatively cheap. </p>
            <p>First, you'll need to do the <a href="../quests/luclin_sharvahlsmith.htm">Shar 
              Vahl smithing quest</a>. Follow this quest until you have a humming 
              luclinite hammer and a Vah Shir anvil. This took me three hours, 
              most of which was spent farming the newbie area around Shar Vahl. 
            </p>
            <p>Once you have those things, it's time to begin farming. I'll discuss 
              a few methods for farming wailing and shrieking substances: </p>
            <p><strong>Shrieking Substances, the Slow Way </strong><br>
              Go to Tenebrous Mountains. Kill sonic wolves. They wander all over 
              the zone and are plentiful. The annoying thing are the bats and 
              grimlings which may add. Still, you should be able to get a decent 
              drop rate, 15 or 20 shrieking substances an hour if you're a good 
              soloer. </p>
            <p><strong>Wailing Substances, the Slow Way </strong><br>
              Go to Paludial Caverns. Yelloweyes, near the Shadowhaven zone line, 
              drops a wailing substance upon occasion, but he is usually camped. 
              There's a camp of four grimy owlbear cubs deep, deep within Paludial 
              Caverns, at about -2000, -500. Kill them all. You'll average about 
              one wailing substance out of every four owlbears. Sometimes you'll 
              get two, sometimes you'll get zero out of the four owlbears. I averaged 
              about six wailing substances an hour here, which is a definite bottleneck. 
              I would definitely recommend the Fast Way. </p>
            <p><strong>Shrieking and Wailing Substances, the Fast Way: The Hollowshade 
              Moor War. </strong><br>
              This has got to be the single most frustrating thing to manage, 
              as the war becomes bugged quite frequently and will only become 
              unbugged if the zone is reset. But it gives you *lots* of Shrieking 
              and Wailing Substances if you can get it to work, so it's worth 
              trying. </p>
            <p>Basically, you have three camps whenever the zone is reset. Grimlings 
              to the south, Owlbears to the east, Sonic Wolves to the north. After 
              a server reset, every so often one camp will attack another and 
              try to take it over. These random, automated attacks will stop after 
              one race has successfully taken over the camp of another race, at 
              which point attacks will only be triggered when you kill a named. 
              You want to manipulate all of this to your advantage. </p>
            <p>What you're trying to accomplish is to get the owlbears or sonic 
              wolves to take over the four islands in the southern part of the 
              zone. The sonic wolves and owlbears that spawn on these islands 
              will comonly drop shrieking and wailing substances, respectively. 
            </p>
            <p>First, learn where the named owlbears and sonic wolves pop. There 
              are two named owlbears in the owlbear caves: Skrieta'Cha pops at 
              3027, 2002. Skrieta'Chu pops at 3537, 1983. Their placeholders are 
              owlbear fleshrenders, and they are on a 12 minute cycle. The sonic 
              wolf named is Ghowik, in the caves at 450, -2975. Its placeholder 
              is a sonic packleader and they are also on a 12 minute spawn cycle. 
            </p>
            <p>Pay attention to the next sentence, as it took me far too long 
              to figure out: </p>
            <p>Killing a named will spur its race to attack another camp. </p>
            <p>In other words, if you want the owlbears to attack another camp, 
              you have to kill one of the owlbear nameds. (It should be noted 
              that others have found this not to be the case, and that killing 
              a named will trigger a random attack from any camp to any other 
              camp. That may very well be. I'm just sharing my observation, which 
              is that once the automated attacks have stopped, I could only trigger 
              an owlbear attack by killing an owlbear named.) </p>
            <p>What you want is for the owlbears or the sonic wolves (depending 
              on which substance you wish to farm) to attack the grimling camp 
              to the south. Listen for the zone-wide message that says who is 
              attacking and who is defending. When you hear that the owlbears 
              (for example) are attacking the grimlings, run to the grimling chieftan 
              at -2800, -600. In front of him are a couple of grimling bodyguards. 
              The attack of the owlbears will spawn four grimling defenders. These 
              mobs are perma-rooted and <em>summon</em>, so be careful. Do what 
              you must to kill all these guys - defenders, bodyguards, and chieftan. 
              You have about ten minutes from the zonewide announcement to do 
              this. Then the owlbear attackers show up. If they can get into the 
              chieftan's hut, the owlbears will have won the battle, the grimlings 
              in the area will despawn, and owlbears will spawn in their place. 
              Follow this same sequence if it's the sonic wolves you want to win. 
            </p>
            <p>If, when you kill a owlbear named, you see a message that the owlbears 
              are killing the sonic wolves to the east (even though the sonic 
              wolves are really more north than east, the zonewide message talks 
              about their camp being in the east), I'd recommend going to the 
              sonic wolf cave and helping the defenders defeat the owlbears. You 
              don't want the owlbears and sonic wolves to kill each other in the 
              north and east camps, and if one race is completely defeated, you 
              won't see it again until the zone is reset. There's supposed to 
              be a way for you to get the war to reset on your own, but it is 
              hopelessly bugged. So it's up to you to micro-manage the war and 
              make sure the owlbears and sonic wolves defend their own realms 
              successfully. </p>
            <p>Also, let's say owlbears have taken over the southern grimling 
              camp and you've got all the wailing substances you need for now. 
              Go to the sonic wolf cave and kill Ghowik until you see a message 
              that the sonic wolves are attacking the owlbears in the south. Then 
              run to the same place the grimling chieftan used to be (-2800, -600) 
              and kill all the owlbears you see there, including the perma-rooted 
              summoning owlbear defenders. Then the sonic wolf attackers will 
              waltz in and take over the camp. </p>
            <p>Properly managed, this war can make farming wailing and shrieking 
              substances trivial. It frequently becomes bugged, and you'll often 
              have to run from place to place defending one race against an unwanted 
              attack. Still, the benefits are worth it. </p>
            <p>Okay, you've gotten the sonic wolves or owlbears to take over the 
              southern camp. Start killing the mobs that spawn on the four islands. 
              As a 62 cleric I was able to be a one-man AE group: I aggro'd about 
              eight or ten sonic wolves, then cast Upheaval and wasted them all. 
              Doing this with KEI, I averaged 30 drops an hour. What's best, though, 
              is if you can get an honest-to-goodness AE group together, with 
              a tank puller and a wizard to AE nuke. Then you can get 50 drops 
              an hour. </p>
            <p>This will be your best source of wailing / shrieking substances 
              if you can manage it properly. </p>
            <p><strong>Swirling Shadows </strong><br>
              Once you've got a good supply of wailing and shrieking substances, 
              it's time to begin farming swirling shadows. These items are no-rent, 
              which means they'll poof if you log off, so do these last. <em>(As 
              an alternative, you can get someone to duel you and then die, then 
              loot your corpse of everything but the swirling shadows. As long 
              as your corpse doesn't rot, the swirling shadows will remain for 
              you to loot at your convenience.) </em>You can get swirling shadows 
              from lesser shades in Shadeweaver's Thicket, but they are uncommon 
              drops <em>(about one in five lesser shades drops a swirling shadow)</em> 
              and it's a real pain chasing down the lesser shades all over the 
              zone, so I recommend farming lesser and greater shadows in the Twilight 
              Sea. </p>
            <p>There's an island in the Twilight Sea at about -200, -1000 where 
              the shadows roam. It's a relatively small island that's relatively 
              close to Katta Castellum, so it's convenient to farm. Be warned, 
              these mobs are not necessarily pushovers. They are level 40 and 
              they lifetap frequently. I definitely needed KEI to farm there, 
              since I had to heal myself often. Also, because the island is small, 
              it is not difficult to get two or three adds during a battle. If 
              that proves to be a problem for you, I'd recommend pulling the shadows 
              to one of the nearby islands, where you won't get adds. Soloing, 
              I got about 20 swirling shadows an hour. I'm certain my drop rate 
              would have gone up with some help; this would be another decent 
              place to AE, I think. </p>
            <p>I should also mention that it was easier for me, a cleric, to farm 
              the mobs in Twilight Sea since I could heal myself after getting 
              lifetapped constantly. If you're a class that can't heal themselves 
              effectively, you may want to consider getting help, or just go back 
              to Shadeweaver's Thicket and farm the lesser shades. </p>
            <p>You need at least twice as many swirling shadows as wailing or 
              shrieking substances for Shadowscream armor, so plan accordingly. 
              When I did my smithing, I'd farm 40 swirling shadows, then go do 
              20 Shadowscream combines, then farm 40 more swirling shadows, etc. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>At Last: Combining Everything into Shadowscream Armor </strong><br>
              OK! You've got your swirling shadows and your shrieking substances 
              and your wailing substances. Time to actually make some armor. Go 
              to the Plane of Knowledge and find the vendor that sells large bricks 
              of ore. (Plain ore, not high-quality or medium-quality.) Combine 
              one large brick of ore (1.5pp) with a flask of water and your file 
              in a forge. You'll get your file back and two metal rings. Then 
              combine one metal ring with one wailing substance, one shrieking 
              substances, your humming luclinite hammer, and your Vah Shir anvil 
              in a forge. This will produce a humming orb. </p>
            <p>Now place two swirling shadows, one humming orb, one banded boot 
              mold (1.7pp), a water flask, your humming luclinite hammer, and 
              your Vah Shir anvil in a forge. Hit combine. On success you'll get 
              Shadowscream Boots. </p>
            <p>Keeping making Shadowscream Boots. They become trivial at 248, 
              but remember you only need to get to 240 if you've purchased a Geerlock 
              Automated Hammer. As a guildeline, I found that I averaged one skill-up 
              per twenty combines. That means that to get from 188 to 240, you'll 
              need approximately 1040 Wailing Substances, 1040 Shrieking Substances, 
              and 2080 Swirling Shadows. </p>
            <p>Congratulations Grandmaster </p>
            <p><strong>Addendum: For those with 15% Modifiying Items </strong></p>
            <p>So you've helped kill the Creator in Ssra and have been awarded 
              the Hammer of the Ironfrost. Or you've hunted in Vex Thal and got 
              the Gauntlets of Dark Embers. That's great. That means that you 
              only need to get your smithing skill up to 220 to become a grandmaster. 
              Plus there's a small shortcut you can take: Ethereal Energy Rings. 
            </p>
            <p>The minimum required skill for EE Rings is 220, which means you'll 
              need to use Shadowscream to get your skill up to 192. 192 + 15% 
              &gt; 220, so you'll be good to go then. </p>
            <p>In order to make those, however, you need Ethereal Temper, lots 
              and lots of it. This requires a Grandmaster Brewer to make. Rather 
              than try to find one willing to make hundreds of Ethereal Tempers 
              for me, I decdied to become a Grandmaster Brewer myself. This is 
              much easier to do than you might think. That also meant I was willing 
              to spend 3 AA points in New Tanaan Crafting Mastery to allow a second 
              skill to rise above 200. If this seems excessive just to get 20 
              skill-ups in smithing, keep in mind that this will still be a useful 
              skill after you've maxed your smithing, since you'll need these 
              tempers to make some of those ultra-uber PoP armors. </p>
            <p>You need a brewing skill of 220 to make Ethereal Temper - or a 
              skill of 210 plus a Geerlock Fermentation Device. The Geerlock Fermentation 
              Device is another player-made item that adds 5% to your brewing 
              skill. I found one for sale in the Bazaar for 50pp. </p>
            <p>Everything you need to become a GM Brewer can be found in Shadowhaven. 
              Combine barley, hops, malt, yeast, and a cask in a brewing barrel. 
              Repeat until your skill hits 135. Then (ready for it?) do a nice 
              little <em>nine</em>-item combine: Two flasks of water, two short 
              beers, three malts, yeast, and a cask. Repeat until your skill is 
              210. Overall, it cost me two days, 500pp, and an extremely cramped 
              hand to get to 210 in brewing. Still, this is one of the easiest 
              and fastest tradeskills to master - if only smithing was this easy. 
            </p>
            <p>Now for Ethereal Tempers. Everything you need is in the Plane of 
              Knowledge. First get a mortar and pestle, then combine a Scent of 
              Marr and a Celestial Solvent to get a Celestial Essence. Then, in 
              a brewing barrel in the Plane of Knowledge, combine two Celetstial 
              Essences, a soda, and a emerald tea leaf to make Ethereal Temper. 
              Make lots. Lots and lots. What I would often do is buy a bunch of 
              Celestial Solvents and Scents of Marrs and take them with me while 
              we were raiding. During downtime, I'd combine them into Celestial 
              Essences. I discovered that you can even do this while auto-following 
              someone. If you want to save time making Celestial Essences, you 
              can usually find them for sale in quantity from player vendors in 
              the bazaar. When I was in a hurry, I could find them for 5 or 8pp 
              each, which is not entirely unreasonable. </p>
            <p>Now all you need is a lot of Ethereal Energy Bricks. If you group 
              in one of the PoP planes you'll find that these drop in quantity. 
              I also would buy them from traders in the Bazaar if the prices were 
              reasonable, although that could add up in a hurry. </p>
            <p>Making EE Rings is easy: Combine one Brick of Ethereal Energy, 
              one Ethereal Temper, and your file in a forge in the Plane of Knowledge. 
              These become trivial at 212. </p>
            <p>From 212 to 220, revert back to Shadowscream armor. If you're uber-rich 
              and have access to a willing cleric of Tunare, you might consider 
              moving on to Mistletoe Sickles to avoid farming. Or you can start 
              making Heraldic armor, which has the potential to make you lots 
              of plat while you're getting skill-ups. I won't go into detail on 
              those recipes here; check elsewhere on <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com">http://www.eqtraders.com</a> 
              for details on what you can make and how you can make it. </p>
            <p>That's it! You're a Grandmaster Blacksmith.</p>
