            <h3>#4: Fur-lined Coldain Prayer Shawl </h3>
            <p> You have survived baking...but are you feeling up to pottery? 
              This is the quest that brought the infamous Thurgadin gate potions 
              into Norrath, via the Vial of Velium Vapors which we deliver to 
              Tanik to save his spying self from the giants. Many people, especially 
              those who cannot gate, make the potion that you will need for this 
              quest and use the one charge of Gate: Thurgadin as a last ditch 
              escape when they're stuck somewhere, or as a quick port to avoid 
              paying the ridiculous prices one often pays nowadays for a tp to 
              Great Divide. Unfortunately, these things have also shrunk even 
              further the already tiny market for gate potions, leaving many shamans 
              wondering why they dumped all that plat into their medicine bags 
              just to be replaced by a simple bit of pottery. Not that I'm bitter 
              or anything, after about 10k pp spent getting from sow potions to 
              gate potions...Ahem...anyway! On with the quest!

            <p> Ask Loremaster Borannin "What is brewing?" <br>
              Loremaster Borannin says, "Ahh yes, good to see you again Verdandi. 
              I wish it were under better circumstances that we meet today. For 
              some time now we have sent teams of our finest rogues to gather 
              intelligence for the Dain. Tanik Greskil is one of our best. He 
              was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very important 
              mission and has not returned. He is now long overdue, and fearing 
              the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch a rescue party 
              to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. I 
              have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust 
              you have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission?" 
              <br>
              You say, "I will accept this mission." <br>
              Loremaster Borannin says, "The council will be pleased to hear of 
              your acceptance, Verdandi. Scour the regions surrounding the city 
              of the Giants. Discover what happened to Tanik and, if possible, 
              return him to Thurgadin. If you are successful, remember to hand 
              me your woven shawl. We seem to be running low on them, but I must 
              say Mordin has never had so much help in the kitchen. Anyway, I 
              will eagerly await word of your findings. Good luck, and may Brell 
              protect you." 
            <p> You say, "Hail, Tanik Greskil" <br>
              Tanik Greskil says, "Outlander! Thank Brell you've found me! I am 
              the last surviving member of my unit. Our mission was somehow compromised, 
              the bloody Kromrif knew just where to find us... I can't imagine 
              how they knew. I was barely able to escape with my life and wandered 
              into a trap here. I am badly hurt and need your help." <br>
              You say, "I will help you." <br>
              Tanik Greskil says, "Quickly, give me a vial of Velium Vapors so 
              I can return home, I am in desperate need of some attention from 
              our clerics." <br>
              <i> (Note: Tanik will despawn if you ask the next question in the 
              conversation, so don't ask him about the Velium Vapors if you wish 
              to give them to him at this point.) </i> <br>
              You say, "What are Velium Vapors?" <br>
              Tanik Greskil says, "Drat! Are you telling me you don't have one 
              with you? Run back to Thurgadin at once and speak with Frundle, 
              she can make you one. I will do what I can to stay alive. I may 
              need to move about a bit to keep from being discovered. Hurry now 
              outlander, you're my only hope." 
            <p> You say, 'Hail Frundle Frenkler' <br>
              You say, 'What are Velium Vapors?' <br>
              Frundle Frenkler says, "Ahh, you come seeking my family recipe? 
              After all you've done for our people it's the least I can do. First 
              you must fashion a velium vial, then combine the vial with two small 
              pieces of velium in this jar. That's all there is to it. Please 
              keep the recipe a secret." <br>
              You say, "What is a velium vial?" <br>
              Frundle Frenkler says "I'm no potter mind you, but if I remember 
              correctly it's a small brick of velium, three crystalline silks, 
              and two glass shards. Then you'll have to finish up by firing it 
              in a kiln with a high quality firing sheet." <br>

            <p> [Give Tanik: Vial of Velium Vapors] Tanik Greskil says "Thank 
              you, Verdandi. I shall be eternally grateful to you. Should you 
              ever require my assistance I pledge to you my aid. Please deliver 
              this to Borannin, it is imperative that he deliver this to the Dain 
              at once. Farewell for now outlander...." <br>

            <p> [Give Borannin: Tanik's Note & Woven Coldain Prayer Shawl] <br>
              Loremaster Borannin says "Words cannot express our gratitude for 
              your deeds outlander, you have saved a hero of our people from certain 
              death. Please accept this, the Fur-lined shawl, as a token of our 
              sincere appreciation. You are indeed among the most highly regarded 
              Barbarians to set foot in Thurgadin. The next time we meet be sure 
              to ask me how to further advance your reputation with the coldain."<br>

            <p> 
            <h4> <a name="inst">Detailed Instructions</a><br>
            </h4>
            <p> The story line of this quest has you find Tanik once in order 
              to get information and then again a second time in order to give 
              him the Vial of Velium Vapors. Given the difficulty and danger involved 
              to someone who is kos to giants, however, I recommend coming prepared 
              the first time and doing all of your business with Tanik in one 
              trip. 
            <p> So, first you need your Vial of Velium Vapors. This means you 
              need two small pieces of velium, a small block of velium, and three 
              crystalline silks. If you are level 50+, you can get all of these 
              along with some experience by hunting the spiders in Velketor's 
              Labyrinth. If you are lower than that or don't want to fight for 
              a group in Velks, or simply can't stand the music, head to Crystal 
              Caverns. Kill orc miners for the velium. The small pieces of velium 
              are the stackable kind, make sure to get two. The blocks are unstackable, 
              but you only need one. You might get a block by auctioning, but 
              the small pieces are worth far, far more than you want to pay for 
              this quest because they are needed for Velious tailoring. You will 
              probably get a block before you get your two pieces anyway, so just 
              suck it up and kill some orcs, shouldn't take too terribly long. 
              Then drop down to the bottom of the orc area and find the path over 
              to the spider area. If you're not familiar with the zone, get someone 
              to show you the way. You will get the crystalline silks very quickly 
              off of the spiders. Don't bother auctioning for those either, they 
              are also used in tailoring. The armor you can make with them isn't 
              worth much of anything, but everyone who is a couple steps ahead 
              of you in the shawl quest is using them to get their skill up for 
              the sixth shawl. When you have these things together, go back to 
              Thurgadin. 
            <p> <i> The Pottery Bit </i> <br>
              For instructions on how to get your pottery up, see <a href="intro.htm#how">"What 
              is the quickest way to raise Xxxxxx skill?"</a>. Most non-quest 
              recipes require you to use a pottery wheel and kiln, both of which 
              are found in cities. There are no portable pottery kits like tailoring 
              kits or spits for baking. But pottery equipment is actually pretty 
              easy to find, unlike the components that you need to buy to do the 
              pottery. (There are a pottery wheel and kiln in both North and West 
              Freeport, but you'll have to go to East Commons to find the nearest 
              firing sheets. Go figure.) Pottery recipes, other than for this 
              quest, always require a pattern bought from a vendor. One type of 
              vendor has patterns for everything except for poison vials. The 
              vendors that have clay and firing sheets have the poison vial patterns. 
              The most basic recipes simply call for a pattern, the right size 
              piece of clay, and a flask of water. This gives you an unfired version 
              of what you need. Then you put the right quality of firing sheet 
              into a kiln along with the unfired item and hit combine to get the 
              usable item. The process of firing non-quest items is trivial at 
              17, but the velium vial for this quest has a much higher trivial. 
              A few recipes need extra ingredients, like glass shards sold by 
              the clay/firing sheet vendor, or metal bits made by a smith, or 
              a pelt off of creatures. The pottery for this quest, however does 
              not require a flask of water or a pattern. 
            <p> Combine in a Pottery Wheel: 1 Small Brick of Velium + 3 Crystalline 
              Silks + 2 Glass Shards = Unfired Velium Vial. (trivial unknown)<br>
              Combine in a Kiln: Unfired Velium Vial + High Quality Firing Sheet 
              = Veluim Vial. (trivial 122) 
            <p> Yes, they misspelled the word Velium in "Veluim Vial". 
            <p> Go to Frundle Frenkler. She is located at approximately -350, 
              500. To get to her from the bank, head like you are going to the 
              Temple of Lore. As you go down the ramp towards the creepy statue, 
              on the left are three buildings. Frundle is in the middle building. 
              She will not respond to a Hail, but when you ask her about velium 
              vapors she gives you the Velium Purifier that you need. <br>
              Combine in Velium Purifier: 2 Small Pieces of Velium + Veluim Vial 
              = Vial of Velium Vapors. (never fails)<br>
              Yes, this item has one charge of Gate: Thurgadin on it. Tanik wants 
              it so that he can gate home, but you can also make it in order to 
              gate yourself to Thurgadin, much to the dismay of alchemists. 
            <p> <i> Finding Tanik </i> <br>
              Now we head on out to find Tanik. I did this by the old method of 
              running up and down the ramp that leads down into Kael from East 
              Wastes, and on the surface ground level along either side of the 
              ramp. When you do this, eventually you'll hit the right spot and 
              one of two things will happen. Either you will see a message saying "You stumble over a pile of snow exposing a Coldain!" 
              and Tanik will appear lying on the ground, or you will get a message saying "You have been ambushed!" and the Kromrif Death 
              Squad will appear and chop you into tiny bits. The Death Squad consists 
              of two to six giants of approximately level 50. You might want to 
              make sure you know the way from the ramp to the zone into Kael, 
              and you definitely want to have jboots or sow, just in case. (Even 
              if you are kos in Kael you can safely zone in as long as you don't 
              take more than a few steps inside.) 
            <p> There is a safer way to find Tanik. It is much more time-consuming, 
              but if you are absolutely terrified at the prospect of encountering 
              the Death Squad, it could be worth a try for ya. You will still 
              run the risk of triggering the giants, but this is a way to know which you're getting before it is triggered. 
              Basically, there are "invisible men" npcs scattered around the area.  When you get close enough to one of them, they emote the message that you see and trigger the spawning of either Tanik or the Death Squad.  These invisible npcs cannot be tracked or seen with any see invis spells and are not traps that rogues can sense or disarm.  However...as any pet owner knows, when you tell your               pet (other than enchanter pets who obey no one) to guard a spot 
              "/pet guard here" they not only stay in that spot but they also 
              turn to face the nearest non-pet NPC. See where this is going?  Even a charmed snow bunny can find these things that none of the rest of us can detect.  Either 
              make a pet or charm a pet or bring someone with a pet and put the 
              pet on guard at the top of the ramp. It will swing to face where 
              the nearest trigger npc awaits. (Make sure that there aren't 
              any other creatures closer to you than the entrance to Kael.) 
            <p> Now, in order to find out whether you have a Tanik or a Death 
              Squad trigger, make sure you have your options set to confirm before letting 
              you drop anything, put an unimportant item (food, drink, bat wing,               just nothing precious in case you make a mistake) on your cursor 
              and click a few feet away in the direction the pet is pointing. 
              If you get the confirm box to drop the item, hit No to keep holding              it and take a couple steps in that direction. Bring the pet up and               tell it to guard again. Check the direction the pet is pointing 
              and try clicking again. If you get the confirm box, bring up the 
              pet. Continue doing this until instead of getting the confirm box 
              to drop the item, you get the message "You are too far away from..." message that you get if you try to give something to an NPC when 
              you are too far from them. The goofy thing is that the Tanik trigger npc 
              is named "You stumble" because that is the beginning of the message               you get when you find him, and the giant trigger is named "You have"               because that is the beginning of their message. So, you will either               see "You are too far away from You have to trade" if you are approaching 
              the giants or "You are too far away from You stumble to trade" if 
              you are approaching Tanik. If you get the stumble message, then 
              just walk forward to trigger him and give him your vial and collect 
              your note and go back to Thurgadin. If you get the giant message...well, 
              it seems that there can be more than one trap up at the same time. 
              You might try moving your pet a ways away and see if they can detect 
              a different trap. You could also try triggering the giants and running 
              into Kael so that it resets and maybe you'll get Tanik. 
            <p> Reports are that you might get really lucky finding Tanik or you 
              might curse the day you heard that shrimp's name. I got two Taniks 
              in a row right off when doing this for myself along with a friend 
              doing his. Others have gotten 20 Death Squads before Tanik would 
              show his face. When he does finally put in an appearance, be very 
              careful not to go all the way through the quest text with him if 
              you want to give him the Vial of Velium Vapors the first time you 
              find him...he will despawn if you ask him "What are Velium Vapors?". 
              You can either go through the conversation up to that point, or 
              just give him the vial without saying a word, and he will give you 
              the note you need. 
            <p> Take the note back to Borannin in Thurgadin and give it to him 
              along with your third shawl, and receive your fourth shawl! Hurray, 
              you're making progress! At this point you're wearing a pretty respectable 
              garment!
