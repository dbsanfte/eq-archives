<span class="headers">Epic 1.5 Quests</span>
<p>
With the release of the Omens of War expansion, we're receiving word that the epic 1.5 quests have a tradeskill component to them.
<p>
While we would rather that the various class sites tackle the writeups of their respective epics, we would like to include information on the tradeskill portion of each quest here on EQTC.
<p>
If you have information on tradeskill combines for the new epics, please post in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/forumdisplay.php?f=23">Quests Requiring Tradeskills forum</a>.
<p>
As we get such information, we'll link it in to this page.</p><p>
