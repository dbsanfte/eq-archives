            <h3> Myrron's Beginner's Guide to Smithing <i>(Post-June 5th Patch) 
              </i></h3>
            <p>Since June 5th, 2002, pretty much all smithing trivials were altered 
              in some way. As a result, this guide takes the new trivial levels 
              into consideration, as well as cost of supplies. Each of the steps 
              outlined below are suggested based on cheap cost and readily available 
              supplies. These steps are designed for the beginner in smithing, 
              who wishes to increase his or her skill at a relatively cheap cost 
              to themselves. This guide suggests steps to a smithing skill of 
              122. There is a section after the guide suggesting several routes 
              for smithing beyond 122, but these are not laid out step-by-step. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>First things first: increase your stats! If you are a caster, raise 
              your intelligence/wisdom (whichever is your primary stat) as high 
              as you can before attempting to smith. Melees can do this, but strength 
              may substitute for wisdom/intelligence. So get either wisdom, intelligence, 
              or strength as high as you possibly can. There is no need to max 
              out all three stats; just pick one that should be easy to increase. 
              Recall that spells may also alter stats, not just armor and weapons. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Why do you want to increase your stats? As your stat increases, 
              so does your chance of getting a skill-up in smithing. This is not 
              to be confused with the actual creation of a new item. Whether or 
              not you succeed when trying to create a new item depends on your 
              smithing skill level. If your smithing skill is 25, you have the 
              exact same chance of creating a steel boning whether your intelligence 
              is 120 or 180. However, with a 180 intelligence, you will be more 
              likely to improve your smithing skill to 26. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The following is what I have done in order to master smithing. 
              My charisma (affects prices from merchants) has fluctuated between 
              75 and 92, and my wisdom (primary stat) fluctuated between the 120's 
              and 160's. Most merchants I dealt with were indifferent to me. <br>
            </p>
            <p><b><i>(Begin Steps in Guide)</i></b><br>
            </p>
            <p>Sharpen rusty weapons (sharpening stone + rusty weapon) until the 
              mid-20's. The first rusty weapons begin to trivial at a skill level 
              of 18, but you can take your skill up to 24 with a rusty longsword. 
              Sharpening stones may be bought in a few locations, including Erudin, 
              Ak'Anon, Felwithe, and Freeport to name a few. You can sharpen some 
              rusty weapons all the way to 26, but I think it's ok to move on 
              to steel boning at 24. You can sell tarnished weapons and recover 
              the cheap cost of the sharpening stones; you find enough rusty weapons 
              at low levels off of enemies so you shouldn't have to buy any. Alternately 
              you can make metal bits (2 small pieces of ore, flask of water) 
              to 18, but if so, you will need to buy the ore. Rusty weapons are 
              free.<br>
              Create steel boning (small brick ore, file, flask of water) until 
              37. If you don't see a file for sale, you can make one (1 metal 
              bits, file mold, flask of water; trivial at 21). If you are also 
              interested in tailoring, you may alternately make studs (3 metal 
              bits, file, flask of water) until 35 and then boning until 37. However, 
              I tried this, and for whatever reason I got skill-ups with almost 
              every boning attempt, while studs took more time to prepare and 
              gave me fewer skill-ups. Steel boning may be saved if you are a 
              tailor, or sold back to recover some of the cost of the ore.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Create lanterns (1 metal bits, lantern casing mold, bottle, flask 
              water) until 68. This is surprisingly cheap. It will take you a 
              while to make a few stacks of metal bits, but otherwise this is 
              not too costly (several plat). The lantern casing molds are not 
              stackable, so have a few empty backpacks/containers with you. The 
              only nuisance here is that lanterns do not give you much money when 
              you sell them back to a merchant. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Create dairy spoons (2 metal bits, scalar mold, flask of water) 
              until 74. Same as before; these sell back for even less than the 
              lanterns. However, they, too, are fairly cheap to make. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Create banded gorgets (1 sheet metal, gorget mold, flask of water) 
              until 92. Sheets of metal can be made (2 small bricks of ore, flask 
              of water) and are stackable; molds are not stackable. Finally, you 
              can make something that you may actually be able to sell; banded 
              armor! I suggest making banded gorgets (these are cheapest) until 
              your skill hits in the mid-80's. At that point, try auctioning your 
              smith skills to other people. Offer to make custom banded armor 
              for whoever wants some and is willing to pay. (Check with some people 
              to find out what is a standard price for banded armor on your server; 
              the price varies.) Be fair; do not ask for more money than what 
              is fair. Why? No matter what, you're going to get more money from 
              players than from merchants, so why be greedy? So not only are your 
              customers gaining banded armor, you may continue to get skill-ups 
              while filling orders and you recover more of your lost money than 
              you would selling back to merchants. It's a win-win situation. I 
              have found that when your smithing skill is in the mid-80's, you 
              are able to make most banded pieces within three attempts, so buy 
              three molds per order and sell back any unused molds to merchants. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p>Continue with banded helmets (2 sheet metal, helm mold, flask of 
              water) until 106, then move on to banded mail (3 sheet metal, mail 
              mold, flask of water) until 115; or continue to fill orders for 
              banded armor until you trivial it. Sheets of metal can sometimes 
              be bought from merchants (Freeport, for example), if you do not 
              wish to make it.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Create embroidering needles (needle mold, 1 metal bits, celestial 
              essence, flask of water) until 122. Celestial essence is a no-fail 
              poisonmaking recipe, but can be made by anyone. You do not need 
              the poisonmaking skill in order to make celestial essences. A celestial 
              essence is made by combining 1 celestial solvent (vendor-sold in 
              Shadow Haven and Bazaar) and a spell research component in a mortar 
              and pestle. If you do not have the Luclin expansion, you can always 
              ask a buddy who does to buy you the components needed, or even try 
              to find someone selling celestial essences. There is a list of which 
              spell components are useable for this recipe at EQTraders: <a href="../secrets/celestial_solvent.htm">http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/celestial_solvent.htm</a>. 
              <br>
            </p>
            <p><i><b>(End Steps in Guide)<br>
              </b></i><b> </b> </p>
            <p>In the guide, you may notice I skip steps. For example, it is possible 
              to move on from dairy spoons (trivial 74) to fillet knives (trivial 
              76) before moving on to banded. However, I find that skill-ups come 
              more quickly when working on items that trivial about 15-30 points 
              above your skill level. Thus, this guide usually has you working 
              on an item at most times that &#147;challenges&#148; your skill 
              a little. <br>
              Congratulations! At this point you have become a master smith! I 
              have bought most of my supplies from merchants and have probably 
              spent 250pp so far (my skill is 122 as of August 13th). However, 
              I have been making a profit on banded armor, so I've only lost about 
              150pp total to get my skill up to master level. At this point you 
              can offer to make banded armor to people, studs and boning to tailors, 
              and tools such as skinning knives and filet knives to others. On 
              my particular server, a full suit of banded armor costs 92pp, and 
              considering I am out almost 150pp but now able to make banded armor 
              for profit, I am really surprised more people don't take the extra 
              time to smith. <br>
            </p>
            <p><b>Beyond 122</b><br>
              There has been considerable interest in what items to make after 
              you trivial embroidering needles. I have not gone beyond 122 at 
              this point, but based on the trivial listings at EQTraders and what 
              more experienced smiths have mentioned on the message boards there, 
              there appear to be several routes. Most routes are expensive and 
              can cost you time as well as money, so be prepared.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i><b>Route 1</b></i><b>:</b> Ornate Chain then Fine Plate. Ornate 
              chain requires an appropriate chainmail pattern, a smithy hammer, 
              a bar of metal (silver, electrum, gold, platinum), a flask of water, 
              and high quality metal rings in varying quantities. At 122, you 
              really don&#146;t need to use silver bars anymore, so some people 
              move directly on to electrum or gold bars. Bracers require 1 high 
              quality ring (and has the highest trivial for all items requiring 
              one ring), so bracers seem to be a good item to skill up on. Alternatively, 
              the electrum coif (helm) requires 2 rings, but trivials at 139 and 
              does not require you to buy gold. Rings are expensive, as they require 
              you to combine a flask of water, a file, and a large brick of high 
              quality ore (yield 2). In addition, high quality ore is only sold 
              in three places currently: Qeynos, Kaladim, and the Bazaar. Thus, 
              some people stick with items that require only one ring, but others 
              go for items requiring two. At some point, usually when people have 
              the choice to use platinum bars or move on to fine plate, people 
              move on to fine plate. <br>
            </p>
            <p><b><i>Route 2: </i></b>Straight to Fine Plate. Some people say 
              to move on to fine plate items right after 122, skipping ornate 
              chain entirely. People tend to recommend fine plate visors (smithy 
              hammer, 1 leather padding, flask of water, appropriate mold, and 
              1 medium quality folded sheet of metal) to 163, then bracers to 
              168. (Or just go straight into bracers, skipping visors). Fine plate 
              helms (requires above components but 2 medium quality folded sheets 
              of metal instead of 1) will then take people to 179. Fine plate 
              breastplates (3 medium quality folded sheets of metal) carry you 
              to 188. Leather padding is made by combining a low quality wolf/bear/cat 
              pelt with a silk thread (2 spiderling silks in sewing kit, no fail) 
              in a sewing kit. Leather padding trivials at 31, so it may be worth 
              your while to raise your tailoring above that to reduce failures. 
              If you buy your padding, this will save you time but cost more. 
              Killing animals for pelts and silks will take you plenty of time, 
              but cost less money. Medium quality folded sheets of metal cannot 
              be store-bought (as far as I know); it is different than the medium 
              quality sheet metal that is store-bought. A medium quality folded 
              sheet of metal is made by combining 1 block of medium quality ore, 
              a flask of water, and a smithy hammer. <br>
            </p>
            <p><b><i>Route 3:</i></b> Check your Cultural Recipes. Check on EQTraders 
              (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_cultural_main.htm) 
              to see what items your race can make and see if there are any trivials 
              above 122 that may be cheap. Wood-elves, for example, have the option 
              of making Fier&#146;dal fletching kits to 163 somewhat cheaply. 
              However, I hear that this particular item does not sell back to 
              merchants, so when looking at cultural stuff, check to make sure 
              you can recover some of your money losses. Even if you can&#146;t 
              sell back to merchants, you may find cultural items cheaper to make 
              than selling back ornate chain and fine plate. Half-elves, sorry, 
              but this is not an option for you. <br>
            </p>
            <p><b>Tip:</b> It has been hinted at that your chance for a skillup 
              is slightly better when you succeed making an item versus when you 
              fail an item. Whether this is true or not is in debate, but if you 
              want to increase your chance of simply being successful making an 
              item, you may wish to invest in a geerlock which adds to your smithing 
              skill. If nothing else, the additional successes you have can be 
              sold back to recover more money spent. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Beyond fine plate breastplate&#146;s trivial level of 188, it really 
              is up to you as to what to smith next. There are a variety of routes 
              to go from here, all tough from what I have read. Check trivial 
              listings in the recipes, other guides here, and the message boards 
              to pick a good path. <br>
            </p>
            <p>In general, you won't often see a profit as a smith. You certainly 
              will lose money up until the point that you can make banded armor, 
              and even now I don't see people wanting to buy banded or ornate 
              chain very often. However, smithing, like all tradeskills, is a 
              fun way to take a break from the normal routine of raids, grouping, 
              and soloing. That, and it&#146;s pretty cool when someone asks &#147;can 
              anyone make me a breastplate?&#148; and you can respond, &#147;Sure, 
              no problem!&#148; Good luck!<br>

              Post Script. I would like to thank all of the people who have been 
              posting in the EQTraders smithing message board between the months 
              of June and August, 2002. Their comments and suggestions, as well 
              as their testing of the new trivials, has led to the creation of 
              this guide.<br>
