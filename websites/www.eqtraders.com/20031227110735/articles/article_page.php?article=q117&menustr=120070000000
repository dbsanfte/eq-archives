<span class="headers">Freeport Paladin (Truthbringers) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Freeport. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, and restricted to HUM/PAL only. While stats and exact names of these armor pieces were not provided, the armor has a blue plate graphic when worn. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
This is a list of the recipes for the new low level armor quests gained from Edwardian in North Freeport ontop of the Paladin guild. The items needed are found in Northern Ro, East Commons and West Commons. If you talk to Edwardian he will give you a 'chest' which you use to combine the parts in. This will produce a Metal Sheet which you combine with the mold in a forge. Edward gives you a mold for each peice of armor you ask him about. The smithing combines are no-fail, but can grant minor skill increases.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Edwardian Holyblade' 
</p>
<p>
Edwardian Holyblade says 'Greetings and well met Dukane. I am Edwardian Holyblade, noble paladin of Marr. I have devoted my life and my blade to the glory of Mithaniel Marr. I am also in charge of training all new paladins of Marr to make sure that they have the best training necessary. If you are a paladin of Marr I may have some [training] for you.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what training' 
</p>
<p>
Edwardian Holyblade says 'I have developed a training program for all young and upcoming Paladins of Marr. My tests will enable you to learn some basic hunting, navigating and armor crafting skills. All of these abilities will be very important on your path to enlightenment. If you are [ready to begin my tests] I will explain to you how the tests will work.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i am ready to begin your tests' 
</p>
<p>
Edwardian Holyblade says 'Very well Krohfak, I look forward to seeing you progress through your training. Here is your special mail assembly kit. In this kit you will combine a number of components that you will collect from all areas of Freeport, North Ro and the Commonlands. The components that you will gather and combine in this kit will magical create a specific armor material piece. Each of these materials will be combined in a forge with the appropriate mold that I will provide you with. I will explain to you how the [recipes] work when you are ready.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what recipes' 
</p>
<p>
Edwardian Holyblade says 'Once you have crafted your material from the specific recipes I give you you will need the appropriate mold as I mentioned before. I can present you with the recipe and mold for Truthbringers [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. When you are ready to being collecting the components for a material recipe simply tell me what piece you [want] to craft.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i want to craft a helm 
</p>
<p>
Edwardian Holyblade says 'I would strongly suggest a good helm as you can see by my patch over my eye I was not so careful in my younger days. To create your helm material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Young Kodiak Paw, 1 Ruined Cat Pelt and 1 Hops in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Truthbringers Helm.'

<p>
You say, 'i want to craft greaves' 
</p>
<p>
Edwardian Holyblade says 'I can't begin to tell you how important pants are Dukane. Any injuries to them could disable you from escaping should you need to and would surely perish due to this. To create your greaves material you will need to combine 4 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Coyote Pelt , 1 Shadow Wolf Tibia, 1 Bottle and 1 Raw Bamboo in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Truthbringers Greaves.'

Edwardian Holyblade says 'Sooner or later you will take a tough blow to your hands, being struck there without the right gauntlets could mean a very serious and painful injury. To create your gauntlet material you will need to combine 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Giant Spider Egg Sack, 1 Ruined Bear Pelt, and 1 Armadillo Tail in your assembly kit.

<p>
You say, 'i want to craft a breastplate' 
</p>
<p>
Edwardian Holyblade says 'Any paladins most important armor piece is always their breastplate. Should you succeed in crafting it your Truthbringer Breastplate will guard your upper body from any serious attacks that would otherwise be quite devasting. To create your breastplate material you will need to combine 5 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Young Plains Cat Scalp, 1 Young Puma Skin, 1 Water Flask 1 Deathfist Orc Skull and 1 Giant Fire Beetle Carapace in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Truthbringers Breastplate.

<p>
You say, 'What final test' 
</p>
<p>
Edwardian Holyblade says 'Well for quite sometime the Freeport Militia has become more and more corrupt. They have been known to do any dastardly deed you can imagine which includes harming and sometimes killing followers of Marr. There is a group of Militia Soldiers in the commonlands that have been recently harassing a good friend of mine. His name is Pardor and he is a shopkeeper in the commonlands. As if it wasn’t dangerous enough in the commonlands he know has these Militia soldiers demanding he pay them a tax that does not exist. Will you travel to the commonlands to kill these on these militia soldiers? I fear for my friend's life.'
