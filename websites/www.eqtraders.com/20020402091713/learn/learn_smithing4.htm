              by <a href="mailto:GenM1A1@aol.com">Sinuuyanea Nocturne</a>, Quellious 
             server.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Ah, smithing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
              </span>The forging of weapons and armor to protect ones body, or

            <p class="MsoNormal">So, what chance in hell does a Dark Elven Necromancer, 
              like me, have to succeed in smithing?</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Logic aside, I’ve found smithing to be a rewarding 
              trade by far, and wish to share my knowledge with the rest of Norrath, 
              and guide others onto the path of smithing mastery.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">0-21</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">So, you want to smith, do ya? 
              Well, before you can make that full suit of enchanted imbued 
              cultural armor, you’ve got to do the grunt work first, young apprentice. 
              Most take two paths in approaching their first 21 points 
              in smithing. The least 
              expensive is to sharpen weapons. 
              This takes 1 sharpening stone and a rusty weapon; both placed 
              inside of the forge. Click 
              the ‘combine’ button: on a success, you lose the sharpening stone, 
              and get a tarnished weapon in return, which has a delay that’s 2 
              less than its original (faster); a failure costs you the sharpening 
              stone and returns the rusty weapon. 
              The drawbacks to this method are that it’s time consuming, 
              especially if you need to zone multiple times to get the stones, 
              and rusty weapons are heavy. 
              The other way is to dump points into smithing until it won’t 
              let you anymore&#133; crude and more expensive than sharpening, but effective 
              nonetheless. <i>(You can sharpen long swords up to 26 and two handed 
              swords up to 31 - Ed.)</i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">22-51</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Now begins the hand cramping stages, as you need 
              to start making metal bits. 
              To make a metal bit, put 2 small pieces of ore, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">not 
              stacked</b>, into the forge along with one flask of water. 
              Click ‘combine’.On 
              a failure, you get laughed at by the gods of fate, on a success 
              you get a metal bit. Better 
              make room in your schedule, as for my guide you’ll need at least 
              a 10-slot backpack full of metal bits. 
              After you’ve made these, and they’ll be trivial long before 
              51, you will make toolboxes. 
              Toolboxes are very easy, as they take 1 flask of water and 
              1 metal bit. The problem 
              is, they are containers, and they don’t sell for very much, so you’ll 
              either waste time selling the boxes or money tossing them aside. 
              Toolboxes become trivial at 51.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">52-115</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Big jump, isn’t it? 
              That’s because there are two paths for this leg of your journey. 
              If you have faction in a good aligned city (Qeynos faction 
              is VERY easy, I’m dubious with the Clerics and Corrupt Guards in 
              N Qey, warmly with everyone else), then skewers will be what takes 
              you to 115. You will fail a lot early on, but it’s not as costly 
              or annoying as the alternative listed below. 
              To make skewers, it takes a metal bit, a flask of water, 
              and a skewer mold in the forge. 
              The molds don’t stack, by the way, and are used up on a success 
              or fail. Skewers are 
              trivial at 115.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">For those of you that don’t have faction in a 
              good city, your next step is lanterns. 
              Lanterns take 1 metal bit, 1 flask of water, 1 bottle, and 
              a lantern mold. These 
              are trivial at 68. At 
              this point, you’ll sorely wish you had faction in a good city, as 
              the next step is banded, which takes sheets of metal. 
              To make a sheet of metal, put two small bricks of ore and 
              1 flask of water into the forge and click combine. 
              They will be trivial long before 68, but failures are all 
              too common. Make either 
              banded gorgets (easier and cheaper, fewer raises), boots (costly 
              and more difficult, faster raises), or bracers (in between), each 
              taking 1 sheet of metal, the appropriate mold, and a flask of water.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">116-175</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">This is the money-wasting step, as there is no 
              other reasonable way to make it to 175. 
              Make metal sheets, or buy ‘em from vendors in Qeynos Hills, 
              among other places, and make Banded Cloaks. 
              They take 2 sheets of metal, a flask of water, and a banded 
              cloak mold. 
              You’ll get some failures, but can counteract them by selling 
              easier to make pieces to other PCs.</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">175 and 
              beyond</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">Get a fairly large monetary base before attempting 
              this. Fine Plate will 
              be the best path to reach the 200’s, as most of the materials can 
              be purchased easily. First, 
              smith a Skinning Knife (a large brick of ore, 1 flask of water, 
              a dagger mold, and a hilt mold), then make your way to Everfrost 
              with a sewing kit of any size. 
              You will need to make leather backings first, as Fine Plate 
              and some cultural armors require them. 
              Leather Backings take a Silk Thread (2 spiderling silks in 
              a sewing kit, trivial at Tailoring (15), never fails) and a Low 
              Quality wolf/bear/cat pelt. 
              Everfrost has both spiderlings and wolves/bears, just wandering 
              around saying ‘skin me!’, so oblige! 
              The Skinning Knife is used to lower the quality of a pelt. 
              Put a Skinning Knife and a pelt of any quality other than 
              ruined into the kit and click ‘combine’: to my knowledge, this never 
              fails. You can easily 
              get 4 or 5 stacks of leather padding (trivial in the 30’s, but lots 
              of failures until the 50s in Tailoring) killing these yourself, 
              or buying them from newbies. 
              Fine Steel plate takes Medium Quality Ore, sold in only 3 
              places in the world: Steamfont, Highpass, and Rathe Mountains. 
              Smelt the ore into Folded Medium Quality Sheet Metal by combining 
              in a forge 1 Block (20pp) of MQ ore, 1 smithy hammer (not the cultural 
              one), and a flask of water. 
              For each piece of FS Plate, you need a plate mold (sold in 
              every city save Cabilis and Surefall), 1 leather backing, the smithy 
              hammer (which is always returned unless you botch the recipe), 1 
              flask of water, and MQ Folded metal sheets (1 for bracers and gorgets, 
              3 for breastplates, greaves, and cloaks, and 2 for everything else). 
              Lighter than bronze and similar to the class specific quest 
              armors as far as AC is concerned, FS plate is a good alternative 
              to those that can’t afford the various Crafted or Lambent or what 
              have you. In addition, 
              it can be dyed, but I have not attempted to do so as of yet.</p>
            <p class="headers">Conclusion</p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">It took me a while to reach 175 with this method, 
              and I had to stop for monetary reasons and adventuring’s sake. 
              As I gather info on smithing, I’ll post my findings here or
