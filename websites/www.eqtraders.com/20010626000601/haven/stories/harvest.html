      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The moon was just 
        rising, full and deep orange. Karana's followers called this a harvest 
        moon, as it was generally a sign that the last crops before winter needed 
        to be harvested before a killing frost.<br>
        <br>
        However, this particular follower of Karana was after a harvest of a different 
        sort.<br>
        <br>
        Slaves.<br>
        <br>
        To be more precise, the freeing thereof, from the foul depths of Crushbone.<br>
        <br>
        When she and Joril had been here last time, to defeat D'Vinn, she'd been 
        appalled at their plight, and freed as many as she could. It wasn't enough 
        though. It was never enough.<br>
        <br>
        So, when they'd returned to the area for their honeymoon, she'd decided 
        to do another night-time foray. Joril was busy fletching a large order 
        of arrows for a customer, and she was actually glad he was busy. Not only 
        was it good that his fletching fame had spread so much, but she wanted 
        to spare him the horrors of the slave pits where he'd been imprisoned 
        in his younger days.<br>
        <br>
        The harvest moon rising above her seemed a favorable omen to her as she 
        crept up silently behind a slaver who was napping while on duty.<br>
        <br>
        An hour later, she was doubting the accuracy of omens.<br>
        <br>
        Many slavers lay dead or unconscious, but she'd had no luck finding any 
        of the proper shackle keys for the slaves she'd located. The best she'd 
        been able to do was feed a few from her foraged rations, and tend some 
        minor wounds. If only she knew how to pick locks!<br>
        <br>
        The moon was starting to get higher, and paler, and she knew that her 
        time was running out. The guard would be changing soon, and it was inevitable 
        that the dead slavers would be discovered soon.<br>
        <br>
        She had to get out of there, and soon, before she was discovered. The 
        thought left her seething with helpless frustration, as she wanted, needed, 
        to do more.<br>
        <br>
        Her frustration vanished, to be replaced by total distraction, as she 
        crept past a slave pit next to the castle. She heard the most extraordinary 
        thing, and found herself freezing in place, listening.<br>
        <br>
        Someone was singing. Here, in the midst of the dismal cesspit of foul 
        orcs, was the most glorious singing. Granted, the tune was heartrendingly 
        sad, but the voice ... it was as if someone had taken the most melodious 
        songbird they could find, and given it a voice to sing as people did. 
        Such a voice, such a talent, did not belong here.<br>
        <br>
        Ru finally remembered to breathe, just in time to catch and hold it again 
        as voices neared -- a pair of D'Vinn's personal guard was approaching. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If they'd been talking 
        in orcish, she'd not have had a chance of understanding them. However, 
        D'Vinn wouldn't lower himself to speak orcish, so his personal guard was 
        required to speak Common. She strained to decipher their mangling of the 
        language.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Little one won't sing long. D'Vinn wants in his room. Wants more 
        than her voice.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        An orcish chuckle followed the words, and Ru's hand closed quietly around 
        her longsword as she listened.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Huh. Guess rumors that he her father wrong.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Ungh. Not sure. Think would stop him if true? Only a halfbreed.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Carefully, Ru slipped deeper into the shadows, flooded with conflicting 
        emotions. Was it possible that the foul dark elf, D'Vinn, that made his 
        home here may have spawned a child on a slave? Could she allow such a 
        bloodline to continue? <br>
        <br>
        It sounded like there was some doubt as to the father of the child, but 
        still, the thought of a child of that, that ... beast .... On the other 
        hand, could someone who sang that sorrowfully truly resemble her father, 
        if the rumors of her parentage were true?<br>
        <br>
        She was pulled from her thoughts as the singing ceased abruptly due to 
        the orcs' arrival at their destination.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;P-p-please. N-no. I d-don't want t-to g-go! I promise I w-won't 
        b-be any m-more t-trouble!&quot; <br>
        <br>
        Ru's heart nearly tore in two at the anguished stuttering coming from 
        the slave pit. Karana preserve her, that child sounded like she was only 
        10 or so, far too young and innocent for what was about to happen.<br>
        <br>
        Her mind made up, she slipped out of the shadows behind the guards. One 
        held a pale, struggling young form easily in it's meaty grasp, while the 
        other looked on, snickering.<br>
        <br>
        She struck from behind, sliding a longsword through the ribs and into 
        the heart of the one holding the child. Letting go her grasp on the blade, 
        she left it embedded there as she uncoiled her whip and clenched her tomahawk 
        more tightly.<br>
        <br>
        With a yell, the other guard was upon her, and she heard the cry repeated 
        from another part of the compound as the orcs were alerted that *something* 
        was wrong.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Run, little one!&quot; Ru wasted no more breath, no more time, but 
        launched into combat, knowing that she only had a few moments before reinforcements 
        arrived.<br>
        <br>
        The guard was tough, but Ru's memory of haunted violet eyes, looking out 
        from a tear-streaked face that reminded her of her when she was young 
        goaded her to new feats of strength and skill. Battlefury, pure raw rage, 
        tempered by a maternal instinct she never knew she had, washed over her.<br>
        <br>
        The guard didn't last long, nor did the two centurious who were near. 
        But the hue and cry had started, and it was time to flee.<br>
        <br>
        She stopped to grab her longsword from the first dead guard, but it was 
        gone, and so was the child.<br>
        <br>
        Needing no further urging, Ru fled.<br>
        <br>
        ~~~~<br>
        <br>
        A while later, when she'd shaken off all pursuit, she doubled back, searching 
        the trampled ground for telltale signs.<br>
        <br>
        In the forest of Greater Faydark, she found what she was looking for. 
        Tracks left by bare feet, with tiny drops of blood here and there showing 
        that the feet were badly abraded, as if from fleeing heedlessly over rock 
        and root.<br>
        <br>
        Carefully, Ru started disguising or brushing away the tracks, even as 
        she followed them herself. She wanted no other to be able to follow the 
        trail.<br>
        <br>
        The moon was starting to set by the time she found her target, hidden 
        deep within a thicket. The poor thing let out a squeak of fear as Ru seemed 
        to materialize out of nowhere, and then promptly fainted, dropping Ru's 
        missing longsword in the process.<br>
        <br>
        Ru took the next few moments to look the girl over. She was what was commonly 
        known as half-elven, a name that was a catch-all for any pointy-eared 
        person of at least partial elven descent. It could mean a mix of various 
        elven races, or it could be one-eighth or three-fourths elven. Society 
        didn't care, as to most eyes, they all looked the same. Half breeds. Like 
        Ru.<br>
        <br>
        Silver-haired and slender, Ru noted enough telltale signs to guess that 
        there was quite a bit of human in her, as well one of the smaller elven 
        races. It was hard to tell in the waning moonlight, but her skin looked 
        too fair for her to have a dark elf for a father. Skin color varied quite 
        a bit on halfbreeds, however, and her cheek bones and other features were 
        sharp enough that it was hard to be sure one way or the other.<br>
        <br>
        Carefully, Ru cleaned the longsword of gore and dirt, and then stood there, 
        staring down at the prone figure. For a brief moment, her hand tightened 
        on the hilt of the blade. It would be so easy ...<br>
        <br>
        Her eyes strayed to the scars on the girl's wrists. Manacle scars, unless 
        she missed her guess. And more on her ankles.<br>
        <br>
        Ashamed of herself, Ru sheathed her blade and crouched next to the girl. 
        A tell-tale tensing told her that the lass was conscious, even though 
        her eyes were closed. She was bracing herself for a blow.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Easy lass. I won't hurt you, but we need to get you out of here 
        in case they widen the search.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Wary voilet eyes looked up at her and Ru had to turn her face away to 
        hide sudden tears. Just so must Ru herself have looked up at Mortekai 
        when he rescued her from Blackburrow. Like a cornered beast that was half 
        fearing, half praying for a merciful death blow.<br>
        <br>
        With an effort she forced out the words, knowing that if D'Vinn wanted 
        this child, the search would resume. &quot;Let me bind your feet, and 
        then we're going to the docks. I'm Ru, by the way.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        &quot;I'm M-Meek.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        With little further ado, they were off. Joril would know how to sneak 
        her out of here ... if he could control his own hatred for D'Vinn, and 
        keep it from spilling onto Meek's thin shoulders.</font></p>

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It was the end of 
        harvest time in West Karana, and the druids were busy with the last of 
        the grain. In a large barn, one druid was threshing the wheat from the 
        chaff by using the Whirling Wind spell upon it. The lighter chaff was 
        flung out to the edges of the barn, while the grain didn't move far before 
        it sank again. Migrant workers, adults and half-grown children, then swept 
        the chaff out the doors before the brief burst of wind was called up again, 
        to separate more of the precious grain.<br>
        <br>
        One of the younger of these homeless ones sang quietly as she worked, 
        knowing she couldn't be heard over the din of the frantic activity. Rain

        <br>
        Born a slave, she'd been beaten more times than she could count due to 
        difficulty speaking, and only her lovely singing voice, which rivaled 
        that of her dead mother's, had saved her from permanent maiming or death.<br>
        <br>
        She was free now, and over a continent away from the terrors of Crushbone, 
        but she still woke crying in terror many nights, still went into blind 
        panics when she saw a dark elf, or heard mention of orcs. Thirteen years 
        of slavery was not easily erased by a few days of freedom.<br>
        <br>
        Meek still didn't understand *why* Ruldari had freed her. The woman seemed 
        barely able to tolerate her presence, often looking away after a quick 
        glance. And there were a couple times when both she and her husband looked 
        ready to run her through.<br>
        <br>
        A shudder ran through her over the &quot;discussion&quot; she'd overheard 
        between Ruldari and her husband, Joril.<br>
        <br>
        &quot; ... she won't, or can't, confirm who her father was. Even it *is* 
        true that she's a by-blow of D'Vinn's, she's a mere child. An innocent. 
        A former slave ... just like you were, Jo. She needs our help to escape 
        this island.&quot; Ru's voice was thick with emotion, and the eavesdropping 
        Meek could tell that the woman still battled within herself over what 
        to do with her.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;I'm sorry, m'love. I won't help. Not if there's even a chance that 
        the bast---- D'Vinn is her father. Innocent she might be, but that bad 
        blood might tell at some future point.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        There was a ringing sound of a weapon being drawn. &quot;Then you'd best 
        run this through her heart now, while she is sleeping, because if we don't 
        get her off Faydwer soon, death will be kinder than what D'Vinn will do 
        to her when he finds her.&quot; Her voice quieted, and Meek had to strain 
        to hear the next words. &quot;And then think on your own daughter, husband.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        There'd been dead silence a long moment, then the ringing of a blade hitting 
        the floor. Meek heard the door to the street open, then slam shuthard 
        enough to shake the rafters. Then, all was silent but for the sound of 
        Ruldari breaking into heartrending sobs.<br>
        <br>
        A few hours later, a tight-lipped Ruldari had secreted her on a boat bound 
        for Freeport, with a small sack of provisions and a few coins, and left. 
        Once the boat was far to sea, a merchant sought out her hiding-place, 
        claiming that Joril had tasked him with getting her safely to Qeynos, 
        hidden in his caravan.<br>
        <br>
        She'd been suspicious, fearing that she'd escaped from one form of slavery, 
        just to have been traded into another form of bondage. In the end, however, 
        exhaustion and fear wore down her resistance ... that and the sight of 
        a dark elf standing on the docks when they docked in Freeport.<br>
        <br>
        When they hit West Karana, however, Meek overheard him say something about 
        taking &quot;care of her&quot;, and had fled, fearing the worst. Since 
        then, she'd been living hand to mouth, scavenging what she could, singing 
        for her supper, and finding odd jobs where nobody would ask questions 
        about her scars or her stutter.<br>
        <br>
        She didn't know yet if she would be considered grain or chaff in the final 
        reckoning, but she was going to try to make the best of her new-won freedom.<br>
        <br>
        And one day, &quot;dear, beloved&quot; D'Vinn was going to get a special 
        visitor. One that would teach him how to sing soprano ... by virtue of 
        a knife blade. Then would her mother's death be avenged.</font></p>

        her hair forward over her face, then stopped with a sigh. Old habits die 
        hard. No longer could she hide behind the long silver tresses. D'Vinn 
        had treasured her hair and her voice, and recently had seemed to take 
        an interest in her budding figure. There was little she could do about 
        her figure, and she refused to stop singing to spite him, but the hair, 
        that glorious hair, that she could deal with. She'd hacked it short soon

        at all her new possessions, even as they made her more on her guard. Everyone

        of the motives behind some of the gifts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meek was unused to 
        generosity. Slaves in Crushbone learned quickly that they could call nothing 
        &quot;theirs&quot;. When someone managed to scavenge an item, it was quickly 
        hidden away, for fear it would be taken.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some of these items 
        were used for bribes. Bribery was something she understood well. Gifts 
        with no strings attached were ... incomprehensible. There must be a catch.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Of course, she didn't 
        view the gifts she'd been <i>giving</i> in the same light. They were insurance, 
        or so she told herself. A few bone chips to a necromancer here, a few 
        batwings to a shaman there. These things would hopefully be remembered 
        if she was ever backed into a corner and needed help. Only a tiny, hidden 
        part of her mind would admit that she simply enjoyed seeing the look of 
        pleasure on people's faces. Insurance, nothing more.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Try though she might,

        cracked in two the staff she'd been learning to use on a particularly 
        thick-skulled skeleton. And then, to bring her into <i>Blackburrow</i>, 
        when she only had 4 circles of training?! It had seemed like folly, but 
        the woman was so authoritative in her command to follow, that follow she 
        did, knees knocking in fear. However, she'd returned from the trip with 
        a growing array of skills and loot, and had been granted the knowledge

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The bard, Rhaine, 
        was also hard to figure out. She'd seemed to truly enjoy listening to 
        Meek's original song, and Meek had been agog at the gifts she'd been given, 
        but ...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Rhaine had taken 
        her to the bard's guild to audition, and after a few moments of panic, 
        Meek sang the first thing that came to mind. However, as Rhaine excused 
        herself a moment to aid in locating someone's corpse, her earlier words 
        came rushing back to Meek. She'd been introduced to the bard guild master 
        who was &quot;master of all things both musical and magical.&quot; Master? 
        Suddenly, the whip that Rhaine had given her, and the &quot;guild&quot; 
        seemed something much more ominous. She'd not call <i>anyone</i> master 
        again. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mastermastermastermaster 
        .... noooooo!</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meek had fled in 
        a blind panic to the docks, and hidden on the first ship bound to Erudin.</font></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Once she'd calmed 
        down a bit, she started realizing that <i>all</i> the guilds called their 
        leader &quot;master&quot; as a term of respect, <i>not</i> of subservience. 
        For hours, her mind spun in circles, trying to figure out Rhaine's motives, 
        and trying to figure out what the woman's reaction would be if she <i>had</i> 
        been simply being kind.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Meek didn't want 
        to be considered an ungrateful foolish chit, but at the same time, better 
        an ungrateful one than an enslaved one.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">So, she returned 
        to the Qeynos area and worked on her various emergency caches. Should 
        ever trouble arise, she had plenty of hiding spots to run to. They held 
        things such as spare clothing, food, a rusty dagger, a short sword, more 
        throwing daggers, a wooden staff -- anything she might need for survival 
        if she had to run for it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She worked long, 
        hard, hours learning multiple weapon styles. She still preferred slashing 
        weapons, but was also becoming proficient at staves, daggers, thrown weapons, 
        and had learned a bit of hand-to-hand as well. She was determined to never 
        be defenseless again. She was quite proud of her growing proficiency, 
        all the more so when Azeen commented on it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Azeen - now there 
        was the one person she didn't suspect of ulterior motives. She'd grown 
        up in the slave pits surrounded by dwarves, and they'd always done their 
        best to shield her from the attention of the slavers where they could. 
        She understood their gruffness, and their soft hearts, and she knew of 
        the vows that their paladins took. Azeen truly wanted to help someone 
        in need. She never searched further for a motive behind his actions. ... 
        could it be that she may have found a friend?</font></p>
