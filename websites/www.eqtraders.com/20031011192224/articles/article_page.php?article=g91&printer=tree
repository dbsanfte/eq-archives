<span class="headers">Learn How to Perform Practice Spell Research</span>
<p>
<p>Creation of the Practice Runes is done in the Concordance of Research 
              (a book/container obtained through a quest) and requires no skill 
              whatsoever. Research Skill increases are only obtained by combining 
              pairs of runes (Azia and Beza) in your classes actual research tome 
              (bought in most any spell caster&#8217;s guildhall.) </p>
            <p><strong>Wizards:</strong> Lexicon <br>
              <strong>Enchanters:</strong> Tome of Endless Enchantments <br>
              <strong>Necromancers:</strong> Book of Dark Bindings <br>
              <strong>Magicians:</strong> Elemental Grimoire </p>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong></p>
            <ol>
              <li> You can only put ONE point into spell research with your Guild 
                Trainer at level 16. At level 19 you will be able to put more 
                points in</li>
              <li> Skill cap for research is (level-15)*5. </li>
              <li> the maximum level you can currently reach through Practice 
                Research skill-ups is 184. The remaining 16 points to reach 200 
                will have to be practice points, bought at your Guildhall, or 
                obtained through Advanced (50+ spells) Research. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>-------- </p>
            <p>All Practice Runes require a Quill and a piece of Parchment, in

              Trivials for Wizard Research spells: <br>

            <p>A listing of Trivials for Mage and Necro and Enchanter Research 
              spells was not found in the respective forums, however the class 
              forums and other resources do have useful spreadsheets/checklists 
              to help you track your collection of research components. </p>
            <p>------- </p>
            <p><strong>Additional comments: </strong>as many may point out, practice 
              runes are a lot of trouble. It may just be easier to combine ACTUAL 
              research components for skill-ups. However, with the advent of Celestial 
              Essence, research runes, pages and words may no longer be as easily 
              obtainable as in the past. You can also use your Training Points 
              and buy all your skill, if you have the points and cash to spend 
              and that&#8217;s the route you want to go. It&#8217;s up to the 
              researcher to decide the best path for him/her self. </p>
            <p>-------- </p>
            <p>Good luck and may your skill-ups be plentiful and your failures 
              few and far between.<br>
