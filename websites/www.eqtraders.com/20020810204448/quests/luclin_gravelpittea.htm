            <h3> Gravel Pit Tea </h3>
            <p><i>This involved quest results in faction and a tiny bit of xp, 
              as well as a ceremonial strainer used for some of these quest brews. 
              </i></p>
            <p><i>Feb 4: The number of gravel leaf teas needed by Guard Jabbar 
              has been increased from 6 to 8. </i></p>
            <p>Speak with Merchant Ahlam in Shar Vahl (2nd floor of the tavern 
              at loc -201, -178). He will ask if you have come to help. Give him 
              your <a href="citizenship.htm">personal acrylia slate</a> and he 
              will give you a 10-slot wrist pouch and return your personal acrylia 
              slate. (Remember to have a container slot free for the pouch before 
              you do this.) </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Merchant Ahlam says 'Ah good I was hoping you'd be along soon. 
                I need you to collect some Gravel tea leaves from below the city. 
                I need these leaves to make some tea for the guards under the 
                arena. I need 10 of these leaves to brew enough tea for the guards. 
                Take this pouch and fill it with leaves and return it to me.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Fill the bag with ten gravel pit leaves, which are a rare drop 
              off the young rockhoppers in the pit around Shar Vahl. Combine it, 
              and return the pouch to Merchant Ahlam. He will give you his seal 
              and ask if you are interested in Vah Shir brewing. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Merchant Ahlam says 'Many thanks Krishin, I'll be going to brew 
                this tea up for the guards now. Take this seal as proof of your 
                helping me. You wouldn't happen to know anyone who would be [interested] 
                in learning the art of Vah Shir Brewing would you? I could really 
                use the help in these hard times, I can barely keep up with all 
                the demand.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If you say that you are interested, he tells you he will only teach 
              those who have his seal. Hand the seal back to him, and he will 
              give you an Acrylia sand filter with which to purify water.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Merchant Ahlam says 'Well done Krishin, it is now time to start 
                down the path of learning the art of Vah Shir brewing. You'll 
                need a steady hand if you are to master the brew barrel. The first 
                thing you'll need to learn is how to purify the water we use for 
                all our finest brews. Take this Acrylia filter and use it to [purify 
                water]. Bring me 4 flasks of crystal clear water and I'll teach 
                you how to make the tea from the gravel tea leaves.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Ask him how to purify water and he says that the only water that 
              can be used must come from Gamali, who is in Hollowshade Moor on 
              the shore north of the zone to Paludal Caverns (loc 1092, 2523). 
              You must by hand her an empty bottle and in return you get a bottle 
              of fresh water (no drop). Combine your filter and the water in a 
              brew barrel and receive back your filter and a flask of Crystal 
              Clear Water (trivial at 60 skill). <i>(You no longer lose the filter 
              on a failed combine - Jan. 25)</i></p>
            <p>Give Merchant Ahlam 4 flasks of crystal clear water, and he will 
              mention that Guard Jabbar under the arena needs a shipment of gravel 
              leaf tea to help sedate the prisoners. He will give you an <font color="#400000"><b>eight-slot</b></font> 
              container in which to place the tea to bring to the guard (and as 
              of a recent patch, he now wants 8 teas in the container, not 6). 
              The tea is made by combining a gravel pit leaf and a crystal clear 
              water in a brew barrel. Trivial is greater than 94. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Merchant Ahlam says 'Very good Krishin, this water is perfect 
                for making Gravel leaf tea. I've just received a message from 
                Guard Jabbar under the arena needs a shipment of [Gravel leaf 
                tea] to help sedate the prisoners. Fill a crate with bottles of 
                Gravel leaf tea and take it to Guard Jabbar.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Bring the container with the 8 teas in it (combine it before handing 
              it in!) to Guard Jabbar. Guard Jabbar will then give you his seal, 
              which you then bring back to Merchant Ahlam. </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Guard Jabbar says 'Ah the tea! I've been anxiously awaiting your 
                arrival Krishin, we'd almost run out of that wonderful Gravel 
                leaf tea. Take this seal back to Ahlam, and give him my thanks.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Upon giving the seal to Merchant Ahlam, he will give you a no drop 
              metal strainer, and he will ask you to make Hollow Palm Tea.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Merchant Ahlam says 'Very good Krishin, the guards had been waiting 
                for that tea all day. I think you're ready to move on to something 
                a bit more challenging now. Take this strainer, it will allow 
                you to create some very potent brews from some of the more rare 
                herbs to be found near the city. You'll want to start by making 
                some [Hollow palm tea] to get used to how the strainer works.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Merchant Ahlam has the following to say about Hollow palm tea:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Merchant Ahlam says 'You'll need some Crystal water, just as 
                you do with all of our teas, and some Hollow palm roots. You can 
                find Hollow palms out in the moors, watch out for the grimlings 
                though. Once you find the roots just use the strainer to control 
                the flow of water over the leaves. If you do it correctly you'll 
                create a very potent brew. When you get it right bring the strainer 
                back to me with a sample of your work.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Hollowshade palm roots are found in Hollowshade Moor, over on the 
              islands that Gamali stands near. They are a ground spawn under the 
              trees, and grimling herders path right through there, so if you 
              can't take them on make sure none wander near you. Combine one root, 
              crystal clear water, and the strainer in a brew barrel. It is not 
              trivial skill 142, and every failure gives back the strainer. Result 
              was Hollow Palm Tea, nothing special about it except that it was 
              no drop. Hand the tea and strainer to Ahlam and he says: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Merchant Ahlam sips the tea. A bit of a glazed look comes across 
                his face. Ahlam says, 'Mmmmm, I do so love Hollow palm tea. This 
                is a bit mild for Hollow palm tea though, you might want to try 
                adding some spices next time for a bit more flavor. Here's your 
                strainer back, I etched some runes into that should add to the 
                potency of your brews. I hear the grimlings make a very potent 
                sort of tea from the grimroot out in the forest, but the thought 
                of drinking anything made from grimroot makes my stomach churn. 
                At any rate, tinker a bit with that strainer and don't be afraid 
                of trying some new brews with it. If you create anything interesting 
                that you think I might like bring it to me so I can taste it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>He then gives you back a runed metal strainer. Adding the spices 
              like he suggests results in Spice Hollow Palm tea. (It's a whistle 
              wetter that adds 2 wis and 10 Disease Resist). There seems to be 
              no quest for it, but it's a known brewing variation. There are two 
              versions of this recipe: hollowshade palm root, crystal clear water, 
              runed metal strainer <b>OR</b> hollowshade palm root, water flask, 
              acrylia handled strainer. (Received in the next step of the quest, 
              in the paragraph below.) Trivial is 162.</p>
            <p>Then it's time to make Spiced Grimroot Tea. (Grimroot, spices, 
              crystal clear water, runed metal strainer.) Grimroots can be found 
              as a ground spawn inside the grimling huts in Hollowshade Moor. 
              Give Merchant Ahlam a Spiced Grimroot Tea, and he will give you 
              seal of approval. He then asks for that seal and the strainer. Give 
              both items to him and you will recieve an Acrylia Handled Strainer, 
              which allows you to use normal flasks of water in the teas in place 
              of crystal clear water. After you have received this strainer, you 
              can make further spiced grimroot tea by either the above recipe 
              <b>OR</b> can use grimroot, spices, water flask and acrylia handled 
              strainer. Brewing trivial is 162.</p>
            <p>In the barracks of Katta Castellum, there is a sick legionnaire 
              (Legionnaire Neville). Hail him for the following response:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Legionnaire Neville coughs a bit and looks up at you with tired, 
                bleary eyes, 'Ugh, I have not had such a cold as this since I 
                was a boy. I have heard of a tea-maker in the city of the Vah 
                Shir that makes a stamina enhancing tea. I would like to try some 
                and see if it might help.'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Asking him &quot;what tea maker?&quot; brings the following response:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Legionnaire Neville says 'ACHOO! Excuse me. It was some kind 
                of root tea... saucy greyroot... sparkly greenroot... something 
                like that I think. The brewer's name was... Adam... Lama... Oh 
                I just cannot think straight.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Feeding him the spiced grimroot tea results in faction and a small 
              amount of experience.</p>
