            <p><img src="pics/niami_purple.jpg" align="left"> What? Hm? Ye're 
              still curious aboot me? Och! I be jus' a simple halfling cleric 
              lass wi' a penchant frae trade skills, mischief, an' friendship, 
              in nae particular order. I hide o'er on that realm known as Tunare 
              most of th' time, an' timeshare wi' 10 other personas who help me 
              wi' me tradeskills, exploration, an' roleplay. I be th' creator 
              o' the famed <a href="haven/stories/tickled.html">Bristlebane Tickle 
              Res Technique</a> that brings folks back tae life wi' laughter (an' 
              a large feather!)</p>
            <p>Och, ye want tae know aboot the OOC human that sits behind me an' 
              tells me what tae do? She's a happily married redhead wi' a husband 
              who's almost as much of an EQ addict as she is (he's not matched 
              her 11 characters on a single server part yet, but give him time), 
              3 cats, o'er 300 days of in-game time (with 6 folks in the level 
              50+ range) in EQ since the final phase of beta. All else is subject 
              tae change on a whim. </p>
            <p>She's also MORE than a little overloaded by folks who feel they 
              need to demand, beg, harass, and/or cajole her into spending more 
              of her playtime personally attending to their questions, instead 
              of bothering to either look around the site for the answer, or post 
              something to the message boards. Please do NOT add to this load 
              by logging on to her server and sending tell bombs (even tells from 
              those folks who create newbies on my server to &quot;thank&quot; 
              me add up in a huge hurry), or using EZBoards to send private messages 
              asking for answers to tradeskill questions. This is one of the many 
              things that should be going to the message boards, so that the first 
              doesn't interrupt playtime and the second gets answers from more 
              than just one overworked halfling.</p>
            <p>Note: the above image is extremely old, as Niami is no longer wearing 
              any of her old purple armor. Eventually I will put up a new image 
              of her, but it's changed so much due to new armor/weapons as well 
              as Luclin textures (which seem determined to change her face without 
              warning every once in a while) that I am waiting for the dust to 
              settle before I show folks the newer, slimmer Niami.</p>
