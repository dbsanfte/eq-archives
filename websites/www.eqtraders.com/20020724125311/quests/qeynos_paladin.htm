            <h3> Qeynos Paladin Armor Quest<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop and allow the 
              young human paladin to gain a small amount of smithing skill.
            <p>
            <p>This quest originates with Miltiades Tal`Azroth in Qeynos. More 
              details will be added as they become available.</p>
            <p>Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'Greetings and salutations Greyjoy, I 
              am Miltiades Tal`Azroth Crusader of Karana. I have spent all of 
              my years here in Qeynos and gathered infinite knowledge from my 
              teachers on my path to enlightenment. I have also started training 
              new recruits to help them find their calling as a Holy Warrior of 
              Karana. If you are a [Paladin of Karana] I might have some tasks 
              for you to complete.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I am a Paladin of Karana.'</p>
            <p>Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'That is excellent news Greyjoy, As a 
              Knight in training of Karana I would like to offer you a series 
              of [tests] what will test your devotion to yourself and your god.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'What tests?'</p>
            <p>Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'I have put together a series of tests 
              that will enable our new recruits to create their own armor. You 
              will use a Rainkeepers Assembly Kit to combine assorted items that 
              you will collect from both the hunting areas surround Qeynos and 
              the city itself. Combining these magical items in your kit will 
              create a material that you will place in a forge along with molds 
              that I will present to you to create your armor. Are you ready to 
              start [fashioning your materials]?'</p>
            <p>You say, 'I am ready to start fashioning my materials.'</p>
            <p>Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'Excellent Greyjoy, Please take this 
              Rainkeepers Assembly Kit. Now for your materials you will fashion 
              you will obviously need to know what items are used for what armor 
              materials. Simply tell me what armor piece you [want] to create 
              and I will present you with the recipe for that specific armor material. 
              I can present you with the molds and recipes necessary for creating

            <p>You say, 'What final favor?'</p>
            <p>Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'In the past I have sent some of my finest 
              messengers to Qeynos Hills to deliver messages to the Sayers about 
              current events in Qeynos. However the last few I have sent did not 
              return so I began to look into what might have happened when I received 
              word that the Bloodsabers had claimed responsibility for the slayings. 
              I must ask that you bring me the head of a certain Bloodsaber who 
              I think is [responsible] for the slayings.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'Who is responsible?'</p>
            <p>Miltiades Tal`Azroth says 'I have reason to believe that Tovax 
              Vmar is behind this, a dreaded necromancer that has been known to 
              prowl the hills. Having Tovax dead will surely send a message to 
              the Bloodsabers to tread lightly for their days are numbered. If 
              you are able to find Tovax return to me his necklace along with 
              2 Enchanted Wisp Globes and I will reward you with a weapon suitable 
              for a true knight of Karana.' </p>
