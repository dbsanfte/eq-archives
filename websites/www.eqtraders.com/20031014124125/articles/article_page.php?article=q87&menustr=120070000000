<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Kelethin. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ELF/HEF,RNG only. They are no-fail smithing combines. Armor has a green chain graphic when worn. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
