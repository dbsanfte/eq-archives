            <p> <i>This section will be under construction for quite a while, 
              so please pardon the mess. I'll be taking information found in many 
              message board posts and trying to make them coherent. In some cases, 
              such as the class-specific progressive quests, this will take a 
              considerable amount of time.</i> 
            <p>For many of the Vah Shir quests, you must first complete the newbie 
              citizenship quest and receive a personal acrylia slate for your 
              efforts. This slate is handed in to many NPCs (they return it) in 
              order to trigger quests.

            <p>While this quest is not really a tradeskill quest, it is an important 
              one for tradesfolk who wish to operate out of the Shadow Haven area. 
              The quest results in an Amulet of the Haven (magic, lore, no drop): 
              AC 1, CHA 2, and a faction modifier. It also adjusts several factions 
              in the area, making it easier to shop there. Some merchants will 
              still be dubious after completing the quest, so you may need to 
              loop it several times before you can shop with all the merchants.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It starts in Shadow Haven with Trade Commissioner Henry, after 
              you hail him ...</p>
            <p>Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Hello there, traveler. I don't believe 
              that I have seen you around these parts before- then again, I could 
              have and simply forgotten since there have been so many new faces 
              around here. However, if you are a newcomer to Shadowhaven, please 
              make sure that you [register for trading] in the Haven. Registering 
              with the Traders of the Haven will legitimize you in the eyes of 
              local merchants and customers. </p>
            <p>You say, 'register for trading'</p>
            <p>Trade Commissioner Henry says 'It's great that you are interested 
              _____, you will surely be glad you did. I have some simple deliveries 
              that I need completed if you wish to be a registered trader in Shadowhaven. 
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'what deliveries?'</p>
            <p>Trade Commissioner Henry says 'The deliveries are simple enough, 
              I just need you to bring some letters to some merchants of the Haven 
              that are currently working in other locations. Will you [deliver 
              these letters]? </p>
            <p>You say, 'I will deliver these letters'</p>
            <p>Trade Commissioner Henry says 'I surely do appreciate the help, 
              _____- clearly you understand the value of solid relations with 
              the locals. First, I will need you to take this newsletter to Sateal. 
              He is currently on assignment in the Bazaar and has been out of 
              the loop on the happenings of Shadowhaven because of his heavy workload. 
              Bring this to him and then return to me with his sales report. I 
              look forward to seeing you soon. </p>
            <p>Receive a newsletter and bring it to Sateal in The Bazaar (inside 
              the large merchant area).</p>
            <p>Sateal Deirosap says 'Ah great, I have been meaning to go and pick 
              one of these up from the Trade Commissioner but I have been very 
              busy with my work. I'm sure Henry has been waiting for my sales 
              report so here it is. Please return it to him for me if you could 
              and thanks again! </p>
            <p><i>(You receive only experience for this portion of the quest.)</i></p>
            <p>Receive sales report and bring it back to Trade Commissioner Henry.</p>
            <p>Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Great to see you back so soon _____, 
              you looked like a dependable person from the start. The next thing 
              I need you to do is a bit more dangerous, but by the looks of you 
              I doubt it will be a problem. Go to the Shadowhaven outpost in Fungusgrove 
              and give Thar this book. Thar is a great merchant but I have seen 
              his sales steadily declining, so I figured this book full of selling 
              tips will help him regain his confidence and help him produce the 
              kinds of numbers I know he is capable of. If his economy report 
              is ready please, bring that back to me when you return. </p>

            <p>Receive book of selling tips and take to Thar Anton in the merchant 
              area of Fungus Grove.</p>
            <p>Thar Anton says 'I see you have brought a book from the Commissioner. 
              Well I'm not much for reading but I will surely try anything that 
              may increase my sales. Anyways I'm sure you arent that interested 
              in how bad my sales are and would like to be on your way so here 
              you go. </p>

            <p>Trade Commissioner Henry says 'Excellent work _____, I knew that 
              you were someone that I could trust to get the job done. The trader's 
              union of Shadowhaven will hear of your solid work ethic. Perhaps 
              a courier job is in your future, I couldn't have expected anyone 
              to make these deliveries as fast as you did! Please take this amulet 
              as a symbol of your dedication to Shadowhaven's booming economy. 
              While wearing this you are sure to get all the greatest deals from 
              the merchants of the Haven both here and in the bazaar. It was a 
              pleasure meeting, you and thanks for all of your help. </p>

              the Amulet of the Haven. Since the amulet is lore, if you decide 
              to loop this quest, you will receive a duplicate lore message when 
              you hand in Thar's report, but you will still receive the faction 
              adjustments. </i></p>

              thin claws off needle clawed rockhoppers for a stackable claw needle. 
              These needles are used to make shaded hopperhide armor and are consumed 
              (used up) when you make the armor. (Failure returns the needle, 
              but uses up the armor pieces, success returns the new armor, but 
              uses up the needle.)

            <p><b><a name="skinning"></a>Vah Shir Skinning Knife</b> - hand Broker 
              Fahaar in Shar Vahl your personal acrylia slate. He will give you 
              a 4-slot Young Hopperhide Sack (lore, no drop). Combine 4 young 
              rockhopper hides (no drop off young rockhoppers, from the pit surrounding 
              Shar Vahl) and return the filled bag to Broker Fahaar to receive 
              a leather cord (no drop) and a stretched hopperhide. Return 4 cords 
              to and receive a <b>Vah Shir skinning knife</b>. 
            <p>Make a <a href="../secrets/recipes_luclin.htm#belts">rough belt 
              strap</a> and give it to Broker Fahaar to receive your <b>Vah Shir

            <p>Next, bring Broker Fahaar a <b><a href="../secrets/recipes_luclin.htm#belts">black

              and a <b>bone beaded belt</b></a> plus your Vah Shir needle set 
              to receive an <b>acrylia needle</b>. These belts are lore, so if 
              you wish to keep one of either of the belts, hand them off to a 
              friend while you make another set for this quest. Once you pass 
              this part of the quest, you will not have your Vah Shir needle set, 
              and the belt recipes do not work with the acrylia need.
            <p>Broker Fahaar will then ask you to make him <a href="../secrets/recipes_luclin.htm#belts"><b>owlbear 
              feathered leggings</b></a>. Once you have made the leggings, and 
              give them to him, he will give you a 6-slot (no drop, of course) 
              container to fill with six <a href="../secrets/recipes_luclin.htm#belts"><b>owlbear 
              tunics</b></a>. (As always, make sure you have room for the extra 
              container in your inventory.)
            <p>Combine 6 owlbear tunics in the container, and hand the result 
              to Elder Hymnist Hotitash (sp?) in the Bard guild in the Shar Vahl 
              Palace. He will give you a Sleek Sonic Wolfhide Tunic (AC 16, STR2, 
              STA5, CHA 10; WAR, BST, ROG, BRD, SHM; VAH)

              bloodling carapaces and combine. Hand the result to Master Barkhem 
              and he gives you a bloodling carapace plate. Repeat the quest a 
              second time. Then combine two bloodling carapace plates with nepeta 
              oil extract (<a href="../location/shar_vahl.htm">merchant sold</a>) 
              and a (medium) banded tunic mold in the forge. Hand the completed 
              <i>Bloodling Plate Mail</i> tunic to Master Barkhem. He will return 
              the tunic and give you a <b>Vah Shir apprentice mallet </b>(no drop, 
              lore)<b>.</b> (Bloodling Plate Mail: AC 13, sv disease 1, wt 7.5; 
              WAR CLR PAL RNG SHD BRD ROG SHM; HUM BAR ERU ELF HIE DEF HEF IKS 
              VAH) Should you ever lose your apprentice mallet, you may hand in 
              the tunic again to receive another one.</p>
            <p>Then ask Master Barkhem &quot;what repair order?&quot; He will 
              give you a (lore) work order to repair the shields of the 4 bridge 
              guards (the two guards on the far end of the North and South Bridges). 
              Hand the note to one of the proper guards. (Make <i>absolutely sure</i> 
              before you hand in the note to the guard, that the guard's shield 
              is visible. If you cannot see their shield, then someone else is 
              running the quest with that guard, and handing in the note to that 
              guard will cause him/her to despawn.) The guard will give you a 
              dented shield, which starts the timed portion of this quest. Combine 
              the dented shield and the Vah Shir apprentice mallet in the forge. 
              (If you fail the combine, you must let the timer run out before 
              you try to repair another shield for him, as he'll think you already 
              have his shield, and will depop on you if you try to hand him another 
              note.) A successful combine will return an Immaculate Shield, and 
              lists the guard's name in the description, so that you remember 
              your delivery target. Return the shield to the guard to receive 
              a completed repair order. If the guard already has a shield on him, 
              you either took too long, or something caused the guard to respawn. 
              You will need to have someone else hand in a work order to that 
              guard so that you may then give the guard the Immaculate Shield. 
              <i>(Note: while the despawning problem has been reported as &quot;fixed&quot;, 
              there are apparently still issues with guards despawning, respawning.)</i></p>
            <p>Repeat the above paragraph four times, one for each of the four 
              guards, until you have completed work orders for all four guards. 
              Then give the 4 completed work orders back to the Master Barkhem 
              and he will give you a spirit anchor anvil, called a <b>Vah Shir 
              Anvil</b> (no drop, lore).</p>
            <p>After a bit more conversation with Master Barkhem, you can learn 
              about making <b>shadow disks</b>. He will give you an 8-slot &quot;Barkhem's 
              Box&quot; in which to combine 8 shadow disks. The disks are made 
              by combining the following in a forge: swirling shadows (no rent 
              off shades in Shadeweaver's Thicket), metal bits, your Vah Shir 
              Anvil and your Vah Shir Apprentice Mallet. (You receive the anvil 
              and hammer back during the forging.)</p>
            <p>Return the filled and combined box back to Master Barkhem along 
              with your Apprentice Mallet and receive a <b>luclinite hammer</b> 
              (no drop, just like pretty much every other quest tool for these 
              quests). Then make 3 <b>humming orb</b>s using the following recipe: 
              wailing substance (from grimy owlbears in Paludal Caverns), shrieking 
              substance (from sonic wolves), metal rings, Vah Shir Anvil, Luclinite 
              Mallet. (Again, you receive the anvil and mallet back during the 
              forging.) </p>
            <p>Return 3 humming orbs and your luclinite hammer to Master Barkhem 
              for a <b>humming luclinite mallet</b> (no drop), with which you 
              can make shadowscream steel armor. <font color="#400000"><i><b>Note 
              that the shadowscream armor combine currently returns a luclinite 
              mallet, NOT a humming one, so that you must loop the humming orb 
              part of the quest if you wish to make more than one piece of shadowscream 
              armor</b></i></font>.</p>
            <p>If you are a glutton for punishment and are willing to loop this 
              ad nauseum, ask Master Barkhem &quot;what boots&quot; and he will 
              task you with delivering a pair of boots to Rakutah (leader of the 
              rogue guild in Shar Vahl). Giving the boots to Ratukah will cause 
              him to give you a 6-slot quest container and the boots. He asks 
              you to fill the box with 6 pairs of shadowscream steel boots. Boots 
              are made with the following recipe (in a forge): 2 swirling shadows, 
              humming luclinite hammer, vah shir anvil, humming orb, (medium) 
              banded boot mold, water flask (Trivial &gt;239). Completion of this 
              quest gives you postive faction with the Guardians of Shar Vahl, 
              as well as <b>Ratukah's Seal</b> (lore, no drop).</p>
            <p>Return the seal to Master Barkhem and he gives you a pair of <b>Barkhem's 
              Fancy Pantaloons</b> (lore, no orop) STR 4, STA 2, WIS 2, SvMagic 
              10, Wt 4.0 WAR ROG SHM BST; VAH (note there is no AC to them). While 
              Barkhem seems to indicate that there may be other things he may 
              teach you in the future, there did not appear to be a continuation 
              to this quest at this time.</p>
            <hr>
            <p><a name="rallic"></a><b>Rallic Pack</b></p>
            <p>This quest produces a lore 10-slot, 85% weight reduction, container 
              that can store giant-sized items. </p>
            <p>Speak with Rallik in the city of Katta Castellum; he's located 
              in the building resembling a church, with a hedge around it, right 
              next to the Tenebrous zone (loc -101, -39). Enter the building, 
              take the left hall to the end, turn left, he'll be the door on the 
              left. He was indifferent to be as a Tribunal-worshipping shaman, 
              but KOS to a Cazic Thule monk. Hail him, follow the dialog, he asks 
              you to bring back information from a courier. </p>
            <p>The mob you want is called 'a grimling runner'. It can be found 
              in the Tenebrous Mtns; it spawns on the south side of the zone, 
              right along the wall. If you're coming from the Grimling Forest, 
              turn left after you zone and hug the wall. For me, it spawned on 
              the hill just before the first grimling mine, and pathed toward 
              the mine. It drops a bag, the bag is LORE and NODROP, and not really 
              a bag (it will fit in your bags, just make sure you have a medium 
              sized slot available). Give the bag to Rallik, he will give you 
              the (lore) rallic pack pattern. </p>
            <p>Next you will need a perfect owlbear pelt. Many owlbears can be 
              found in Hollowshade at the owlbear caves, loc is approx 2000 x 
              1000. </p>
            <p>Finally you'll need to head to the newbie area of Shadeweaver's 
              Thicket, just outside of Shar Vahl (conveniently Shar Vahl connects 
              Hollowshade and Shadeweaver's). You want shadeling silks, which 
              you can get from silkworms, or the shades that roam further north 
              (they look like skeletons). You'll need 8 silks total to make 1

            <p>Speak with Merchant Ahlam in Shar Vahl (2nd floor of the tavern 
              at loc -201, -178). He will ask if you have come to help. Give him 
              your personal acrylia slate and he will give you a 10-slot wrist 
              pouch and return your personal acrylia slate. (Remember to have 
              a container slot free for the pouch before you do this.) </p>
            <p>Fill the bag with ten gravel pit leaves, which are a rare drop 
              off the young rockhoppers in the pit around Shar Vahl. Combine it, 
              and return the pouch to Merchant Ahlam. </p>
            <p>He will give you his seal and ask if you are interested in Vah 
              Shir brewing. If you say that you are interested, he tells you he 
              will only teach those who have his seal. Hand the seal back to him, 
              and he will give you an Acrylia sand filter with which to purify 
              water.</p>
            <p>Ask him how to purify water and he says that the only water that 
              can be used must come from Gamali, who is located by the grimling 
              fishing huts in Hollowshade Moor. You must by hand her an empty 
              bottle and in return you get a bottle of fresh water (no drop). 
              Combine your filter and the water in a brew barrel and receive back 
              your filter and a flask of Crystal Clear Water (trivial at 60 skill). 
              <font color="#400000"><b>At this time, if you fail on the water/filter

              attempting this, or you will need to go and collect more gravel 
              pit leaves, etc.</p>
            <p>Give Merchant Ahlam 4 flasks of crystal clear water, and he will 
              mention that Guard Jabbar under the arena needs a shipment of gravel 
              leaf tea to help sedate the prisoners. He will give you an 8-slot 
              container in which to place the tea to bring to the guard <font color="#FF0000"><b>however

              instruments in the set and practice marking runes on the gray jars
