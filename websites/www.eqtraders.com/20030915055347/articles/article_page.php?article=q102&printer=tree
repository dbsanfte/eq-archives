<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of many new youngling armor quests. The resultant armor is lore, no drop, and DEF/SHD only. The combines are no-fail, but can gain you skill increases. Stats for the armor are not yet available, nor is the exact hail text. However, the resulting armor is silver in color. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
