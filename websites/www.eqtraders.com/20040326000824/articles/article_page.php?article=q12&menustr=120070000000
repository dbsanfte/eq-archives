<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. Armor
pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop and are restricted to HUM/WAR. This
quest originates in South Qeynos with Ebon Strongbear. While we do not have
stats for the pieces, it is reported that the armor has a red plate graphic when
worn.</i> <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer
materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a
second one</i>

family is held in high regard here and we always pay our taxes promptly. This
was simply a ploy to steal money and I do not take kindly to that. I must ask
that you retrieve my sisters coinpurse from Beris, he can usually be found in
the hills fishing on his off-duty time. Bring me whatever you can from him along
with 3 perfect gnoll skins and I will reward you with a finely refined blade for
your trouble.'</p>
