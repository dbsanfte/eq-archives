<h3>Templar of Fright Armor - Paineel Cleric Quest</h3>
            <P><i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in 
              Paineel. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, ERU/CLE 
              only. They are no-fail smithing combines. While stats were not provided, 
              we have been told that the graphic for the armor is black plate. 
              Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials 
              often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for 
              a second one </i></p>
<P>You say, 'Hail, Sadorno Chomosh'<BR>Sadorno Chomosh says 'Salutations. I am 
Sadorno Chomosh, Templar of Terror. The path of terror taught to us by Cazic 
Thule is a dangerous way of life. The perils are great but the rewards are 
unimaginable power. In order to harness the powers of fear you must first know 
that which you seek to control, terror, dread, and fright. I presume that you 
are still young and have much to learn. If that is the case I will assist you in 
acquiring [armaments] to aid you on your journey to power.'</P><P>You say, 
'What armaments?'<BR>Sadorno Chomosh says 'You will require this Mail Assembly 
Kit that has been prepared in advance for the construction of Templar of Fright 
Armor. The materials required for the armors construction vary according to the 
section you desire to craft. When you have acquired your suit of armor return to 
me and perhaps you can assist me with a [pending task]. Do you desire to craft a 
[templar of fright helm], a [templar of fright bracer], [templar of fright 
gauntlets], [templar of fright boots], [templar of fright vambraces], [templar 
of fright greaves], or a [templar of fright breastplate]?'</P><P>You say, 'What 
pending task?'<BR>Sadorno Chomosh says 'The Tabernacle of Terror has many 
enemies here on Odus who oppose our teachings our patron deity, Cazic Thule. The 
Priests of Prexus and Quellious in the city of Erudin seek to purge Odus of our 
kind, for they view us as a disgrace to the Erudite race. Behind their disdain 
however, lies fear. It is this fear that allows us to prosper and become more 
powerful than the closed minded fools of Erudin. In the Toxxulia forest you will 
find such a fool, a priest by the name of Terago Omath. This priest has been 
attempting to ward the Toxxulia Forest from the presence of the undead. Seek 
this Terago Omath and return to me with his head.'</P><P>You say, 'I want to 
craft a templar of fright helm'<BR>Sadorno Chomosh says 'To assemble a Templar 
of Fright Helm you will need to obtain two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them 
in a forge with a Water Flask and this Crude Helm Mold. Once that is done 
combine the Crude Bronze Helm with a Ruined Kobold Pelt and a Kobold Skull in 
the Mail Assembly Kit.'</P><P>You say, 'I want to craft a templar of fright 
bracer'<BR>Sadorno Chomosh says 'To assemble a Templar of Fright Bracer you will 
need to obtain a brick of crude bronze and smelt it in a forge with a Water 
Flask and this Crude Bracer Mold. Once that is done, combine the Crude Bronze 
Bracer with a Ruined Kobold Pelt and a Kobold Ulna Bone in the Mail Assembly 
Kit.'</P><P>You say, 'I want to craft a templar of fright gauntlets'<BR>Sadorno 
Chomosh says 'To assemble Templar of Fright Gauntlets you will need to obtain 
two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this 
crude Gauntlet Mold. Once that is done combine the Crude Bronze Gauntlets with a 
Ruined Kobold Pelt and two Kobold Finger Bones in the Mail Assembly 
Kit.'</P><P>You say, 'I want to craft a templar of fright boots'<BR>Sadorno 
Chomosh says 'To assemble Templar of Fright Boots you will need to obtain two

Kit.'</P><P>You say, 'I want to craft templar of fright vambraces'<BR>Sadorno 
Chomosh says 'To assemble Templar of Fright Vambraces you will need to obtain 
two bricks of crude bronze and smelt them in a forge with a Water Flask and this
