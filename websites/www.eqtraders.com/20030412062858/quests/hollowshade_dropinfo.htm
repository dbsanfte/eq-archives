            Vah Shir Quests</font></strong><br>
            <em>information provided by Rosewynde Silverthorne (Innorruuk) </em> 
            <p>
            <p>With the exception of the last three drops you need, Guardian Talon, Guardian 
              Claw, and Chieftain Staff, the drops are easiest to find when a 
              race is in its main camp. Also you'll need to take into account 
              that Hollowshade is frequently farmed by higher levels for shrieking 
              substances, howling substances, acrylia, and drops off named mobs. 
              Because of this often one race has taken over ALL the caves. Unfortunately, 
              the zone is currently broken and if the Prince has not spawned when 
              all camps are overtaken by one race then the zone cannot be reset 
              without a GM zone reset or a server reset. It takes a full GM to 
              do the reset and sometimes they will not reset it for various reasons. 
              It takes time persistence and a willingness to spend a lot of time 
              in Hollowshade petitioning and watching for zone resets. Because 
              of all of this it's suggested you find out Exactly what items you 
              need from each race and be ready to loot them all even if you don't 
              need them immediately. It'll save you a lot of time in the long 
              run. </p>
            <p>As for getting a race to move from one camp to another, See Alakazam's 
              info on Hollowshade war and the additional user posts for how to 
              switch camps around. Basically though if you kill a named in one 
              of the camps you'll see a zone wide message about 10 to 15 minutes 
              latter stating one camp is attacking another. It's best if you don't 
              want them to succeed to kill off the spawned attackers (this takes 
              a tracker to catch them usually). Generally though if not killed 
              off the defenders will win and the camp will remain as is. If you 
              want the attackers to succeed then its best if you wait till they 
              have attacked the defenders and then help them kill the defenders 
              off. They will then enter the cave or chief&#8217;s hut and that 
              area will be switched to the attackers&#8217; race. </p>
            <p><strong>Owlbear Drops</strong> - Most frequently off the lower 
              level owlbears, cubs and grapplers, when they're in their main area 
              between their regular Owlbear Cave in the south and the Vah Shir 
              Outpost near Shar Vahl Zone. </p>
            <p><strong>Sonic Wolf Drops</strong> - Most frequently off the lower 
              level wolves, cubs and wolflings, when they're in their main area 
              where the river comes down from the zone wall and splits to run 
              out to the islands. This area is between the Grimling zone and the 
              Owlbear Caves. You'll get some drops out of the actual cave in the 
              east but not all of them and not as frequently as when you hunt 
              the river area. </p>
            <p><strong>Grimling Drops</strong> - Seem to only drop when they're 
              in their own island camp. Basically the casters, spiritists and 
              mystics, and the fisherman have all you need. </p>
            <p><strong>Ground Drops</strong> - Just take a bit of looking around 
              on the land for little brown bags or red and black stones. Once 
              you've found what you&#8217;re looking for mark the loc and come 
              back frequently. Also look for similar places you may find more 
              Ground Spawn of the same type there. </p>
            <p><strong>Turtle Drops</strong> - There's a really good island out 
              a bit from the Grimling Camps that has about 4 or 5 turtles spawn 
              on it. They're a pretty quick spawn and do not appear to assist 
              each other so just sit there and kill them off as quickly as you 
              can. </p>
            <p><strong>Garrison Cloak Drops</strong> - These are the exception 
              to the rule. They are all rare drops and appear to only drop when 
              the war is in progress (meaning one camp has attacked another but 
              not necessarily succeeded) and only when the race is in its own 
              camp. The Guardian Owlbear Talon drops off the upper level Owlbears, 
              Razorbeaks and Fleshrenders around their main cave (we found they 
              dropped outside and off the guards of the cave so never went inside). 
              The Sonic Wolf Guardian Claw drops off Sonic Wolf Guardians and 
              regular Sonic Wolfs in their main cave. The Grimling Chieftain Staff 
              drops off of Spiritists and the Chief at the main Chieftain&#8217;s 
              camp on the hills next to the islands. <br>
