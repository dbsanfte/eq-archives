      <span class="headers">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Vah Shir Quests</span>
<p>
<p>There are many details still missing from the guide for this race.  What we have so far is either here or waiting in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/forumdisplay.php?f=100">DoN Data Submissions Forum</a>.  Please look there if you do not find the detail you need.  But keep in mind, it simply may not have been reported yet.  If you have some details that aren't here or there, please post them and we'll get them updated!</p>

<p>This is the quest for vah shir to acquire the books necessary to make the cultural armor that is available with the Dragons of Norrath expansion.  For more information on the general details, see the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q182&menustr=120030000000">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Armor Quest Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You start in Shar Vahl, with Vuro Padfoot at -435, -40, in the building just inside the south city entrance (from Shadeweaver's Thicket).  The books do not need to be acquired in any particular order, as Vuro will give you all of them at once if you ask.</p>

<h4>Ancestral Book Quest:</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Vuro Padfoot'</p>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''Hello, Zunnoab. Returning from Norrath? It fills me with pride to see there are still Vah Shir willing to venture off this moon and restore our foothold on [Norrath] once again.''</p>
<p>You say, 'Norrath?'</p>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''From what I have heard, things were much different back when we lived on the planet. I have been studying the writings transcribed from before our kind was blasted from the face of Norrath. They are helping me piece together the [techniques] of our ancestors.''</p>
<p>You say, 'What techniques?'</p>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''From what I have learned, our craftsmanship has regressed over the years. Our relative lack of competition from other races has made us docile and lazy on this moon. In fact, I've uncovered some forgotten [armor patterns] and a few [cultural symbol patterns] that put our current designs to shame. Would you be interested in learning these ancient patterns? They will take time to craft, but, if you are patient, they will serve you well.''</p>
<p>You say, 'What armor patterns?'</p>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''Excellent. To make you a pattern book, I will need a piece of shadeling silk for the cover, a glowing heart stone for the ink, a cracked rhino beetle carapace for the clasp, and a damaged hopper hide to grind down and make a salve which will protect and preserve the finished product. I have heard these items can be found around Shadeweaver's Thicket and the Paludal Caverns. Bring them to me and the armor patterns of our ancestors will be yours''</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quest Summary: Collect and hand in Shadeling Silk, Glowing Heart Stone, Cracked Rhino Beetle Carapace, and Damaged Hopper Hide.</p>

<p><i>Tips:</i> Shadeling silk drops off the xakra silkworms or lesser shades in Shadeweaver's Thicket, and the xakra larva in Shar Vahl. The cracked rhino beetle carapace drops off the bigger beetles in Shadeweaver's. The damaged hopper hide drops from various hoppers in Shadeweaver's. The glowing heart stone drops off A Glowing Muck Digger in Paludal Caverns. This is the only NO DROP part of this quest. The various grime tunnelers are placeholders for this named. A good camp is at loc (-2822, -842).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''Excellent work, Zunnoab. Here is your pattern book. May you use this to restore the standing of our race across Norrath!''</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Receive: Ancestral Vah Shir Armor</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'What cultural symbol patterns?'</p>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''You're interested in the cultural symbol patterns I see. I can give you the cultural symbol patterns but I will need you to run a few tasks for me before I can give them to you. What do you say; would you like to run a few short [tasks] for me?''</p>
<p>You say, 'what tasks'</p>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''I have four tasks that need to be completed. The first is an adventure into [Paludal Caverns] where you will collect some items for a cap that I'm making. The next, you will be tasked with venturing into [Dawnshroud] where you hunt for some ingredients that I seem to be missing for my feast. The third task leads you into [The Grey] where you will gather some jewelry supplies for me. The final task will lead you on an adventure into [Stillmoon temple] where you will learn about the creatures that inhabit the area.''</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Journeyman's Book Task: Vuro's Cavern Adventure</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Paludal Caverns'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Vuro's Cavern Adventure'.</p>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''Paludal Caverns? Let me see what I have for Paludal Caverns. Ohh I do have a task for Paludal Caverns. I was in the process of making a cape but I have run out of a few key items. I know they can be found in Paludal. Venture into Paludal Caverns and explore the owl bear cave in the east side of the caverns.''</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Task Details</u> <br />
Paludal Caverns: Explore the owlbear cave in the east<br />

Shar Vahl: Deliver 1 Recondite Insignia Ring to Vuro Padfoot</p>

<p><i>Tips:</i>The cave that must explore is at -1940, -395.  Walking into it should satisfy the task and give you the next steps.  There are reportedly only seven owlbears in Paludal Caverns. Four are in the same cave at -1940, -395, another two are at 640, 0, and the last is a lone owlbear at 2090, 845. The recondite camp is near the zone to Shadowhaven.</p>

<p><i>Upon handing in the recondite insignia ring...</i></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''You did a fine job. I will be wearing my cape in no time. You have certainly earned these cultural symbol patterns.''</p>

<h4>Expert's Book Task: Vuro's Feast</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Dawnshroud'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Vuro's Feast'.</p>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''I never have the right cooking utensils when I'm cooking. It's so annoying to be in the middle of baking a feast and to not have exactly what you need. Explore the pond in the north west of Dawnshroud and see if you can find some utensils for me.''</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Task Details</u> <br />
Dawnshroud Peaks: Explore the pond in the north west<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks: Kill 50 wolves<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks: Loot 4 A Tattered Wolf Pelts<br />
Shar Vahl: Deliver 4 A Tattered Wolf Pelts <i>(unstacked)</i> to Vuro Padfoot<br />

Dawnshroud Peaks: Loot 1 A Stonegrabber Boulder<br />
Shar Vahl: Deliver 1 A Stonegrabber Boulder to Vuro Padfoot</p>

<p><i>Tips:</i> The pond to explore is in the northwest area of the zone.  Walking into it will satisfy the task.  The small camp site near Netherbian is at (1230, 580). There are three stonegrabber camps in the north east portion of the zone. They are easy to spot since they are marked by several rocks, with stonegrabbers lying on the ground motionless.</p>

<p><i>Upon handing in the stonegrabber boulder...</i></p>

<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''Just in time, the feast is about ready. That shell should be perfect for this perfect meal. You have earned those cultural symbol patterns.''</p>

<h4>Master's Book Task: Supplies for Vuro</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'The Grey'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Supplies for Vuro'.</p>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''I recently started to create jewelry. This piece here is the most requested piece in the city. My supplies are running low and I need you to travel to The Grey and gather some supplies for me. You can start by killing shimmering rockfiends and scraping the shiny granite chips from them.''</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Task Details</u> <br />
The Grey: Kill 40 shimmering rockfiends<br />
The Grey: Loot 4 Shiny Granite Chips<br />
Shar Vahl: Deliver 4 Shiny Granite Chips <i>(unstacked)</i> to Vuro Padfoot<br />
The Grey: Kill 5 sun revenants<br />
The Grey: Loot 1 Dark Skeleton Remains<br />
Shar Vahl: Deliver 1 Dark Skeleton Remains to Vuro Padfoot</p>

<p><i>Tips:</i> Shimmering rockfiends spawn from traps; they have many predetermined locations all around The Grey where they will spawn, stay up for a predetermined amount of time, then despawn (unless agroed). One good place is the northeast corner of the zone, as there is a pretty high concentration of spawn spots there.</p>

<p><i>Upon handing in the dark skeleton remains...</i></p>

<blockquote
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''Superb work. I will grind these bones into many usable charms for my jewelry. You have earned these cultural symbol patterns for your hard work.''</p>

<h4>Grandmaster's Book Task: Creatures of Stillmoon</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Stillmoon Temple'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Creatures of Stillmoon'.</p>
<p>Vuro Padfoot says ''You will adventure into the Stillmoon temple to learn about the different creatures that inhabit the area. Travel to Stillmoon temple and learn about the creatures of the temple. You will need to be careful while you are in the temple. The creatures that you seek can only be found in the most dangerous sections of the temple. You should travel to the Lavastorm Mountains and meet up with one of our operatives. There you will get further information on where you can enter the temple at.''</p>
