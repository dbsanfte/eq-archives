                on planar travel. It is good to see your determination has taken 
                its first step to true glory. I think you may finally be ready

                aspects to your battle readiness is your strong willpower and 
                bravery. Years ago I discovered a particular concoction that will 
                very readily put your willpower to the test. Unfortunately I ran 
                out not too long ago and I am in need of some more [Planar Blood 
                Brew]. If you can make some more for my students, it would certainly 
                look favorably upon you in your future teachings. Bring me some

              <p>Zauvudd Gigoth says 'To make the infamous Planar Blood Brew, 
                you must attain some Nightmare Mephit Blood, Slarghilug Blood, 
                Bubonian Blood, Soda Water, Grapes, a Cask, a Cork, and a Corking 
                Device. Mix them in a Brew Barrel, and if you are skilled enough, 
                the resulting swill should curl the hairs on even the hardiest 
                of traveler's heads!'</p>

            <p>Make some of this brew, and hand it in to him.</p>

                best Planar Blood Brew I have ever tasted! You have passed the 
                first test with flying colors. Here, you take this book and learn

                lesson, the task is simple. A vicious terror has awoken somewhere

                and bravery, you must collect for me a Sandstorm Gem, a Rage Filled

                It is good to see young adventurers interested in planar exploration, 
                but there is one aspect of discovery you must always be prepared 
                for, the struggle for survival. There are very dangerous places

                your newfound knowledge, your first lesson will be to create a 
                special [planar stein] of particular design. Once you have acquired

                Essence, a Water Flask, and some Sculpting Tools. Use these items 
                in a pottery wheel to create your base model to work from. Crush 
                some Valor Crystals together with some Glaze Lacquer in a glaze
