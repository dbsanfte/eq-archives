            <h3>Surefall Druid Youngling Armor Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several new youngling armor quests appearing 
              throughout the lands. This quest, which originates in Surefall Glade, 
              results in DRU only armor and a DRU only weapon. All pieces of this 
              set should be lore (other than the bracer) and no drop</i></p>
            <p>Salmekia is standing right next to Te'Anara (right in front of 
              you when you port in to Surefall). I am not a human druid, but she 
              still gave me the quest, though I doubt I'll be able to use the 
              rewards...</p>

              [Wed Jun 05 16:38:28 2002] Salmekia Treherth says 'Welcome to Surefall 
              Glade Tyrsa, the home of the Jaggedpine Treefolk. I help teach young 
              druids the ways of our people. We have worshipers of both Karana, 
              the Storm Lord, and Tunare, the All Mother, living here in the glade. 
              If you are a new druid I will help you obtain a [suit of clothing] 
              that will offer comfort and protection while working in the wilds 
              and help protect you from the weapons of the Gnolls that wish to 
              take these lands.'<br>

              of clothing requires different materials for its construction. Do

              [Wed Jun 05 16:40:14 2002] Salmekia Treherth says 'We druids seek 
              to live in harmony with nature, taking only what we need from the 
              land and the creatures that inhabit it. Although the City of Qeynos 
              is a noble place, there are people in the city that do not share 
              our reverence for nature and poach the animals of the Karanas needlessly. 
              Even worse than these poachers, whom the rangers of the Jaggedpine 
              Treefolk constantly seek to deter, are the despicable worshipers 
              of Bertoxxulous that hide in the sewers and catacombs of Qeynos. 
              These wicked individuals are known as the [Bloodsabers].'<br>
              [Wed Jun 05 16:40:27 2002] You say, 'what Bloodsabers?'<br>
              [Wed Jun 05 16:40:27 2002] Salmekia Treherth says 'The Bloodsabers 
              are responsible for a number of atrocities including the spreading 
              of the diseases which have been inflicting the wolves and bears 
              of the Qeynos Hills and the recent poisoning of the farmers fields 
              in the Plains of Karana. Recently we have discovered that a Bloodsaber 
              defiler has been attempting to poison the waters of Surefall Glade. 
              Find this individual and deal with him accordingly, I doubt that 
              this individual will surrender willingly. If need be eliminate them 
              and bring me their head.'</p>
            <p>The mob is called &quot;a Bloodsaber defiler&quot; and is behind 
              the waterfall in Surefall. Turning in her head gets you:</p>
            <p>[Wed Jun 05 16:43:39 2002] Salmekia Treherth says 'It is a shame 
              that some people decide to throw away their humanity with the worship 
              of evil deities. Your actions have saved the lives of many creatures 
              that rely on the waters of this glade. Take this Rusty Pine Druid 
              Scimitar and sharpen it in a forge with a sharpening stone. It may 
              take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. 
              Once that is done return to me with the Sharpened Pine Druid Scimitar, 
              a Gnoll Fang, and a Large King Snake Skin.'<br>

              Treefolk got better.<br>

              [Wed Jun 05 16:43:40 2002] Your faction standing with Unkempt Druids 
              got worse.<br>
