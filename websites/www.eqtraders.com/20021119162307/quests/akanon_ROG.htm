            <h3>Ak'Anon Rogue Armor Quest</h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests. The quest originates 
              with Welno Tanboots, in the Rogue guildhall of Ak'Anon. It should 
              result in armor that is lore (other than bracer) no drop, and is 
              GNM/ROG only. (Note: if you're a gnome rogue of Bertoxx, you need 
              the quest at <a href="akanon_evilrogue.htm">this link</a>, instead). 
              Graphic for the armor is purple chain. <i>Please note that while 
              the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make 
              your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i></p>
            <p>Ak'Anon Rogue Armor:</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Welno Tanboots' </p>
            <p>Welno Tanboots says 'Greetings there ______! I am Welno Tanboots 
              Assassin of Akanon. I pride myself on being one of the few to train 
              our younger prospects in the ways of the rogue. If you are a young 
              gnome rogue in training then I might have some [tasks] for you.' 
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'what tasks?' </p>
            <p>Welno Tanboots says 'Well I should hope you are truly a Rogue of 
              Akanon or else I don&#146;t have any work for ya! However if you 
              are then I have some things for you to do. I will present you with 
              a magical box that you will use to craft together certain components 
              that will make an armor material. You will then take the material 
              that you have fashioned with the proper pattern to the forge to 
              create your own armor. I will provide you with whatever patterns 
              are necessary along with the [armor recipes] should you so ask.' 
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'what armor recipes?' </p>
            <p>Welno Tanboots says 'I have the armor recipes for all pieces of 
              Chainmail of the Shadowwalker all you must do is simply ask for 
              whichever piece you [want to craft]. I can provide you with the 
              recipe for Shadowwalker [Coifs], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Boots], 
              [Leggings], [Gloves] and [Tunic]. Once you have collected the necessary 
              components for each recipe combine them in this box to fashion the 
              correct material.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'I want to craft a coif' </p>
            <p>Welno Tanboots says 'While you should usually be using the shadows 
              to your advantage should you need to face your opponent having a 
              good coif will greatly increase your chances of survival. To create 
              your coif material you will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 
              1 Rat Meat, 1 Grikbar Kobold Fur and 1 Throwing Knife in your assembly 
              kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a forge 
              along with this mold to fashion your very own Shadowwalkers Chainmail 
              Coif.'</p>
