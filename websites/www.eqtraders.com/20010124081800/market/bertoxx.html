    and I am a <b>Master Tailor</b>. I Sell <b>backpacks</b>, player made 10 slot 
    honest to goodness backpacks. I charge 100plat each for them. On orders of 
    10 or more I drop the price to 90plat each. I typically have about 60-70 bear 
    skins in stock, so no order is too large. I think from this point of view 
    I am different from most of the backpack makers out there. In addition, for 
    any of my backpacks customers I will also make the <b>shadow silk</b> for 
    free if they supply the ingredients. (I am not interested in making raw silk, 
    reinforced leather or cured silk armor.) Orders for backpacks should be made
