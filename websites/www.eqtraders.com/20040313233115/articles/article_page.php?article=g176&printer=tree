<span class="headers">Information Regarding Mana Vials</span>
<p>
<p>Various tradeskill items require "vials of ___ mana" (viscous, clear, purified, distilled, cloudy). Here's a brief rundown of what they are, where they can be found, and what material components are needed:</p><br>

<p>The appropriate mana spell must be cast by an enchanter who has the material components in their possession when they cast the spell. At casting, the material components are taken away are and replaced by the appropriate mana vial.</p><br> 

<p>The enchanter mana spells are sold in two spots: in the brownie village in Lesser Faydark and in High Keep off Krystalle Corsair (main floor, -93, -232, behind a door). While shopping with the brownies requires all sorts of faction/illusion contortions, Krystalle is much more forgiving.</p><br> 

<p>The mass mana vial spells (zapping 5 at once) are sold in the tunnel in East Commonlands. Mass distill and mass clarify are on Palik Agrolm and mass purify and mass thicken are on Tallik Jaggedfire. </p><br>

<p>Poison vials are sold by some poison vendor merchants or can be player-made via pottery. (Uses normal poison vials NOT lined or sealed).</p><br>

<p>The finished vials are stackable. </p><br>

<p>Note that the mana cost for each of these spells was cut in half due to the Dec. 12, 2002 patch.</p><br>
