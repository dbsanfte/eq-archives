<span class="headers">Crown of Deceit: Illusion Wood Elf Crown Quest</span>
<p>
<p>
This quest requires the Planes of Power expansion, as well as warmly or ally faction with the Frogloks of Guk. It also needs one tradeskill-made item to complete (a velium mastodon fur cloak, that is not trivial at 250 tailoring), as well as an enchanter-made mana vial.
</p>
<p>
Find Sage Ballic in Plane of Knowledge.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Sage Ballic'
</p>
<p>
Sage Ballic says, 'Greetings friend. Welcome to my place of private contemplation. I relax here and leaf through my old studies, admiring at creations from the past made by races we thought would never amount to anything. My favorite tomes to look at are those that deal with Frogloks.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What frogloks?'
</p>
<p>
Sage Ballic says 'A surprising race to study is the Frogloks of Antonica. While we may think their magic was weak, it was at one time so powerful the Gods reached down and smote them for their creations. Balls of energy that made life into magic! Their High Enchanter even made a mask that transformed the wearer into a Teir'Dal! Quite an interesting race worthy of some study if you ask me, someday I shall like to go and see these frogloks, especially to learn more knowledge of the magical mask.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What magical mask?'
</p>
<p>
Sage Ballic blinks and looks at you. 'I have told you all that I know, for more knowledge you will need to seek it's creator. The enchanter is more than likely very old, the mask having been made at the height of the power of the Froglok Race. Here take this picture book to aid you in your quest.' Sage Ballic hands you a book.
</p>
<p>
He gives you a Lore No Drop book, which you bring to the Old Frog in Upper Guk. You must have positive faction with the Frogloks of Guk in order to get him to respond, and using sneak to hand in the book does not work.
</p>
<p>The Old Frog is located in the hallway around the corner just past the priest room if you are traveling from the direction of the Squire spawn. He does have a placeholder (details not available) and his respawn time is unknown, but relatively short. Hand him the book.
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
an old froglok backflips and says, 'Frroooaaaaaakkkk! I'm in this book! You see me! Owww that flip hurt my old bones! Frroooaaaaaakkkk! Look there is a picture of my maaask from long ago! Frroooaaaaaakkkk! I keep book! You taaake this recipe! Maaaybe more! I'm in book! Frroooaaaaaakkkk!'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He gives you a recipe to make Elf Essence.

<p>
Further text is not available at this time, but he needs four items: reet froglok crown, elf essence, vial of purified mana, and a velium mastodon fur cloak.
</p>
<p>
The recipe for the elf essence is above. The reet froglok crown drops off reets in Sebilis. The vial of purified mana is an enchanter-cast spell that needs 4 rubies and a poison vial as material components.
