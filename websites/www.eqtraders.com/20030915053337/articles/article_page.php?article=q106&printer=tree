<span class="headers">Qeynos Bertoxx INT Caster (Scourge Sorceror) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Qeynos. Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, HUM, INT casters of Bertoxx only. It originates in the necromancer guild in Qeynos. While we do not have stats for the various pieces, it is reported that it has a dark red leather graphic when worn.</i> <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>

You say,'What Staff of the Bloodsabers?'
</p>
<p>
Bruax Grengar says'A Staff of the Bloodsabers is a useful implement for young sorcerers dedicated to Bertoxxulous the Plague Lord. I will assist you in the creation of a staff but first you must complete a task for me. The sorcerers of The Order of Three are supporters of Antonius Bayle IV, the haughty ruler of Qeynos. They lend magical aid to the Knights of Thunder and Priests of Life to identify and capture members of the Bloodsabers. A rather troublesome member of The Order of Three, Larkin Tolman, has recently been spotted at a settlement in the Western Plains of Karana. Find this Larkin Tolman and bring me his head.' 
</p>
<p>
Bring Larkin's head back to Bruax:
</p>
<p>
Bruax Grengar says'Well done ___. The Bloodsabers have many enemies within the city of Qeynos and its surrounding regions. You must exercise much caution when not within the safety of our temple here in the Qeynos Catacombs. Take this Rough Bloodsaber Staff and when you have gathered a Giant King Snake Skin, two Gnoll Fangs, and a Giant Fire Beetle Eye, return them to me with this staff and I will complete its construction. 
</p>
<p>

 Your faction standing with Guards of Qeynos got worse. <br />
 Your faction standing with Opal Dark Briar got better. <br />
 Your faction standing with Priests of Life got worse.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Return the listed items to him:
</p>
<p>
Bruax Grengar smooths the shaft of the staff, fashions a grip from the giant king snake skin, secures the giant fire beetle eye in a metal fixture and attaches it to the top of the staff.'Here is your Staff of the Bloodsabers young Scourge Sorcerer. Go now and spread the disease!'
