 Josylyn Greenblade says 'Although our city of Kelethin gains much protection from its construction in the treetops of the Faydark, like all things it has weaknesses in its defenses. The Crushbone Orcs often attempt to ignite the trees with the fires of their torches. Young Emerald Warriors are often stationed on the forest floor beneath Kelethin to watch for these orc arsonists and stop them. Go now to the forest floor and should you catch one of these orcs slay him and bring me his orcish torch.'
