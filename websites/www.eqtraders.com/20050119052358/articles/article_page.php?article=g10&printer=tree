<p><b><i>Bags:</i></b> Click the name of the vendor or crafted items to be taken to the purchasing information or recipe.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1141&menustr=">Medicine Bag</a></b> - <i>Vendor bought</i>, this fundamental alchemy tool is the container in which you combine your ingredients.  Every single alchemy recipe uses a medicine bag. They are available from most alchemy vendors, especially those carrying a large selection of herbs.</li>

<li><b><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8268&menustr=">Folded Medicine Bag</a></b> - This is a <i>tailored</i> alternative to the Medicine Bag.  They are more expensive and more difficult to acquire but much easier to store between uses.  The item itself is not a container and can therefore be stored in any bags that can hold small items.  In order to get the usable container, you put the Folded Medicine Bag in one of your general inventory slots and right click it.  This will summon a Folding Medicine Bag, a No Drop container that is functionally identical to the vendor-sold Medicine Bag.  It is not No Rent.  Your Folded Medicine Bag remains in your possession after you have summoned the Folding Medicine Bag.  Therefore, when you are done with the summoned Folding Medicine Bag, you can delete it.  Just be careful to delete the summoned Folding bag rather than the Folded bag.</li>

<li><b><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1824&menustr=">Bearskin Potion Bag</a></b> - This <i>tailored</i> bag is the basic tool for creating potions that have 5 or 10 charges.  To use, combine either 5 or 10 single charges of the same potion into the bag.  This process will never fail but will never give you any further skill.  Because it never fails, anyone can use this bag, even those who are not practicing alchemists or even shamans.  The Bearskin Potion Bag is a container capable of holding tiny or small items.</li>

<li><b><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8270&menustr=">Folded Bearskin Potion Bag</a></b> - A <i>tailored</i> alternative to the Bearskin Potion bag, this item works much like the Folded Medicine Bag.  They are a little more expensive and harder to make but much easier to store between uses.  The item itself is not a container and can therefore be stored in any bags that can hold small items.  In order to get the usable container, you put the Folded Bearskin Potion Bag in one of your general inventory slots and right click it.  This will summon a Folding Bearskin Potion Bag, a No Drop container that is functionally identical to the regular Bearskin Potion Bag.  It is not No Rent.  Your Folded Bearskin Potion Bag remains in your possession after you have summoned the Folding Bearskin Potion Bag.  Therefore, when you are done with the summoned Folding Bearskin Potion Bag, you can delete it.  Just be careful to delete the summoned Folding bag rather than the Folded bag.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p><b><i>Skill Modifiers:</i></b>  Click the name of the crafted items to be taken to the recipe.  Note that these items do NOT stack with one another.  When you equip more than one alchemy modifying item at a time, only the highest percentage item will affect your alchemy skill.  Also note that equipping any one of these items only affects your changes of success.  For the purposes of trivials, your actual skill is still what determines whether or not you can skill up off of that item and whether or not you receive a trivial message upon success.  For example, if your alchemy skill is 100 and you have this item equipped, you will have the same chance of success as someone with a skill of 105.  However, you will still be able to improve your skill by practicing with recipes that trivial from 101-105.  Whether or not you receive a trivial message will also be determined by the trivial of the potion compared to your actual skill, and ignores the effect of the skill modifying item.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8272&menustr=">Geerlok Alchemy Set</a></b> - This item is created by gnomes via <i>tinkering</i>. When equipped it grants a 5% bonus to your alchemy skill. </li>

<li><b>Philosopher's Stone</b> - This <i>dropped</i> item adds 10% to your alchemy skill and comes from the Alchemist Varona, a random spawn in any of many places in Grieg's End.  She is reportedly weak on offense but has a hefty defense.  The stone does not drop every time but is fairly common.  See <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7596">Illia's Bestiary</a> for more details.</li>

<li><b>Umbracite Swarm Orb</b> - This <i>dropped</i> item is from Vex Thal and adds a whopping 15% to your alchemy skill, as well as <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12413">a whole slew of other stats</a>. It is No Drop, so consider it a distant dream until your guild is strong enough to get the necessary keys and hunt there.</li>

<li><b><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7484&menustr=">Grandmaster's Medicine Bag</a></b> - This item works much like the Geerlok Alchemy Set but has some additional benefits.  It is created via <i>alchemy</i> with some components that require <i>pottery</i> and <i>jewelcraft</i>.  You receive the same 5% bonus as from the Geerlok Alchemy Set but can equip this item in your primary, secondary, or range slots.  It will also go in your ammo slot but will not give you the 5% bonus or the additional stats.  Those additional stats are STR +10, WIS +15, and CHA + 50.  Furthermore, you can right click this item to summon Grandmaster's Satchels: 10-slot, 100% weight reducing bags that are No Drop and No Rent, but not Lore.  As if that were not enough, you can give one of these Grandmaster's Satchels to the gnome Jolum in the Bazaar and receive a Grandmaster's Carry-All, a Lore bag that is identical to the Grandmaster's Satchels except that it is not No Rent.</li>
