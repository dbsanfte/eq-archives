            <h3>Qeynos Evil Rogue Youngling Armor Quest</h3>
            <p><i>This is one of several new armor quests for young humans that 
              originates in Qeynos. All pieces of this set should be lore (other 
              than the bracer) no drop, and HUM, HEF/ROG only. This quest originates 
              in the Qeynos rogue's guild, underneath Crow's Bar. Please note 
              that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often 
              are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second 
              one</i></p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Reldin Harkolis'<br>
              Reldin Harkolis says 'Hail Wendolyn. Know that only within these 
              few passageways and rooms whose borders are marked by the symbol 
              of the Circle of Unseen Hands can we speak freely of our organization 
              and its undertakings. Neither the streets of the city above nor 
              the sewers and catacombs are free of ears that would harm the Circle 
              of Unseen Hands should they hear of our [secrets].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'What secrets'<br>
              Reldin Harkolis says 'The Circle has many secrets some of which 
              only Hans may know. Our agents are all about, mingling among the 
              common law abiding folk and working in all manner of profession. 
              At one time we had a significant number of the Qeynos Guard allied 
              to our organization but the loyal soldiers of Antonius Bayle IV 
              has discovered and punished many of them. The ones that remain are 
              hesitant at best to continue their association with us. You will 
              need to exercise much caution within this city as you learn the 
              ropes. I will help get you outfitted in some [gear] that you will 
              find useful in our line of work.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what gear'<br>
              Reldin Harkolis says 'Take this Curing Kit. With it you can assemble 
              an outfit of light, flexible, and sturdy yet inconspicuous leather 
              clothing to protect you from the perils of your job. The materials 
              required will depend on the piece of clothing you desire to craft. 
              Do you plan on crafting Sturdy Workmans [Gloves], Sturdy Workmans 
              [Boots], a Sturdy Workmans [Bracer], a Sturdy Workmans [Cap], Sturdy 
              Workmans [Leggings], Sturdy Workmans [Sleeves], or a Sturdy Workmans 
              [Tunic]? Once you are suitably outfitted return to me and I will 
              inform you of your [next job].'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what gloves'<br>
              Reldin Harkolis says 'To craft Sturdy Workmans Gloves you require 
              two [silk thread], a ruined wolf pelt, two giant field rat whiskers, 
              and a large king snake skin. Once you have the necessary components

              furs, and a giant king snake skin. Once you have the necessary components 
              combine them in your Curing Kit with this Tattered Pant Pattern.'</p>

              fur, and a giant king snake skin. Once you have the necessary components 
              combine them in your Curing Kit with this Tattered Tunic Pattern.'</p>
            <p>You say, 'what next job'<br>
              Reldin Harkolis says 'A message between two of our agents was recently 
              intercepted by a Qeynos Guardsman. The message is encoded in thieves 
              cant but should the guards eventually decode it we would expect 
              trouble. Guard Gregor, the guard who currently is in possession 
              of the message is out patrolling somewhere in the West Karanas. 
              Find this guard and recover the message. Bring it back to me when 
              you have done so.'</p>
            <p>Go kill guard Gregor in West Karana. He is located over by Misty 
              Storyswapper. He drops the message and I think the faction that 
              goes down when you kill him is just Qeynos Citizens gets worse. 
              Take the message back to Reldin to get an rusty unseen hands dagger, 
              lore. Sharpen this dagger in a forge with a sharpening stone and 
              give Reldin the sharpened dagger, a gnoll fang, and a large kind 
              snake skin to recieve the Dagger of Unseen Hands. Magic, lore. no 
              drop. damage 3 delay 21 primary secondary 1 str 2 dex. human half-elf 
              rogue usable. </p>
