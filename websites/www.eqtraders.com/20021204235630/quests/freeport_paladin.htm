            <h3> Truthbringers Armor - Freeport Paladin Quests<br>
            </h3>
            <p>This is one of many new youngling armor quests based out of Freeport. 
              Armor pieces are lore (other than bracer), no drop, and restricted 
              to HUM/PAL only. While stats and exact names of these armor pieces 
              were not provided, the armor has a blue plate graphic when worn. 
              <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials 
              often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for 
              a second one</i> 
            <p> 
            <p>This is a list of the recipes for the new low level armor quests 
              gained from Edwardian in North Freeport ontop of the Paladin guild. 
              The items needed are found in Northern Ro, East Commons and West 
              Commons. If you talk to Edwardian he will give you a 'chest' which 
              you use to combine the parts in. This will produce a Metal Sheet 
              which you combine with the mold in a forge. Edward gives you a mold 
              for each peice of armor you ask him about. The smithing combines 
              are no-fail, but can grant minor skill increases.</p>
            <p>You say, 'Hail, Edwardian Holyblade' </p>
            <p>Edwardian Holyblade says 'Greetings and well met Dukane. I am Edwardian 
              Holyblade, noble paladin of Marr. I have devoted my life and my 
              blade to the glory of Mithaniel Marr. I am also in charge of training 
              all new paladins of Marr to make sure that they have the best training 
              necessary. If you are a paladin of Marr I may have some [training] 
              for you.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what training' </p>
            <p>Edwardian Holyblade says 'I have developed a training program for 
              all young and upcoming Paladins of Marr. My tests will enable you 
              to learn some basic hunting, navigating and armor crafting skills. 
              All of these abilities will be very important on your path to enlightenment. 
              If you are [ready to begin my tests] I will explain to you how the 
              tests will work.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'i am ready to begin your tests' </p>
            <p>Edwardian Holyblade says 'Very well Krohfak, I look forward to 
              seeing you progress through your training. Here is your special 
              mail assembly kit. In this kit you will combine a number of components 
              that you will collect from all areas of Freeport, North Ro and the 
              Commonlands. The components that you will gather and combine in 
              this kit will magical create a specific armor material piece. Each 
              of these materials will be combined in a forge with the appropriate 
              mold that I will provide you with. I will explain to you how the 
              [recipes] work when you are ready.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'what recipes' </p>
            <p>Edwardian Holyblade says 'Once you have crafted your material from 
              the specific recipes I give you you will need the appropriate mold 
              as I mentioned before. I can present you with the recipe and mold 
              for Truthbringers [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], 
              [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. When you are ready to being collecting 
              the components for a material recipe simply tell me what piece you 
              [want] to craft.' </p>
            <p>You say, 'i want to craft a helm </p>
            <p>Edwardian Holyblade says 'I would strongly suggest a good helm 
              as you can see by my patch over my eye I was not so careful in my 
              younger days. To create your helm material you will need to combine 
              2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Young Kodiak Paw, 1 Ruined Cat Pelt 
              and 1 Hops in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper 
              material take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your 
              very own Truthbringers Helm.' </p>

              the proper wrist protection and the result was never good. To create 
              your bracer material you will need to combine 1 Brick of Crude Iron

              arms safe from any attacks you may face while in training. It is 
              a common tactic to go for ones arms because with them disabled it 
              becomes impossible to defend yourself. To create your armguards
