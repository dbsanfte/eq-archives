            </h3>
            <p>Weapons with the Seru Bane attribute are needed to be able to damage 
              Lord Inquisitor Seru through normal melee. Procs on non bane weapons 
              will land on him, but to keep up a continuous run of &#8216;normal&#8217; 
              melee damage, you need a Seru weapon with Bane DMG: Seru +# to be 
              able to hit him. </p>
            <p>Lord Inquisitor Seru is located in Sanctus Seru, and all of the 
              items needed to make Seru Bane weapons are located in various zones 
              of the SoL expansion. You will be traveling around and camping various 
              things to make these weapons, so do not expect it to be as simple 
              as making things such as normal forged weapons. </p>
            <p><strong>The original text for making the Seru Bane weapons: </strong></p>
            <p>Book 1: <br>
              Day 1 <br>
              --------- <br>
              Today is a great day, so I shall begin this journal. The High Inquisitor 
              has called for my skilled hand to create for him a set of armor, 
              which cannot be pierced by any weapon. This is to be my last chance 
              to be in good grace with Lord Seru, though I have denounced Katta 
              I assume they can still sense that I miss my family. Regardless, 
              I shall begin working with the materials that were supplied to me 
              in the morning. </p>
            <p>Day 2 <br>
              --------- <br>
              Creation is going steady; the ore is melting to my expectations. 
              This metal, which I have named Yttrium, should not be able to be 
              pierced. I have sent for items to help tint the armor as Lord Seru 
              requests. </p>
            <p>Day 10 <br>
              ----------- <br>
              With the greaves complete I begin working on the Breastplate soon. 
              I have discovered how to make perfect Yttrium Sheets so production 
              should go faster. Mixing two bricks of Yttruim ore, with one Vial 
              of Quicksilver Temper creates the perfect sheet. The Quicksilver 
              Temper is a harder mixture though, I must request ingredients be 
              brought to me often, they seem to be hard to come by. For the perfect 
              hue I have been brewing one part Fungoid Sap, one part Meteor Dust, 
              one part Shissar Blood, and one part Shiknar Ichor. I do not know 
              where the Consillium of the Hand is acquiring these ingredients, 
              nor do I care, as long as I can present Lord Seru with a fine set 
              of armor. </p>
            <p>Day 18 <br>
              ---------- <br>
              I have finished Lord Seru's Breastplate and just returned from presenting 
              the Praesertum with it. They shall take it to him soon, so I should 
              get word in a week. I shall wait to see if this is enough to please 
              Lord Seru. I shall begin work on weapons that can match the armor, 
              in the case that it doesn't. </p>
            <p><br>
              Book 2: <br>
              Day 22 <br>
              ---------- <br>
              Success! I have created an entire arsenal that should be able to 
              strike through his armor. I had the most success using the following: 
              A Pommel Mold, Hilt Mold, one Vial of Quicksilver Temper, one Yttrium 
              Steel Sheet, and either a Dagger, Short, Curved, or Long Blade mold 
              created a fine blade. An Oak Shaft, one Vial of Quicksilver Temper, 
              one Yttrium Steel Sheet, and either a Mace, Hammer, or Axe Head 
              Mold created heavier, powerful weapons. For a powerful set of gloves, 
              I used two High Quality Rockhopper Pelts, one Vial of Quicksilver 
              Temper, and one Yttrium Steel Sheet. A bow made with an Oak Bow 
              Staff, a Silk String, a Planing Tool, one Yttrium Sheet Metal, and 
              one Vial of Quicksilver Temper imbues any arrow shot from it with 
              the same properties. Should I be banished, I will create these weapons 
              for Recuso to destroy Seru. </p>
            <p>Day 25 <br>
              ----------- <br>
              The inevitable has happened. My time for the question has arisen, 
              even though too soon. I failed because of my longing for my family 
              Katta. I know their ways are wrong but I of course still love them. 
              I write into this log from a land of destitution, I have been named 
              a Recuso. </p>
            <p>Day 49 <br>
              ---------- <br>
              A few days ago in search of shelter from the rain I stumbled inside 
              this place. What is this place... my nightmares become reality. 
              I feel as though I am being watched with every step. I can not remember 
              the way out, I can not remember... anything. </p>
            <p>Quicksilver Temper is brewed and trivial below 180. The Yttrium 
              Steel Sheet has a high trivial somewhere above 250. Both of these 
              items are droppable. The final combines' trivial levels are in the 
              mid to upper 100s. The final weapons are no drop, so you have to 
              produce them yourself. </p>
            <p><strong>Combines in brief: </strong><br>
              A VIAL OF QUICKSILVER TEMPER: shissar blood + shiknar ichor + fungoid 
              sap + meteor dust <br>
              YTTRIUM SHEET METAL: 2 small blocks of yttrium ore + quicksilver 
              temper </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Shissar blood can be found on the snake-type shissar mobs in 
                Luclin, mainly in Ssra. temple, and also available in the grey. 
              </li>
              <li> Fungoid sap is only dropped off An Ancient Shrieker, which 
                resides in the Deep. There are a couple of camps of them on the 
                far side of the invisible bridge. They are not KoS and do not 
                assist each other. Drop rate is said to be uncommon-rare. </li>
              <li> Meteor dust is found mainly in the Grey, from Shattered golems, 
                shissar style mobs, and rarely from the skeleton version of the 
                sun revenants. </li>
              <li> Shiknar ichor is found on the Shik'nar bug type mobs in Fungus 
                grove. Any form of Shik'nar insect can drop it.
            </ul>
