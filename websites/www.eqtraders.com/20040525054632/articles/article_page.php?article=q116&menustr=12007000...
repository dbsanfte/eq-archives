<p>
<p>
One of many new quests for younglings, this one is for Freeport Monks. Armor made will be lore (other than bracer), no drop, HUM/MNK only. Graphic is plain leather when worn. <i>Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one.</i> Tailoring combine is no-fail and trivial <=26

You say, 'Hail, Klom Jysun'
</p>
<p>
Klom Jysun says 'Pleasure to meet you Fistsaflyin. I am Klom Jysun, Grandmaster of the Ashen Order. I have lived in the great city of Freeport for quite sometime now and have watched the city evolve and change. Nowadays though I am in charge of training new members of the Ashen Fist. If you are a young monk and are in need of some armor I might have some work for you. Are you a [monk]?'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I am a monk'
</p>
<p>
Klom Jysun says 'I am always pleased when a new disciple visits our sacred halls. If you are [interested] in crafting your own armor I have a number of gathering tasks for you to do that will test both your navigational and fighting skills.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I am interested'
</p>
<p>
Klom Jysun says 'I am very pleased to here about your interest in proving your worth to the Ashen Order. First let me present you with this Fistfighters Loom. Inside of it you will combine [various components] to form armor materials. Once you have a material for a certain piece of armor you will combine it in a Loom along with the appropriate pattern. When you inform me what piece of armor you [want] to craft, I will be able to present you with the component recipe and pattern needed for crafting it.'
</p>
<p>
The loom you get is a 10 slot combine box called Fistfighters Loom.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what various components'
</p>
<p>
Klom Jysun says 'The items you will need to collect are all over the Freeport area, some in stores some off vicious monsters. If you are up for the challenge though I will be able to provide you with the armor recipes and patterns for Stonehand [Caps], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Sandals], [Trousers], [Gloves] and [Robes]. All you will need to do is tell me what piece of armor you [want] to craft, and I will be able to present you with the component recipe and pattern needed for crafting it.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a cap'
</p>
<p>
Klom Jysun says 'A cap will almost certainly be your most important piece of armor you will craft. To create your cap material you will need to combine 2 Matted Lion Pelts, 1 Malachite, 1 Snake Scale and a Cloth Cap in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a Loom along with this mold to fashion your very own Cap of the Stonehand.'

To create your bracer material you will need to combine 1 Matted Lion Pelt, 2 Rat Ears, 1 Coyote Pelt and a Cloth Wristband in your assembly kit.

<p>
You say, 'I want to craft sleeves'
</p>
<p>
Klom Jysun says 'A monks body is a representation of all that he or she has worked so hard for. It would be a shame to see your body, especially your arms riddled with bruises. To create your sleeve material you will need to combine 2 Matted Lion Pelts, 2 Lion Tails, and Cloth Sleeves in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a Loom along with this mold to fashion your very own Sleeves of the Stonehand.'

<p>
You say, 'I want to craft sandals'
</p>

To create your sandals material you will need to combine 3 Matted Lion Pelts, 1 Giant Spider Egg Sack, 2 Severed Orc Feet, 1 Bone Chip and Cloth Sandals in your assembly kit.

</p>
<p>
Klom Jysun says 'Trousers are a definite must for any Initiate of the Ashen Fist. You will learn to generate some attacks using your legs later in your training that is why it is necessary that you keep them in as best shape as possible. To create your trouser material you will need to combine 4 Matted Lion Pelts, 1 Cutthroat Insignia Ring, 1 Spider Venom Sac and 1 Cracked Giant Scarab Carapace in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a Loom along with this mold to fashion your very own Trousers of the Stonehand.'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Trousers: 5 AC +4 STA +2 AGI wt 0.8
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft gloves'
</p>
<p>
Klom Jysun says 'The gloves will assist you in hitting anything that might have some kind of magical barrier surrounding it preventing you from damaging it with your bare hands. To create your glove material you will need to combine 3 Matted Lion Pelts, 1 Giant Scarab Eye, 1 Rat Whisker, 1 Ale and 1 Armadillo Carapace in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a Loom along with this mold to fashion your very own Gloves of the Stonehand.'
</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'I want to craft a robe'
</p>
<p>
Klom Jysun says 'Your robe is essential to your armor set and I am very pleased to hear that you are ready to craft it. To create your robe material you will need to combine 5 Matted Lion Pelts, 1 High Quality Cat Pelt, 1 Lion Mane, 1 Leaf Scarab Carapace, 1 Giant Scarab Brain and 1 Cloth Shirt in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material take it to a Loom along with this mold to fashion your very own Robe of the Stonehand. Please come back to see me after you have completed your robe, I have a [favor] to ask of you.'
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Robe: AC 6 STA 5 AGI 2 wt 0.9
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'what favor?'
</p>
<p>
Klom Jysun says 'I had a student not too long ago that trained with me for quite sometime. He showed a lot of promise on his way to becoming a Grandmaster, however one day he came to tell me that he intended on joining the militia. I told him that I did not feel that was what he wanted to do but he insisted. On the day that he left he stole a headband from me that I was presented with by the Hall of Truth. This headband meant a lot to me, if you were able to find Firansad I am sure he will have it. Return it to me with 2 Orc Toes and I will surely reward you for your trouble.'
