<span class="headers">Qeynos Badge of Nobility Quest</span>
<p>
<p>
This is a continuation of the progressive Qeynos Badge of Honor quest. While the first four steps in this quest do not require tradeskills, this fifth step requires baking. You need at least amiable faction to Jaggedpine to get the full quest. You also need to have done the first four steps in the quest. (Details regarding the first four quests can be found on Allakhazam's: <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1271">Badge One</a>, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1273">Badge Two</a>, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1279">Badge Three</a>, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1288">Badge Four</a>)
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Sergeant Caelin'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Sergeant Caelin says 'Hail, ______. You have nothing to fear from the gnolls. My men and I have been sent from Qeynos to help defend Fort Jaggedpine should those worthless curs make the mistake of assuming this will be a place of easy plunder. I've fought and slain scores of gnolls in my time. Were I not bound to my post here I would go forth and drive them from their dark cave to the north myself. However, I can offer you a [bounty], should you choose to take such a mission upon yourself.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You say, 'what bounty'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Sergeant Caelin says 'If you choose to go and fight against the gnolls, I shall offer a bounty for every gnoll canine that you return to me. You look a bit more adventurous then many of those that live in this settlement. They seem a bit [docile].'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You say, 'who is docile'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Sergeant Caelin says 'Perhaps it comes from living in harmony with nature for an extended period of time but they are more concerned with trading food recipes and doing arts and crafts. I have offered to give them some basic training in the arts of war but they seem to have no interest. This is a dangerous world in which we live and failure to acknowledge that has meant the downfall of many a society. I won't let this happen on my watch, provided my [men] are on their toes.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'What men'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Sergeant Caelin says 'Guard Bossamir is a model soldier and a good man. I'm happy to have him watching my back. That Finewine character however, he is not worth the cost of the sword he wields! All he does is whine and complain. He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and his family enrolled him in the guard to teach him some discipline but I've had no luck with him. He hasn't even turned in a [shift report] for weeks. Captain Tillin will bust me down to private if I don't deliver those soon.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unless you are amiable to Sergeant Caelin, you will not be able to progress further, as he will state: "You have not proved yourself worthy to our cause. It is recommended that you kill gnolls and turn in gnoll fangs to increase your faction.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what shift report'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Sergeant Caelin says 'You have been helpful in our defense efforts. However, I can not be too careful about whom I trust with carrying this information. If you truly consider yourself an ally to Qeynos then no doubt you have assisted the city in its defense before. Show me your Qeynos Badge of Honor and I'll know I can trust you 
fully. I'll place my mark upon it should anyone question your authority to do this service for me.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hand him your Qeynos badge of Honor and you will receive "Marked Qeynos Badge of Honor" in return along with "A warning note/report" to give to Guard Finewine. <em>(Hail text not available at this time.)</em>
</p>
<p>
Guard Finewine is nearby, standing at the back entrance to the next house.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Guard Finewine'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Guard Finewine says 'Yeah. Hi. Lovely place this. Humid, dark, wild animals all over the place, man eating plants, snakes and bugs finding their way into my armor and biting me where a man ought not be bit. And if [Bossamir] is right, we're soon to be cut down by ravaging gnolls. Why-oh-why did I get assigned to this job? Why wasn't I assigned to Qeynos where a man can get a decent meal and sleep in a nice bed at night? Oh I'm sorry. Did I say that out loud?'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'What Bossamir'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Guard Finewine says 'Hmm. . . Yeah, I have this tendency to prattle on when I'm completely miserable. According to what my colleague Bossamir has heard, these gnolls may be tougher then we thought. But that would be par for the course anyway with the way my pitiful life is going. Woe is me. The people in this backward settlement hate me, Sergeant Caelin hates me and I assume Kane hates me too because he sent me to the armpit of Antonica on a suicide mission.' 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Give him the Warning letter.
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Guard Finewine says 'So he wants to send me to jail simply because I'm not filling out some silly reports? How can I be expected to think in such a decrepit state? Maybe you could help me. If I had a meal worthy of someone of my breeding then maybe I could think. Bring me something elegant, I don't want anything dull and pedestrian. I don't know what I want though. Do you have any suggestions?'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Feed him either Dryad Pate or Potemied Pate. Dryad pate is made by combining dryad parts, plant shoots (foraged in Jaggedpine), spices and brandy in a spit or oven. Baking trivial is 191. (Replace the dryad parts with potemied parts to make the potemied pate.)
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Guard Finewine says 'Hmm. . . This is interesting. . . The taste is very refined but sort of. . . odd. . . We're almost there but I don't think you have the recipe quite right. Rather then that peasant Brandy, use this in your recipe instead. And rather then whatever other 'meat' you were using before use a Panther Liver. You do seem to have some skill as a chef, mayhaps you could work for me some day. Prepare some Panther Pate for me. Give me the Panther Pate and let me read that warning again.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He then gives you back the Warning letter (No Drop, Lore) and Finewine Family Brandy (No Drop Lore)
</p>
<p>
Now you must make him panther pate. We suspect that this is a no-fail combine, but it has not yet been confirmed. We do know, however, that it is definitely trivial below 114. You must take a no drop panther liver (dropped only off the Jaggedpine "a black panther"), the finewine family brandy, plant shoots (foraged in Jaggedpine), and spices. Combine in a spit or oven.
</p>
<p>
Hand him back the warning letter, as well as the panther pate.
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Guard Finewine says 'Ah yes, this is perfect! I feel my head clearing already. Wait, is that the sun poking through the trees there or the moon? Hard to tell in this hideous jungle. . . Oh wait yes. My shift reports for the last few weeks. Why don't you go ahead and turn these into Sergeant Caelin for me. I'm going to enjoy this fine pate.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He will hand you Compiled Shift Reports (No Drop, Lore), which you then give to Sergeant Caelin.
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Sergeant Caelin says 'Oh praise Karana, how did you manage to get these out of him? Never mind, I don't really care. Here, take this Compiled Report to Captain Tillin in Qeynos at once.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He will hand you a book of reports. Run to South Qeynos and give Captain Tillin the Book. The captain will give you some Captain's Orders <em>(hail text not available)</em>. Return to Sergeant Caelin and give him Captain's Orders <em>(hail text not available)</em>. You will receive a "Writ of Execution" and "a Black Sachel" both No drop, Lore.
</p>
<p>
Now you need to Kill Barduck Darkpaw(*) in the JaggedPine Gnoll caves just north east of the Town. He has 15k-ish HP and can be slowed. He hits hard and fast so DO slow him if able. Loot his head and combine with the Writ to make a Sealed Black Satchel.
</p>
<p>
Give "a Sealed Black Satchel" to Sergeant Caelin along with your Marked Qeynos Badge of Honor.
</p>
<p>
Receive "Qeynos Badge of Nobility"
</p>
<p>
(*) <strong>Note</strong>: Killing Barduck Darkpaw starts the Gnoll War. The Gnoll War is where a series of gnolls start to invade the town through 3 waves of ten to eighteen level 42-45 MoB's. Partaking in the Gnoll war does not effect you getting the badge whatsoever, but you might have to wait until the Sergeant respawns to turn everything in if you lose the war. Turn in the combined box before hand to avoid this problem.
