<span class="headers">Qeynos Bertoxx Shadowknight (Scourge Knight) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several new armor quests for young humans that originates in Qeynos. All pieces of this set should be lore (other than the bracer), no drop, HUM/SHD only. Due to the location and the faction of the NPC down in the sewers, it's not recommended that you attempt this if you are not a worshipper of Bertoxxulous. Armor has a red plate graphic when worn. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
You say,'Hail, Unmuz Tukore'
</p>
<p>

<p>
Unmuz Tukore says'We Scourge Knights of the Bloodsabers, often refered to as shadowknights by those less knowledgeable of our sect, are gifted by Bertoxxulous with prowess in combat and powers over the spirits and bodies of the dead. It is through discipline, training, and devotion to the Plague Lord that we are granted our powers. You must first equip yourself with a [suit of armor] to defend you in battle from the weapons of our [enemies].'
</p>
<p>
You say,'What suit of armor?'
</p>
<p>
Unmuz Tukore says'Take this note to Wellis Pestule. He will assist you in obtaining your armor. Once you have been properly outfitted return to me. I will allow you to assist me with a [pressing matter].'

<p>
Wellis Pestule says'Welcome to the Bloodsabers young Scourge Knight. I will help prepare you for your spreading of the disease.

</p>
<p>
Unmuz Tukore says'The Knights of Thunder, the order of paladins loyal to Karana, the Storm Lord, have been paying close attention for signs of us Bloodsabers in the streets of Qeynos. By orders of Antonius Bayle knwn disciples of the Plague Lord are to be executed by the Knights of Thunder. A particular knight, Grennet Stormhands, has recently discovered the loyalties of a Bloodsaber member that held a valuable position among the merchants of Qeynos. Grennet is to be hunted and slain for our loss. Find this Knight of Thunder and bring me his head.' 
</p>
<p>
Grennet Stormhand spawns next to the outer wall between the entrance to Qeynos and the secret wall that has the well leading to the Qeynos Aqueducts. He is level 15, and is known to double attack and cast lay on hands once during the battle.
</p>
<p>
Hand in his head for the following response:
</p>
<p>
Unmuz Tukore says'Excellent, the Knights of Thunder must learn that by beginning an inquisition of the Bloodsabers they are effectively declaring war. Take this Rusty Scourge Knight Saber to a forge and sharpen it with a sharpening stone. It may take you several attempts if you are unfamiliar with the process. Once that is done take the Tarnished Scourge Knight Saber and a Giant King Snake Skin to Wellis Pestule and he will put the finsihing touches on the weapon.' 
</p>
<p>
Sharpen the saber as per the above instructions. Chase down the rare spawn giant king snakes in Qeynos Hills and get a skin. Bring the sking and the sharpened saber to Wellis Pustule to receive:
