<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several new tradeskill quests for younglings. Armor pieces are DEF/WAR only and are lore (other than the bracer) and no drop. Stats for the various pieces are not yet available, but the resulting armor is silver in color. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Jarrex N`Ryt' 
</p>
<p>
Jarrex N`Ryt says 'What have we here? A new weakling that wishes to reap some sort of self-value and renown through service to the Indigo Brotherhood perhaps? Well speak up whelp!! Have you come to [destroy the enemies of Neriak] or are you a coward better suited to mop the filth from the back rooms of the Maidens Fancy.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I have come to destroy the enemies of Neriak' 
</p>
<p>
Jarrex N`Ryt says 'If you are going to be of any value to the Indigo Brotherhood you will need to outfit yourself in a suit of armor that will turn aside the blades of enemy forces. From the looks of you even the tiny fangs of a moss snake could bring you death. Take this request form to Issva H'Rugla to get yourself started on the assembly of your armor. When you have procured some protection for your weakling body return to me for [further instruction].' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what further instruction?' 
</p>
<p>
Jarrex N`Ryt says 'Ah, you are eager to advance further within the Indigo Brotherhood. Although it is my duty to aid your training, do not allow your arrogance to blind you to your lowly position amongst the Kings most loyal subjects. Your next task is to assist the construction of a [weapon] and [shield] worthy of being wielded by a Warrior of the Indigo Brotherhood.' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what weapon?' 
</p>
<p>
Jarrex N`Ryt says 'Beyond the mouth of Neriak lies the Nektulos Forest. There the Deathfist Clan of Orcs has set up camps in an attempt to invade and claim the Nektulos Forest. Slay these invaders and bring to me an Orc Templar Scalp, an Orc Fibula bone, and an Orc Clavicle bone.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what shield?' 
</p>
<p>
Jarrex N`Ryt says 'Young Kodiak Bears often wander into the Nektulos Forest from the Commonlands searching for food. You do not appear to have the strength to arm wrestle a pixie. If you prove me wrong by slaying Young Kodiaks and bringing me four Young Kodiak Femurs I will guide you in the construction of a shield worthy of a warrior of the Indigo Brotherhood.'
</p>
<p>
Issva H`Rugla says 'So you are one of Jarrex's new recruits. You are to assist in the construction of the armor you will don as a new Warrior of the Indigo Brotherhood. I have assembled a kit that is used in the crafting of Orc Slayer Mail. You must travel beyond Neriak into the Nektulos Forest for the [materials] that compose the armor.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what materials?' 
</p>
<p>
Issva H`Rugla says 'Many species of dangerous creatures, the walking dead, and invading Deathfist Orcs inhabit the Nektulos Forest. You must defeat these creatures and undead in order to obtain the materials. The materials you seek depend on the piece of armor you desire. Do you desire to craft [gauntlets], [boots], a [bracer], a [helm], [greaves], [vambraces], or a [breastplate]?' 
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I desire to craft a gauntlets' 
</p>
<p>
Issva H`Rugla says 'To craft Orc Slayer Gauntlets you require two [silk thread], a cracked pyre beetle carapace, and two orc finger bones. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Glove Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I desire to craft a boots' 
</p>
<p>
Issva H`Rugla says 'To craft Orc Slayer Boots you require two [silk thread], two cracked pyre beetle carapaces, and two orc foot bones. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Boot Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I desire to craft a bracer' 
</p>
<p>
Issva H`Rugla says 'To craft an Orc Slayer Bracer you require a [silk thread], a cracked pyre beetle carapace, and an orc ulna bone. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Bone Scale Kit with this Tattered Bracer Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I desire to craft a helm' 
</p>
<p>
Issva H`Rugla says 'To craft an Orc Slayer Helm you require two [silk thread], a cracked pyre beetle carapace, and an orc skull. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Cap Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I desire to craft a greaves' 
</p>
<p>
Issva H`Rugla says 'To craft Orc Slayer Greaves you require three [silk thread], a pyre beetle carapace, two orc tibia, and an orc pelvis bone. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Leggings Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I desire to craft a vambraces' 
</p>
<p>
Issva H`Rugla says 'To craft Ord Slayer Vambraces you require two [silk thread], a pyre beetle carapace, and two orc humerus bones. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Sleeves Pattern.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'I desire to craft a breastplate' 
</p>
<p>
Issva H`Rugla says 'To craft an Orc Slayer Breastplate you require four [silk thread], a pristine pyre beetle carapace, an orc sternum, and an orc ribcage. Once you have the necessary components combine them in your Mail Assembly Kit with this Tattered Tunic Pattern.'
