<p>
<p>There are many details still missing from the guide for this race.  What we have so far is either here or waiting in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/forumdisplay.php?f=100">DoN Data Submissions Forum</a>.  Please look there if you do not find the detail you need.  But keep in mind, it simply may not have been reported yet.  If you have some details that aren't here or there, please post them and we'll get them updated!</p>

<p>This is the quest for barbarians to acquire the books necessary to make the cultural armor that is available with the Dragons of Norrath expansion.  For more information on the general details, see the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q182&menustr=120030000000">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Armor Quest Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You start in Halas, with Kjell Sunrunner at 153, 387, inside The Golden Torc. (When you enter the city, take the turns to go left and go straight ahead to the building at the end of the path.)  The books do not need to be acquired in any particular order, as Kjell will give you all of the quests at once if you ask.</p>

<h4>Ancestral Book Quest</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Kjell Sunrunner'</p>
Kjell Sunrunner says ''Aye, hail,' the barbarian says as he raises a fist in salute. 'Have you returned for the [funeral], Verdandi?''</p>
<p>You say, 'what funeral?'</p>
<p>Kjell Sunrunner says ''The funeral of Fellroon Skene. He's one of the last of the Skene clan. The lad fell in battle. It was a proud death, a warrior's death! Too bad there are so few of his kin left to mourn him. That's why I've returned to Halas, to pay tribute to a great [warrior]!''</p>
<p>You say, 'What warrior?'</p>
<p>Kjell Sunrunner says ''Aye, all the Skenes had a penchant for warfare. That's probably why there are so few of them left. Before he died, Fellroon told me where to find his clan's armor pattern book. Their ancestral designs were a long kept secret, but Fellroon said he didn't want these patterns to die with him. He told me to pass them on to all Barbarians across Norrath. Would you be interested in a pattern [book] or perhaps some armor [patterns]?''</p>
<p>You say, 'I am interested in a pattern book'</p>
<p>Kjell Sunrunner says ''Very well then. To make a pattern book, I require a fire beetle carapace for the cover, a patch of zombie skin for the pages, a golden bandit tooth for the clasp, and a lion tail to grind down and make a salve which will protect and preserve the finished product. I have heard these resources can be found in Western Karana. Return to me when you have these items and the armor patterns shall be yours.''</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quest Details: Collect and hand in Fire Beetle Carapace, Zombie Skin, Golden Bandit Tooth, Lion Tail</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kjell Sunrunner says ''Just in time too, Verdandi. The funeral is only days away and I intend to travel on as soon as it’s over. As promised, here is your pattern book. May we carry the memory of the Skene clan with us into battle!''</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Receive: Ancestral Barbarian Armor</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'What armor patterns?'</p>
<p>Kjell Sunrunner says ''Well then, Verdandi. Now that the Fellroon is dead, a blood feud has began between his family and the goblins that slew him. If you are interested in joining their effort, they may be able to reward you with more of their ancestral pattern designs. Let me know if you are interested in expeditions for the Skene clan into [Everfrost], the Mines of [Nurga], the [Maiden's Eye], or the [valley] beyond the Lavastorm mountains.'</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Journeyman's Book Task: Chilled to the Bone</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'in Everfrost?'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'Chilled to the Bone'.</p>
<p>Kjell Sunrunner says 'The undead that roam the Everfrost peaks are often created from the remains of the goblin's victims. Venture forth and slay twenty ice boned skeletons. Return to me with four bone chips as proof of your kills.'</p>

<h4>Master's Book Task: The Essence of Darkness</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'what in Maiden's Eye?'</p>
<p>You have been assigned the task 'The Essence of Darkness'.</p>
<p>Kjell Sunrunner says 'In an effort to curb the power of the goblins, our shamans require further study of the magical essences used by the goblin warlocks. It is said that the essence of darkness can be found in Maiden's Eye. Go there, slay eighty shades and return to me with their dark essence. We can use what you recover to study the nature of the goblins' magic.'</p>

<p><i>Tips:</i> Vampyres can be any Coterie and are under the surface; they aggro when you walk over them.  One good place is SW corner of the zone where the bats and reanimated drudges are.  Essence of darkness drops only about 1/5 kills right now.  Vampyre ashes will probably come within the 5 kills needed. All mobs had about 10k hps, hit for up to around 150 max and are mainly light blue at 70 with the occasional dark blue and green.</p>

Venture into Stillmoon temple and take down six score of the denizens of Stillmoon. Recover eighty goblin skins for the Skene's war banners and deliver four to me for my personal battle standard. You may wish to seek out some operatives in Lavastorm to aid you in tracking down these rare items.'</p>

<h4>Barbarian Book Texts</h4>

<p>Ancestral Barbarian Armor:<br />
"This book details the ancestral armor of the Skene clan, a hearty stock of barbarians renowned for their wars against the goblins of Permafrost.  Although the House of Skene has fallen into sharp decline in recent years, its armor remains some of the best to ever grace a barbarian's shoulders.  Forged with dragon fire and cooled in the deep nows of Everfrost, the Skene's armor designs can turn aside the strongest of blades and splinter incoming arrows like tooth picks.  The patterns in this book can be copied many times, but eventually they will wear out and you can tell that if you use the patterns enough you will need to replace the book.  To create pattern for tailoring armor templates based on these patterns you will need this book, a large bottle of ink, a roll of plain parchment, a quill and a compacted backpack to hold the patterns you will make. You'll also need a book binding to do the work.  If you wish to use the patterns to make molds you'll need a kiln to work in as well as a high quality firing sheet, sculpting tools, a huge block of clan and a compacted backpack to hold the molds when you're done."</p>

<p>Books of Barbarian Culture:<br />
"Although not an innately magical race, the Barbarians have learned to invoke a number of spirits through their shamanistic rituals. These invisible spirits can often be contained and bound to runes etched accross barbarian battle armor. Controlling these sprits requires a great deal of strength and stamina, both mental and physical, so the strongest spirits are only bound to the strongest of the warriors. This book contains the simplest of spirit runes. Although they offern only a slight degree of protection, they are also easy to create and control.  Ideally, barbarians will begin with these spirit runes and work their way up to more advanced patterns. You know that you will be able to reproduce this pattern many times before the book becomes worn and you must replace it.  To create patterns for tailoring armor templates based on these patterns you will need this book, a large bottle of ink, a roll of vellum, a quill, and a compacted backpack to hold the patterns you will make. You'll also need a book binding to do the work."</p><p>
