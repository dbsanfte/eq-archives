<h3>Shadeweavers Thicket - Claw Needle</h3>
<p>
<i>This quest produces <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=5910&menustr=">a claw needle</a> that is used to make shaded hopperhide armor. The needle is used up when you make a piece of the armor, so you might wish to loop this many times. (A failed tailoring combine on the armor returns the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=5910&menustr=">a claw needle</a>, but uses up the armor pieces, success returns the new armor, but uses up the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=5910&menustr=">a claw needle</a>.)</i> 
</p>
<p>
Give Tiamon Aroo (tailoring supplies merchant in Shadeweaver's Thicket) 4 <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8355&menustr=">a needle thin claw</a>. These drop off needle clawed rockhoppers. Reward is one <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=5910&menustr=">a claw needle</a> (stackable) and a minor amount of experience.
