            <h3>Xanthe's Earring of Nature/PoTC Quest</h3>
            <p>This is an in-progress <i>rough</i> outline of the two versoins 
              of the quest for the Protection of the Cabbage spell (NO DROP, level 
              59, single-target Protection of the Grove spell for druids.) The 
              original version of this quest, which relies very heavily on tradeskills, 
              results in a copy of the spell and a no drop earring. The second 
              version (also linked in below), results in only the spell. The earring 
              reward is: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font color="#800000"><b>Xanthe's Earring of Nature:</b></font>

                7, sv magic 7, recommended level 51, effect: circle of the combines; 
                DRU/ALL, LORE, NO DROP. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If you have completed this quest and are not a druid, fear not! 
              You can hand this earring back to Rebecca Cabbageleaf for:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><b><font color="#800000">Earring of the Solstice:</font></b>

            <p><i>(Yes, druids can do this quest twice, trading in their Xanthe's 
              Earring of Nature for the Earring of the Solstice, then completing 
              the quest a second time for the Xanthe's Earring of Nature)</i></p>
            <p><b>Some basic background:</b></p>
            <p>On May 8, 2002, during the massive tradeskill patch, nine Liber 
              Brassica Felix books were introduced throughout the lands, each 
              written in a different language. They outlined various &quot;gifts&quot; 
              from the three druid races, and gave hints as to the proper combination 
              of them. The folks here at EQTC and the druids from the Druid's 
              Grove did <i>much</i> pooling of knowledge to solve this <i>extremely</i> 
              tradeskill-intensive quest. It was the first cross-server quest 
              of it's kind, and once it was completed, the folks at VI stated 
              that there would become an easier path to obtaining the spell. They 
              also stated that the quest would stay in place for those who wished 
              to strive and obtain the extra reward. (The first person to complete 
              the quest it was the lovely Lady Xanthe Ravenwolf on Bertoxxulous, 
              which explains the new name for the earring.) At that time, the 
              reward was the spell, and a lovely little ALL/ALL no drop earring.</p>
            <p>On June 5, during another patch, the tenth Liber Brassica Felix 
              book was found, and the old Earring of the Solstice magically changed 
              into Xanthe's Earring of Nature in inventories throughout the lands. 
              While greeted with some excitement, there was also much consternation 
              by the non-druids in the community who suddenly found their all/all 
              earring turn into something druid-only. Fortunately, VI took pity 
              on all the frenzied tradeskillers who had spent the time and money 
              to obtain the rather lovely earring, and announced partway through 
              the day that Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungus Grove would be glad to 
              accept trade-ins on earrings for something more suitable. (She could 
              also be used to recharge earrings that were mistakenly out of charges, 
              apparently by handing in the Xanthe's earring, then returning the 
              Earring of the Solstice to her.)</p>
