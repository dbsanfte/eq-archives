      <span class="headers">Gates of Discord Tinkering Collect</span>
<p>
This is one of several new tradeskill quests originating in Abysmal Sea. For general information on these quests, please see the main <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q142&menustr=120037000000">Gates of Discord Quests</a> writeup.<p>
The completion of this quest will allow you to progress to tinkering skill 54 (provided that you meet the level requirements. It will also allow you to learn how to process raw dark matter, so that it can be used in the new GoD tinkering recipes.<p>
<blockquote>You say, 'what work'
<p>Tialechaety Orrthemech  nods, 'Good.  But for what I need to do, I'll need some dark matter.  If you can find some raw dark matter, take it over to Skelontorim and he can treat it for you.  Then bring it to me and I'll put you to work.  Work hard enough and I'll teach you the secret for treating dark matter.  Of course, since I am asking you to provide some of the material for the work, I will reward you more quickly than Skelontorim.  So gather up some dark matter and hand it to me, and I'll give you some chores to do.'</blockquote>
This version of the quest requires that you find raw dark matter (mob drop) and give it to Skelontorim Orrthemech for conversion into dark matter. You then give a dark matter to Tialchaety Orrthemech to trigger step one.<p>
Not all of the hail text is available at the moment, but the important stuff is here.<p>
<hr>
STEP ONE<p>
<blockquote>Tialechaety Orrthemech says ''Well, as you could probably guess, we have plenty of opportunities to get ourselves hurt out here.  Heck, some of the people working on this boat hurt themselves every single day.  I have figured out a way to use dark matter as a power supply for gauze presses.  It's still a bit tricky to use and keep working, but they tend to last longer if handled properly.  All I need you to do is put the dark matter into the presses.  That sounds easy, but because dark matter is so unstable, it is difficult to place properly into the device without breaking or contaminating it.  I'm certain that you can do it, though.  When you have the presses ready, bring them back to me."'</blockquote>
She will give you enough raw materials for 10 combines on the wayfarer gauze press. Give her the completed presses, then give her another dark matter. Continue to loop until you have given her 30 completed wayfarer gauze presses, at which time she will progress to step two the next time that you hand her a dark matter.<p>
STEP TWO<p>
<blockquote>Tialechaety Orrthemech says ''Your assistance is welcome, ____.  The task I have for you is a little dangerous.  I think I have discovered a new way to make flares that are not only more visible, but more distinctive.  They should be more useful that simple fireworks for sending signals.  The difficulty is that these flares use dark matter.  I'm a little worried that a mistake might cause some damage to the tinkerer doing the work.  But I can see that such danger does not discourage you!  Here are some flares and some dark matter.  Make sure to only use one scrap of dark matter in each flare!  I'd hate to send folks out with flares that have too much power. . .  Bring the flares back to me when you have them done.  But please work on them over in a corner somewhat away from me.  Thanks.''</blockquote><p>
This is pretty much a repeat of step 1, only with new materials and a new finished product. Loop until you have given her 30 of the wayfarer signal flares, and the next time that you give her dark matter, she will progress to step three.<p>
STEP THREE<p>
<blockquote>Tialechaety Orrthemech  smiles slightly, 'I am glad you can still work with us.  I'm not one to panic, but I have been asked to beef up the ship's water pumps and repair some of the old ones.  This might just be routine maintenance, but I could speculate otherwise, but that would be impolite.  Please take these pumps and power them with the dark matter and grease all of the moving parts.  Bring them back to me when you are done.'</blockquote><p>
This is pretty much a repeat of step 1, only with new materials and a new finished product. Loop until you have given her 30 of the wayfarer water pumps, and the next time that you give her dark matter, she will progress to step four.<p>
STEP FOUR<p>
<blockquote>Tialechaety Orrthemech says ''Oh, hello.  Great, you brought more dark matter.  I've been wanting to try something for a while now, and this should allow me to try it.  I hate rats.  Any reasonable person does.  But the sailors are used to having them around and don't take any efforts to get rid of the pests.  I have been snapping up any broken clockworks that I can find and refitting them to look something like cats.  If you could power them up with the dark matter, set in the bait and bring them back to me, I'd be grateful.''</blockquote><p>
This is pretty much a repeat of step 1, only with new materials and a new finished product. Loop until you have given her 30 of the wayfarer water pumps, and the next time that you give her dark matter, she will delcare you ready to learn the secrets to converting the raw dark matter and raw infused dark matter.<p>
<blockquote>Tialechaety Orrthemech says ''You have already been of great service to us, I won't ask you to do more.  Skelontorim can teach you how to treat dark matter as your reward.  Make sure to tell him that you were able to [lend a hand] helping me out and he will show you what you need to know.  Thank you for your help, may Brell be the ground on which you walk.''</blockquote><p>
Return to Skelontorim, tell him "lend a hand" and he will give you the instruction that you seek.
