<p>
<p>There are many details still missing from the guide for this race.  What we have so far is either here or waiting in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/forumdisplay.php?f=100">DoN Data Submissions Forum</a>.  Please look there if you do not find the detail you need.  But keep in mind, it simply may not have been reported yet.  If you have some details that aren't here or there, please post them and we'll get them updated!</p>

<p>This is the quest for halflings to acquire the books necessary to make the cultural armor that is available with the Dragons of Norrath expansion.  For more information on the general details, see the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q182&menustr=120030000000">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Armor Quest Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You start in Rivervale, with Bill Whistletop at -280, -136.  The books do not need to be acquired in any particular order, as Bill will give you all of the quests at once if you ask.</p>

<h4>Ancestral Book Quest</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail Bill Whistletop'</p>
<p>Bill Whistletop says, 'Hi-ho there, Maisie. You startled me. I'm busy compiling notes for my compendium, it'll be a complete [history] of Rivervale for an entire century. Imagine that!'</p>
<p>You say, 'What history?'</p>
<p>Bill Whistletop says, 'Well, it's not really a history book, not exactly. It's more like I just sit around and write about whatever's [going on] in Rivervale at the moment. I've been doing this for thirty-seven years now, so ,um, hey, I'm almost half done!'</p>
<p>You say, 'What has been going on?'</p>
<p>Bill Whistletop says, 'Yeah, I write down everything: fishing trips, crop yields, new card games I pick up. Hmm , I guess it is more of a journal than a history book... Oh well, it's still chalk (sic) full of historical [significance].'</p>
<p>You say, 'What significance?'</p>
<p>Bill Whistletop says, 'Heck yes, I write down everything so some of it has got to be important. For example, I copied down all those [armor patterns] and [cultural symbol patterns] that were displayed during that spring festival eleven years ago. You know the one where we had that competition to see who could make the best suit of armor! Boy, that was a great festival. The apple tarts were amazing. I'm glad I wrote down the recipe for those too!'</p>
<p>You say, 'What armor patterns?'</p>
<p>Bill Whistletop says, 'Oh, you're interested in the armor huh? I guess you do look like the adventuring sort. Well, heck, I can make you an armor pattern book if you want? I have all the designs written down and recorded somewhere in one of my journals; all I'll need is the materials for the pattern book itself. Just bring me a cat skull cap for the cover, a fractured femur for the spine, a minotaur horn for the clasp, and a bunch of optic nerves to grind down and make a salve, which will protect and preserve the finished product. I hear these items can be found in the Runnyeye Goblin territory and the Beholder's Maze, but I'm not really sure? Anyway, once I have those, I can make you a pattern book. Then we can go fishing!'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quest Details: Collect and hand in Fractured Femur, A Bunch of Optic Nerves, Minotaur Horn, and Cat Skull Cap.</p>
<p><i>Tips:</i> The Cat Skull Cap and Fractured Femur both drop off of pickclaw goblins in Runnyeye.  A goblin who is carrying a femur will have in equipped in its hand.  A Bunch of Optic Nerves drops off of evil eyes in either Runnyeye or Beholder (The Gorge of King Xorbb). The Minotaur Horn drops off minotaurs in Beholder (and Steamfont Mountains, if you want to make that hike). When a minotaur has a horn on it, you will see it holding something horn-like.</p> 
<blockquote>
<p>Bill Whistletop says, '"Oh hey there, Maisie. I'm still working on my history book. In fact, I just wrote down the part where we first met. Here let me read it for you!" Bill clears his throat. "Ahem, so I was writing in my history book when Maisie comes up to me and says Hail. And so I reply..." Bill continues to ramble on for many minutes. Finally, he gets to the end of his journal and looks up. He blinks as though surprised that you are still here. " Oh, yeah, the armor pattern book. Sorry I forgot about that. Here you go!"'</p>

<p>The following chart shows what drops are needed to make each tier of armor (made with the Ancestral book). More information about making the various tiers of symbols (with the Books of Culture) is on the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q182&menustr=120030000000">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Armor Quest Overview</a>, because the books are the only ingredient that differs between races.</p>
