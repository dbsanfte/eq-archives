      <P> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Ogres and trolls 
        might seem like they consumed more food than any other primary race in 
        the lands, but everyone knew that, pound-for-pound, halflings consumed 
        the most food in relation to their body mass. They also were reputed to 
        have the most culinary appreciation for a variety of foods. Let the biguns 
        eat anything that didn't eat them first. It took a halfling to truly appreciate 
        the myriad of robust seasonings and styles of food preparation that could 
        turn almost anything into a culinary masterpiece. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A young halfling 
        lass by the name of Niami knew this fact well, and had eagerly awaited 
        the day that she could bake something more than the unappetizing, but 
        quite filling, edible goo.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">That young halfling 
        lass was now a most upset halfling lass, and her ire was impressive to 
        see. Whirling upon one of the elders who'd seen fit to teach the orphaned 
        halfling, Niami stamped a large foot in vexation. &quot;What do ye mean 
        there be no baking supplies closer than th' Commonlands?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Mardra Meepup threw 
        up her hands in a gesture of frustration. &quot;Lass, it's the gods' will 
        that we have no baking supplies merchant near our lovely town. Goodness 
        knows we've tried often enough to get one to set up shop here, but something 
        always seems to go wrong. Apparently, Bristlebane wants our cooks to have 
        to travel in order to provide us with culinary delights.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Pshaw and piffle! 
        I do nae believe that frae a moment!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Arms akimbo, Mardra 
        stared at the young lass. &quot;You'd <i>dare</i> question the word of 
        one of Bristlebane's chosen, a Priestess of Mischief?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Aye, lass, 
        that I do. An' I'd question Bristlebane himself o'er such an issue as 
        well! Imagine creating us wi' such prodigous appetites, an' then leaving 
        us tae gnaw on roots an' half-cooked meats, unless we want tae have tae 
        beg th' humans frae supplies!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A snicker, quickly 
        muffled, erupted from where some of the halfling acolytes were studying 
        their spells. Thekela, however, looked ready to erupt, and Niami idly 
        wondered if that was steam coming out of the woman's ears, or just a stray 
        tendril of fog.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">High Priest of Mischief, 
        Leek Guinders, who'd been studying religious texts in a nearby alcove, 
        made his presence known to the two before Thekela could let loose with 
        any blistering commentary. &quot;Then question him you shall, young one. 
        For these past few months you've been trying us with one question too 
        many.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">With that, he gestured, 
        and Niami was wisked ... elsewhere. However, just as her familiar Rivervale 
        faded around her, she could hear Thekela speak up, voice waspish: &quot;They 
        deserve each other!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&gt;&gt;whoomph&lt;&lt; 
        One moment Niami felt like she was going to fall into endless blackness, 
        the next she landed on a big, fluffy pillow ... on a giant table?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A booming voice resonated 
        from above her. &quot;Well, what have we here?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hastily adjusting 
        the handkerchief covering her unruly mop of black curls, Niami got to 
        her feet as her brown eyes widened. Sitting at the table she'd so summarily 
        landed upon was the largest halfling she had ever seen ... larger even 
        than an ogre!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For a moment, Niami's 
        mind ran around inside her head, gibbering, as she realized she was sitting 
        in the presence of Bristlebane himself. Then she gathered her resolve 
        and drew a deep breath as she remembered, not what her teachers had told 
        her of the god, but what her parents had taught her. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Och, lad! I 
        hae come tae tell ye a few things, an' take ye tae task!&quot; She stalked 
        down the length of the table towards him, her large feet flapping.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hearty laughter followed 
        her comment. &quot;You? Want to take <b><i>me</i></b> to task? Bold little 
        thing, aren't you?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Aye, laddybuck, 
        an' yuir th' one who made me that way, aren't ye? Sae ye cannae take me 
        tae task frae bein' as ye made me ... can ye?&quot; She peered up at him 
        quizzically.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Another laugh followed 
        the first. &quot;Well so I am! But it's not every day I get some halfling 
        not even out of her tweens telling me to my face that she's going to take 
        me to task.&quot; He leaned back in his chair, folding his hands over 
        his ample stomach as he eyed the small halfling standing on his table.&quot; 
        You intrigue me young one. Now, tell me, what's on your mind and why did 
        Leek send you to me?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Heartened by the 
        fact that she'd not yet been struck down for her temerity, she pointed 
        dramatically at a bowl of bixie crunchies sitting in front of him. &quot;&quot;Because 
        o' that! An' because I be too much o' a mischief maker.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;<i><b>Too </b></i><b><i>much</i></b> 
        of a mischief maker? One can <i> <b>never</b></i> have too much mischief 
        lass!&quot; Bristlebane's brows lowered in an alarming frown.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Aye, laddybuck, 
        that be what I said! But methinks th' puir ol' fuddy-duddy was finally 
        at his wit's end. He's jus' nae got th' mischief in him anymore, an' neither 
        do those he's surrounded himself wi'. At least nae proper mischief.&quot; 
        Niami nodded empatically to underscore her point. &quot;They've forgotten 
        how tae laugh properly, an' they jus' sit there an' preach. Th' Vale used 
        tae be full o' laughter an' mischief afore me folks died, but after they 
        did, it seems th' mischief went right out o' folks.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;This current 
        issue o' mine be jus' another case in point! Och! It be enow tae drive 
        a lass tae distraction, an' all they can do is preach that it's yuir will.&quot; 
        She tapped the fingers of one hand on her hip as she stared at him challengingly. 
        &quot;Are ye trying tae starve us, lad??&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Starve you? 
        What makes you think that I, lover of fine foods, is trying to starve 
        you?&quot; Bristlebane peered at Niami quizzically. He already knew the 
        topic she was going to rant about, but he wanted to see just how she'd 
        handle the delivery. After all, if this one was going to become one of 
        <i>his</i> chosen clerics, he needed to better test her mettle.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Several things, 
        tallstuff, sae listen up, an' I'll tell ye.&quot; She snagged the pillow 
        that she'd originally landed upon, and dragged it across the table until 
        it was in front of Bristlebane. Then she unceremoniously plopped herself 
        down on the pillow and started ticking off points on her fingers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;At first glance, 
        we'd seem tae hae an idyllic life in th' vale wi' plentiful food everywhere. 
        But do ye know how boring plain fish, an' stray veggies can be? Och! It 
        be enow tae drive a food-lover tae suicide, almos'!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She flung her tiny 
        hands up in exasperation. &quot;An' then, there's th' meat! I beat an' 
        beat an' beat on those wolves an' bears that try tae take a bite oot o' 
        me, an' do ye think I can find a decent cut o' meat on their miserable 
        carcasses? It needs tenderizing, or a guid soak in some sauces in order 
        tae be made intae passable steaks, an' there's nary a sauce tae be sold 
        in th' Vale or surrounding area, much less any proper seasonings, frostings, 
        or e'en flour. An' no bread tae make proper sandwiches, either! I e'en 
        cracked me staff on th' last bear, he was sae tough!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> All the months of 
        frustration while she watched the cleric's guild grow more hidebound, 
        all the shame and righteous anger from being scolded every time her mischevious 
        streak went awry, and all her desire to bake the divine recipes she'd 
        read about in her mother's cookbook exploded out of her as she jumped 
        up and started waggling a finger under Bristlebane's nose.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Ye listen tae 
        me, laddybuck. I'll hae none o' it, ye hear me? Yuir supposed tae be th' 
        god o' mischief, an' how on earth can I cause proper mischief in worship 
        o' ye if I be half starved frae guid food, as well as frae proper appreciation 
        o' me pranks? Ye need tae do summat aboot th' lack o' a proper baking 
        merchant, an' aboot yuir clerics who hae lost their laughter, an' aboot 
        th' lack o' simple bread at th' inn in Rivervale, an' last but not least, 
        lad, ye have tae do summat about the fact that those bears hae such tough 
        hides that I'm like tae break more than jus' me only weapon th' next time 
        one o' them tries tae snack on me!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For a long moment, 
        silence reigned, other than the rasp of her breathing as she tried to 
        get it more under control. Attempting to continue with the bravado that 
        had gotten her so deep into this mess in the first place, Niami casually 
        patted once again at the colorful kerchief holding her hair in place as 
        she waited for Bristlebane to respond.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She watched with 
        growing concern as Bristlebane's face started to turn a lovely shade of 
        red. His shoulders started shaking, and he clenched large hands tightly 
        on the table's edge. Oh dear, she'd gone and done it, he was definitely 
        holding back ... a laugh?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Whooping shouts of 
        laughter bounced off the walls, as Bristlebane finally gave in to the 
        laughter that had been threatening to erupt throughout her tirade. She 
        was just so cute when she was feisty!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;I have definitely 
        done well, little one, if you're a sample of what I did when I created 
        halflings. You please me ... and are a fitting Priestess of Mischief. 
        Your first duty as one of my chosen ones is to tell that old stick-in-the-mud 
        Leek to either loosen up, or to start looking for his replacement. Mind 
        you, find a properly mischevious way of doing it, wee one, or I might 
        change my mind.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A whole swarm of 
        bixies could have flown aerial displays in her mouth, it was gaping open 
        so wide. However, she had no time to recover, as he continued.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;As to the merchant, 
        it seems a ... clerical error ... occurred. The last fellow we summoned 
        to set up shop there was supposed to bring baking supplies with him. However, 
        I understand he brought enchanter spells instead? No matter. It's been 
        fixed now. When you return, you'll find him selling the proper wares.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">&quot;Now, as to 
        the bears. You know full well that they come under the rule of Tunare, 
        and I'm not about to mess with one of her creatures over something so 
        trivial ... though it could be fun to try. So, I guess the only thing 
        to do is to give you a better weapon.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">He snapped his fingers, 
        and an oversized meat tenderizer appeared in Niami's hands. Startled, 
        she almost dropped it before she managed to hold it in a 2-handed grip. 
        &quot;Let this do your tenderizing for you, little one. And for times 
        when that is not enough, may it strike with all the strength of the righteous 
        wrath within you. Now, is that all?&quot; He steepled his fingers in front 
        of him, and peered at her from behind them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Suddenly mindful 
        that she was standing on Bristlebane's table, eyeball-to-eyeball with 
        him, she answered, &quot;Aye, lad, an' thank ye. May yuir toe fur flourish.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As she felt the world 
        around her dissolve, she realized he'd said nothing about the inn and 
        it's bread. Best not to mention it now, however. After all, when dealing 
        with the god whose <i>other</i> name is the God of Lies, getting 3 out 
        of 4 concessions was a major undertaking.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And so, Niami got 
        her meat tenderizer, Bim Buskin started selling baking supplies in Misty 
        Thicket (clerical error or not, the gods had been insistent that he was 
        selling such wares until a wee halfling took one of them to task), and 
        Leek Guinders stepped down as leader of the Clerics of Mischief, in favor 
        of his nephew Beek (after there was some unfortunate incident involving 
        a concoction of jumjum stalks, bixie stingers and frosting mysteriously 
        replacing a high feast for the Mayor.)</font></p>
