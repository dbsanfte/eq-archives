<span class="headers">Rivervale Rogue (Slickfinger) Armor</span>
<p>
<p>
<i>This quest allows the young halfling rogue to learn the very basics of blacksmithing skill, while attaining some good starter armor. It is believed that the combines are no-fail, and minimal smithing increases have been seen from the creation of this armor. The results are lore (other than bracer), no drop, and are HFL/ROG only. Armor has a dark blue chain graphic when worn. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one</i>

</p>
<p>
You say, 'what training'
</p>
<p>
Lendel Deeppockets says 'There are many steps that young rouges must take on the road to stealth. The most important part of your training is learning how to use the tools around you such as the forge. From the looks of you I can tell you could use some more [enchanted armor] as well so I think this would be a good learning experience.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'what enchanted armor'
</p>
<p>

First, I will present you with your Dusty Mail Assembly kit when you are ready. After that, simply tell me what piece of Slickfinger Chainmail you [want] to craft and I will give you a pattern along with a recipe for [Coifs], [Bracers], [Sleeves], [Boots], [Legplates], [Gloves] and [Tunics]. The recipe I will give you for specific items will need to me combined in the assembly kit to create the magical material necessary. Once you have this material and pattern that I gave you when you told me what item you wanted to craft, put both in the nearest forge to create the armor piece you asked for. Here is your Dusty Mail Assembly Kit.'
</p>
<p>
You say, 'i want to craft coif' ( had to be singular)
</p>
<p>
Lendel Deeppockets says 'Protecting the ole noggin is probably the smartest move you will make young Placibo. Here is your pattern, once you have combined 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Ruined Thorn Drakeling Scales and 1 Carrot in your kit place it in a forge along with this pattern to create your Slickfinger Chainmail Coif.'

Lendel Deeppockets says 'Go out into the thicket and seek out 1 Brick of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Shattered Warbead, 1 Large Yellowjacket Sternite and 1 Milk. Once you have combined them in your kit to fashion the bracer material take it to a forge along with this pattern to create your Slickfinger Chainmail Bracer.'
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
Completed bracer is AC 4, STR 1, DEX 3, wt 1.0
</p>
</blockquote>

Take this pattern to the nearest forge with that material to create your Sleeves of the Slickfinger.'

<p>
You say, 'i want to craft boots'
</p>
<p>
Lendel Deeppockets says 'Boots you say Placibo? Well I think I heard you right but I had to check. Make sure you only wear your boots in case of emergency. All other times you should showcase your feet to the world with pride. You will need to combine 2 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Fire Beetle Eyes and 2 Giant Thicket Rat Skulls in your kit to fashion your Slickfinger Boot Material. Once you have done this take the material to a forge along with this pattern to create your Slickfinger Chainmail Boots.'

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'i want to craft gauntlets' ( Keyword is different from what he lists.)
</p>
<p>
Lendel Deeppockets says 'Your gauntlets may possibly be the most important part of armor. One should always be sure that their hands are not exposed, because taking a blow to the hand is a lot worse then getting hurt anywhere else! To create the gauntlet material please collect 3 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 2 Bixie Wings, 1 Large Snake Skin and 1 Red Wine.'

Please collect 5 Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, 1 Giant Wood Spider Femurs, 1 Embalming Dusts, 2 Dark Elf Skins and 1 Giant Yellowjacket Thorax. Come back after you are finished, I have a [job] for you. ' <i><b>(Note: this recipe only requires ONE dark elf skin, not two)</b></i>
</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>
The completed tunic is AC 12, STR 2, DEX 5.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You say, 'what job'
</p>
<p>
Lendel Deeppockets says 'Orcs is the job Placibo. Plain and simple I cannot stand these homewreckers. They have moved into our land and continue to storm our front gate. I seek out bone fragments and fractured jawbones from these nasty Orcs. Once we have 1 of each we will be able to create a weapon for you to use.'
