<p>
<p>
This quest provides an alternate method to gain entance to the Halls of Honor. It involves a smithing combine (that may be skipped if you wish to pay the NPC to make the combine instead) and both versions of the combine have a chance of failure. This quest requires the Planes of Power expansion. 
<p>
Collect to following three items: 
<ol> 
<li>From PoN - <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7630&menustr=">Nightmare Mephit Heart</a><!-Nightmare Mephit Heart-> ~ droped by nightmare mephits</li> 
<li>From PoV - <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8467&menustr=">Crystal Spider Brain</a><!-Crystal Spider Brain-> ~ dropped by Lumini Crawler </li> 
<li>From PoI - <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7628&menustr=">Solid Block Of Perilium</a><!-Solid Block of Perilium-> ~ dropped by any named mob (ie. corroded prototype, corrupted system) </li> 
</ol> 
<p>
You then hand these three items and 3000pp to Borik Darkanvil in Plane of Knowledge @ -375, 500, Southeastern trader building<!-Borik Darkanvil-> for him to combine to make the key to HoHa, alas Borki is not that experienced at smithing, and does have a chance of FAILING the combine, in which case you LOSE everything including the 3000pp. Alternatively, you can combine them yourself as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9537&menustr=">Box Of Souls</a><!-Box of Souls->
<ul>
<li>Components: <a href="/items/show_item.php?item=8467">crystal spider brain</a>, <a href="/items/show_item.php?item=7630">nightmare mephit heart</a>, <a href="/items/show_item.php?item=3086">smithy hammer</a>, <a href="/items/show_item.php?item=7628">solid block of perilium</a>, <a href="/items/show_item.php?item=1001">water flask</a><br />In: <a href="/items/show_item.php?item=5499">tanaan forge</a><br />Also Returns: <a href="/items/show_item.php?item=3086">smithy hammer</a><br />On Failure Returns: <a href="/items/show_item.php?item=3086">smithy hammer</a> (<i>Smithing Trivial 15&lt;x&lt;=113</i>)<br />Yield: 1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
Either of these methods should result in a box of souls. 
</p> 
<p>
You then go to PoJ where you need to kill the tormented souls who live in a cell near the final stairs down to the trial area. You need to kill them 1 at a time until they spawn a named mob on death, named either exiled trooper of Marr, exiled officer of Marr or exiled soldier of Marr. Each shade in the room will spawn one of these mobs on death. Once the exiled spirit spawns, hand it the box. 
</p> 
<p>
You should then recieve a soul orb and have the box returned to you. 
</p> 
<p>
You need to do this once for each tormented spirit in the room, until you have the 3 soul orbs. 
</p> 
<p>
You then make your way to PoV and find Grenic Drere, to whom you hand the 3 soul orbs. This will result in a Ring of Marr, your key to HoHa! As of the April 8, 2003 patch, everyone that is grouped with you for this final handin, should also receive the ring.
