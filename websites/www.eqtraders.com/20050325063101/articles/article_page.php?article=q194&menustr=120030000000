<p>
<p>There are many details still missing from the guide for this race.  What we have so far is either here or waiting in the <a href="http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/forumdisplay.php?f=100">DoN Data Submissions Forum</a>.  Please look there if you do not find the detail you need.  But keep in mind, it simply may not have been reported yet.  If you have some details that aren't here or there, please post them and we'll get them updated!</p>

<p>This is the quest for dwarves to acquire the books necessary to make the cultural armor that is available with the Dragons of Norrath expansion.  For more information on the general details, see the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q182&menustr=120030000000">Dragons of Norrath Cultural Armor Quest Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You start in South Kaladim, with Yar Shiverbrow near the warrior guild at 16, 465. The books do not need to be acquired in any particular order, as Yar will give you all of the quests at once if you ask.</p>

<h4>Ancestral Book Quest</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'Hail, Yar Shiverbrow'</p>
<p>Yar Shiverbrow says 'Gaa! Look at that shoddy piece of work yer wearing! You call that [armor]? I've seen finer craftsmanship hanging off the corpse of a rock-pickin' goblin!'</p>
<p>You say, 'what armor?'</p>
<p>Yar Shiverbrow says 'Bah! See how you are?! All sloppy and ragged! Now look at me! A respectable dwarf, standing tall and proud in bright mail. The way Brell intended! To any self-respectin' dwarf, good armor is more important than good ale! Your ale won't last, but your armor is forever! Remember that, Achenar. Now if you [want] to be a self-respecting dwarf, let me know. I've also got a couple kits of [adornments] to be used by someone in decent armor, not someone like you. But if yer interested in them I might tell you about them. Otherwise carry on with your lollygagging!'</p>
<p>You say, 'I want to be a self respecting dwarf'</p>
<p>Yar Shiverbrow says 'Well then, I can make you a pattern book for some decent armor, but first I'll need some zombie skin and a bit of grave mold from the Estate of Unrest. I can use those to create the cover and ink for the book. I'll also need some of the battle beads from Crushbone to help bind the book and a rotting orc tooth to complete the ink. Now get going, ya filthy roustabout!'</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>You say, 'what adornments?'</p>
<p>Yar Shiverbrow says 'You see, these adornments aren't just fer lookin at. No, these can work wonders when you combine them with the patterns that I have. You'd surely be a foolish one if you thought that I'd ever be makin somthin fer armor that was just fer looks. Now I'm willing to part with some of these kits but you'd have to [prove your metal] first.'</p>
<p>You say, 'how do I prove my metal?'</p>
<p>Yar Shiverbrow says 'Lets see here. . . I know, since yer an adventurin type, I'll send you on some adventures. I'll even be nice about it. You've got yer choice of goin to the [Estate of Unrest], the slightly damp [Kedge Keep], [The Deep], or to the [Thundercrest Isles].'</p>
