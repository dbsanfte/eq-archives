            <p>This iskar quest has been around for quite some time, and is not 
              yet solved. It contains a smithing combine detailed below that is 
              good for smithing skillups for young iksar, as well as a baking 
              combine. Honey mush bread has finally been added to a vendor, but 
              the elusive sewer catfish was temporarily extinct. It's back in 
              the fishing table for Cabilis on Test, and is awaiting a patch to 
              go live. Please note the lore status of the cutting disks and the 
              thin sliced froglok, and don't try to make a second of those while 
              you still have the first one on you.
            <p>This quest starts with Klok Foob in Lake of Ill Omen (ruins near 
              West Cabilis, upstairs at loc 6130, -6454) 
            <blockquote>
              <p>You say, 'Hail, Klok Foob' <br>
                Klok Foob says 'Buy, buy, buy. Go ahead, make a purchase. I am 
                not here to talk. Go to Cabilis for talk. Come to Foob for armor. 
                Now hurry and.. &lt;his stomach growls&gt; Ooh.. Foob is starvings. 
                Foob wish he had his [munch break favorite].' </p>
              <p>You say, 'what is your munch break favorite?' <br>
                Klok Foob rubs his tummy. 'Oh!! Catfish croak sandwich is my favorite, 
                it is. Can only eats on my break. I haves one and one is what 
                the Haggle Baron says to Foob. Only thing is Foob gets way tired 
                from standing. Foob needs some broodling to [fetch the catfish 
                croak sandwich] for him.' </p>
              <p>You say, 'I will fetch the catfish croak sandwich.' <br>
                Klok Foob says 'What?!! You dus gets Foob his sandwich for his 
                munch break!! You be a good tail. Gets me two sandwiches, one 
                fer break and one fer work, then me pay you something for the 
                troubles. But it be no trouble. Foob is sure you know [how to 
                make sandwich].' </p>
              <p>You say, 'how do I make the sandwich?' <br>
                Klok Foob chortles loudly in disbelief. 'How you not know? It 
                da best food. You gots to get a sewer catfish which swims in da 
                Cabilis, and find lizard who have thin sliced froglok. Then all 
                you need is shrub lettuce and honey mush bread. All dis in da 
                oven makes a good sandwich.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Honey mush bread is sold by Klok Sargin, also in Lake of Ill Omen, 
              in the same building as Klok Foob (second floor, loc 6019, -6334). 
              The bread is a meal, so be careful to not accidentally eat it! (Also 
              found on Klok Bygle in Swamp of No Hope)</p>
            <p> Next, find Klok Ephmir in East Cabilis at Location 122, -117</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>You say, 'Hail, Klok Ephmir' <br>
                Klok Ephmir stares at you with a wicked smirk. 'So you share the 
                Brood's love of frogloks, do you? Alive, they provide much trouble. 
                Dead, they provide much delight. I have found many uses for the 
                frogloks. From fine meat to fine mats. Be sure to ask if you do 
                not see something you desire.' </p>
              <p>You say, 'I need thinly sliced froglok' <br>
                Klok Ephmir says 'I can provide thin sliced froglok meat, or rather, 
                I used to. First, I need to [sharpen the dull cutting disk].' 
              </p>
              <p>You say, 'I can sharpen the dull cutting disk' <br>
                Klok Ephmir says 'That would be good. If you are a blacksmith, 
                I am sure you can find a sharpening stone and bring life back 
                to my disk. If you sharpen this I shall gladly provide you with 
                some thin sliced froglok.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Recieve: Dull Cutting Disk, Lore, NoDrop, wt 0.5, size small, all/all, 
              nonstackable </p>
            <p>Nearby you will find a forge and Klok Toren who sells the Sharpening 
              Stones for 3cp.</p>
            <p>Combine in forge: Dull Cutting Disk + Sharpening Stone. On failure, 
              the dull cutting disk is returned. Upon success you receive: Sharp 
              Cutting Disk, Lore, NoDrop, wt 0.5, size small, all/all, nonstackable. 
              Trivial for the combine is 26.</p>
            <p>Give Klok Ephmir the sharp Cutting Disk</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Klok Ephmir takes the disk and attaches it to an odd device powered 
                by a foot pedal. He takes a froglok leg and begins to slice it 
                as chunks of gristle flies into your face. When he is done he 
                hands you some thin sliced froglok. 'There you are. Run along.' 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Receive: Thin Sliced Froglok Meat, lore, no-drop, Meal, Wt 1.0, 
              Size: Small, all/all, (appears stackable but its lore so can only 
              have one)</p>
            <p>Shrub lettuce drops off man eating shrubs in Swamp of No Hope, 
              especially around the first outcast iksar camp.</p>
            <p>Once you have everything together, combine sewer catfish, shrub 
              lettuce, honey mush bread and thin sliced froglok meat in an oven 
              to make a catfish croak sandwich, no drop, meal, wt 0.1, small, 
              all/all. Trivial is somewhere between 22 and 38. Once you have the 
              first one made, then rinse and repeat to make a second one.</p>
            <p>Further updates will be available once the quest is fully functional 
              on Test.</p>
