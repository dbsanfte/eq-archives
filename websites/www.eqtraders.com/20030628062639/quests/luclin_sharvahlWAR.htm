            <h3> Vah Shir Warrior Quests</h3>
            <p><i>As with many quests in Shar Vahl, this requires that you've 
              already completed the <a href="citizenship.htm">Vah Shir Citizenship 
              quest</a>. Also, as with all the class-specific quests in Shar Vahl, 
              it requires that a young Vah Shir focus on a specific tradeskill. 
              For warriors, this skill is smithing. Further details on the Hollowshade 
              Moor drops needed <a href="hollowshade_dropinfo.htm">can be found 
              here</a>.</i></p>
            <p><i> Please post any additions/clarifications on the message boards. 
              </i></p>
            <p>After completing your citizenship quest, return to the warrior 
              Guild Master. He will tell you to find Guard Hebijeb (Note: He is 
              labeled Khala Dun Hebijeb. He can be found guarding the entrance 
              to the arena.) and show him your personal acrylia slate.</p>
            <p>Give Khala Dun Hebijeb your personal acrylia slate (he will return 
              it to you):</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Khala Dun Hebijeb says 'I was told to expect you, Grekas. It 
                is my duty to supervise this stage of your training, which will 
                help strengthen you in preparation for your life of service to 
                our people. There is much to do in very little time so let us 
                begin. There are creatures that roam freely at the base of the 
                rock on which we live. You are tasked with demonstrating a basic 
                understanding of combat by defeating skeletons of grimlings and 
                delivering to me four of their femurs.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Go to the pit surrounding the city and hunt Grimling Skeletons. 
              Collect four femurs and return them to Guard Hebijeb. (Note: the 
              grimling skeletons seem to only spawn at certain times so it might 
              take awhile to collect all the femurs you need.)</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Khala Dun Hebijeb looks at you with an expression of approval, 
                'Your completion of the assigned task has been noted. Accept this 
                weapon as a token of the Khala Dun's gratitude. You will find 
                the Khala Dun to be very generous to it's humble students, quick 
                to reward obedience. I have been notified that one of our citizens 
                needs some assistance, bring me proof that you have aided Dronqam 
                Runghi. '</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You are rewarded with faction, XP and a Crude Bone Short Sword 
              (Lore, primary/secondary, 1HS, 4/25, wt 6.5, VAH, WAR)<br>
            </p>
            <p><br>
              Find and hail Dronqam Runghi (he can be found in one of the buildings 
              to the right of the palace)</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dronqam Runghi says 'Good day friend! Im glad you've stopped 
                by. I am in need of some assistance. Please direct anyone seeking 
                work to me.</p>
              <p>You say, 'I am looking for work'</p>
              <p>Dronqam Runghi says 'Excellent! I practice the art of alchemy 
                and I am currently working on some new recipes. I require a few 
                special ingredients. Fortunately they grow in the crater just 
                outside our city walls. Bring me a redcapped mushroom, a pinch 
                of scarlet moss and a bluecapped mushroom. I'll be most grateful.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>These can also be found in the pit. (Note: As soon as you go down 
              to the pit walk around where the wall meets the ground and look 
              for the ground spawns. Did not take me to long to find them. The 
              pinch of scarlet moss looks just like the chunk of mud ground spawn.)</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Dronqam Runghi says 'Wonderful! I have little to offer you for 
                your trouble aside from my gratitude. Here is a pinch of acrylia 
                dust. I know it's not much. If you have no need for it go to Mignah, 
                he can always use all kinds of acrylia.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Take the dust and give it to Guard Hebijeb.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p> Khala Dun Hebijeb takes the acrylia dust and places it in a 
                vial already half full of the metal, 'You are nearly finished 
                with the task at hand, Grekas. I now need you to begin your training 
                in the art of blacksmithing, an essential aspect of the life of 
                the Khala Dun. Combine this mold with three metal bits and a flask 
                of water to fashion a buckler frame. When this is done bring it 
                to me with the Crude Bone Short Sword and your initiate's cloak.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Take the mold with the metal bits (<a href="../secrets/smithing_conversions.htm">smithed</a>) 
              and a flask of water and put them all into the forge. Combine them 
              to receive a buckler frame. Trivial is &gt;24 for this combine, 
              and you receive the mold back upon failure. (Note: If you're facing 
              Khala Dun Hebijeb turn to your left, go toward the buildings your 
              facing go into the last one on your right to buy small a piece of 
              ore to make the metal bits with. Then go back to the first building 
              in the row of buildings and go through the door then turn right 
              and go behind the stairs for a forge.)</p>
            <p>Give Khala Dun Hebijeb the buckler frame, your initiate's cloak, 
              and the crude bone short sword:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Khala Dun Hebijeb says 'Your progress pleases our order young 
                one, and I am proud to promote you to the rank of recruit within 
                the Khala Dun. Wear this cloak with pride, ______. I have completed 
                your buckler as well as enhanced your sword. The blade will now 
                be more effective when used against the skeletons from which it 
                was constructed. Show the buckler to Armsman Khaigesh and he will 
                instruct you further.</p>
              <p>Khala Dun Hebijeb shouts 'Fellow citizens of Shar Vahl, help 
                me welcome _____ to the rank of recruit in the honorable Khala 
                Dun. May his actions henceforth reflect the strict sense of loyalty 
                to our king that defines our order. May he exhaust his every resource 
                in glorious defense of our proud people!</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You receive faction, xp, and the following rewards:<br>
              Cloak of the Khala Dun Recruit, lore, no drop, AC 5, 1% blacksmithing 
              modifier, STR 1, HP 1, wt 5.0, VAH WAR<br>
              <br>
              Skeletonbane Short Sword, magic, lore, no drop, 1HS, 4/25, bane 
              vs skeleton 2, wt 5.0, VAH WAR<br>
              <br>
              Buckler of the Recruit, lore, no drop, AC 5, wt 8.0, VAH WAR<br>
            </p>
            <p>Give your buckler to Armsman Khaigesh (he will return it). Make 
              sure to have a container slot free. (Note: Armsman Khaigesh can 
              be found upstairs of the same building with the forge. Go upstairs 
              and around the corner and through the door into the next room.):</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Armsman Khaigesh says 'I can see by your armaments, that Hebijeb 
                has started you along the path of bravery. That's a very good 
                foundation for a young Khala Dun recruit to build upon. Bravery 
                is an important trait, but you will need to learn discipline and 
                patience. The blacksmithing that we do as Khala Dun helps to reinforce 
                and reflect upon those traits. Take this bag and I will help you 
                with your next lesson. </p>
              <p>You say, 'What lesson?'</p>
              <p>Armsman Khaigesh says 'A warrior must learn to be patient and 
                pay attention to detail. Take the bag that I've just given you 
                and fill it with Acrylia flecked nuggets. When hunting the moor, 
                we often found rocks and ore wedged in the shells of the beetles 
                that roam there. Kill the beetles that walk near the city's gates 
                and pry their shells apart. You should be able to gather a decent 
                amount of ore that way. Once you've filled the bag that I've given 
                you, return here with the bag and your Skeletonbane short sword 
                and I'll teach you something new.'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You'll find the acrylia flecked nuggets on rhinobeetles outside 
              the gate in Hollowshade Moor. While you're there, you may want to 
              collect rough ore pieces, as you will need them later. Fill the 
              bag with 8 acrylia flecked nuggets, combine, and hand the result 
              to Armsman Khaigesh.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Armsman Khaigesh grins at you as he takes the items. 'You're 
                scruffy and you smell, but you're a fast enough learner.' He says 
                as he pulls a leather strap out of his waistband and carefully 
                wraps it around the hilt of your sword. He hands the sword back 
                to you hilt first and says, 'Wrapping the hilt in that manners 
                allows you to grip the sword better and hit harder. Take the sword 
                and show it to Noril Galoon. He will instruct you further.'</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You will receive faction, xp and a Leather Gripped Short Sword 
              (lore, magic, no drop, primary/secondary, 1HS, 5/25, bane vs skeletons 
              2, DEX 1, AGI 1, wt 5.0, VAH, WAR)<br>
            </p>
            <p>Noril Galoon can be found in the North side of town in the bridge 
              area.When you enter the gate area from the Arena area turn left 
              and follow the wall till you get to the last building you will see 
              stairs that go up. Once up the steps you will see a guard to your 
              right with another set of stairs that go up. Go up these steps then 
              walk across to your right to the walkway that leads to the next 
              building. Noril will be standing next to the door once you cross 
              the walkway.) Hand him the leather gripped short sword. (He will 
              return it.). Make sure you have a container slot free.<br>
            </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Noril Galoon examines the hilt for a moment and hands the sword 
                back to you. 'This looks like it will work fine.' He says. 'If 
                you are up to doing me a favor, I can teach you how to modify 
                your shield as well. Take this bag and these files and come back 
                to me when you have some spare time and want to learn more about 
                shields.'</p>
              <p>You say, 'I have spare time.'</p>
              <p>Noril Galoon says 'Shields and bucklers are very versatile. They 
                can be used to deflect blows, knock your opponents off balance, 
                and even offer a secondary form of attack. If you want me to help 
                you to modify your shield, I'll need you to gather some rough 
                ore pieces. They can be taken from the rhinobeetles that reside 
                in the moor. Place them in a forge with a flask of water and your 
                set of files to create bolts. Combine the full bag of bolts and 
                return the product and the buckler to me.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If you did not collect rough ore pieces, go back out to Hollowshade 
              Moor and kill more rhinobeetles.</p>
            <p>To construct the bolts, combine 1 rough ore piece and a flask of 
              water in the forge. Once you have filled the bag with 8 bolts, combine 
              and return the result and your buckler to Noril Galoon. Trivial 
              for the combine is 68. (You will receive an upgraded buckler back 
              in a later step)</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Noril Galoon says 'Thanks for the Bag of Bolts Grekas.'</p>
              <p>Noril Galoon says 'Thank you for making those for me. I was almost 
                out. I'll modify your buckler immediately after I finish what 
                I am doing here. Meanwhile, take this shopping list to Friaz. 
                Do what you can to assist her. I need the bag of beetle horns 
                she will give you if I am to work on your shield today.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Noril gives you a shopping list. Bring the list and give it to 
              Friaz - she will add items to the list. Make sure, as usual, to 
              have a container slot free.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Friaz Ompir says 'Ahhh... I see that Noril is trying to get out 
                of work. That lad is a lazy one. Not a problem though... you'll 
                do all the same. Here, let me add a few more things to that list, 
                since you look nice and strong. Take this list and my grocery 
                bag and I'll see about scrounging up the beetle horns that Noril's 
                been bugging me about. '<br>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The shopping will have changed to: 2 Bluetoe Mushrooms, 1 Bottle 
              of Grinning Grimling, 1 Bottle of Rockhopper Red Ale, and 4 Fatty 
              Owlbear Meat. </p>
            <p>Bluetoe Mushrooms are a ground spawn in Paludal Caverns. Enter 
              Paludal Caverns from Hollowshade Moor (when you zone into Hollowshade 
              Moor turn right and follow the wall till you see an outcropping 
              of rocks. This is the zone into Paludal Caverns) After you zone 
              into Paludal Caverns go through the first room once you get to the 
              tunnel. Start searching the white mushroom patches for the Bluetoe 
              mushrooms (there are 4 different patches which seem to contain this 
              ground spawn).<br>
              Fatty Owlbear meat is found on Owlbear cubs in Hollowshade Moor 
              - they look like Owlbear guts. The Grinning Grimling <br>
              can only be bought in Katta Castellum in the bank area at &quot;Nectar

                get these horns himself, but I guess that I can understand what 
                it feels like to be too busy to get everything done. You've been 
                a great help to me today. Give these horns to Noril and tell him

            <p>Take the bag of Beetle Horns and give them to Noril Galoon.</p>
            <p>When you give Noril the Bag of Beetlehorns he gives you back your

            <p>You will receive faction, experience and a Horn Covered Buckler

            <p>Return to Armsman Khaigesh and give him your buckler, sword and

                young warrior. You are well suited to the path of the Khala Dun. 
                Take this new cloak and wear it proudly. You have earned the right

            <p>You will receive experience and the Cloak of the Khala Dun Apprentice

              wt 5.0, VAH WAR)<br>

            <p>Give Khala Dun Kuash (found on the north bridge of Shar Vahl at 
              approximate loc 650, -200) your buckler. Make sure to have an inventory 
              slot free. <i>(DenMother's Note: he returns the buckler to you)</i></p>

              <p>Khala Dun Kuash says 'You must think you're pretty tough wearin 
                a buckler like that, eh? Well well... Perhaps you're looking to 
                hunt some bigger game, eh? Earn a little scruff on your ears like 
                Kuash? I thought so. I know a good place for you to start... and 
                it's part of your civil duty. Our scouts have always had trouble 
                with the wolves in the moor. I'm thinkin that you can start there. 
                Maybe break in a few of the younger wolves' paws, eh? I thought 
                so. Put your buckler back on and take this bag. Fill it with wolf 
                paws and bring it back to me. Maybe then I'll give you a real 
                challenge.' </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Note: The Paws you are after are called &quot;wolf cub paws&quot; 
              and are no drop items. They can be found on any wandering sonic 
              wolf type (not the ones in the caves). Fill the bag with the paws, 
              press combine, and return the result to Khala Dun Kuash.</p>

              <p>Khala Dun Kuash says 'Well, you're beginning to scare me you're 
                so tough! Just pullin your tail. Those were some scary beasts, 
                eh? I thought so. I've got a dagger that helps me to deal with 
                them. It's made in a special way to hurt the wolves more than 
                usual. If you want one, you're going to need to make your own. 
                I still got the molds that I used when I was craftin blades for 
                people. If you run this status report to Bookkeeper Leaha in the 
                Grunt Forest outpost for me, I'll go by my house and get the molds 
                for you. Sound like a deal? I thought so.<br>

              <p>Bookkeeper Leaha says 'What's this? Why was Kuash unable to bring 
                this to me himself? Oh, never mind... he's not worth the aggravation 
                at this point. Run this report to Hollowshade and have Guard Kliknaw 
                sign it as well. Then take it back to whomever you got it from... 
                and tell that particular whomever to stop slacking. It's not proper 
                for a citizen to act like that... let alone a Khala Dun. <br>

                later he says, 'I'm pretty sure that they're all here. Just take 
                this back and act like your didn't just see that.' He winks and 
                hands you the report.<br>

            <p>Bring the report back to Khala Dun Kuash.</p>

              <p>Khala Dun Kuash says 'Thank you very much. I see you got it all 
                filled out. I gathered up all of those molds for you while you 
                were gone. You can even have this old hilt that I found with them. 
                Make sure you keep them in a safe place. You're going to need 
                them and the books that the book fellow Qua sells. He's got a 
                bunch of them and a kit that you'll need. When you get done with 
                makin your dagger, bring it back by here with your cloak and I'll 
                show you a surprise! <br>

            <p> When you turn the note back into Khala Dun Kuash he gives you 
              the no drop blade mold, claw mold and hilt. The blade and claw molds 
              are returned on a combine. The hilt is used only for your own personal
