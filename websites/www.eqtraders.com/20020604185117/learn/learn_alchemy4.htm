            <h3>A Brief History of Alchemy </h3>
            <p><i>- by Verdandi Snowblood</i></p>
            <p>In the beginning, there were two kinds of herb vendors. One was 
              found in some shaman cities and had a set of herbs that each could 
              be combined with a different dropped item, like a rat ear or undead 
              froglok tongue. The other type of vendor was the gypsy vendors, 
              found in gypsy camps across Antonica. They had a different, smaller 
              set of herbs that each also could be combined with a different kind 
              of dropped giant toe to make other potions.</p>
            <p>However, shaman guild trainers across Norrath refused to train their pupils in the fine art of alchemy. It was well nigh a year before they received their instructions from On High ensuring that they would finally consent to teach us the fundamentals of alchemy.  The herbs and potions at the time also were extremely expensive and of very limited usefulness. (One of them with an herb cost of more than 30pp and requiring a drop from the Plane of Hate had the oh-so-powerful effect of Endure Magic.) Therefore, when our guildmasters were fixed so that we could train, our line of potions available was completely changed in the revamp.</p>
            <p>All of the old shaman city vendor herbs were 
              removed entirely, effectively removing access to those potions. 
              Only the gypsy vendors remained and their potions continued to work. 
              In the cities, the old herb vendors were replaced by a whole new 
              set of herbs that took up two vendors because there were so many. 
              These are the herbs that are most familiar to folks nowadays, the 
              ones that can make sow potions and invis to undead potions. For 
              these potions, no dropped component is required, they are made entirely 
              via herbs bought from the vendors.</p>
            <p>Thus the world remained, with Revamp Alchemy and Gypsy Alchemy 
              composing the entire line of alchemy available. Until Luclin.</p>
            <p>With the advent of Luclin two additional sets of potions were added 
              to a shaman's menu. First was a whole new set of potions with brand 
              new effects. These include the mana potions and grow potion. These 
              herbs are available in a few different places, all in Luclin. The 
              other set of potions...well, shamans exploring Shar Vahl came across 
              these strange herbs with naggingly familiar names...until it 
              hit them. Old Alchemy. Now available in Shar Vahl are the herbs 
              used to make potions from the old, original, pre-revamp alchemy. 
              These are the ones that required the drops like rat ears and undead 
              froglok tongues. </p>
            <p> 
            <p>And this is where it stands, with four lines of alchemy potions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Old Alchemy (requires dropped ingredients, herbs only found 
                in Shar Vahl)</li>
              <li> Gypsy Alchemy (requires dropped ingredients, herbs only found 
                on gypsies)</li>
              <li> Revamp Alchemy (no dropped ingredients, herbs found in many 
                places)</li>
              <li> Luclin Alchemy (no dropped ingredients, herbs found only on 
                Luclin)</li>
            </ol>
            <p> </p>
