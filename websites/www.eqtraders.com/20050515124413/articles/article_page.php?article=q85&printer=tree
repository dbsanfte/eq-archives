<p>
<p>
<i>This is one of several youngling armor quests originating in Kaladim. All armor pieces are lore (except bracer), no drop, DWF/WAR only. They are no-fail smithing combines. The armor is gold in color. Please note that while the bracers are not lore, the bracer materials often are, so make your first bracer before you get the parts for a second one </i>
