<br />
Backflagging * <br />
----------------------------- <br />
<br />
As you know, when a guild gains or loses members, they often find themselves dedicating a large amount of time re-playing content that they have long since completed in order to gain access to zones for newer members. During our Community Summit this last summer, and in many subsequent discussions, we have heard the recurring desire to find a way to ease the frustrations associated with this backflagging. <br />
<br />
While the issue is not as simple as removing flags altogether (we feel flags are necessary for the zones they are currently attached to), we have looked into ways that we can reduce the frustrations of backflagging and feel that we have arrived at a fair and equitable solution, which is detailed below. <br />
<br />
- A new implementation of the 85/15 rule has been introduced into Planes of Power zones including the Plane of Time. This should resolve the outstanding problems that occur from time to time with the current 85/15 implementation. <br />
<br />
- The new 85/15 has also been introduced for the locked zones in Gates of Discord. <br />
<br />
- An alternate means of flagging guild mates for locked content in Planes of Power and Gates of Discord has been implemented that will allow you to flag raid members for the zone you are in by completing raid content within that zone. <br />
<br />
The implementation varies slightly from zone to zone to fit the story and nature of the zone, but in general will involve killing a raid target within that zone, looting an item, and completing a single group quest to change that item into a zone flag. This only applies to zones that don´t already have a single group task or system to gain access. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AA Changes <br />
----------------------------- <br />
<br />
- Reduced the cost of many Gates AAs. Players will receive a refund equal to the difference on AAs that now have a lower cost. * <br />
<br />
- Changed the monk AA Crippling Strike to an activated ability that does an eagle strike attack as well as a snare. <br />
<br />
- Changed the monk AA Stunning Kick to an activated ability that does a round kick attack as well as a stun. <br />
<br />
- Changed the monk AA Eye Gouge to an activated ability that does a tiger claw attack as well as reduces the targets offensive ability. <br />
<br />
- Due to major changes in how these work, AA points for Crippling Strike, Stunning Kick, and Eye Gouge have been refunded. <br />
<br />
- Reduced the reuse time of the Ranger AAs Frost Arrow and Flame Arrow to 3 minutes. * <br />
<br />
- Hobble of Spirits will now stack with the Beastlord´s proc buffs. * <br />
<br />
- Fixed problem with the Beastlord AA Bestial Alignment where if you had maxed buffs this AA would not reset if it did not take. <br />
<br />
- Duration enhancement focuses and AAs should now increase the duration of pet buffs. <br />
<br />
- If your stored AA´s go above 30, they will no longer be set to 30 when you zone. However, you should still not be able to gain more than 30 unless you get a refund, get the AA from a GM, or get an AA from a script. * <br />
<br />
- Fixed an issue with Half Elf Paladins of Tunare and the Origin AA. * <br />
<br />
- If your character was created before EQ started storing starting location data, when you log into the game you will now be prompted to choose your home city from a list of valid starting locations for your character. You will only need to do this once and once this has been set, it cannot be changed. This will correct the problems with the Origin AA not returning some characters to their expected home city. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zone and NPC Changes <br />
----------------------------- <br />
<br />
- Hot Spots have been moved (level ranges are approximate): * <br />
Shadeweaver´s Thicket 1-30 <br />
Kurn´s Tower 10-25 <br />
Unrest 15-30 <br />
Crystal Caverns 25-35 <br />
Solusek´s Eye 25-45 <br />
Katta Castellum 30-60 <br />
Lower Guk 35-55 <br />
Nagafen´s Lair 40-55 <br />
Umbral Plains 50-60 <br />
<br />
- Respawn time for the bosses in Tacvi has been increased from 3 to 5 days. <br />
<br />
- Some Tacvi loot has been upgraded. Bosses now drop more items per kill and some all new items have been added to the zone. * <br />
<br />
- An alternate entrance into Tacvi has been added in Txevu that will allow guilds to bypass the Zun´Muram after they have defeated him at least once. Guilds that have previously defeated the Zun´Muram will need to do so at least once more before they can use the new entrance. * <br />
<br />
- Gilipus of Ak´Anon has joined the Beta Neutral Faction. You will now be able to complete his quest without having to raise Gem Choppers Faction. <br />
<br />
- The 3 Tormentors in the Jelvan event now share hatelist when idle or aggro. Anyone that is on one Tormentor´s hatelist, but not on the other 2 Tormentor´s hatelist will be added. This should make it difficult (if not impossible) to avoid AOEs. <br />
<br />
- Modified the Warden Hanvar event, all guards should appear in their appointed places. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug in Anguish that could make Warden Hanvar unkillable. <br />
<br />
- Clicking on the door to Anguish while having the Seal: Mastery of All on your person will now prompt red text indicating your flag has been granted. <br />

- The respawn of Globes of Discordant Energy are now tracked on the event timer for Anguish. The method for obtaining the Globes has not changed. <br />
<br />
- The pile of stones that was used as a secondary zone between Dranik and Bloodfields has been removed. There is now an actual zoneline there. <br />
<br />
- Plane of Justice - previously, you could not click the red teleports to leave the Seventh Hammer´s room unless the Seventh Hammer was dead (or not up). This has been changed so you can leave the room as long as it is not aggro. If you click on a portal while he is aggro, you should get a message and remain in the room. <br />
<br />
- Grennet Stormhand in North Qeynos is no longer a task master since he is part of a quest. His task master job has been taken over by Jorren Boxmover. <br />
<br />
- Increased the maximum duration for all Labyrinth Trials from 1 hour to 2 hours. When an event is successfully completed, the instance will shut down in 30 minutes. If it is failed, the instance will shut down in 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
- Changed the reclusive Girplan event in Bloodfields so that each NPC in the sequence stays up for 15 minutes instead of 3 minutes before depopping. <br />
<br />
- Elemental NPCs are once again Charmable in Bastion of Thunder. <br />
<br />

----------------------------- <br />
<br />

<br />
- Fixed a bug with the Frenzy of Conquest benefit. <br />

<br />
- The spell Nature´s Blight was not increasing the damage as stated and should be working as intended now. * <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug with haste items and haste augments. Their effects were stacking when they shouldn´t have. It will now only take the greatest haste effect from the item including augments. <br />
<br />
- When combining the aegis of chaotic worship with the soul temper and a flask of water, you will receive the temper and the aegis of chaotic worship back if you don´t have the correct flags instead of just the aegis back. <br />

<br />

Incorporeal * of the Specter <br />
Mucus-Drenched * <br />
Immortal´s Bloodied * <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous <br />
----------------------------- <br />
<br />
- Multiple procs on a pet are now working properly. * <br />
<br />
- A resource leak in the graphics engine was corrected and we have seen a measurable improvement in client stability as a result. <br />
<br />

<br />
- Animated traps such as the ones in soldunga/b are now detected by the collision system and will cause a small amount of damage. <br />
<br />
- You can once again target things on the other side of a water surface and other passable surfaces. <br />
<br />
- Added code to check and validate specialization skills. If the values are not legal, the player will be informed why they are not legal and they are reset. <br />
<br />
- Added popup confirmation dialog when you attempt to give an augmented item to an NPC. * <br />
<br />
- Added optional parameters to /book command -- /book open, /book close. * <br />
<br />
- Fixed bug where a player who had more than 2 million plat in his inventory was unable to purchase anything from a vendor or trader. <br />
<br />
- /yell messages are no longer displayed if the yelling player is in your ignore list. * <br />
<br />
- Some models that were scaled dramatically could cause the collision system to fail, resulting in warps to ceiling and other strange side effects. For example the vases in dranikcatacombsa at 1000,-1011, 0 would always cause players to be pinned to the ceiling due to this bug. <br />
<br />
- Players standing on the lip of an edge should now slide down off them more smoothly. <br />
<br />
- There have been some optimizations to the collision system. You should see improved performance in zones with very large stationary objects (potimea, bloodfields, etc). <br />
<br />
- Fixed a number of small bugs in the zoom camera behavior. These fixes include removing the possibility of having the first mousewheel click causing the camera to bounce back into first person, a bug that could cause the camera to get stuck one click out of first person, as well as smoothing out the camera motion a bit. <br />
<br />
- Scrolling to third person and tabbing to another window should no longer cause the screen to bounce back and forth. <br />
<br />
- Summoning mounts in certain places should no longer cause players to fall through geometry. <br />
<br />

<br />
- Players should no longer experience 20k falls when standing on cliff edges while suffering from low frame rate. <br />
<br />
- The bounding radius for small races was too tall, preventing them from accessing some areas. For example, gnomes couldn´t enter the small huts in Steamfont. This was a global problem that is now fixed; that is just one example. <br />
<br />
- Weather effects are now working properly when the Wake of Karana spell is used. Additionally, sounds related to starting <br />
<br />
- /who commands now display both class title and base class name for players over level 50, e.g. ¨Bedazzler (Enchanter)¨ * <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that caused a lot of writing to the dbg.txt file during a raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zone Revamps - Mistmoore (Legends) <br />
----------------------- <br />
<br />
In Mistmoore´s Catacombs, the servants of the Trueborn, a sect of vampires with Mayong Mistmoore´s blood flowing through their veins, grew tired of their masters throwing them into the fray against the Norrathian intruders. They came to desire more power for themselves. <br />
<br />
It was not long before the first words of dissension crept through the catacombs on the will of whispers. The Trueborn servants congregated in dark, musty halls away from the eyes of their masters and over time their numbers grew along with their ambitions. Their time had come and soon they would rise up to claim their rightful place in Mistmoore Castle, gaining accolades from Lord Mayong Mistmoore himself for their brilliance and bravery -- or so they supposed. <br />
<br />
Over several months, the Trueborn traitors recruited an army to their cause. On a black night as the moon was swallowed by a thick veil over Faydwer, they struck, killing their masters and leading their army toward Mistmoore Castle. They slaughtered all in their path and many masters of the Scions sect, the Trueborn´s rival blood-children of Mayong, were destroyed that night. <br />
<br />
The fierce wave of the lesser Trueborn rushed into the cellars of Mistmoore Castle without detection. Unbeknownst to all but the servants, Norrath´s adventurers had uncovered winding caves beneath the surface that bypassed the castles defenses. In a matter of hours, the castle was overrun and the servants of the Trueborn declared themselves the true Children of Mistmoore. <br />
<br />
Since taking control of the castle, many Children have busied themselves repairing the damage from the battle while others continue to seek the magical ore that was uncovered in the catacombs. <br />
<br />
They all prepare, waiting for the day their master returns to grant them glory. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zone Revamps - Splitpaw (Legends) <br />
----------------------- <br />
<br />
Farsoth Mal, son of the Ishva Mal, leader of the Verishe Mal tribe, sat by his fathers side watching him rule his minions in Splitpaw Lair. His father may have conquered this lair some years ago, but Farsoth believed they should rule far more than just one underground kingdom. He grew to despise his father for his lack of ambition and many hours were spent in bitter arguments between the two. The Ishva Mal grew tired and angry at the ceaseless challenges to his authority, gaining as much contempt for his son as his son had for him. <br />
<br />
During a particularly heated argument of growls and grisly barks, the Ishva Mal reminded his willful son that his power was absolute and that he shared his throne with no one. With one quick motion, the Ishva Mal brandished his spear and sliced off his son´s paw, determined that he would finally win the respect he deserved from his son. But the Ishva Mal´s cruel methods would prove to be his downfall. <br />
<br />
The Ishva Mal grew to be a greater tyrant each day, so much so that the Verishe Mal mages and warriors secretly formed the Council of Nine to challenge his rule. Farsoth saw the plans the Verishe Mal had in store for his father, but did nothing to stop them and instead chose to use them to his advantage. <br />
<br />
Farsoth learned much from the council´s mages and became obsessed with the summoning arts they practiced. His fascination eventually led to a plan that would secure the throne . . . for him. <br />
<br />
Through all he´d learned from the Verishe Mal mages, he believed he could summon a powerful entity from the Plane of Fire itself. Farsoth thought with such power at his side, nothing could stop him from ruling the Splitpaw Lair and any lands he desired. <br />
<br />
He prepared for weeks, researching and gathering the reagents he required and finally he set to work to summon a terrible beast to bring an end to his father´s rule. <br />
<br />
Farsoth was distracted by his own anger, forgetting vital components as he wove the spell and the unthinkable happened. Flames shot out of the portal that Farsoth opened and, at the same time, rocks rained down upon the inhabitants of the lair. Then, the portal shifted its focus and water flooded into the corridors, extinguishing the flames and washing away the rocks. The portal shimmered once more and waves of all types of elementals poured into Splitpaw. <br />
<br />
Farsoth certainly attained part of his goal. His father was killed, but so to were most of the gnolls he wished to lead to greatness. <br />
<br />
Now he is a prisoner to the swarms of enraged elementals that have made Splitpaw Lair their new home. <br />

It's been a little hectic around here lately, with all the Live, Legends and expansion work going on.  We're busy in that good way, where you get a lot done every day but tomorrow there's just as much to do.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
New adventure unearthed in Lavastorm!  In the depths of the Lavastorm mountains there is only one ruler.  But even his burning breath and power have their limits.  Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach.  These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden.  Some say that he's already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value.  Other say that he couldn't have carried it all off by himself.  But most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted.  Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories?<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
New fletching recipes will be added.  We're adding a few new fletching recipes.  The resultant items will only be usable by Rangers that worship Karana, and will be comparable to their Tunare counterparts.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Guktan Illusion will be implemented.  Yup, the long-awaited new illusions will be available.  While the old Illusion: Froglok spell is just as popular as ever, folks have been asking for an illusion based on the new Froglok models.  After our next update, both will be available.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Adding summoned Burning Affliction items to the Magician's arsenal.  Four new summoned items with the new Burning Affliction focus ability will be introduced.  This rounds out the Magician's ability to create summoned focus items.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
UPDATE:  Well, one of the hazards of trying to talk about what will happen in the future is that someone will make a mistake.  This time it was me.  The upcoming update on August 6th will not include any code changes.  We hope to update again at the end of the month with the code changes that will move the features listed below to the Live servers.  I'm sorry for the mistake. - Alan<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We will be adding platinum to the Shared Bank.  In order to allow folks to transfer money between characters on the same account in the same way that they can now transfer items, we will be adding a spot in the Shared Bank for placing platinum. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
New filters and chat message options will be added.  We have separated pet melee messages into their own category.  You will be able to send them to whichever chat window you want, or filter them out completely in the Options window.  We have also added the ability to send /random messages to any chat window you'd like.  There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, you can't claim that you didn't see the /random that you lost just to force a re-roll).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
/memspellset command will be added.  This new command will allow you to memorize the spell set you indicate (using the corresponding number) from the command line or from a hot button.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week.<br />

<br />
By now, you've probably heard that we're working on our next expansion, The Lost Dungeons of Norrath. We're attempting some interesting new technology and some awesome new design ideas. Keep your eyes open for website updates about that. <br />
<br />
But, this column isn't about expansions, it's about upcoming Live features, and we have plenty of them for you this month. <br />
<br />
We've been working on a lot of zone revamps, both partial and more complete. Nine zones were updated this month for Live servers, and Legends will be getting a new revamp as well. That's a lot of zones! We're addressing issues in those zones that players have had concerns about, with the intent to make them a little more interesting and desirable to play in. Check them out; we think you'll like what we've done with the zones. <br />
<br />
Oh, and for those of you that celebrate Independence Day, have a safe and explosive 4th! <br />
<br />
Several partial zone revamps coming to the Live servers. Droga and Nurga will be moving from Legends to the Live servers with our next update. Along with those zones, we have completed partial revamps of several other zones: The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and Velketor's Labyrinth. We chose these zones to update based on feedback from players, and have implemented changes that will make these zones more entertaining to play in. If you haven't been to one of these zones in a while, you may want to go back and revisit them after our next update. <br />
<br />
Grieg's End changes going to the Legends server. Grieg's End is one of the more interesting zones in EverQuest, but the original design made pursuing the content in this zone a bit complicated. The redesign includes new encounters, items, traps, and events that make the zone a challenge for the experience group, with plenty of events for a raid group. These changes will revitalize this zone and should make it one of the more popular places for characters of the appropriate level to visit. <br />
<br />
Tradeskill trivial failures will be reduced. Obviously even a great master can make mistakes. EverQuest players, however, have expressed that they feel master tradeskillers fail on trivial items too frequently. We have reviewed the trivial failure chances and have made a change to the way they work. The greater the skill of the character relative to the skill needed to complete a recipe; the less likely he is to fail on a trivial recipe. <br />
<br />
Damage Over Time Spell Foci update. We have implemented a change to focus items for Damage over Time (DoT) spells. Focus items improve aspects of certain spells when they are cast. Originally, DoT spells were included in a group of other spells that some focus items affected. But the nature of DoT spells is very different than other spells, and the affect of these focus items on DoT spells was not what we wanted it to be. To correct this, we have changed the Extended Affliction line to Burning Affliction, which cause DoT spells to do more damage, instead of having a longer duration. <br />
<br />
New Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells will be introduced. Certain trade skill recipes rely on magic spells used to make normal items into magical items. To make creating these magical items a little more convenient, we will be introducing new Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells that create five magical items rather than just one. These spells require five components and take longer to cast and use more mana, but they should make creating these items much more convenient. <br />
<br />
Newbie quests will be added for Erudites, Trolls and Ogres. New characters, especially if played by new players, need some time to get acquainted with the area surrounding their starting city. One of the best ways to get those characters out into the world is to send them on quests. We have been introducing new quests for new characters to each of the starting cities. The next update will include quests for young Trolls beginning in Neriak, Ogres in Oggok and for Erudites starting out in Erudin, completing the updated newbie quests for all races. <br />
<br />
Area of Effect spells that do not affect your group in PvP will also not affect your Raid. Taking on large tasks on a PvP server can be complicated by the fact that Area of Effect spells damage your own raid and not just the monsters. It makes sense that since these spells do not affect your group on a PvP server, they should not affect your raid. <br />
<br />
We've updated character creation descriptions. Players will now be able to right-click the class, race or statistic buttons during character creation to see a detailed explanation of the item clicked. This will help folks when making decisions about what they want their character to be. <br />
<br />
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week. <br />

------------------------------ <br />
<br />
** Experience System Change - Grouping ** <br />
<br />
We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in EverQuest. These improvements are aimed at positively reinforcing the act of grouping. After all, this is a Massively Multiplayer game. <br />
<br />
Prior to this update groups gained a 2% to 20% experience bonus for having two to six members. <br />
<br />
As of today this bonus has increased to range from 20% to 80% for having two to five members. When a group adds a sixth member, the 80% bonus remains, but the experience gained is only divided by 5 before being distributed. The sixth group member no longer causes the experience gain to be divided by 6. <br />
<br />
Planes of Power zones had an increased experience award above and beyond those of most other zones. Because of these new dramatic improvements to group experience gains, we will be reducing the zone-specific experience bonus for Planes of Power zones a bit. As long as character is grouped with at least one other in these zones, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one down side to the new system is that there will be a small decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in Planes of Power zones. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Experience System Change - Level 60+ ** <br />
<br />
In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC levels that give a character experience after they reach level 60. This will open up many of the "old world" zones to players previously restricted to Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of NPCs that will be "blue" to a level 65 character has been increased as far as level 50, with the "light blue" range extending to level 45. The best experience gains, however, are still for fighting things around and above your level. This should open up areas for high level characters in groups and solo. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface ** <br />
<br />
- Shared Bank Vault - We've added two shared bank slots to the interface. These extra bank slots can be accessed by any character on the same account and server. No-Drop and No Rent items can't be placed in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist in the shared bank at any time. <br />
<br />
- Spell Context Menus - This is a new interface menu that will make memorizing spells less tedious. To access the spell menu, just right-click an empty spell gem. This will open a list of spell categories. Point your mouse at a category and a list of spells will be displayed. Select a spell from that list to memorize it in that slot. Your character will sit down, memorize the spell and stand back up. <br />
<br />
- Spell Favorites - Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a full set of eight spells without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking on the spellbook icon in your spell window will open up the spell favorites menu. You will be able to save your current spell lineup as a favorite, delete a favorite or memorize all the spells in one of your already saved spell sets. You can save as many as ten sets of spell favorites. As with the new spell context menus mentioned above, this will not replace the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large numbers of spells more convenient. <br />
<br />
- Spell Descriptions - We have expanded the spell description window. Along with the information that has always been available, we have added an explanation about what the spell does in general that includes damage and duration when appropriate. You can see these new descriptions by right-clicking and holding on the spell scroll, the spell gem in your Spells window, or the spell icon in your spellbook. <br />
<br />
- New Camera - We've added a new camera mode to the game. Lovingly dubbed the EQ Cam, it uses the mouse wheel to allow you to zoom away from your character into a "chase" camera. This only works from first person mode (the default view). Using the mouse wheel you can determine the distance of the camera from your character, or to zoom back into first person mode. When in the chase mode, mouselook turns the character and camera together and you can change the pitch of the camera using the mouse. <br />
<br />
- NPC Names - Many NPCs will be displaying additional titles to make it clearer what their job is. For example, an NPC that sells tailoring supplies may have the title [Tailor Supplies] under their name. This will help folks find the proper merchant. It's analogous to them hanging out their shingle. <br />
<br />
- Rare Character Select Crash - Using the arrow keys to try to change the selected character at the character select screen when there were no characters on the account was causing people to crash out of the game. That's fixed now. <br />
<br />
- Guild Message of the Day - Using certain HTML codes when setting up a Guild Message of the Day was causing all members of the guild to crash. While this may have been amusing for pranks on your guild, we still decided to fix it. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- Spell level limits now enforced - Some high level spells cannot be cast on characters under a certain level. In the past a caster could get around this level restriction when casting a group version of a spell by targeting a higher level group member, and the spell would take effect on the whole group, regardless of their level. That loophole has been closed. We're sorry if you have grown accustomed to the system working this way, but those level restrictions are important to the integrity of lower level gameplay. <br />
<br />
- Incineration and Conglaciation of Bones - Both of these spells should now crit and stack (when cast by different casters). <br />
<br />
- Divine Intervention - This spell should now be reporting the amount of healing it delivers. <br />
<br />
- Healing Messages - The target of a healing spell will now get a message telling them the caster's name and the amount of healing they receive. <br />
<br />
- Reporting Damage Over Time - Damage over Time (DoT) done to NPCs will now be reported to the caster every time it does damage. These messages can be filtered in the Options window. <br />
<br />
- Boon of the Garou - The level restriction for this spell has been removed. We have also fixed a bug with the spell that would prevent it from being cast on target that are not on a horse if the enchanter is on horseback (spell still cannot affect those on horseback). <br />
<br />
- Wake of Karana - To improve the usefulness of this spell, we have lowered the recast time from 90 seconds to 15 seconds. <br />
<br />
- Beastlord Warders - Beastlords will once again be able to summon their warders in the Plane of Sky. Sorry for the delay in getting this one fixed properly. <br />
<br />
- Familiars - Familiars will no longer attempt to equip items. This was causing them to try to wear weapons inside their heads, which probably isn't a good thing for them to do. <br />
<br />
- Spirit spell line - We have added +75 dexterity to the effects of Spirit of Flame, Spirit of Rellic, and Spirit of Snow. <br />
<br />
- Spell stacking and blocking - Changed the following spell lines to cause them to bounce off of each other. Each line should block everything from the other line, but still be overwritten by spells of the same line. <br />
<br />
Spiritual Strength <br />
Spiritual Brawn <br />
Spiritual Vigor <br />
<br />
Strength of Tunare <br />
Strength of Nature <br />
<br />
Brell's Mountainous Barrier <br />
Brell's Stalwart Shield <br />
Brell's Steadfast Aegis <br />
<br />
- Translocation spells - Fixed a bug with translocation spells. If a second translocation spell was cast on a character before he had accepted the first, both would fail. <br />
<br />
- Spell casting pets - In the past, pets were restricted to casting spells of level 20 and below. We have given them access to higher level spells. You may want to be careful with them until you get used to their new abilities. <br />
<br />
- Drunken Riders - We fixed an odd bug that allowed people who were extremely drunk to cast spells without mana cost while on a horse. Yes, crazy bugs like that actually happen.  <br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones ** <br />
<br />
- Droga and Nurga - The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by crafty Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and slaving away under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign for these zones are now on the Legends server, Stormhammer. The mines of Nurga are a fun zone for characters of levels about 40 to 55. The Temple of Droga accommodates characters around 50th to 65th level. Both zones will have some new events and quest, while retaining the distinct feel of the zones. <br />
<br />
- Veksar - Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there have been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of those rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the insular Iksar is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is about a city that lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was called Veksar, and it is up to you to discover the tale of its fate. <br />
<br />
- Planes of Power access - Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play with their friends and guild mates. <br />
<br />
To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement: <br />
<br />
Level 55 and over <br />
Plane of Storms <br />
Plane of Torment <br />
Plane of Valor <br />
Crypt of Decay <br />
<br />
Level 62 and over <br />
Bastion of Thunder <br />
Halls of Honor <br />
<br />
Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter these zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring additional unflagged or lower level characters with them. All other planes with flag or story requirements for entry will still require those flags, and those flags can still be obtained as they always have. <br />
<br />
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to travel and adventure together in the planes. We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, in the form of a nice Charm slot item and Alternate Advancement points based on the number of planes you've gained access to. <br />
<br />
The reward for planar progression will be available this week. We found an issue with part of the reward on Test server, and are in the process of fixing it. This is a top priority and we plan to bring it to all live servers this week. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Great Divide - The Plane of Knowledge portal in the Great Divide will now be available when the Ring War is in progress. <br />
<br />
- Bastion of Thunder - We have upgraded the loot available from many of the mini-bosses in the Bastion of Thunder to make the reward more inline with the risk. <br />
<br />
- Sol Ro's Tower - They look like frogs, hop like frogs and now they even react to spells like frogs. Flame Frogs are now flagged as animals. <br />
<br />
- Rallos Zek encounter - Rallos Zek will remove anyone from the zone that attacks him if they are not part of the raid that has him engaged. Even in war, there are rules to be followed. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- Tradeskill item flag - There is a new flag on items. When viewing the information about an item, if you see that it has a Tradeskill flag, it is an item that can be used in a tradeskill recipe. This isn't to clearly spell out every item that is used in every tradeskill recipe. The intent is to assist those who are finding items that do not already have an obvious use, by letting them know that the item is used in a tradeskill recipe, somewhere. <br />
<br />
- LoY "Fine Steel" - Many of the more commonly dropped weapons in the Legacy of Ykesha zones were a bit too powerful for the ease and level needed to get them. Some of the most out of line items were the Harpoon, Luggald Trident, and Luggald Dagger. We've decided that it is necessary to tune them down a bit. <br />
<br />
- The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk - This is the old Acrylia key. It has been changed into a charm. This charm can be used by anyone, not just those that own LoY. <br />
<br />
- Bows - The Longbow of the Grimlings and the Bow of Gloaming have both been given ranges. They can now be used properly. <br />
<br />
- The Burning Flame Shield - This item had the wrong resist modifiers. It now has a +30 fire resistance and a -10 cold resistance. <br />
<br />
- Bazaar Search - Non-instrument items with instrument modifiers will now show up in instrument type searches in the Bazaar. <br />
<br />
- Ornate Stone Medicine Totem - This item can now be equipped. <br />
<br />
- Storm Reaper Thorn Machete - This newbie Halfling quest weapon is now flagged as magical. <br />
<br />
- Charm of the Brotherhood - This item will now give a bonus when grouped with others of either the same class or race. <br />
<br />
- Dagger of Distraction - This item can no longer be used by Monks. <br />
<br />
- Edge of Eternity - Beastlords and monks can no longer use this item. <br />
<br />
- Veil of Lost Hopes and Orb of Clinging Death - The casting times on both of these items has been lowered. <br />
<br />
- Magi`Kot's Pants of Convergence - The effect on this item has been changed to summon a Rod of Mystical Transvergance. <br />
<br />
- Cloak of the Falling Skies - The focus effect this item has changed to Preservation of Solusek <br />
<br />
- The Wristguard of Keen Vision - This item is now useable by int. casters. <br />
<br />
- The Mask of Conceptual Energy - This item is now useable by priests. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Lifeburn - This ability would cause an undue amount of aggro to be generated because it would bring the caster to an extremely low number of hit points, making them look like tasty targets to enemies nearby. To lessen this problem, Lifeburn will no longer reduce the caster to 10 hit points, but to about one fourth of the caster's hit points. This should prevent the additional agro generated while retaining the risk for using the ability. <br />
<br />
- Feigned Minion - The Child of Bertoxxulous pet will no longer cast buff spells to break his feign when under the Feigned Minion effect. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests and Tradeskills ** <br />
<br />
- Bankers - There were a few quests that required giving an item to a banker. When we recently removed the ability for characters to give items to bankers to help prevent mistakenly losing items, those quests became unavailable. We have moved those quests to new NPCs. If you see any other quests that ask you to give something to a banker, please use /bug and report it to us. <br />
<br />
- Newly Stackable Items - Valor Crystals, Ceramic Linings, Holgresh Fur and Casks are now stackable. Also, Valor Crystals can be sold to vendors. <br />
<br />
- Sewer Catfish - These unappetizing fish have begun to appear in Cabilis. <br />
<br />
- Klok Foob - Will now accept a Catfish Croak Sandwich. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Changes for New Characters ** <br />
<br />
- Newbie Starting Locations - We've modified all locations where new characters start to make them a bit more convenient for the new player. They should all start very near their guild masters. <br />
<br />
- Nudging - New characters will be given a text message to encourage them to hand in their newbie note to their guild master. For new players, this is one of the key things to get them involved in gameplay, and one of the easiest to overlook. <br />
<br />
- Guild Masters - To help guide new characters, Guild Masters now take a more active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to some starting points for quests. <br />
<br />
- Quests - There are even more quests in the newbie zones, most of them revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even the grandest cities. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />
<br />
- We are working on an update to the Luclin player character model animations. This will not be a complete revamp of all the animations, but will address some of the most common concerns. However, in the mean time you may see some unusual animations, particularly when shorter PCs are running. <br />
<br />
<br />
** UI File Changes ** <br />
<br />
NOTE: In order to see the new Shared Bank slots, you will need to use the default bank window, or modify your custom bank window to include the new slots. <br />
