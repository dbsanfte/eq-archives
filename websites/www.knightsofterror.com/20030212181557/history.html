          <p align="left"><font color="#CCCCCC">Formed by Chance Nifield in November 
            of 1994 in a text based game called MajorMud, the Knights of Terror 
            have always been a force to be reckoned with. From the start KoT was 
            a purely evil PK guild based on mass destruction. They hunted down 
            and slayed any player character that was not affiliated with them, 
            be it for gold, items, or merely for satisfaction. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#CCCCCC">The foundation for the Knights 
            of Terror was built on real-life friendships that grew into online 
            chaos. Lord Sandraxys Blackfire, the first ever member of the KoT, 
            was a co-founder and to this day one of Chance Nifield's closest friends. 
            Unfortunately Sandraxys had not been part of the KoT online organization 
            since the days of MajorMud back in 1995. He returned to battlefield 
            as a KoT General in Dark Age of Camelot.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#CCCCCC"> From MajorMud the KoT moved to 
            circle muds, and then on to Diablo where they hassled, killed, and 
            thieved from other players that had no knowledge of how terrible KoT 
            could be. A number of months passed in Diablo and day after day, people 
            like Gotham Grock, Braylor Hawkes, and Saradon Warchild were spreading 
            fear throughout the land and making one hell of a name for the Knights 
            of Terror. To this day KoT members names can be found on wanted lists 
            from Diablo1.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#CCCCCC">In 1997 things took a big turn 
            for the Knights of Terror as Ultima Online was introduced to the gaming 
            community. On release of this new more global scaled world, the KoT 
            worked hard and dedicated a lot of time into learning how to use this 
            new playing field to their advantage. They finally settled on one 
            of the northern islands of the Ultima Online world, and met some of 
            the most loyal members they ever would come by. Shotcaller, Shade, 
            Naf, and Red Talon, were some of these new KoT eager to spill blood 
            and make sure no one felt safe on what we called "KoT Island". Stockpiling 
            boats and boat keys, armor and weapons, we built a legacy on that 
            island. As the months went on more and more people came to fight us, 
            and more and more people died. Eventually as members tired of the 
            game and stopped playing, the KoT were chased from their home and 
            forced to relocate. In the relocation/rebuilding process the KoT picked 
            up two of their most trusted members in Bob and Doug Mckenzie. These 
            two, eager to become part of our famed guild went on killing sprees 
            larger then life breathing new life into the dormant guild. Some members 
            spurred by the two new members came back and once again the Knights 
            of Terror were a force to be reckoned with. Based out of the dungeon 
            "Wrong" they continued their lifestyle of slaughtering players, looting 
            houses, and causing mahem to lord british's events. But yet again, 
            players lost interest, and slowly the guild turned to a dorment state 
            once again. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#CCCCCC">The summer of 1998 brought a new 
            element to the guild as they organized their first real life meeting 
            in Pomona, California. Chance Nifield and Gotham Grock travelled many 
            miles from British Columbia, Canada and had a blast partying with 
            our southwestern KoT brothers. We then also attended a UO Napa Valley 
            gathering, and succeeded to be the only ones to be hung over at 10am 
            in the morning. Although hung over, members still had enough energy 
            to make fun of and disturb the function at least once. </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#CCCCCC">The KoT showed sparks again when 
            in March of 1999 Everquest was released. This new game was quite a 
            bit different from what the KoT was used to. More so based on leveling 
            and spending time killing monsters, the KoT were not as affective 
            as in previous games. Members were so spread out in level range, and 
            geographic location that it was hard for them to be very affective 
            as a group. Still the KoT pked, looted and annoyed other players as 
            much as they could, but EverQuest producers started tweaking the game 
            so the whiney role playing power gamers would get their way. This 
            led to less interest in the game, and then finally to people quitting 
            the game completely. In the months after Braylor Hawkes another one 
            of KoT's finest, led the guild for a short time in an inspirational 
            come back.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#CCCCCC"> In the summer of 2000 the KoT 
            had a real life BBQ with members from around North America. On entry 
            all members were required to do a shot called a Rocky Mountain Bear 
            Fucker which was made up of 1/3 tequila, 1/3 jack daniels, and 1/3 
            151 proof rum. Once into the BBQ kegs were tapped and many drinks 
            were hoisted in a truly awesome 3 day party. These parties seperate 
            a real pk from the roleplaying wannabe's that we kill.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#CCCCCC">At the time of writing it is late 
            2001. Other then sparks in games like Diablo 2, Anarchy Online, and 
            Asherons Call, KoT again has layen dorment waiting for another game 
            where we all can ride once more and cause unmatchable chaos and complete 
            destruction. I believe that game is upon us... we rally our troops 
            now and fire breathes from our horses snouts. Watch for us looting 
            your town next, in Dark Age of Camelot. -As recalled by Lord Chance 
            Nifield, Leader of the Knights of Terror. 10/9/01 </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#CCCCCC">2001-2003- We kicked Ass in Dark 
            Age of Camelot. We dominated the Bedevere server and then the Andred 
            PvP server in true KoT style.</font></p>
