"3">I am the lone wolf<BR>
I watch your pack as you hunt<BR>
I can choose to hunt with you<BR>
But I do not need you to hunt</P>

<P>I am the lone wolf<BR>
I watch you argue and fight<BR>
You must learn who is your leader<BR>
I am at peace, my own leader</P>

<P>I am the lone wolf<BR>
You must preen and clean<BR>
You must be kind and friendly<BR>
You need to win favor to be chosen</P>

<P>I am the lone wolf<BR>
Your pack grows, evolves, learns<BR>
Your pack celebrates it's achievements<BR>
I do not need recognition from others</P>

<P>I am the lone wolf<BR>
I am alone and satisfied<BR>
I don't need anyone's approval or favor<BR>
I do not need to be popular, I already am</P>

<P>I am the lone wolf<BR>
Your pack hunts for trophies<BR>
You decide and argue who is deserving<BR>
I find my own without approval, deserving of all I win</P>

<P>I am the lone wolf<BR>
When it is cool and calm at night<BR>
I am at peace with the stars, the sky, and the land<BR>
The moon shines on my coat and warms me<BR>
I am happy and free<BR>
I am my own master and my own servant</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>Lately I've noticed the higher I go in life, the more corruption there
seems to be. It seems that a lot of things have become not so much skill
and ability, but more popularity contests. It may not always be to an extreme,
but it's always there.</P>

<P>I remember when young, I'd be one of the last to be picked. The shy,
quiet one hiding in the shadows. The shadows where I could watch the others,
find there weaknesses and strengths, and be strong in needing neither.</P>

<P>While it's true groups are required to get the nicer items, it's also
true that items do not make you who you are. I'd still be the same as I
am, even if I were stripped of all I had.</P>

<P>I will never fight to be popular just to gain the aid of others to get
an item.</P>

<P>Some choose otherwise, but I am a lone wolf, and happy with the freedom
it gives.</P>

<P>Beware the lone wolf, for they need no others. There strength and ability
solo unmatched.</P>

<P>Beware the lone wolf, you may just learn something from them. They have
been watching you from the shadows a long time.
