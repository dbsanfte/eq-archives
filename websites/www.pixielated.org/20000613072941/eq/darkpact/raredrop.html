HEIGHT="288">As I spent my 20 hours camping &quot;Dyllan&quot; in highpass
I had a lot of time to think. This was my first real camp for a 'rare drop'
item. In this case the item itself isn't rare, it's the spawn himself, he
in fact always has the item.</P>

<P>I'm fighting in Lower Guk these days and once every about 40 minutes
something has a chance of spawning that has a or b item. B, the rare, has
a chance of not even spawning in a 4 hour period from what I've seen. As
example I was camping in the lord and mage rooms, and in 6 hour periods
of each neither spawned the super lucky items. In fact the lesser items
were even very rare.</P>

<P>This brings us to the question: Do rare drop items work? If so why or
why not.</P>

<P>Why they do</P>

<P>Well it limits the number of times the item spawns over a period of time.</P>

<P>Why they don't</P>

<P>Look 2 months down the road, or 4. Soon everyone will have them. No matter
how you make the spawn rare.</P>

<P>Example, Shiny Metallic Robes are still &quot;new&quot; on my server.
I will see maybe 1 in 100 wearing one on my server in my area. Flowing Black
Robes are &quot;way old&quot; on my server. It seems anyone who starts a
mage of the classes that can wear one has one.</P>

<P>This gets to the question of economy. Back when the server opened and
FBRs were first being harvested they were worth over 1,000 plat. Now I think
there down to 100. But there still just a powerful an item as they day they
were first collected.</P>

<P>In more extreme cases you have something like the Shin armor. This spawns
in Lower Guk, but spawns so frequently you have people under 10 th level
are cloaking, sneaking down, and taking them from those who can kill them
(30 ths+) because they spawn so frequently there 'trash'.</P>

<P>What does this mean?</P>

<P>This means FBR and Shin are both harvested and attained just as easily.
High level x, kills and / or gives item to Low level y. Different history
of the items, yet the same end result. Over harvesting.</P>

<P><B>Summary / Solution / Truth</B></P>

<P>Economy-shmonomy. There is no such real animal in EverQuest. Eventually
everything is harvested to death and is so low in price it's easily attained
or just simply given to low level characters. I have found this time to
be about 2 months after item x is attainable.</P>

<P>I expect by the time the expansion comes out on E'ci there will be first
level Lizardmen Warriors in Crafted with Executioners Axes. Why? By then
they will be so commonplace it's not funny.</P>

<P>The problem will then move from &quot;twinking&quot; (that which someone
killed and put in effort for, to give to another character, be it theirs
or a friends) to &quot;imbalance of the world&quot; (that being there are
so many of the item it's basically commonplace everywhere, yet at one time
was difficult to attain).</P>

<P>I for one do not want to see first level Scorpions hitting at 75 hp a
shot to compensate.</P>

<P>Verant needs to wise up here. They need to really think about what they
are doing with a 'rare drop' and why, and work around that.</P>

<P>If they want an item to be attained by someone of approximately x level
and higher, they need to work around that.</P>

<P>They can guard it with monsters appropriate of that level, with ways
that can not be defeated. (Monsters don't have to see invisible, just see
inviso past x levels lower than them.)</P>

<P>They can put a level limit, or statistical requirement on an item.</P>

<P>They can put a maintenance cost on an item.</P>

<P>All these things have been done in other games long before EQ.</P>

<P>As it stands Rare Drops just frustrate players. If you only want player
x to get y, then make it a more frequent spawn. Give it a level limit, or
make it no drop, limit the number available per world. Prevent it from being
over harvested in some way other than Rare Drop. Rare drop is a temporary
time based solution, it eventually will not work.</P>

<P>I for one do not want to spend the levels of 46 - 50 to get all my class
only stuff in the plains. I'd like to know a hard earned 24 hours would
do the trick. I mean there is a lock down on the door. You A- have to be
46 th or higher, and I hear you have a high chance of death just coming
in, and are randomly dropped somewhere in the zone. That alone is a high
prevention. Why make the items so impossible to attain after that? I have
to be 46 th to come in. Isn't that my reward and prevention all in one?</P>

<P>Wize up Verant. Make more things no drop. Give things level requirements.
Maybe add a degradation. Make more stuff class and or race specific.</P>

<P>The gods forbid you actually think about a reason other than the economy
of today (as tomorrow it will be different) and think about the fun. You
may in fact inspire and encourage the cooperation you so blindly claim to
follow by making things no drop and spawn more often and add a level limit
to only allow players of that level or higher to use the item.</P>

<P>Do some research. You will find players have more fun helping their friends
attain x that is no drop than harvesting y because they can one shot it.
