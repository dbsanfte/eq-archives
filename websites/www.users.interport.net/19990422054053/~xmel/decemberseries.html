The Tuesday, December 2nd show at the Manhattan Internet Lounge was a big success!<p>Nearly 200 web fiction fans showed up to hear six writers read in conjuction with the print publication of <a HREF="http://www.coffeehousebook.com/">Coffeehouse: Writings From the Web</a>, a fiction anthology. <p> 
The show lead off with <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Ben Cohen<FONT COLOR="#000000">, reading some of his poetry backed by web text of the words.

Next up was <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Meg Wise-Lawrence<FONT COLOR="#000000">, who read a disturbing and highly sexual story to the music of Portishead and Led Zepplin.<p>
After a short break for some late-arriving samosas, <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Levi Asher<FONT COLOR="#000000"> stepped up to the plate for the public premiere of his "Notes From the Underground" CD-ROM film.<p><FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Barclay Dunn, a.k.a. Tabitha Rasa, <FONT COLOR="#000000"> followed Levi, reading one of the few acutal excerpts from the book.  The story, about her days as a rock singer called Venus Envy in a band called Scrotum, was backed by a series of changing web images. <p>
<FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Alison Dorfman<FONT COLOR="#000000">'s funky poetry sequence was one of the event's big hits.  Alison also read from the diary she kept as a ten-year-old. <p>
Rounding out the evening was 
<FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Xander Mellish<FONT COLOR="#000000">, sitting amid a forest of cartoon New York City spires and reading to the music of Miles Davis and Duke Ellington.
<p>
Thanks to everybody who helped make Web Writers happen!
