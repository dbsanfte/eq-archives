<H2>Results of Time Off</h2>
<p>
I spent the first three weeks of February in Belize, staying in the mountain town of San Ignacio with my friend Alex Greene, who is studying traditional healers.
<p>
We had no television and no foreign newspapers in San Ignacio - a nice break from following every twist and turn of the news in my day job - and few modern appliances.  Given the heat, that made for a lot of hand laundry in a washtub, followed by sprints to get everything off the clothesline before the daily rainstorms.
<p>
Basically, we had nothing but time, and I got a heck of a lot of writing done - several draft episodes of the <a HREF="vedalist.html">Five George Washingtons</a> and a new episode of <a HREF="http://www.interport.net/~xmel2/joel/joel2-1.html">Joel Faur&#233, the Melancholy Male Model</a>.  Since they were composed largely on the Mayan ruins by Alex's house, they come with the very highest pedigree.
<p>
I also got a lot of reading done.  Hating everything I'd brought along, I ended up reading bits and pieces I found in hotels and secondhand bookshops:  James Fennimore Cooper's "Last of the Mohicans"  (very high body count!);  Judith Guest's excellent "Ordinary People;" and Somerset Maugham's soapy, loopy "Painted Veil."  (Belize is the former British Honduras, and I was craving some of Maugham's colonial Brits).
<p>
Aldous Huxley, to drop one more name, once said that if there is such a thing as ends of the Earth, Belize is surely one of them.   He's right, but it was also a great place to get stuff done.
