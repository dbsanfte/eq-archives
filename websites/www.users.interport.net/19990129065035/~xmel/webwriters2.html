<h3>The final <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Web Writers In The Flesh<FONT COLOR="#000000"> show of 1998 featured nothing but female web writers  - purely an artifice, since web writers seem fairly well-divided by gender.   Still, "Ladies Nights" always do pull a good audience, as discotheques in New Jersey long ago discovered.

<P>The first reader of the night, at her request, was <a HREF="http://www.i-out.com/soap/">Gays of Our Lives</a> writer <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Kim Ficera<FONT COLOR="#000000">.  Kim had the audience in stiches with an essay about society's obsession with large breasts, illustrated with shots of decidedly uncomfortable-looking bust enlargements.  Such abnormalities, she decided, were useful only to "provide sarcastic lesbians with comic relief."
<p>
Next up was <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Steve Brownlee<FONT COLOR="#000000">, an audience favorite from the season's first Web Writers in October.  Steve read a straight-to-the-gut piece about the first time she'd made love, complete with a funny line about how a big dick wasn't worth much when it was attached to a man who was, personality-wise, a big dick.

<FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Kymm Zuckert<FONT COLOR="#000000"> was the only Web Writers virgin at this show, but she was wildly popular with the audience.  Kymm runs a continuous web diary, <a HREF="http://www.hedgehog.net/mightykymm/">Hedgehog Tales</a>, and read an excerpt about the birth of a neighbor's baby, followed by a bit about the difficulty of buying shoes when you have big feet.  For the audiovisual portion of her presentation, Kymm wore the shoes she finally was able to buy.

<FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Alison Dorfman<FONT COLOR="#000000">,  the only web writer to appear in all three seasons of the series, was next.  After some funny free verse about the various bosses she'd worked for, she read a great story about a teenage love affair conducted among crew members at a McDonald's.  
<p>
The final reader of the evening, and the season, was <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Xander Mellish<FONT COLOR="#000000">, with an encore presentation of <a HREF="http://www.xmel.com/joel.html">Joel Faur&#233, the Melancholy Male Model</a>.  Joel looks a little bit like a light bulb, but his lonely wanderings through Manhattan, to the tune of Aaron Copeland's "Quiet City," touch us all.
<p>
See you next season!
