<BLOCK>I used to read Greek mythology as a kid - I loved all the enterprising virgin goddesses - and I remember the Golden Apple of Discord, which would be thrown in the middle of a crowd of friends and make them enemies.  They'd go running off in a hundr
ed different directions, coming back only to do battle. <p>New York City is like a giant Golden Apple all on its own.  Tossed in the middle of it, everyone runs off in a hundred different directions alone, chasing their private ambitions.  <p>They work al
one, they live alone, bit by the invisible viper that ruins every one of us by convincing us to make our dreams come true. </BLOCK> <h4>

<dd>Most of my troubles in life come from wanting things my own way.   When I was sixteen, I told my high school guidance counselor I wanted to be a journalist, and he said, "Dear, it's very hard to get a job doing that, but my daughter is a secretary and
 she types the company newsletter." <dd>It was impossible to explain to him, sitting satisfied in his government-issue chair, that I specifically wanted to be the exception to everything - the violet in the sand dune, the light out the train window at nig
ht, the mink that wanted the coat made of movie stars.
