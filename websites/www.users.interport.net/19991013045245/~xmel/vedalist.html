<P><DD>A city at night is a mystery. Its avenues hum with traffic, and its veins with noisy subways, but its side streets lie in shadow, quiet.  Skyscraper apartments, stone hives of people, are silent, yet full of sleeping life.  From a sidewalk, an outsider sees just dark windows set with brilliant signs: <I>Locksmith, Cold Beer, One-Hour Photo.</i>  A city may not sleep, but it hushes.</FONT>

    She was reading in a newspaper about a massive crash by
the country's largest online service. It was a great middle finger
to those arrogant Internet lovers, forever going on about their
e-mail addresses. Now they were missing drink dates, doing
without new pie recipes, or having their tiresome genealogical
queries lost forever. It was the next best thing to having a
massive power outage get rid of the Internet entirely.

<h3><dd>Billy Dose sat in the Brigitte Diner over his finished turkey dinner, wondering how long it would be until they asked him to leave.  He ordered another cup of coffee.  He couldn't order dessert, because dessert came as part of the prix-fixe "Joyeux Noel Platter" the Lebanese-pretending-to-be-French operator of the diner had already served him.  It consisted of turkey, mashed potatoes, and a little apple tart, all on one plate.

<P><DD>Since Undine Spragg would have never permitted him to move in, he and Veda worked out a system. He stayed out all night, doing God knows what, and then waited outside until he saw Veda and Undine leave for work in the morning.  Then he'd go upstairs, smoky and disheveled, and sleep the day away in Veda's bed. He set her alarm clock for 5:30 pm, a half-hour before Undine was due home.

<DD><h3>Working as a novelty psychic for parties was Gemma
Guimard's least favorite way to earn money. There were so
many people, and so many predictions, and she couldn't recycle
them the way she usually did because they all talked to each
other.<P><DD> Inevitably there were long lines outside her "Fun
Psychic" booth, and after a while, every palm looked the same.
<P><DD> The whole experience made her sympathize with strippers
working bachelor parties.

<h3>At a disco in the daytime, where a mirrored ball hung idly from the ceiling and the waitresses, without makeup, were surly about having to be up so early, the Cybersocial was underway. <P><DD> 
	Veda and Frederic had come there via subway and a long walk through a deserted neighborhood.  They passed rusty train tracks and cigarette billboards, and parking lots fenced with barbed wire, the kind of isolation and desolation that seemed terribly cool in a prosperous city.

Jason Jellyman was a man of property now.  He had sold <I>Cyberswinger</I> to a mass-market magazine publisher and with the proceeds bought his own apartment near the Flatiron Building, in what was just beginning to be called Silicon Alley.   Now <I>Cyberswinger</I> was a glossy magazine, repositioned towards housewives vaguely interested in the Internet.  Jason had seen it in the supermarket: on the cover, a model was holding a mouse in one hand and a spatula in the other.
