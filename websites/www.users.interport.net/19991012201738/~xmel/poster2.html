<h3>
<p>
<p>
The point of this site is not to sell stuff.   The point of this site is to 
bring stories to readers. <p>
Letting readers know about the site is a job in itself, however, and it's 
particularly tough reaching people outside the U.S.   That's why I 
offered this 
24" x 36" poster to cybercafes overseas.<p>
Right now, it's on display in over a dozen countries, including England, 
Australia, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa, Hong Kong, Mexico, Canada, Switzerland, Malaysia and Slovenia.  I had to check an atlas to find out where Slovenia was. 
<p>
A limited number of signed and numbered posters are still available, and 
I'm not above trying to make some dough off them. <p>
You can <a HREF="mailto:xmel@aol.com">purchase</a> a poster for US$10, 
plus $3 postage and handling.  Checks to Xander Mellish, 18 Greenwich Avenue, #206, New York, NY, 10011. <BR>Framed hand-drawn cartoons are also for sale. 
<p>
But the stories are still free!<p><p><p></h3> <h4>
