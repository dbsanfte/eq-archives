<h3><pre></pre>I stared at the ocean that spring until my eyes turned blue.  I could make that sound like devotion, because my husband was on the other side in Europe, in the Army, in the war.  But I barely knew
 him, and had already pretty much forgotten him and fallen in love with someone else.  It's funny, how nothing alive and warm on the Earth is blue, except a few human eyes.<PRE> </pre> We came here by train from Minnesota, and until then I'd never seen an 
ocean, only lakes, which had no passion in them.  My husband had been assigned to basic training on Long Island, and the idea was that I could stay with his aunt nearby.  We could have her beach cottage all to ourselves when he had leave.  Two days after 
we
 arrived, though, he volunteered for flight school and was sent to Texas and left me by myself.  For what seemed like an endless string of days I just sat on the beach in the dim sunlight, alone on the sand, while the ocean roared with desire.  It was an
 odd way to be married, and we hadn't been married very long.<p>At noontime, I would go up to the main house and eat dinner there.  Aunt Trudy still buys as much gin as she ever did for the parties no one has any more, and when she drinks it, she gets 
sentimental about the war.  She gets started on weepy speeches about boy soldiers, their sweet bodies ripped by Nazi bullets, sacrificed to defend from ungrateful foreigners the American way of life.  Aunt Trudy had waited too long for a man to divorce
 his 
wife, a story that had ended with the wife a widow and Aunt Trudy a spinster.  She has a house now, and a little income, and a blue star in her window, even though it isn't actually her son that's at war.<p> When she was really soused, she'd put on her
 hat 
and her CDVO volunteer corps badge and go around to houses reminding people to save up their tin cans and copper wire for the war effort.  I went with her;  there was nothing else to do.  I got to know every old lady in town, as well as details about
 their use of canned goods.<PRE>  </PRE></TD>

Aunt Trudy's
 greatest frustration. Through their windows she could see great scrap
trophies; one had an old steel washing machine in view in the basement.
Sometimes, when Aunt Trudy had been drinking more heavily than on other days, she wanted to bust into them
 like a cat burglar.  It would have been for a good cause, and I don't know if I could have talked her out of it.  <BR CLEAR><TABLE>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=250>&nbsp</TD>
<TD WIDTH=400><FONT FACE="times" SIZE="+1"><h3><pre> </pre>I was happy, then, to see the door to the washing machine house ajar one day, and the window shades up.  I walked back a few steps to Aunt




 Trudy, 
who was looking through the windows at the scrap in somebody's
garage, and told her that the house was open.<p> "It  can't be open," Aunt Trudy said. "There's no flag out front." 
<p> But it was open, the front door was open, and there was someone inside. 
 Aunt Trudy knocked on the door frame and went in without waiting for an answer.  I followed her, a little embarrassed.<p>In the front room was a very pretty dark-haired woman, cutting a huge piece of orange fabric in half.  She had freckles, and she was 




too old for freckles. She was the first person my own age I'd seen
since my husband left town. <p>Aunt Trudy stopped short.  She stepped
back. <p>"Mrs. Doyle?"  said Aunt Trudy. <p>The dark-haired woman looked
up. <p>
 "Mrs. Doyle, why aren't you flying the colors?" Aunt Trudy asked. She seemed a little flustered.  She
kept talking without giving Mrs. Doyle time to answer. "What are you doing
with so much fabric?" she said. "You know, fabric is a very precious
commodity. I predict fabric will be rationed.
 You must use it
wisely."<p>"It's just a bedspread,"
 she said. "It
was a very nice bedspread, but my husband won't be back for awhile."  She
grinned at me. Mrs. Doyle had a very bright smile.
 "It's probably better
if I don't have such a good-looking bed while he's gone," she said.<p>I think she thought I would find that
funny. I just stared at her.
  <p> "These are blackout curtains," she told
Aunt Trudy. "One of the ladies told me I needed curtains so the enemy
couldn't spot light from my house."
<p
>Aunt Trudy had recovered enough to introduce me.  "Mrs. Joseph Doyle of
Massachusetts, this is my niece by marriage, Mrs. Andersen of Minnesota. Her father is the president of Thousand Lakes Savings Bank in Minneapolis.  Mrs. Doyle arrived from Boston
last week."<p>"Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Andersen," said Mrs. Doyle, not
extending her hand. She was struggling a little with the big piece of
fabric.<p>"Mrs. Andersen's husband," said Aunt Trudy, "my nephew, is in
Italy now. 
He's making an enormous contribution to the war effort." <p>I looked around at the house, which was full
of odd-looking old furniture.
  It was horribly dusty.  I noticed Aunt
Trudy looking around the room,  too, and I could guess what she was
thinking. <p>"This was Mrs. Keane's house, 
wasn't it?" Aunt Trudy said.<p>"Yes, she was Doyle's grandmother."<p>"Mrs.
Keane was known for being very frugal," said Aunt Trudy, taking off her
gloves. "She very rarely threw useful items away. I wouldn't wonder that

there is some very interesting scrap material in your basement." <p>"You're welcome to look," said Mrs.
Doyle.<p>Aunt Trudy found her
 way back into the other room, and I could hear her opening the cellar door. <p>Once she was gone,  Mrs. Doyle put down her scissors and ripped the fabric in
 half.  <p>"Aren't you hot in those clothes?" she said suddenly.<p> "I've
been down by the beach," I said," and it's cooler there." It was the first
thing I'd said in the house.<p>"Well, it's hot up here. Besides, there's
no use dressing up when this whole place looks like a ghostie's house. Isn't it a horror?" Her hair was

falling out of its bun.  'We inherited this house, and that was lucky,
because we never could have afforded one on our own. Doyle's not much for
working."
<p>Aunt Trudy was back. "He's 
a fine boy, I'm sure," she said. "Isn't he in the Navy?"<p>"Yes, he's in
the Pacific."<p>"Then he won't meet the German army. My nephew is fighting
the German army." Aunt Trudy told us. "Could you hold the cellar door open
for me, Helena?" she asked me.
 "I don't have a lantern."<p>I followed her through the dusty house. She
opened the cellar door, and pulled me with her down onto the steps.
<p>"That's Merrilyn Doyle," she said. "She talks to the handymen.  And I
don't mean that she greets them, I mean she
 talks to them.  I heard all about it at church."<p>"I didn't see her at
church," I said. <p>"She goes to the Catholic church," said Aunt Trudy.
"Be very wary of her."
<PRE> </PRE>I thought about Merrilyn Doyle as Aunt Trudy
poked around the basement.  I was wondering how she found men to talk to,
anyway, since as far as I knew there weren't any nearby except for
fishermen and teenagers and old men who thought they could fight off the Nazis with muskets and baseball bats.  Aunt Trudy didn't find anything else 
of 
use in the cellar that we didn't already know about, and I helped her
back
 up the stairs, where we found Merrilyn basting the blackout curtains
with huge, careless stitches. <p>"You have a lovely broken washing machine in your basement which would be very helpful to our scrap drive," Aunt Trudy told her. "I'll send some
children to pick it up in their scrap wagons."<p> "I don't think it's
right to make children carry it all," said Merrilyn.<p>"Oh, they'll enjoy
it. It's their contribution to the war
 effort. They get points for it at school."<p>"Then send them by," said
Merrilyn Doyle. She had very blue eyes. <PRE> </PRE>"That woman," said Aunt
Trudy, "is loose. She does not respect the institution of
marriage."<p>"And you don't like her because of that?" I 
said. <p>"I don't like her because she's not flying the flag,"  said Aunt
Trudy. </TD></TR></TABLE><PRE>   </PRE><IMG 
ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="lonelyicon.gif"><p><br clear>That night, I decided to write a letter to my husband, a real one, not my usual strained effort filled with news about the weather and not written, as they usually were, as big as possible to
 take up space. I would write him a good letter, a good wife's letter. <p> He had written to me a couple of times, tiny, machine-shrunken V-mail letters. They were all dotted with black marks, footprints of the censor, who crossed out everything having to




 do with location or




 troop movements. That left only questions, mostly about people in Minnesota, and we hardly knew any of the same people in Minnesota. <br clear><TABLE>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=400><FONT FACE="times" SIZE="+1"><h3><pre> </pre><p>My family hardly knew anyone, because we socialized very little.  My father was always busy at the bank, my mother in her room with her headaches, and I spent most of my time out of school alone downstairs, looking out of the window. If my father hadn't arranged for me to be a debutante, I would have never gone to the dance where I met my husband, a quickly-arranged winter mixer that was supposed to substitute for the canceled spring debutante ball.  It was right after the attack, when we'd all been so excited and angry and ready to fight.  This seemed like my part in it all, marrying him and coming here to write letters and save up his army paychecks. <p>That night, I wrote him everything I could think of about the people in Minnesota.  I wrote him about how awful everything was in this poky small town, and how lucky he was to be in Europe. I was starting 


to






 come back to the weather again when, my hand hurting from the effort, I signed my name.  I signed it Helena, and then crossed it out and shortened it to Lena, and then added Love. <pre> </pre>I took the letter to the post office first thing the next morning; 









it always seemed important that I get his mail to him as quickly as possible,  before he had time to be shot or killed or made crazy by a gas attack. I walked up the street to the little brick post office, and every house I saw was flying a flag. 
<PRE>  </PRE>At the door of the post office I met Mrs. Doyle, coming out. Her cheeks were pink with excitement, and she was wearing that same horrible tight dress, and I realized I didn't like how pretty she was. Her arms were full of opened letters.<p> "Look,"
 she said, "they're all from my family. I think they all sat in the
kitchen and wrote to me the moment I left. You'd think they could have put
them all in one envelope and saved on stamps. Boston seems far away, doesn't it?"<p> "Hello," I said.<p> She 
lifted
 some V-mail envelopes up to the light. "These are from Doyle, my husband,
in the Navy. He's on Tuvalu," she said. "That's an island near Australia, believe it or not."<p>
 I couldn't help being curious. "How do you know where he is?" I said. <p> "We have 
a 
code. The first letter of the second sentence in every paragraph spells
out where he is." She looked at the letter again. "Tu-va-lu," she said.<p> I moved my letter from one hand to the other. My heart was pounding; she was so pretty, and I didn't know what to say to her. There was a telegraph boy's bicycle leaning against th

e
wall,  and I leaned against the bicycle. <p>
 "Can I ask you something?" she said. "What do you do all day? There's no one here to talk to, no one to play cards with, nothing. There's 

no one to cook or eat with."<p> "There isn't, I guess," I said. <p> "Can
you come visit me?"<p> "I could," I said.<p> "Today," she said. "Today, please. I have no one to talk to."<p> She had a very warm smile, and the day was a little bit cold. I walked
 with her in the sunshine back towards her house, which had its orange blackout curtains up now. She'd taped a newspaper picture of a flag above her doorbell. I never did mail my letter to my husband.</TD>

because she was born on the 25th of the month, though not on Christmas,
and she was a Catholic, which is a sort of person I had never met before. She had five brothers, all of whom
 helped her father on construction projects; she'd come to live in the house
in town because Mrs. Keane had been her husband's great aunt, and the war
in a way was a blessing for them because his steady salary from the army
would give them an income nice
 enough fix up the house with. I found that out just on the walk up to her
house. I didn't mind her talking so much, because it meant I didn't have to say anything at all.

The house was a worse mess than the last time I'd been there. Merrilyn had bits of clothes lying all over the place, some of them underclothes. I guess she'd
been unpacking. <p>In the kitchen there were pails full of mussels and clams she must have bought from the fishermen that morning. I sat in the kitchen while she put them in a pot.
 I guess they were lunch, although it was too late for breakfast and too
early for lunch. I got the feeling she ate whenever she wanted to. The old stove was fired by wood, and it did make the house hot, even on a cool day. I could understand why
 she'd been wearing so little clothing.<p>There was a pleasant kind of silence
inside the kitchen.  I could hear birds outside, and waves in the
distance.  Aunt Trudy would have been horrified to find me there.<p> "Your husband's a pilot, isn't he?" Merrilyn asked
 me. <p> "Yes."<p> "You have to enlist on your own to get those good
jobs," she said. "Did he enlist on his own?"<p> "Yes."<p> "They picked
Doyle up in a movie theater. I didn't even know he'd been drafted - he just threw the letter away when it came.
 They came to pick him up, and we didn't even know what happened to him. When
they pick you up, they don't even let you call your family. He just went to the movies, when he was supposed to be going to work, and a few days later we got a letter from a naval base
 in San Diego. But that's Doyle."<p>She poured the clams into a bowl.
<p>"I just got my sugar ration. I can never save it for more than a couple
of days. I'm going to make fudge." She ripped open the sugar and got the
milk out of the icebox. "I can't find a saucepan in this horror house," she said.<p>Merrilyn put the clams

on the table, and we started cracking them open. At home, we never had seafood in the summer, and so it didn’t seem quite proper.  But it would have been bad manners to say anything 
about that,  so I ate them anyway, in silence. <p>"I'd like to break you
open like a clam," she said. "What are you so quiet about? It can't be
that interesting." <p> "I'm not quiet," I said. <p>We ate in silence for a
while.  In between clams, Merrilyn got 
up to stir the fudge.<p> "What's he like, your husband?" she asked me.
<p> "I don't know. I don't know him very well."<p> "Oh, come on," she
said. "You'd know him if he sat down next to you on a bus, or
something."<p> "He's handsome," I said. "And he's

 from one of the best families in St. Paul." That didn't seem to mean much
to her. "He tells jokes," I said. <p> "Good jokes?"<p> "No, mostly old
jokes. Aunt Trudy even knew some of them."<p>She sat down across from me
with a spoon full of fudge mix.  "What's he like in the sack?" 
<p>"What?"<p>"I mean, is he good at sex?" <p>Merrilyn Doyle was an awful
woman, I decided. <p>"It can take time before you start
liking it," she said.<p>"Well, he left before I started liking it."<p>She
got up
 to start pouring the fudge mix into a flat pan. <p> "I dream about it every
night, with all different people," she said. "Doyle says I'm a deviant.
They've been showing him movies about deviants in the service."<p> "How
does he know what you've been dreaming?"<p> "I tell him. When I write him I tell him everything that's on my
mind. You know, they never censor sex talk. They only censor talk about
military movements. I think they think it's good for his morale."<p>She was fanning the fudge with her hand.
 <p>"I can't wait for this to cool," she said. "Try some."<p>I put a spoon
into the soft chocolate.  It was still hot. <p>I let it cool a little
before I put it in my mouth.<p>"Ugh!" I said.  I spit it out into a
napkin. <p> "It tastes like fish," I said.
 <p>"Let me try," she said, taking a spoonful. <p>She made a horrible face,
but she swallowed.<p>"Oh, God," she said. "Did I wash out the pot when I
was done with the clams?" <p>I looked at her, and I started laughing.  I
couldn't help it. She was so silly,

 and so pretty, and she was laughing too.</TD></TR></TABLE>

It wasn't until the Fourth of July that anyone knew we were
friends. I'd gone with Aunt Trudy to the town picnic.  She quickly left me
behind, however, for the ladies of 



the Women's Civil Defense Auxiliary, who had picked almost all the park's
wildflowers for their hats. Merrilyn came and sat beside me, and I
couldn't tell her not to, because everyone was welcome in the park that day, the first Independence day of the war


.<p>"I wonder where Doyle is today," she said. <p>There were dozens of miniature flags lining the path through the park, and the sound of birds and crickets, and the smell of hot dogs. Merrilyn sat beside me with her ankles crossed in the green grass.
 There was a ladybug in her hair. <p>"He's happy, though.  I'm sure of it,"
she said. "I always know how he's feeling, even from so far away.  The one half always knows what the other is feeling."<p>A few yards away from us, a man walked across the grass, 

disregarding the path entirely.  He was one of the local handymen, out working even today. His pants were all dusty.  He winked at Merrilyn, and waved at her. <p>"Who's that?" I said. <p>"I played cards with him," she said. "I played gin rummy."<p>"You talk 
to him?" <p>"I had him in my house.  No one will ever know." <p>Across the park, I could see Aunt Trudy with her auxiliary ladies, gathered around the picnic table, talking in whispers. <p> "The whole town talks about how you behave with these dirty men," I told her. <p>"They do?" she said.<p>She was quiet for a moment.  She took all the leaves off of the dandelion, and then she put it in her mouth, chewing on it a little. <p>"Well, what if I had only played cards with him?" <p>I looked at her, frowning 
with a dandelion in her mouth. <p>"I love my husband, you know," she said. "I think it's a sign of love, that I need someone else to fill his place."<p>She tucked her knees beneath her chin, and uprooted another dandelion.<p>I lay back on the grass myself,
 and looked at the sun.  It seemed all upside-down,  that Merrilyn could love her husband and not even be faithful to him, and I could be faithful to mine and not love him at all. <p>A band started playing in the corner of the park.  It sounded off-key
 and lopsided.  Half the musicians were probably in the service.  <p>"It's crazy to have this whole big picnic just for ourselves," Merrilyn said. "They should have gone out to Fort Totten and invited some of the servicemen."<p>"Oh, the servicemen.  I'm
 so
 sick of the servicemen. They're not the only ones whose lives were ruined by this war."<p>Merrilyn looked at me skeptically.<p>"Well, it's true,"  I said.  "A girl in my position doesn't have much time to have fun, and I've missed it all."<p>"You can
 have 






fun later."<p>"No, I can't.  I'm married."<p>She laughed.<p>"I'll never be
a debutante," I said. "I'll never go down the steps
of the Minneapolis Club in a white dress.  I'll never meet people and make
friends."<p>Merrilyn tried to look sympathetic. <p>"I would bet," she said,  "that this is what Hitler had in mind all along."<p>"What do you mean?"<p>"Was there some German girl who wanted to wear your same dress? That's probably what set him off," she said. <p>I looked at her, still a little 
bewildered.<p>"I'll bet you're the cause of this whole war,"  she said.<p>"Stop it," I said. I was starting to laugh.<p>"The whole world was put in peril just because you had to wear a goddamn white dress."<p>"Stop, stop, stop."  I was really laughing 
now, too
 hard to even care about the profanity.<p>We forgot all about the bar, and about the ball, and were laughing and it was a beautiful day.  I was telling Merrilyn about the day a bat got loose in the Minneapolis Club when Aunt Trudy finally came back for
 me, frowning, and insisting that the Auxiliary ladies needed help serving
food.<p>"Are you a bird, dear?" she said, as we walked
away.<p>"What?"<p>"Birds of a feather flock together," she said. <p>She
stopped and turned to look at me,  her eyes in shade from 


the brim of her hat.<p>"I hope I don't have to tell your husband's family
that you are acquainted with that sort of woman," she said. "They would
think less of me if they knew I'd allowed it."<p>We were there in the sunny park that day while the whole
 world was spinning out of control, while bodies were being blown to pieces and cities were left in ruins, and every ordinary good thing in our own lives was being sucked out and shot to vicious bits.  Looking at Aunt Trudy, her lips pursed in an 

expression
 of wrinkly moral outrage, I started laughing all over again.  A flower fell off of her hat.

and they were always seeing things.  That night, though, it was hard to
imagine they could have seen anything at all. It had been raining steadily for hours. <p>"It can't be a real

rain.<p>"It might be real," I said.<p>"Come on,"  Merrilyn said.  "Let the
Nazis come get us."<p>I put out the 
candle we'd been burning, just in case, and we sat in the dark. Merrilyn told
me a long story about her brother the priest, and how he'd won half a
Studebaker playing poker. The other half of the Studebaker turned out to belong to a mobster, and at one point 


he'd found a bloody corpse in the back seat and had succeeded in giving
him extreme unction right there, kneeling on the wheel bump. I told her a ghost story I'd heard about a bald man who loved his red-haired wife. When she died, his hair started
 growing, growing back red. <p>No planes came, but no all-clear sign came either. For a drill, the all-clear sign was usually up within fifteen minutes. It had been at least a couple of hours, though there was no way of knowing the time for sure. It was

about cities in flames, about buzz bombs and anti-aircraft fire. <p>Now, I couldn't hear anything except the rain. <p>"They could come in ships," I said. "Ships would be quiet."<p>"It's not ships that come near here. It's U-boats," said Merrilyn.<p>"Can
 soldiers come ashore from a U-boat?" I said. <p>Out there in the beach cottage we were so cut off from the town, from everything, by 


night and fog. <p>"I don't see any ships," said Merrilyn. "I don't see
anything. I'm going to walk home."<p>"You can't go out. They have air
wardens all over the streets. They'll think you're a saboteur or
something."<p>I could hear her fidgeting around in the dark. <p>"I think I'm just going to sleep here," she said. "You must
have an extra nightgown."<p>"I don't," I said. <p>"Well, I can just sleep
without one."<p>"I only have my wedding night gown," I said. "My negligee.
It's packed away. I'll have to 


light a candle again to look for it."<p>"Oh, light one. I don't believe in
Nazis."<p>I tried to shelter the candle's light a little with my hand. I
found the negligee in a box beneath my bed. <p>She got

never a lonely place. There were dozens of women alone, their lunches laid out on beach blankets, and hundreds of girls and very little boys screaming as they played in the surf.  Some of the women from the munitions factories in the city came down on 
weekends and lay sleeping in the sun.  They were city girls, most of them,

wore jewelry to the beach.<p>Merrilyn was watching them one weekend as we

liked having her around all the time, more than I'd ever really liked
having anyone around.  I liked having her


 in the cottage with me.  I always hated going to her house, with its dust
and its monstrous old furniture and the hundred unsaid reminders that this
would someday be Doyle's house, and she'd be spending her days and nights with him, not me.  I was
 beginning not to like Doyle at all.

seemed as 






if we would spend the rest of our lives at war, as if the rest of our
lives would be permanently gray.

<TD WIDTH=400><FONT FACE="times" SIZE="+1"><h3><pre> </pre><PRE> </PRE>One day in October I woke up to sun again.  I left Merrilyn in bed and went to cash some of my husband's army paychecks, with the idea of doing
 some shopping after lunch. I had promised Aunt Trudy I would eat dinner with her.  <p>I didn't see Aunt Trudy much any more, now that she was so involved in her Women's Auxiliary, knitting for the navy and teaching people first aid for when the 
Nazis came. 

<P>Now that Aunt Trudy had so much war work to do, she didn't drink as much. She was much more herself, and I liked her even less.<p>We sat, just the two of us, at her long table, and waited as the cook set down the salad in front of us.  The cook also had
 to
 serve as maid and butler, but Aunt Trudy was one of the few people in town who still had any servants at all. She had convinced the local planning committee that she needed them because of all her war work. <p>"I received a letter from your husband," 
she said. "You haven't been answering his letters. He wrote to me to ask
if you're all right."<p>"I'm all right," I said. "I'm very well."<p>"Your
husband," she said, "has killed six people with his bare hands. I can hardly wait until he gets back, so I can





 look at his hands."<p>The rain had turned into a thunderstorm.  Behind her head, I watched the sky turn white with lightning.<p>"Of course, it seems as if almost anyone can be a hero these days. I saw a man in the paper who killed three Japs, but at home









 he was a coal man. He was the man who brought the coal! "<p>The cook took our salad plates away and was setting down the plates for the main course. <p>"It's terrible how people think they've come up in the world, just because we're pulling together to w









in this war. The presumption," she said. "That Irish Catholic wife of that plant foreman tried to put herself up as the block leader for the wardens and the ladies let her, just because her husband's in the armor plating business. Pretty soon they'll have









 the colored servants seated at the table with us."<p>The cook was carefully ladling beef stew onto our plates. <p>"If Hitler had set out to destroy the social fabric of this country, he could scarcely have done a better job," Aunt Trudy said. <p>It had
 started to rain now, and we heard the first clap of thunder. <p>"I hope
that Doyle woman will leave town," Aunt Trudy said, "now that she's a widow."<p>"What?" I said.<p>"I heard about it at the post office today. They took her the telegram first thing in 






the morning, and she wasn't even home."<p>I couldn't find words. <p>"I'd
like to think she was out doing morning marketing, but I doubt it." Aunt
Trudy said.<p>I wondered if I'd wished it. I don't think I had. I felt horrible, and at the same time almost 





horribly wonderful. Now I had Merrilyn all to myself. <p>"She can go back
to her people by the very first train," Aunt Trudy was saying. "We 
don't need her kind here."<p>"Miss Helena," said the cook, interrupting. "there's a woman at the door for you." 
 <p>It was Merrilyn, soaking wet, standing on the porch and sobbing. <p>I stepped out into the rain with her and held her while she cried and cried and cried.<p>"Oh, God," she said. "Oh, Doyle."<p>"Let's go back to the cottage."<p>"I want to go back to ou
r 








house," she said. "Doyle's house, and mine."<p>"Come to mine," I said.
<p>She was sobbing and holding her chest with both hands, as if her heart would come out. <p>"You have to come to mine!" I said. <pre> </pre>I came back to the table soaking wet and sat
 down. Aunt Trudy looked at me carefully. I just sat there staring at my food, holding my fork in midair.<p>After a moment I got up and left her sitting at the table, left her behind, Aunt Trudy, and my husband, and his family and my family and everyone
 else 






in the world, left everyone behind me and went to find Merrilyn. </TD></TR></TABLE>

I found her lying face down on the bed where I had left her that morning, sobbing, crying so hard she was sweaty. I put arm around her, and my cheek against her sweaty, teary
 cheek. <p>"I'm still here," I said. "Honey? I'm still here."<p>She just cried.
I held her for a long time, smoothing down her hair with my hand.  <p>"I couldn't even feel it," she said. "I didn't even know it had happened."<p>"Merrilyn," I whispered, after a



 while, "what are we going to do?"<p>"I'll go back," she said. "to Boston.
To my family." She was still choking on her tears. "Everyone who knew
Doyle is in Boston."<p>My heart was pounding. <p>"I'll come with you," I said. "I can come with you to Boston.
 Don't worry. We can find an apartment there. There must be war jobs in Boston," I said. "I'll come with you."<p>She looked up at me.<p>"Why?" she said.<p>"I want to be with you," I said.<p>"Don't be crazy," she said, sitting back.<p>"I don't care. I 
don't care about my husband.  I want to be with you."<p>"I'll be with my family," she said. "I won't need you any more." <p>I held her for a second longer, a colder second, and then let her down onto the bed.  I got up and sat in a chair across the room. 


<p>






That night she cried and cried, for somebody who wasn't me.  It was her husband, who she loved, who she'd been thinking of the whole time we were together.  <p>It rained all night, but it wasn't the warm rain I remembered.  When she finally fell asleep, I









 moved over and sat by the side of the bed as she slept.  Finally, I slept too.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<TD WIDTH=250>&nbsp</TD>
<TD WIDTH=400><FONT FACE="times" SIZE="+1"><h3><pre> </pre>I woke up to the air raid siren. I sat in the dark for awhile, listening to it, and to Merrilyn's regular breathing by my side. In the haze of sleep I almost reached 
over to her.  Then I remembered, and I sat back, listening to the siren. This time I almost wished it would be for real.  I felt like dying anyway. <p>But the all-clear signal came, this time like just like every time. I got out of bed and put on my robe.


 Going
 back into the main room, I lit a candle, and saw my own husband
sitting at the kitchen table. <p>Startled, I dropped the candle. I reached down and picked it up, the flame intact.  He didn't move.<p>"Toby?" I said.<p>He wasn't even looking at me.<p>
 "It's so quiet here," he said. "And it's cold. I thought by the beach it would be warm."<p> He looked just like he had before, as if nothing had changed, even though so much had changed. Then he turned to me and opened his mouth, and I realized his front


 teeth were gone.<p>"What happened?" I said. "What are you doing back here?"<p>"Didn't you get my letters?"<p>"No," I said, lying.<p>I sat down at table, across from him.  It was odd to see him again in the form of a person, not a thought. 
I looked at his

 hands, like Aunt Trudy had wanted to.  They were trembling.<p>"I probably shot down the pigeon carrying the mail," he said. <p>He grinned, a sickly grin, but in it I could see a bit of the man he used to be, the man who came from one of the best families



 in St. Paul, a man with square shoulders and a uniform, which he wasn't wearing now.  They had him in what looked like army-issue civilian clothes, a stiff greenish shirt.  He looked like a living carcass in the flickering light of the candle. <p>I got
 up 






and got him some coffee, which he wouldn't drink.  I had some.  I was terrified.  Did he know what I was thinking?  People who were really married always knew what the other was thinking, Merrilyn had said.<p>Oh, Merrilyn. Merrilyn was in the next room,
 in my bed, in his bed.<p>I went to wake her up.  She was sleeping with her hair all spilled out across the pillow, and for a moment I watched her, trusting and defenseless, like I had so many times that summer.<p>Then I reached down and shook her hard. <p>






"Merrilyn, you have to go," I said. <p>She was sleepy and confused, and her blue eyes were swollen from crying.<p>"Merrilyn, Toby's here.  My husband's here. He's alive, and he's home." <p>She looked up at me, bewildered.<p>"Didn't you want to go back to 









Boston?" I said. <p>"Who's here?" she said.<p>"You wanted to go to Boston!" I said. "Now go!"<PRE> </PRE>I sent her out into the cold October night. I sent her home.   My husband didn't even ask who she was.<PRE> </PRE>Toby needed sleep, and I put him to bed in Merrilyn's place.   Alone in the front room, I unpacked his duffel bag, putting his loose army medals in a row on the kitchen table. I knew I would have to pack it again soon when we moved away somewhere, moved someplace together.  I drank the rest of the coffee myself, my lungs filling with air, with the sound of the waves in the background and the beach right outside our door, and the daylight only a few hours away. </h3> </TD>
