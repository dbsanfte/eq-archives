<H2>Novel Preparation: Things A Crazy Person Does</h2>
<p>
Taking on a huge project like a novel is sort of like trimming a meadow with a nail clippers.   It certainly can be done, but, hell, where do you start? 
<p>
It's a funny thing, writing a novel.  Because you are creating an alternate reality, it requires you to act like a crazy person while you put it together. 
<p><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="loft.gif"<p>
I do profiles of every character.  I think about what they wear, what they eat, where they went to school, what their first romances were like.  I choose residences for them around the city, and later, when I walk past, I look in their windows and think about what they are up to. 
<p>Let us be frank: these are the actions of a crazy person.  But if you don't believe in the people you create, how can you expect anyone else to?
<p>
I do a lot of site research, walking all over Manhattan taking snapshots of where my characters walk, work, and socialize.  <p><h5>The winning loft</h5><h3>
For example, this novel starts at a party on Washington Street, and on one of the hottest days of the year I walked the entire length of Washington Street, looking for a suitable second-floor loft.<p>
Naming the characters is fun; many of them go through several names before I decide on one I like.  This is a real benefit to my line of work.  The average woman gets to name one? three? ten? people in a lifetime.  An author gets to name dozens and dozens. 
<p>
The plot, I work out through an outline, which goes through endless revisions. I like to know where I'm going, or at least where I intend to go, even if I don't ultimately end up there.
