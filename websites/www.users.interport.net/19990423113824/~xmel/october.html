<H2>Silly Author Photos</h2>
The point of this site is not to put big pictures of me all over the Internet.  It's to let you read these stories, which is why I make you read to the end of at least one of them before finding a link to my biography. 
<p>
But I like to keep the site fresh, and my photo on <a HREF="whois.html">Who Is Xander Mellish?</a> is nearly a year old.  This month, I thought it was about time to change my author photograph.

Author photos on traditional books are guaranteed to look nothing like the actual author.  It's always fun to go to a book-signing and see the real-life schlub behind the airbrushed demigod. 
<p>
The absolute worst photos are the literary ones, those artsy, pained portraits that seem to say  "A book contract hasn't made me happy! I'm still alienated!" <p>.<p> <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="authorphoto4.gif"border=0>
I also like the author photos you see on the back of mass-market paperbacks, those ones where the sixty-year-old authors have been all whitened out to make them look as if they were thirty-five.  Fiction fans:  I have heard from good sources that Jackie Collins wears make-up even on her hands.  In this sample mass-market photo, I have whitened out my face so you can't tell that I am 28. 
<p>
Actually, one of my own favorite pictures of myself is another cartoon - one by Don Bevan, whose celebrity caricatures I fell in love with at Sardi's, the old theater hangout on Broadway.  I wrote to Don in Studio City, California, asking if he'd do a sketch of me, and he kindly did so on the back of an envelope. I think it's an uncanny likeness, seeing that we never met in person.  You can see that cartoon at the top of this page.<p>
