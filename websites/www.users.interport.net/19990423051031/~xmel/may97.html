  <h2>I Attempt To Run A Forum</h2>
<p>
I have a terrible secret:  I am an Internet solipsist. <p>Between writing the stories, drawing the cartoons, working a full-time job, and maintaining this site, I have very little time to look at anybody else's site. <p>I mostly use the Internet to cancel my record-club selections. Clearly, I am not doing my part to maintain the Internet's sense of community.  In a karmic sense, probably nobody should be coming to my site at all.<p> <IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="cybergrrl.gif" border=0>That's why when Aliza Sherman, the founder of Cybergrrls, was looking for some volunteers to run forums in the new Cybergrrl Village, I put up my hand to do a "Writing and Publishing" group. <p>I've met so many other writers on the Internet, and I thought it would be good for them all to have a place to hang out. <p>It's also crucial to have a place to discuss important questions of our literary era, such as "Are good-looking writers better writers?" (The publishing industry seems to think so).
<p>Although the Cybergrrl Village is geared towards women, gentlemen are welcome if they behave that way. <p>Just go to http://village.cybergrrl.com/, and when it asks for your password, hit "cancel".  They'll set you up as a member of the group right away.

  <h2>New Domain Name: xmel.com</h2>
Many of you found this site through links, and others typed this site's original URL, http://www.interport.net/~xmel.
<p>
The hippest among you, however, know this site's has its own domain, www.xmel.com.<p>
Why in the world do I need my own domain name?<p>
Snobbishness and vanity is part of it, I suppose.<p>But the new address is also much shorter and easier to give out.  And a lot of people still have trouble finding the Tilde on the keyboard.  God knows modern literature faces enough other roadblocks. <p>
