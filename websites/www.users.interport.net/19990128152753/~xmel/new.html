<h2>A Gift From Sante Klaas: A New Dutch Version</h2>
The new <a HREF="nederland.html">Dutch version</a> of this site, our eighth foreign-language version, did not actually come from Santa Claus at all.
<P>
It comes from Jeroen van Bergeijk, a reporter for the Dutch paper NRC Handelsblad.  Jeroen also wrote a <a HREF="http://www.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/NY/291098a.html">great piece</a> about <a HREF="webwriters.html"><FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Web Writers In The Flesh</FONT></a> earlier this fall. 
<p>
The foreign-language versions have always been a bit of an incomplete science.  Nobody, not even the craziest fan, is willing to translate this entire sprawling site into any language;  I haven't done it myself for the French and German versions.
<P>
But the foreign-language versions do bring us overseas fans who can then enjoy the stories in English.<P>Or, in some cases, just enjoy the cartoons:  I seem to be very big among Spanish speakers.  I get a lot of e-mail in Spanish.

<h2>What You Can Expect From This Site In 1999</h2>
<P>Keeping this site as a living being is important to me, even though much of my attention these days is being directed towards my new web serial <a HREF="http://www.5georgewashingtons.com/"><FONT COLOR="1E6E00">Five George Washingtons</FONT></a>.
<P>
I wish I could say there were more short stories on the way, but right now, there aren't. 
<p>
There ARE long-delayed cartoons nearly finished, however, for <a HREF="matchstart.html">Matchmaking Creeps</a> and for <a HREF="kingstart.html"><FONT COLOR="cca514">King and Queen of an Empty Kingdom</FONT></a>.
<P>
I also have been tinkering around with a new project called <a HREF="http://www.5georgewashingtons.com/machine/machine.html">A Machine For Breaking Hearts</a>, for which a hundred story lines have already been though of, all of them bad.  The idea was to do something entirely different, but I haven't quite figured out what that might be, yet.

  <H2>The Story Behind This Project</h2>
  This web site is part of a project I began four years ago, 
  partly out of 
  frustration. I was writing a lot of short stories, but I was 
  having 
  trouble finding readers.<p>
  Meanwhile, the streets around my apartment in New York City 
  were full of 
  posters advertising bands and theater events. So I decided 
  to turn my 
  stories into posters.<p>
  The first posters were only the typed first pages of each 
  story, with a 
  phone number at the bottom people could call if they wanted 
  to read the 
  rest. I put them up all over the city, on lamp posts and in 
  subway 
  stations and in laundromats, any place people might have 
  spare time to 
  read.<p>
  I got hundreds of phone calls, and a lot of interested 
  readers.  People 
  would call and ask questions about the characters. Some 
  actors got 
  together and made one of the stories into a play. I had 
  fans.
   <p>Putting up 
  the posters, which I usually did running away from cops in 
  the middle of 
  the night, was an experience in itself.  One old drunken bum 
  in a subway 
  station on Second Avenue read the poster aloud in a voice as 
  deep and 
  lyrical as Paul Robeson. I made a deal with some anarchists 
  who were 
  putting up posters demanding war against the fascist state 
  that we 
  wouldn't cover up each others' work. A drug dealer on 
  St. Mark's Place stopped selling Xanax long enough to ask 
  for a story, 
  take it, and tuck it carefully into his pocket. Also, I saw 
  a lot of very 
  big rats. <p>
  Once the posters were up, I used to spy on people reading 
  them. People 
  are very suspicious in New York about calling a stranger's 
  phone number: I 
  think I probably had twenty readers for every one caller. It 
  was tough 
  duty sometimes: 
  there's no more honest criticism than when you can see 
  someone walk away 
  after the first paragraph. But I was really happy to see 
  people of 
  every size 
  and shape reading the posters - school kids, homeless 
  people, Wall Street 
  yuppies, black girls in gangs, old ladies, everybody.  So 
  much 
  conventionally published fiction in 
  the U.S. is read only by a little subset of white, educated 
  - maybe 
  overeducated - literary snobs. It was cool to see my stories 
  read by 
  everybody.
  <p>
  Since the election of a new New York City mayor in 1993, 
  putting up 
  posters has become rather futile. The city's run better now, 
  and 
  the lamp posts get cleaned, usually overnight.  
  <p>
  Fortunately, with the help of the Internet, I can now reach 
  readers all over 
  the 
  world.
  <p>This site has now been operating since September, 1995, 
  and has 
  received more than 150,000 visitors, generating more than 
 2,000,000 hits. <p>
