<h5>The Manhattan Internet Lounge, before the show.<pre>  </pre>
<h3>
The crowd at the Monday, May 11th episode of <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Web Writers In The Flesh<FONT COLOR="#000000"> was smaller than at the previous two readings: no more than sixty people braved the fifteenth day of a rainstorm to reach the Manhattan Internet Lounge.
<p>
It wasn't a bad thing. <p>Gallery technical director Sean Gibbons turned down the lights, and there was an intimate feel in the dark loft on Broadway.
<p>First up was <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Xander Mellish<FONT COLOR="#000000">, who read an excerpt from her comic revenge fantasy <a HREF="match.html">Matchmaking Creeps</a>. It was set to the music from the Bouronville ballet "La Sylphide." <IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="may112.gif"border=0> 
<p>Next was <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Victoria Ludwin<FONT COLOR="#000000">,   delivering a funny urban essay about a hairdresser who promised to transform her - and didn't. 
<p><FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Tyler Thoreson<FONT COLOR="#000000">, a last-minute addition to the schedule, was a real hit with the audience.  He read a piece about the humiliations of a New York fact-checker, as seen through a haze of anti-depressants.<h5>Web Writers.

<p>If the first three readers performed traditional pieces merely transmitted on the web, <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Ayelet Sela<FONT COLOR="#000000"> showed how to take advantage of the new medium.  Her excerpts from the online version of NBC's "Homicide" made use of RealAudio, RealVideo, and a changing palette of colorful images.
<p>
Long ago, the Manhattan Internet Lounge was a leather warehouse, and <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Terry Baker<FONT COLOR="#000000"> used to work there.  Whatever leather spirits remained must have been on Terry's side: on Monday, he was the highlight of the show.  Reading an essay about life with HIV, he was intensely emotional but never maudlin.
<p>The show ended on a cheerful note, with <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Brett Leveridge<FONT COLOR="#000000"> reading from his pioneering website, "Men My Mother Dated."  Brett's mother had a heck of a lot of fun.
<p>
The evening wrapped up with a quick round of applause for Sean Gibbons, who managed the sound, lighting, and all the technical hookups.<p>Before next week's reading, Sean has promised to do something about the weather.
