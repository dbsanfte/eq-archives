<h2>Next Month: This Site's Second Anniversary</h2>
<p>
Next month is the second anniversary of this site, so this will be a busy month for me.<p>
As part of the birthday celebration, I hope to add new readings to the voices page, at least one new story, new photographs (including one for <a HREF="whois.html">Who Is Xander Mellish</a>) and an archives section that will collect old stuff. 
<p>
Two years ago, when the Web was still called "Mosaic", Erik Gavriluk, then of Microsoft, volunteered to help me put the stories in a numbered FTP file.<p>I sent him disks of stories and cartoons in large manila envelope. He quickly became remarkably busy and stopped responding to my phone calls.<p> Ultimately, I got an HTML Book - Laura LeMay's - and learned how to program my own site.<p>In retrospect, that was a blessing in disguise, I think, because it let me control all the creative aspects of the site.<p>I still do all the programming by hand - no HTML software involved.

<h2>Too Many Mediums: This Site Makes Radio And TV Appearances</h2>
<p>
Isn't it irritating when sites list their clips?  I mean, really, who cares, except the site author's mother?  My mom collects all of this site's clips in a nice book for our coffee table in Wisconsin.    
<p>
That said, Pam Mendel's recent <a HREF ="http://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/digimet/072897digimet.html">Cybertimes 
</a> is a nice account of RealAudio radio reading several of us did for the upcoming "Coffeehouse: Writings From The Web" web fiction anthology.  (See <a HREF="july97.html#vier">July News</a>).  
<p>
You can hear the whole show, if you like, through
<a HREF= "http://pseudo.com/netcast/shows/gpoetry/archives/gpoetryJul24_1997_0242pm.ram">Go Poetry</a>, which sponsored the reading.
