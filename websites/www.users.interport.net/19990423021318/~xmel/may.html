<H2>Blaue Blume Continues</H2>
"<a HREF="blumestart.html">Blaue Blume</a>", the first entirely new story I've begun in more than a year, continues in May.
<p>
I'm afraid I have to blame "Blaue Blume" for not having more to add to the site this month.  When I'm caught up in a story, everything else seems to go out the window. 
<p>
Like many writers, I work incredibly slowly - every line you see on the screen has probably been rewritten at least 25 times!

Reading large blocks of text onscreen can make your eyeballs swim like little fish. <p>
To break up all that verbage, I've added cartoon dingbats to each of the stories, except for "<a HREF="fireworks.html">Fireworks and Soup</a>," for which I can't think of anything suitable.<p> Any <a HREF="mailto:xmel@aol.com">suggestions?</a>
