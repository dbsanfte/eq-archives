<h2>Greta Floating, Lillian Straight Ahead:  A New Story</h2>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="gretaicon.gif" border=0>
<a HREF="greta.html">Greta Floating, Lillian Straight Ahead</a> is a short-short story - less than 1000 words, or two typed pages in Times Roman. <p>
Nevertheless, it's been my primary focus all summer, along with the serial <a HREF="glorylist.html">Glory in the Golden Apple</a>.  I've spent a lot of time working on it in the flower gardens at St. James-in-the-fields Church, on Hudson Street near Christopher.
<p>Short-short stories are hard, as I found out during the six years I worked on the three typed pages of <a HREF=charlottestart.html>Charlotte's Mirror</a>.
<p>
You have very little room to make your point - there's no margin for error.  Still, if you have only one point to make, as <a HREF="greta.html">Greta</a> does, 1000 words is long enough to make it.   The trick is getting the right 1000 words. 
<p>
The title is from a two-panel composition I was assigned in a long-forgotten graphic arts class.  It showed silent film actresses Greta Garbo and Lillian Gish.   I've always liked the title, and have long wanted to write a story to fit it. 
<p>
<a HREF="greta.html">Greta</a> is also the only story on the site which has a dedication - to the very successful journalist, and my onetime friend, Maer Roshan.

<h2>
Color Theory on a Black-and-White Site</h2>
<p>
Symbolism fans will notice that "Greta Floating, Lillian Straight Ahead"  is largely a story about the color red. <p>
For a project done mostly in black and white, the stories on this site depend heavily on color. 
<p>
Shades of pink play roles in <a HREF="amystart.html">Amy Beauty Rose</a>, <a HREF="charlottestart.html">Charlotte's Mirror</a>,  and <a HREF="doestart.html">Doe</a>;  blue is a character in <a HREF="lonelystart.html">In A Lonely Place</a>, <a HREF="firestart.html">Fireworks and Soup</a>, and, of course, in the <a HREF="blumestart.html">Blue Flower of Happiness</a>. 
<p>
Gold gets name-checked in <a HREF="glorylist.html">Glory in the Golden Apple</a> silver in <a HREF="amystart.html">Amy Beauty Rose</a>, and white in <a HREF="jeunestart.html">White City</a>.   Diana's black hair distinguishes her in <a HREF="extrastart.html">Extraordinary.</a>
<p>
I have so far written no stories about yellow, purple, or orange, probably because the words themselves don't sound very nice.
<p>
However, green fans, my newest story - barely underway, now, and not likely to premiere for several months - features a heroine named Olive Hurst. <p>
