The May 18th <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Web Writers In The Flesh<FONT COLOR="#000000"> was the final episode of this spring season, and it offered one of the finest selections of web literature yet. 
<p>
Leading off the show was <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Kim Ficera<FONT COLOR="#000000">, with a very funny excerpt from her on-line serial "Gays of Our Lives."  
<p>
Following Kim was <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Assistant Professor Audrey Steinhauer<FONT COLOR="#000000">, who put web fiction into a (highly) academic context. 
<p>
Having had its intellectual vitamins for the evening, the crowd enjoyed <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Leslie Harpold<FONT COLOR="#000000">'s accessible, contemporary essays, one about the fellatial subtext to those Milk Mustache ads. 
<p>
<FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Sean Elder<FONT COLOR="#000000"> was up next with one of the evening's highlights - a dark account of a drinker's trip, with his young son, to Disneyland.
<p>
<FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Xander Mellish<FONT COLOR="#000000"> followed with her cartoon series, <a HREF="joel.html">Joel Faure: The Melancholy Male Model</a>. Beautiful but lonely, Joel wanders Manhattan searching for love, to the tune of Aaron Copeland's "Quiet City."   He is based on a real person, but Xander swears she will never reveal <a HREF="http://www.nycballet.com/danceBios.html">who that is</a>.
<p>
<FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Austin Bunn<FONT COLOR="#000000"> rounded out the evening with two very pleasing poems. 
<p>
Thanks to everyone who helped make this reading series such a roaring success!<p>  <FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">Web Writers in the Flesh<FONT COLOR="#000000"> will be back in the fall.
