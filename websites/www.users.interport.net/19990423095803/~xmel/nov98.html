<H2>A Long Overdue Site Redesign</h2>
<p>
After more than three years on the web, this site was in dire need of a
redesign.  HTML has come a long way since September, 1995.
<p>This month it debuts.
<p>At first glance, not much has changed:  the first three pages entering
the site look pretty much the same.
<p>The stories themeselves, however, have become easier to read, through
the judicious use of columns and tables and other stuff I've absorbed
during my tenure at <a HREF="http://www.abc.com">abc.com.</a>
<p>I've kept the basic black and white look of the site, which readers have
said they liked - it's been called "retro","gentle" and "the only black
and white site on the web" - while adding some carefully-chosen color.
<p>In fact, each story now has its own color, relating to some event within
the story -  cherry like the famous cherry in a bottle of vodka in <a HREF="doestart.html"><FONT COLOR="b6143c">Doe</font></a>
; green like the grass Lulu sees at the railroad station in <a HREF="firestart.html"><FONT COLOR="43af00">Extraordinary</font></a>.  Future scholars, on your marks.
<p>By the way, I've also replaced that awful "wings" icon for <a HREF="matchstart.html">Matchmaking Creeps</a> with a very hip voodoo doll.  There's actually no voodoo doll in
the story, but since it's a revenge fantasy, I thought it was
appropriate anyway.

<H2>Back To Merchantilism!  We Start Selling Cartoons Again</h2>
<P>
Long ago, this site sold poster versions of its first logo.   Now, our
sister site, "Five George Washingtons", sells poster versions, while
this site has opted towards high art.
<p>Once again, this site will sell cartoon originals, for $100 and up, unframed.   <a 
  HREF="mailto:xmel@aol.com"> E-mail me</a> for details about specific cartoons.
<p>Someday, these cartoons may really be worth something.    If so, my heirs - at this
point, mostly second-cousins in Texas - may be furious that I sold them
all at this low-low price.
<p>On the other hand, they may just be happy that I've paid off my Visa
bill.
