<H2>Blaue Blume, A New Story</H2>
The first page of "<a HREF="blumestart.html">Blaue Blume</a>", the first entirely new story I've begun in more than a year, was added to the site on the first of April.
<p>
All stories on this site begin with a single page, because most of them were originally single-page street posters. (See <a HREF=#fumf>The Story Behind</a> This Project)<p>
The rest of "Blaue Blume", as well as the accompanying cartoon, is still 
under construction.<br>.<p> <h5>Unfinished 
cartoon of Claire from "Blaue Blume"</h5>

Reading large blocks of text onscreen can make your eyeballs swim like little fish. <p>
To break up all that verbage, I've added cartoon dingbats to each of the stories, except for "<a HREF="firestart.html">Fireworks and Soup</a>," for which I can't think of anything suitable.<p> Any <a HREF="mailto:xmel@aol.com">suggestions?</a><p>.<p>.<p>.

<h5>Cherry dropped in a bottle of vodka, in "Doe."</h5><p>.
