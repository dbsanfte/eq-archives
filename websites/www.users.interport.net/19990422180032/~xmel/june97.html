  <h2>In Which I Lose The Thread</h2>
<p>
"Glory And The Golden Apple" was supposed to be a weekly serial, and several stories on the site are still lying around half-finished, but hey, it's been a hell of a month.
<p>
I lost my job at Dow Jones, where I've worked as a journalist for more than 5 years, in a round of layoffs.  It's been a very painful experience, and it isn't over yet.  My family's been great, but a lot of friends weren't around when I needed them. 
<p>
Fortunately, I'd scheduled a May trip to Paris, so I was able to get away from all this misery and woe for a while.   Once there, it occurred to me that I could spend the whole summer and a great deal of money on therapy to figure out why I felt so bad, or I could blow the same amount on new clothes in Paris and spend the summer going to parties and feeling just fine.
<p>
I chose Option B. <p>
By the way, for those with an interest in fashion, Paris is showing a lot of browns and golds this year, and the skirts aren't as short as Vogue magazine might have us believe. 
<p>
Anyway, now that I'm unemployed, I plan to spend a lot more time on writing and on this web site, so look forward to more good stuff.

  <h2>The Never-Ending Story: Blue Flower</h2>
<p>
The first story that needs to be finished is "Blue Flower".  I get constant complaints from readers about this.
<p>
Vale@qnet.com writes, "In my twenty years on this planet I have never read anything that so compelled me to continue as this story does."   Says Jdunshee@freeway.net, "You must _must_ finish this story."  And Anais126@aol.com asks, "Are you ever going to finish writing Blue Flower of Happiness?  It's a really good story and I want to read the rest of it and find out what happens."
<p>
They're right;  I should get my act together.  
<p>
As regular readers may know, there was an ending at one point, but it didn't work, and I've removed it.
<p>
Here's my pledge:  "Blue Flower" will be finished by the end of this summer, one way or another.  As soon as my layoff takes effect, in mid-June, I plan to start working on it full-time.
