<H2>New Version Of Charlotte's Mirror</H2>

"Charlotte's Mirror" is by far my most problematic story.  Although it's only three pages long in print, it's been through dozens if not hundreds of re-writes, none of which entirely satisfy me.
<p>
The most recent version shows the results of suggestions by Cherie Brooks, an editor I hired after auditioning about a dozen candidates.  Cherie is a playwright herself, but she seems to understand where my stories are headed, and what they're about on a sort of macro level that I can't see.  She pointed out, for example, that "Charlotte's Mirror" was at its root a story about envy - about how our commmercial culture manufactures celebrities who are supposedly superior to us as a means to sell products, and how our inchoate discontent with ourselves is a byproduct of this manufactured envy.  
<p>
 Of course, if I had really been thinking about that when I wrote the story, it would have turned out terribly fatuous.  There's nothing worse a young writer can do than take herself too seriously.  I'm glad I can pay Cherie to think these deep thoughts. 
<p>
I still can't say I'm entirely satisfied with the story, but I'm more satisfied with it than I was a month ago.  Some day it may even be finished.

<H2>Scary Publicity About This Site</H2>

I've worked hard to bring readers to this site.   I've sent out thousands of postcards and press releases, and hundreds of e-mails proposing the exchange of links, and shaken dozens of hands at Internet schmooze parties.  I get mad every time I see other sites being written about, and vow to get as much attention for my site, and myself.  I always thought it would be fun to be a celebrity so that I could do things like date Brett from <a href="http://konpeito.bekkoame.or.jp./~ikkan/suede.html">Suede</a>.
<p>
That's why I'm surprised at my own mixed feelings about a story that ran June 25 in the San Francisco Chronicle.
<p>
It was my first major-media exposure, aside from a National Public Radio feature  three years ago,  and just the sort of thing to impress my parents, who are none too convinced of my artistic talent.   And it was certainly a complimentary piece.   One colleague who read it said he thought the author was in love with me.
<p>
The author, Jesse Kornbluth, is not in love with me, although he is a very nice man.   Nevertheless, it was still disconcerting to be written about, rather than writing myself.   The subject of a story, I discovered, has very little control over what's in it, and Jesse didn't write what I would have written.  It also bothers me that people always seem more excited about my publishing methods than my stories.   The whole point of this site isn't REALLY so I can date <a href="http://www.nycballet.com/Bios/SotoBio.html">Jock Soto</a> and Brett from <a href="http://konpeito.bekkoame.or.jp./~ikkan/suede.html">Suede</a>.   It's to bring readers to the stories. 
<p>
Anyway, I've chalked it all up to experience, and I made a lot of Xeroxes for my parents and their friends.   Despite all the excitement, visits to this site didn't increase much after the article ran - proof, I think, of how isolated the on-line world remains from the world of print.
