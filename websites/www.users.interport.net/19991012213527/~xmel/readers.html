The Web has three great advantages over print: independence (from big capital, which allows people like me to publish), immediacy (no more two-year wait for a manuscript to reach the bookstores), and interactivity.
<p>
I get a lot of mail, and I try to publish a fair selection of it.  Some people are very supportive, while others don't like what I do.  That doesn't bother me - sincerely, it doesn't.  I don't take criticism to heart, perhaps a result of having so many ye
ars of my journalistic works blue-penciled to some editor's whims. 
<p>
I'm anxious to hear <a HREF="mailto:xmel@aol.com">your reaction</a> to 
the stories too.

As a young, hopeful, fellow writer/artist I do 
believe what you are doing is marvelous. I shall be back often.

What a find. You say you're indifferent to criticism. I hope you don't fee the same about praise. You're bound to get lots of it. Now I'm going back to read more.

The more I see of the cartoons, the more I like them. They appear
to be quite original & they set a kind of mood even without the caption. The
caption kind of synergizes the effect, I think. The drawing style is
excellent.
<P> These remarks are from someone who most people call excessively
critical, hard to please, etc. Eg. I didn't care for "Midnight iin the
Garden of Good & Evil, thought "East of the Mtns." a near dud, thought "Cold
mountain" beautifully written but got emotionally turned off on about half
way thru & didn't finish.
<P>I think I know crap when I see it, but those
cartoons are by somebody who ought to get more recognition.

Dear Ms. Mellish, I would like to take a moment of your valuable time to mention that I would like to ask you for a small request. If it is possible, I would sincerely appreciate receiving a personally autographed photo of you. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

This is just a quick note to let you know I've read every last episode of <a HREF="http://www.5georgewashington.com/">Five George Washingtons</a> and enjoyed every word. <P> I'm no expert at any of this, but I know what I like, and as a happy coincidence, what I like often happens to be very good. I like <a HREF="http://www.5georgewashington.com/">Five George Washingtons</a> very much, and I think that if your agent doesn't like this book, it might be time for you to get a new agent.
<P>
The other thing is, I keep seeing film when I read this story.  Has that idea entered your mind at all?  A full-length animated film would be wonderful, and probably do good at the New York Film Festival or similar venue.<P>  And speaking of that I like the way you parody the whole Silicon Alley phenom and pay homage to it at the same time, sort of like you're poking sharply perceptive but loving fun at close friend or family member.<P>  I've developed something of an affinity with Veda, and I'm very sorry to witness the mess she seems to be stepping in. Whatever future forms this story takes, I'll be watching.  Thanks for the read.

What a surprise - gentleness on the net.  <P> It's like going on a sleepaway as an adult with a friend from first grade you had forgotten, all new and growingly familiar.<P>
How do you do it?   It's spiritualized, but then again not.

Hi Mellish
<P>
I've read through <a HREF="blumestart.html">The Blue Flower of Happiness</a> and it's real thing!
Beautiful and personal.
How can you write such story? But, why does it seem that the story stop
in the middle as it ends with 'unhappiness'?
But no doubt, I like the story.
<p>
I am from Indonesia (you know it? Perhaps our Bali is more
wellknown).<P>Now I am reading your <a HREF="doestart.html">DOE</a>.
 To tell you, I am an editor for an English-based newspaper namely The
Indonesian Daily News base in Surabaya (East Java) and I like stories
very much. I read stories after the working hour when I am sick of
political news.<P>
  Regards,
  Ribut Wahyudi (Ribut means 'Noise' in English)

Dear Xander:
I absolutely adored your <a HREF="glorylist.html">Golden Apple</a> serial. I'm also a member of the (gasp) media, and so much of what you wrote rings true.  I laughed out loud many times reading your work and praying that when I move to New York City this
 June, I'll have saner colleagues (like in journalism anyone's sane--ha :) )

Hello Xander! The next time some fool tells you that you can't write, send 'em to me!  I've had great fun with your site.

<h3>
For all of my 18 years I have been hoping to find stories with
characters so real and problems so trivial but important and you're it!
In away I see myself in some of these same situations but unable to act
out accordingly, and as some of these same characters. Your an
inspiration to modern day writers who long to escape the stereotypical
stories of a damsel in distress rescued by her handsome yet troubled
Prince Charming. I would love to turn you're stories into beautiful
short movies and be able to convey the feelings of your stories to all.</h3>

When I first stumbled across your site I was really taken aback. The
first three or four stories I read seemed fresh and innovative. However,
the more I read, the clearer the limitations of your stories become. For
example, <a HREF="jeunestart.html">White City</a> is a story which absolutely did not need to be told.
<p>It was a simple reworking of <a HREF="lonelystart.html">In A Lonely Place.</a> In fact, virtualy all
your stories look at the same two characters. The insecure, naive,
unsure, and essentially colourless first person narrator, and the
'extraordinary' extravert he or she meets and keeps or looses. 
<p>One story that really should have been censored is
<a HREF="extrastart.html">Extraordinary.</a> The female protagonist in this one annoyed me beyond
endurance. <p>Of course, I still have faith in you as a writer, because your style is
just so good. However, you seem to be standing still rather than
progressing in any real way. You need to stretch yourself. You need
fresh challenges. Your stories basically feel a lot like your cartoons:
aestethically pleasing, instantly charming, but ultimately confined by
their own simplicity.<p>
<DD><h4><FONT COLOR="#871F78">gerald.naughton@ucg.ie</font><p>
<h3>Hi Xander, LOVE YOUR WEBSITE!! It's really fresh, and I love the 
cartoons! Black and white is a really striking combination, but here's a 
suggestion-- you need to have your picture in colour! Lots of love, Dana

To me, all Xander's stories are exactly the same, except with
different names and different occupations for the characters.  The
personalities of most all her characters are the same; they're people
(primarily women) who are unhappy with their lives and do very little
about it except get involved with unfortunate people who are probably
bad for them.  They're unhappy with their jobs yet settle for them.
The only woman I recall who does something about her work situation
(Lana--I forget the story) gets ahead by looks & devious means, so
it's fairly stereotyped as well.  I think most of her female
characters are pathetic and sad, and her male ones don't do anything
for me, either. 
<p>
Having said that, I thought <a HREF="extrastart.html">Extraordinary</a> and <a HREF="glorylist.html">Glory In The Golden Apple</a>
were the most interesting and there was another one whose title I
can't remember that I liked a little.</h3>

I love your writings. I think you are a very clever woman. It is very
rare that you meet women with such a creative mind. </h3>
<DD><h4><FONT COLOR="#871F78">northington@juno.com</font></h4>
<p><h3>
I like your vignettes, <a HREF="amystart.html">Amy Beauty Rose</a> and <a HREF="blumestart.html">Blue Flower</a>, because they're
infinitely sad in some ways but without pathos. Reading them, I feel
vicariously, through the writer, the sensation of being down, out,
ripped off, thwarted, frustrated, but not dispirited. The leimotif
running through the tales is the cry of ambition, however modest, and
also that for dignity.

I was expecting so much more.  It reads like primetime television. Your illustrations are very appealing
and they usually entice me to read what is behind them...only to be left
with the sence of being underwhelmed.  This is, in my opinion, geared for a young female group.</h3>

I wish to use some text from your site above in a sermon illustration
magazine to which I contribute.  It would appear like this:
<p>
"Xander Mellish writes, <a HREF="blumestart.html">I came out of the office and it was morning.
The sun overhead was brilliant, but the shadow of the tall buildings
blocked the light to the street. In New York, there are buildings all
around you, so no matter what direction you pray there is always
something between you and God, and you end up praying to that. </a>
What barrier stands between us and the mystery of incarnation?"
<p>
The Lord be with you as you continue to provide a breath of fresh air in
cyberspace with some very creative writings and drawings.</h3>

<h3>My name is Lana Rutter. I am from England. I'm 13 yrs old.
I think your site is really good. I don't normally read stories on the net, but for my English homework we had to write a short story, and your page really helped me. THANK YOU.

I didn't copy your work, I just got ideas from it.

I stumbled across your work during a half hearted Sunday night meander across the Web, and was captivated.  The words that you claim to have stuck onto lamp posts, into laundromats and into pizza parlours, should have been flown from flagpoles, snuck unde
r welcome mats as pleasant presents, and have had pizzas named after them  (the Glory Pizza - slightly acidic, but juicy and tasty and full of colour?  Many calories, for energy to be consumed means calories).

I don't think <a HREF="charlottestart.html">Charlotte's Mirror</a> is very good. Actually. the story is ok....   
it's Charlotte that doesn't seem very well developed. She seems like a   
character based on someone you know and hate, and so you end up making   
her crazy and unlikeable. Her dialogue is a bit surreal.<P> However, I did   
find In A Lonely Place to be almost unbearably moving in a way I can't   
express. </H3><DD><h4><FONT COLOR="#871F78">

<p>
<h3><a HREF="lonelystart.html">In a Lonely Place</a> would make a great movie, but only if it were done 
like a European film rather than a Hollywood one. I think it has a lot 
to say without hitting readers over the head. I could imagine all the 
scenes in my head. If I were a filmmaker, I'd ask you for the rights!</h3>

<p><h3>I want you to know how much I enjoyed your stories, I printed all of them 
and I am putting them in a binder so that they can be enjoyed forever.
You are an excellent writer.  I hope you will soon get a wonderful contract by 
one of the best publishing houses.  I am surprised that one of them has 
not grabbed you already.

I linked to your page in an amusing way.  Having remarked to a friend, "If you have a fetish for sex with air conditioners, there's 
probably already a newsgroup for it on the Internet,"  I got to thinking, "I wonder if it's true?"
<p>
Next time I logged on, I went to Alta Vista, which is a service that 
searches millions of Web documents to match key words.  The service lets 
you look for words near each other, so I entered "sex NEAR air NEAR 
condition*."    
<p>
There were 23 matches, one of them your story <a HREF="amystart.html">Amy Beauty Rose.</a>  The 
quote:

  "I can't have sex with the air conditioning on," I said finally.      
  "It's too cold. There's no sweat." 
<p>
Upon reading your story, I realized that some people DO have sex with 
air conditioners and while people prefer sex without them!
