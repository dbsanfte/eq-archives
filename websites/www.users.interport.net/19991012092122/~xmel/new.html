<H2>Why I Suddenly Feel Much Better</H2>
Feeling low?  Out of sorts?  Do what I did - fire your agent! <p>
Your spirits should improve immeasurably.  Mine have, since I dispatched my incredibly well-connected, incredibly fabulous, incredibly hateful literary agent two weeks ago.   Fans, let me suggest this:  even if you don't HAVE an agent, get one and then fire her.  It works wonders. 
<P>
I won't go into details, since my former agent has a lot of lawyers on her side, but suffice to say this:  I thought it was her job to sell what I wrote.  She, on the other hand, thought it was my job to write something she could sell.

<P>
I tend to be an overly good-hearted person.  There are few people in the world I make the effort to dislike. <P> However, if that agent were to be loaded into the Mars Climate Orbiter and mistakenly fired past the planet, forcing her to drift for eternity through outer space, I wouldn't be too upset.

<H2>Please Give Me a Job</H2>
Ordinarily, I take great pains not to mix this website and my paying jobs.   It's kind of a wife vs. mistress situation for me, one in which I vastly prefer the mistress - this site - but it's just as well as the wife doesn't know.   Or, if she does know, that she be allowed to save face and pretend she doesn't know.  You get the idea.
<P>
But the situation is different, now, because my paying job at <a HREF="http://abc.go.com/">ABC.com</a> is leaving me, moving to Disney HQ in Los Angeles.   I don't want to move to Los Angeles, which is too far from Paris  (where I also don't want to move, but like to visit on a regular basis).  Ergo, I need a new job.   
<P>
I have a great deal of experience, as you can see from my <a HREF="resume.html">resume</a>, having worked as a journalist, a TV producer, and an Internet hack.   I like new media, and would like to continue working in that field.<P>
<a 
 HREF="mailto:xmel@aol.com">Any offers?</a>  I can promise a signed work of original cartoon art, as seen on this site, to the person who suggests the job I ultimately take. 
<P>
Extra points if anyone knows of jobs in any field in Copenhagen, where the food is great and the guys are gorgeous.  Really.
