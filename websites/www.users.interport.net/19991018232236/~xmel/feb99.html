<H2>Very Bad Things: Why I Missed A Month</h2>
<p>
Last month, for the first time since I began doing a monthly news update in March 1996, I skipped a month.
<p>
This was an educational experience:  I learned that there are a lot of people out there who visit the site every month.  
<p>
I also learned that a lot of them don't come through the front door of this site, where I usually put the month's best new cartoon.  They bookmark this page.  Since this page hadn't changed, they assumed there was nothing new on the site in January.
<p>
Actually, there was: a new cartoon for <A HREF="matchcartoon.html">Matchmaking Creeps</a>, as well as a fifth chapter of <FONT COLOR="1E6E00">Five George Washingtons.</FONT>
<p>So why didn't I update this page? 
<p>It's a lame excuse, but I just got overwhelmed.  The combined stress of working full time at <a HREF="http://abcnews.go.com">ABCNEWS.com</a> website - where I wrote catchy little headlines for the front page - of working on the <FONT COLOR="1E6E00">Washingtons</FONT>, and on that website, of working on my bimonthly <a HREF="http://www.mostnewyork.com/1999-01-21/New_York_Now/Cityscape/a-17123.asp">New York City history column</a> and on <a HREF="http://articles.citysearch.com/New_York/dance/990104/">ballet pieces for Citysearch</a>, was just too much. 
<p>Anyway, I've taken the first two weeks of February off to get my act together.   This should result, I hope, in a new <FONT COLOR="#9090FF">Joel Faur&#233;</FONT> episode, as well as additional chapters of the Washingtons.

<H2>The State of Washington: Is This A Sellout?</h2>
<p>
Among the things that are new this month on the site is a <a HREF="vedalist.html">new entryway</a> to the Five George Washingtons, similar to the entryway for <a HREF="glorylist.html"><FONT COLOR="#cc3333">Glory in the Golden Apple</FONT></a>.
<P>
This was the fine suggestion of Tom Standage, a London-based writer who was one of the standouts at the <a HREF="may4.html"><FONT COLOR="#ff7f00">May 4 Web Writers in the Flesh reading</FONT></a>. Tom said readers probably didn't like being sent to another site just to read a bit of the story.
<p>
So, we'll see.  The George Washingtons don't seem to have won readers' hearts the way some other stories have.  I had to take down or hide some of the interactive gee-gaws, because people were playing with them instead of reading the story. 
<P>
I think part of the problem is the length of the story, and its format: it's hard to follow as it jumps from character to character.  Web writing, I think, has to be short and very direct.  It has to grab you enough to compensate for the inherant discomfort of reading onscreen.
<P>
In the meantime, I've signed with an agent who will attempt to sell the Washingtons to a print book publisher. 
<P>
Is this a sellout?  I don't think so.  There was some talk at one point about a book of the short stories, and I felt the same way then as I do now:  the website is the original form of the work, and a print version is a spinoff of that.  It doesn't invalidate the website any more than a play or movie version.
<P>
But I imagine some people will disagree with me.
