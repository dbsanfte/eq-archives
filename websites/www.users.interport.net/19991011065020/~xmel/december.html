<H2>Blue Flower - Finally Finished, For Now</h2>
<p>
There was a bit of dissention among visitors this site about my decision to put the first half of "Blue Flower of Happiness" on this site before I'd written the second half. 
<p>"When oh when will you finish blue flower.  I won't sign off until it is done, and I'm going broke, broke, broke," e-mailed a reader from Chicago.<p>Catherine Arnold, a fellow writer who often stops by this site, said I should really have the decency to tell people at the beginning of the story that there was no end to it.<p>Instead, I'd included a small note that the story wasn't finished. "What do you mean this story is not finished!" e-mailed my mother.
<p>I put up the beginning of Blue Flower out of a desire, perhaps misguided, to have the site change and look new.
<p>
I'm a terribly slow writer:  the eight stories on this site have taken me five years to write, and many of them - <a HREF="http://www.interport.net/~xmel/lonelystart.html">In A Lonely Place</a>, <a HREF="http://www.interport.net/~xmel/charlottestart.html">Charlotte's Mirror</a>, and <a HREF="http://www.interport.net/~xmel/blumestart.html">Blue Flower</a> itself - still haven't reached their final draft.
<p>
That said, the full version of <a HREF="http://www.interport.net/~xmel/blume.html">Blue Flower</a> is now ready to read.  And the <a HREF="http://www.interport.net/~xmel/blumecartoon.html">cartoon</a> accompanying the story is my current favorite.

<H2>New Spanish-Language Version</H2>
<p>
Two Spanish-speaking readings - one living in Miami, and one in Taipei, Taiwan - are the translators behind this site's new Spanish version, <a HREF="http://www.interport.net/~xmel/espanol.html">Xander Mellish: Relatos Cortos e Historietas</a>.  
<p>Fans have helped translate parts of this site into <a href= "danish.html">Danish</a>, <a HREF="deutsch.html">German</a>, <a HREF="francais.html">French</a>, and <a HREF="japan.html">Japanese</a>.   (If you have a browser that limits you to roman letters, try the <a href="http://
www.lfw.org/shodouka/">Shodouka Launch Pad</a> translator to see the Japanese kanji.   Just copy this address and paste it into the translator:  http://www.interport.net/~xmel/japan.html.)
