<h3>
  From time to time, this site makes available originals of 
  some of the cartoons you enjoy on the web.
  <P>Because the cartoons are composed in paper layers, each 
  original is a one-of-a-kind three-dimensional object.   Some 
  are versions of a cartoon during composition; others are 
  more or less "final" works.
  <P>The price of each original is $100 unframed.
  <P>You can contact Xander Mellish at <a 
    HREF="mailto:xmel@aol.com">xmel@aol.com</a> with 
  inquiries.
