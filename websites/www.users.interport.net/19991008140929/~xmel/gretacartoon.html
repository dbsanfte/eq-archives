Late at night, I rode home in a cab through the most beautiful city in the world.  All these priceless buildings laid themselves out for me along Park Avenue, buildings filled with great works of art, and the most beautiful people in the world waited on c
orners to cross the street.  I was at the top of everything, I thought, the top.  What in the world to I have to complain about? What in the world?
