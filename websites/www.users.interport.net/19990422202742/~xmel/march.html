At long last, new stories!</H2>

<H4>
Two new stories have been uploaded onto "Xander Mellish: Short 
Stories and Cartoons."<p>
The first, <a HREF="charlottestart.html">Charlotte's Mirror</a>, is about an 
ambitious young journalist sent to interview a TV personality she both loves 
and 
envies.<p> The second, <a HREF="lonelystart.html">In A Lonely Place</a>, 
takes 
place on the home front during World War II. It's the first story I've ever 
written set outside of contemporary times.<p>

I'm a terribly slow writer...."Charlotte" took me more than three years, and at least a hundred revisions,  while "In A Lonely Place", which is still on its first major draft, is more than 18 months old.
<p>
I wish I could write faster;  I've tried.   When I do, however, the stories, come out really badly.  I think they just need a little time to mature on their own.<p>

The point of this site is not to sell stuff.  The point of this site is to bring stories to readers. <p>

However, I am not above trying to make a little dough to help defer the costs of server space and promotion, so starting this month I will be offering signed and numbered posters <a HREF="poster2.html">for sale</a>, along with framed hand-drawn cartoons. 


















<p>
I'm also considering T-shirts for the summer months - would <a HREF="mailto:xmel@aol.com">you</a> wear one?

<H2>The Story Behind This Project</h2>
<h4>
This website is part of a project I began three years ago, partly out of 
frustration. I was writing a lot of short stories, but I was having 
trouble finding readers.<p>
Meanwhile, the streets around my apartment in New York City were full of 
posters advertising bands and theater events. So I decided to turn my 
stories into posters.<p>
The first posters were only the typed first pages of each story, with a 
phone number at the bottom people could call if they wanted to read the 
rest. I put them up all over the city, on lamp posts and in subway 
stations and in laundromats, any place people might have spare time to 
read.<p>
I got hundreds of phone calls, and a lot of interested readers.  People 
would call and ask questions about the characters. Some actors got 
together and made one of the stories into a play. I had fans.
 <p>Putting up 
the posters, which I usually did running away from cops in the middle of 
the night, was an experience in itself.  One old drunken bum in a subway 
station on Second Avenue read the poster aloud in a voice as deep and 
lyrical as Paul Robeson. I made a deal with some anarchists who were 
putting up posters demanding war against the facsist state that we 
wouldn't cover up each others' work. A drug dealer on 
St. Mark's Place stopped selling Xanax long enough to ask for a story, 
take it, and tuck it carefully into his pocket. Also, I saw a lot of very 
big rats. <p>
Once the posters were up, I used to spy on people reading them. People 
are very suspicious in New York about calling a stranger's phone number: I 
think I probably had twenty readers for every one caller. It was tough 
duty sometimes: 
there's no more honest criticism than when you can see someone walk away 
after the first paragraph. But I was really happy to see people of 
every size 
and shape reading the posters - school kids, homeless people, Wall Street 
yuppies, black girls in gangs, old ladies, everybody.  So much 
coventionally published fiction in 
the U.S. is read only by a little subset of white, educated - maybe 
overeducated - literary snobs. It was cool to see my stories read by 
everybody.
<p>
Since the election of a new New York City mayor in 1993, putting up 
posters has become rather futile. The city's run better now, and 
the lamp posts get cleaned, usually overnight.  
<p>
Fortunately, with the help of the Internet, I can now reach readers all over 
the 
world.
<p>This site has now been operating since September, 1995, and has 
recieved more than 6000 visitors, generating more than 52,000 hits. <p>
