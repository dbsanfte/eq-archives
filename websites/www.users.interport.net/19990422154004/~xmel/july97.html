<h2>Results of My Layoff: A New Glory Gateway</h2>
<p>
As regular visitors to this site know,  I was laid off last month from my job of five years<p>
That was a downer, but having some extra time on my hands has proven beneficial to this site. 
<a HREF= "glory.html">Glory and the Golden Apple</a>, for example,  got two new episodes, several new <a HREF= "glorylist.html">cartoons</a>, and a new <a HREF= "glorylist.html">gateway</a> that includes the first use of color on the site. <p>
I've also begun a new short story, "Greta Floating, Lillian Straight Ahead." <p>
No promised finish date....the last story I tried to write in a hurry was <a HREF= "charlottestart.html">Charlotte's Mirror.</a><p> Three years later, it's still unfinished and still a disaster.<p> I'm still willing to send a free poster to anybody who can suggest a good ending for the thing. <p>

  <h2>Something Apropos From The Archives: "Let Go"</h2>
<p>
<a HREF= "letgo.html">Let Go</a> was the first story I ever published,  although <a HREF="sea.html">Say Goodbye To The Sea</a> was actually accepted for publication first.
<p>It's about a woman laid off from her job - which, at the time, had never actually happened to me.  Now seemed like a good time to exhume it from the archives.  <p>
<p><a HREF= "letgo.html">Let Go</a> first appeared in the Manhattan Spirit newspaper in January, 1992.

<h2>Blue Flower Edges Towards Completion</h2>

<p>
Speaking of stories that lack endings, <a HREF= "blumestart.html">Blue Flower of Happiness</a> is now sporting a new one. <p><a HREF= "blumestart.html">Blue Flower</a> went up on the site as an unfinished story, had an ending tacked on just before Christmas, and then became unfinished again when I decided I really hated what I had written. <p> The new ending is better, I think, although I'd still hesitate to say <a HREF= "blumestart.html">Blue Flower</a>  is entirely done and I won't ever touch it again.   There's some stuff I'd still like to work on, particularly Lee's closing words.<br clear>

<h2>"Amy Beauty Rose" In Dead Tree Edition</h2> <IMG ALIGN=LEFT
  SRC="cover.jpg"border=0>
<a HREF= "amystart.html">Amy Beauty Rose</a>, one of this site's most popular stories, will appear in a traditional print book, <a HREF= "http://www.coffeehousebook.com">"Coffeehouse: Writings From the Web"</a>, edited by Levi Asher of <a HREF= "http://www.levity.com/brooklyn/">Queensboro Ballads</a>. 
<p>To say the least, Levi and I didn't exactly agree on everything having to do with the way the book was put together, but we're still friends, which is saying something.
<p>Levi hopes to set up a few in-person readings from the book in the New York City area.   I'll let you know if that happens. <br clear>
