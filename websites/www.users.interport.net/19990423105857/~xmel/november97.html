<h2>Cartoons Live:  My First Literary Reading</h2>
<p>
Literary readings are an odd are an odd thing - why would anyone want to see some author blandly reading aloud a text?  Frankly, they make me fall asleep, and if I go to one I always bring along something to write or some cartoons to draw. 
<p>Still,  it's one of the few times a writer gets to appear before her public, and let's face it, I'm a ham. 
<p>
That's why I'm organizing a literary reading - which will be the first time I've read in public - to help promote <a HREF="http://www.coffeehousebook.com"</a>Coffeehouse: Writings From the Web</a>, the web fiction anthology edited by my buddy Levi Asher. 
<p>
Six other writers have been invited to join me, and the reading will take place at the Manhattan Internet Lounge, 678 Broadway near West 4th Street, 2nd Floor, at 7 pm on Tuesday, December 2nd.
<p>Admission will be free, and everybody is welcome.
<p>
Among what I hope will be the many attendees will be friends who provided <a HREF="voices2.html">voices</a> for the characters, as well as people some of the stories were based on, although they may not know that. <p>
<p>What I'll read, I'm not yet sure.   I will be wearing an orange dress I bought in Paris last month - that's the only decision I've made so far.<p>

<h2>Thinning Hair: An Instant Short Story</h2>
One of the best things about being a totally obscure writer is the ability to take chances.  If I fail, it's not like my large fan base will be distressed, or my movie deal will fall through, or the secretaries at my publishing company won't be able to afford manicures.  
<p>
Some people would argue that <a HREF="greta.html">Greta Floating, Lillian Straight Ahead</a>, which is newly revised this month, is one of those failures.  But no matter.
<p>
<a HREF="thinninghair.html">Thinning Hair</a> is another experiment.  It was written in a day or two, not including the requisite revisions.  Most of my stories take months, if not years, to complete.
<p>
The story was also in response to reader suggestions that I try writing a story in the third person, and in a setting other than New York City.   Yes, like a deejay, I take requests if I can. 
It was inspired by a visit to the Paris intersection so beloved by the art history scholar in the story.
<p>
Regular readers (and my mom, of course) will know that I was an art history major at university, and briefly considered going for a masters degree before good sense caught up with me.
<p>
Another reader has requested a love story that ends with the couple together, happily.      I'm working on that.

<h2>Rear View Mirror:  A Column</h2>
<p>
I've always been a history buff, so it's kind of remarkable that only one story on this site, <a HREF="lonelystart.html">In A Lonely Place</a>, is set in the past.<p>But that's just a personal preference of mine when it comes to fiction.   I love reading books written in the period - I love what they reveal about psychology of a different time - but I'm resistant to contemporary authors who try to impose current morality on bygone eras. I just saw a dreadful film version of Henry James' "Washington Square" that had Catherine Sloper running a day-care center, in 1838. 
<p>This is a long-winded wind-up to the announcement of a side project, a column that will appear on <a HREF="http://www.mostnewyork.com/">Most NewYork</a>, the web site of the New York Daily News newspaper.
<p>Called, after some debate, "Rear View Mirror", it'll set current events in historical perspective.  The first one dealt with a noted police brutality case, presenting Victorian accounts to show that police brutality is an old, old issue.
<p>Check out the column - I'd love to hear your reactions.
