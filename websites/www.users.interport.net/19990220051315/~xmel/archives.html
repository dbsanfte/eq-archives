Most of the stories on this site have been written since 1992, when I abandoned, half-finished, the final novel in a series of three and started writing short stories full time.<p>
The first was <a HREF="extrastart.html">Extraordinary</a>, still one of my favorites, and my difficulties getting it published precipiated  the poster project which lead to this site.  (See <a href="new.html#sechs">The Story Behind This Site</a>)<p>
Still, there are some worthwhile odds and ends which don't necessarily fit with the format of this site, among them short stories written before I began the novels in 1986, as well as others written in the early 1990s as the third novel, "Statues and Haloes", was slowly coming undone. 
<p>
Two of those stories, <A HREF="letgo.html">Let Go</A> and <A HREF="sea.html">Say Goodbye To The Sea</A>, have been conventionally published, and have also appeared on this site as monthly features.<p>
<p>
<a HREF="charlottestart.html">Charlotte&#39;s Mirror</A> and <a HREF="greta.html">Greta Floating, Lillian Straight Ahead</a> are two short-short stories - under three pages - that never seemed to quite work, no matter how many revisions they went through.  I guess I'm not born to write short-shorts.  Oh well.
<p>I've also added the short-short <a HREF="thinninghair.html">Thinning Hair</a>, which I did on the fly in Paris in the fall of 1997.  I guess I'm not meant to write stories on the fly, either. <p>
Furthermore, these archives will offer <A HREF="art.html">Giving Up Art</A>, which started out as a monumentally unsuccessful short story, and makes a slightly better play.
<p>The latest addition to the archives is <a HREF="firestart.html">Fireworks and Soup</a>, which had a long and not-quite-successful run on the List of Stories before joining us here.
