<H3>N.Y. writer uses the Net as publisher</H3>
<H4>By Edward A. Mazza II<BR>
Special to The Daily Yomiuri</H4>

        Are there real people on the Internet? Xander Mellish is counting on it. Mellish is a financial journalist in New York. Like many New Yorkers, she's also a part-time playwright, poet and illustrator with a burning desire to share her work with the world beyond.<P>

        Publishers would have none of it which was fine with Mellish, who finds the modern literary world about as delightful as the South Bronx after dark. "It's all a horrible ghetto full of people who write for each other and not for the rest of the world. I wanted to write for the real people," she said.<P>

        She took her stories to the streets, hanging posters with part of a story on lampposts and laundromats.<P>

        Then, she stumbled upon the new town square. The Internet, she realized, offers possibilities beyond print and posters. Especially for compulsive revisionists.<P>

        "Some of the stories have been rewritten a hundred times," she said. "If I was a painter, I'd probably be going to the houses of the people who'd bought my paintings and changing little bits here and there as they hung on the wall."<P>

        Her stories are lonely, yet contain a certain bitter humor. The characters tend to be either emotionally crippled or emotionally scarred, but not so much that readers can't relate. There are tears, broken hearts, lost souls, codependency, unhappy endings and sparse yet appealing descriptions.<P>

        "Beneath a layer of snow the city looked elegant and untroubled. It seemed like a city I had never been to, a white city, a peaceful, hurtless place.<P>

        We stopped at a corner by my house, and I stood there for a second, watching the snow fall past the streetlights," is one example, coming from "White City."<P>

        Yet Mellish is not striving to focus on style so much as character. "I find people fascinating_one of the things I try to do in stories, I think, is to create a person with whom the reader can feel intimate," she said. "Some of the best portrait artists do that, they create real people you feel like you know. The portrait can be 500 years old, yet you can easily imagine how the person would look in modern dress standing next to you in the museum, how she would act, what she would say."<P>

        As of now, she has no plans to give up her day job in reporting. "Although my stories are where my heart is, I really don't resent having to work a day job_I think writers who do nothing but ponder all day become ingrown and fatuous," she said.<P>

        Mellish seems to be in no danger of that, so long as she continues to reach out to the common reader. "There's nothing worse a young writer can do than take herself too seriously."<P>
