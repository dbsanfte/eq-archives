<br>
            Ok first off, Thank You Bexin for your help! I dinged 46. Rangah powerleveling <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
At times.....<br>
<br>
           I would spend hours looking for a group to no avail. Began jumping in ponds washing off, hoping I didnt<br>
           Smell. Purchased some mints but it wasnt working. So I log hubbbys Druid to see what was really going<br>
           on. Why it was so damn hard for a 40 something to get a group. Now mind you when he went traveling around<br>
           It wasnt prime Time (which to me is 8 pm est ish) But even then the results are just as pathetic.( Druids name is Niviak)<br>
<br>
           Ready here we go...<br>
<br>
<br>
          First stop Hot Zone!<br>

What is going on I ask myself. I have read the population in EQ is dwindling but I suppose I am in Denial.<br>
After seeing all these empty zones I am still in Denial. Of course Im going to do this again when its prime time.<br>
People out of work and dare I say Kids out of class. ( I say kids because Im 32 years old)<br>
<br>
So I do a who all 40 to 46 and this is what I got ... (forever in denial maybe)<br>

I have felt this pain. Server numbers are dwindling, with EQ2, and the imminent release of WoW, things are not looking too bright, but one thing on our servers that has become more apparent to me, is the 'multi-boxers' out there. Thats half the reason for so many hours spent /LFG, IMO.<br>
<br>
I am guilty, in as much as I have 2 accounts, and can run a host of characters in tandem, but I HATE doing it. Its so boring, not to mention unsociable. I seem to end up doing it after 2 or more hours of /LFG, and even then I keep /LFG up on my toons, in the hope something might happen.<br>
<br>
I dont think it will be too long before we see some server contraction going on, which in theory should increase population, and hopefully more groups etc, but IMO the 'multi-boxing' has gotten out of hand.<br>
<br>
Oh well, I guess I am just ranting now too lol..<br>

Funny you mention multi-boxing.<br>
<br>
After much frustration lfg. I tried multi-boxing for the first time the other day.Needless to say I stink! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      But at least it was something to do. <br>
In my case it was the lack of groups that drove me to try  multi boxing. When I log on I just want to  play for the fun and enjoyment of it. So being on the game and not playing was begining to cause so much pent up frustration (resembling PMS!) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Any who,I made Ranger/ Enchanter duo. A double speed bump!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
