<p><font color="#C0FFC0"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><i>May The Pants Be With You</i></font></font><br><font size=-1>Friday, June 8, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a><p><FONT SIZE=2  FACE=arial><blockquote><i>As Posted on Crossroads by Belgarathx</i><br><br>from monk page post.....<br>Star Wars "Pants" Lines <br>_____This probably takes some explaining. I recently received an e-mail containing several Star Wars quotes that sounded funny when a key word was replaced with "pants". I do not know who first came up with the idea or who originated the forward. <br><br>* I find your lack of pants disturbing. --Darth Vader, SW <br><br>* General Veers, prepare your pants for a ground assault. --Darth Vader, ESB <br><br>* I used to bullseye womprats in my pants back home... --Luke, SW <br><br>* Lock the door. And hope they don't have pants. --Han and Luke, SW <br><br>* You are unwise to lower your pants. --Darth Vader, RJ <br><br>* You look strong enough to pull the pants off a Gundark. --Han, ESB <br><br>* Great, Chewie, great. Always thinking with your pants. --Han, RJ <br><br>* That blast came from the pants! That thing's operational! --Lando, RJ <br><br>* I recognized your foul pants when I was brought on board. --Leia, SW <br><br>* A tremor in the pants. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. --Darth Vader, SW. <br><br>* Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of pants more heavily guarded than this. --Han, RJ <br><br>* Maybe you'd like it better back in your pants, your highness. --Han, SW <br><br>* Jabba doesn't have time for smugglers who drop their pants at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser. --Greedo, SW <br><br>* Short pants is better than no pants at all. --Han, RJ <br><br>Pants not make one great. --Yoda, ESB <br><br>I sense the conflict within you, let go of your pants! --Luke, RJ <br><br>Pants you I can, yes, mmm. --Yoda, ESB Credit for this one to Jon Pearson. <br><br>That's because droids don't pull people's arms out of their pants when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. --Han, SW <br><br>I love pants. I know. --Han and Leia, RJ (the inflection is better here than in ESB.) <br><br>Watch it kid or you're gonna find your pants floating home. --Han, SW <br><br>I thought pants smelled bad on the outside. --Han, ESB <br><br>Your pants, you will not need them. --Yoda, ESB <br><br>Your pants. They'll have to wait outside, we don't want them here. --Wuher, SW <br><br>How long have you had these pants? About three or four seasons. They're up for sale if you want them. --Stormtrooper, Luke, and Ben, SW <br><br>Search your pants, you know it to be true. --Darth Vader, ESB <br><br>The Force is strong in my pants. --Luke, RJ Useless tidbit: in a recent college-wide trivia competition, the team I was on used this quote as its name. <br><br>Take care of your pants, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it. --Luke, SW <br><br>I want them alive. No pants. --Darth Vader, ESB <br><br>Twilight is upon me, and soon pants must fall. That is the way of things, the way of the Force. --Yoda, RJ <br><br>Bounty Hunters. We don't need their pants. --Piett, ESB <br><br>What's the cargo? Only passengers. Myself, the pants, two droids...and no questions asked. --Han and Ben, SW <br><br>You'll have to sell your pants. That's okay, I'm never coming back to this planet again. --Ben and Luke, SW <br><br>There'll be no pants to stop us this time. --Darth Vader, SW <br><br>Away with your pants, I mean you no harm. --Yoda, ESB <br><br>I seek an audience with your greatness to bargain for Solo's pants. --Luke, RJ <br><br>My pants are dirty too, what are you afraid of? --Han, ESB. Credit to Paul Grasshoff. <br><br>There aren't enough pants in your life. --Han, ESB <br><br>I happen to like nice pants. --Leia, ESB <br><br>Yes. Yes. Pants would be a great asset. --Palpatine, ESB <br><br>Good, I hate long pants. --Han, RJ <br><br>You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor. Take her pants! --Vader, SW <br><br>Look sir, pants. --Davin Felth, SW <br><br>Pants leak, very dangerous. --Han, SW. Credit to Paul Grasshoff. <br><br> The Sandpeople are easily startled, but they will soon be back, and in greater pants. --Kenobi, SW. Credit to Paul Grasshoff. <br><br>Pants me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. --Leia, SW. Credit to Paul Grasshoff. <br><br>Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight, the same as your pants. --Kenobi, SW <br><br>I need your pants, Luke. She needs your pants. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. --Kenobi, SW <br><br></p></font></font></blockquote>

<p><font color="#C0FFC0"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><i>A Rant from Mareth</i></font></font><br><font size=-1>Wednesday, June 6, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a><p><FONT SIZE=2  FACE=arial><blockquote>I reserve the right to piss and moan...<br><br>...Because god dammit there's nothing to do. No games, no movies, no books, no console games, nothing in EQ to do. I hate these lulls right before summer hits full swing.<br><br>Lets look at what there is to do:<br>Shrek: Ok flick. An ogre goes on a quest for a king so he can get the fairy tale creatures out of his swamp. Turns out the ogre isn't really evil, he's just lonely. I liked this movie as I was able to mentally dodge the insipid moral stamp dreamworks and disney love to enforce on my soul. I'd like to burn down thier offices but then that would mean no more Buzz Lightyear so I'm at an impass.<br><br>Mummy Returns: I loved this flick. It constantly makes fun of itself for being a sequel PLUS its just GOOD in its own right. If you liked the first one, this one I'd recommend. However my problem is, once I watch a movie, I've kinda killed it for something to do. Kinda like jerking off too early in the day.<br><br>Aside from that, there aren't much for movies that make me want to get out of my melancholy. I AM looking forward to Tomb Raider but don't believe me if I tell you its for the "story". Basically a chick in tight clothes whupping everyone's ass and shooting guns is pretty much bliss for me. AND it comes out on my birthday. I haven't been this happy on a birthday since I beat metroid the day I turned 15 and found out Samus was a chick (/moan). <br><br>During this lull of stuff to do, OF COURSE it rains. So I go out and buy the latest copy of PC Lamer. Anyone want to make a computer game mag with me that DOESN'T SUCK? These idiots are usually captivated by eyecandy. "It looks good!" Ya well so did the D&D movie. Check it for content and interface next time jackweed.<br><br>I'm so bored, in the past 2 months I've Re-played my stock of over 25 pc games, 14 console games and I've read 6 books. And GOD, please don't tell me "play EQ more!". I'll have to kill you by putting a rabid hampster in your underwear. I've played almost every game on the market PLUS I have high level EQ characters. Ok yes I have the attention span of an excited gnat. Shouldn't SOMETHING however come along? I've entered a zillion betas. Haven't been accepted into any of them (/rude Blizzard for taking so goddamn long for an expansion). <br><br>Someone get me FTP access for warez or into some beta so I can use my time for something GOOD! In the daytime I watch my kid so I can't commit the horrid time that EQ's high level game requires (well unless I want to log on and /cheer...yay THAT'S fun! I'd rather jump on a grenade.). HELP ME GUYS! HELP ME, HELP YOU! HELP ME, HELP YOU! Ok now I'm so bored I'm yelling at everyone. Dude I'm getting too apothetic (sp?) to RANT. WTF is up with that? God knows I hate everything but now I'm too the point of "/yawn, why bother bitching about it? I'm tired...". <br><br>At least I know now why meth was created. It was to get us over that spring/summer lull. I'm going to go eat a box of vivarin. Someone POST SOME SUGGESTIONS for me or I'll show up all cracked out where you live and demand all your Dr. Pepper and porn mags. <br></p></font></font></blockquote>
