The wedding will take place Saturday, April 17th at 1 PM EST (10AM Pacific) near the Chessboard in Butcherblock mountains.<p>
All citizens of Rathe are invited to come celebrate in our joy! We will try to provide a safe escort for those who are of the evil races and do not think they can make the journey alone, or please come in the form of another character and tell us who you are!

From LordBio:<p>
<font color="#C8824A">
Game Post <a href="http://www.gamepost.com">www.gamepost.com</a> has put up a review of EverQuest which was developed by Verant Studios/989 Studios. EverQuest gives everyone a chance to become adapted to the world, and then possibly join the hosts of PvP if they wish. The concept is solid, and the deployment in terms of game development is to be commended. Now if Verant had only taken stress-testing their ISP into consideration before release, all would have been wonderful. Even after those few weeks, EverQuest is definitely one the best games in our lifetime, and one that I can imagine will be played for years from now. <a href="http://www.gamepost.com/reviews/everquest.html">Go read our review of EverQuest.</a>

<FONT SIZE=2  FACE=arial color="C3830C"><b>A Scam?</B></font><br><font size=-1>posted 4/12/99</font size><FONT SIZE=2  FACE=arial><p>

We received this scam alert from Grimfold today:<p>
<font color="#C8824A">
I just want to alert people of a situation that has developed on the
Innoruuk server yesterday.
<p>
Two people claiming to be paladins going by the names of Leoric and
Heimdall were offering to sell rare items, such as Mino axes in the area of
Greater Feydark. They would initiate a trade with a player and then switch
the item after the purchasing player had clicked trade.
<p>
In my case, I checked that the item he was offering was indeed a Mino axe,
but then after I had clicked on the trade button, Leoric switched the Mino
axe for a rusty axe.
<p>
This can be avoided by making sure that the person selling the item has
locked in the trade before you lock in the trade, however it still means
someone has got to initially put some trust into the transaction.
<p>
Of course, when I realized what had happened (which was immediately after
the transaction) and confronted Leoric on it, he laughed and stated that he
had checked with a GM and that such duplicities were not a violation of the
rules. I don't know if this is true, as I never received an answer to my
petition.
<p>
Some may say that I should have known better, that it is my own fault.
Maybe they are correct. However, that is not my point here. My point is to
warn others.
<p>
Although there may be no repercussions against such dishonest actions in
the rules, there is nothing stopping me from spreading the word of these
people's dishonesty.
<p>
As I told Leoric and Heimdall, "I can always get my money back. You can
NEVER get your reputation back."
<p>
</font>
Thanks for the info about a switch scam! Players can always change names, but we can be on the lookout for these tactics.

<p>
professor: ...you, Mr....um...Smyth? Can you tell me what
Rousseau was getting at in the readings?
<p>
student: Well sir, I didn't get quite that far in the--
<p>
prof: Dammit! I'm tired of your excuses. Everyday you walk
into this classroom sleepy-eyed and unprepared. Not once have
you come up anything that even remotely resembled an answer.
<p>
stu: You want answers?
<p>
prof: I think I'm entitled to one.
<p>
stu: You want answers?!
<p>
prof: I want the truth!
<p>
stu: You can't handle the truth!! (dramatic pause)<p>
Sir, we live in a world that has games like EverQuest, and these games have to be played
by men and women with dreams. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Mr. Teaching
Assistant? I have a greater responsibility than you can
possibly fathom. You read your little textbooks and you curse
those that cut you off in traffic.<p>
You have that luxury; you have the luxury of
not knowing what I know: that my wood elf city is under attack by orcs,  that my hunting forays,  while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, save lives. We use words like
"TRAIN","Mino Axe", "What do you mean <b>your</b> land?." We use these words as the
backbone of a life spent in Norrath. You do not use them at all.<p> I have neither the time, nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps underneath the
blanket of the protection that I provide. I'd rather you
said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you
pick up a staff, and start to swing. Either way, I don't give a
damn what you think you're entitled to!
<p>
prof: Did you fail to do the work?
<p>
stu: I did my job, I'd do it--

prof: DID YOU FAIL TO DO THE WORK?

April 5th, 9:00pm<br>
-----------------
<p>
We will be opening up a new section on the EverQuest website solely dedicated to the Test Server. Once the Test Server section is
available, changes and bug fixes made to the Test Server will be documented, so that you may help us test the changes. 
<p>
As for server updates, from this day forward, we will be updating the regular EverQuest servers every Tuesday morning at 3:00am Pacific
Standard Time.
<p>
We will be performing a patch and server update at 3:00am Pacific Standard Time on Tuesday, April 6th. The patch contains the following
additions and fixes;
<p>
1. Crashing while giving newbie items to NPCs. 
<p>
2. Going link-dead would cause the character to regenerate extremely quickly. 
<p>
3. Various sound related crashes were fixed. 
<p>
4. Created items disappearing from characters after zoning. 
<p>
5. Characters able to use skills, which are not allowed for their specific class. 
<p>
6. A limit to the successful hit and spell messages has been implemented that should reduce the number of unneeded messages sent to the
players. 
<p>
7. After slaying a creature, the player will receive a proper faction hit. 
<p>
8. Occasionally, after being disconnected, users would crash upon re-logging into the server. 
<p>
9. The DLS sound system is now enabled. 
<p>
10. A new text command, "/reply " has been implemented. This will allow players to reply to the last character that sent a private tell message. 
<p>
11. Many adjustments to the faction system were made. 
<p>
12. Multiple quest-related bugs were fixed. 
<p>
13. A slew quests were added. 
<p>
14. A number of new music tracks were added to various zones. 
<p>
15. Occasionally, sound settings would reset to default, while graphically, the slider bars appeared to be correct. 
<p>
16. Various safe zones were eliminated to prevent exploitation. 
<p>
17. Some equipped weapons and items would draw into the user interface overlays, which would result in the client crashing. 
<p>
18. It was possible to strafe at normal speed while rooted or sneaking. 
<p>
19. All hybrid classes now receive meditate at level 12. 
<p>
20. Experience over level 30 will now be reflected properly on the user's experience bar.

If you haven't tried the test server to hear the music, you may want to. I actually prefer the game without music, as it feels more like a "world" and less like a "game" without music. I also found my frame rate bogged down with the music on. One more thing for my P166 to process, hehe.

EverQuest is like a roller coaster: when it's good you don't want to get off,
and when it isn't... you can't wait to throw up.
<p>
The journey of a thousand miles begins with storing all your valuables in a bank and casting a good camouflage spell.
<p>
I believe for every drop of rain that falls, a flower grows. And a
kill is stolen and a server goes down and the centurion gives you nothing and…
<p>
Follow your dream! Unless it's the one where you're at work in your
underwear swatting wasps with a snake fang.
<p>
Soloist's Credo: Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for
I may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Just leave me the hell
alone!
<p>
If you don't like my hunting, don't whine to me about it. Just get on another server.
<p>
It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're a Dark Elf sneaking into Freeport, that's the time to do it.
<p>
Each day I try to enjoy something from each of the four food groups:
the orc group, the bandit/poacher group, the caffeine group, and the
thing-in-tinfoil-in-the-back-of-the-fridge group.
<p>
Into every life some rain must fall. And lightning. Usually when you've just logged on to EQ.
<p>
This morning I woke up to the unmistakable scent of pigs in a blanket.
That's the price you pay for letting the Ogres stay over.
<p>
Keep your nose to the grindstone and your shoulder to the wheel... they say it's
better than creating a new character from scratch.

Just as a reminder, we will be doing maintainence from 7am to 8am pst tomorrow morning April 1st. This will not
include the Client patch which we want to get 1 more full day of Testing. That will be put up on Friday April 2nd at
3am (asuuming that tomorrow's testing goes well). It's important for people to realize that we are only going to put
up patches once we're convinced they are stable. Tonight we found a bug that we fixed and we want to get another
24 hours of testing. This will be a pretty big (content, not size) patch as it will include:
<p>
1) Music on non-soundfont cards 
<p>
2) Frame Rate increase 
<p>
3) Numerous crash and other bug fixes, 
<p>
We have also located and fixed a bug that was causing corpses to decay to quickly. That was a server side fix so
it doesn't need to wait for the client patch. 
<p>
We are also working on numerous bugs including crashes on the client as well as many gameplay bugs. We will
be coming up with a complete list of exactly what we are tracking by sometime tomorrow. 
<p>
Also, one last item: Bertoxxulous should be up real shortly here.

With a Riva 128zx card my client would freeze up about once an hour.
I had to do a hard reset each time. I could not ctrl-alt-del, I could not move my mouse,
anything. Each incident occurred in different places under different conditions. Time
playing did not matter, it happened if there were 300 or 1000 people on server.
Fortunately it never happened in combat.

Thinking it was a memory or hard drive space issue, I increased from 64 to 96 RAM, and
bought a 8 gig hard drive. I still encountered the problem. We updated to the latest
DirectX drivers. It still froze.

This did not happen to me in beta. When the commercial was released I changed from a
Voodoo to a Riva. The Riva had more texture memory, and was thought to be "better".
Given that we'd tried everything else, we changed back to the Voodoo.
<p>
I am happy to say I have not had the freezing up problem since. It may be some type of
incompatibility issue with my Riva 128zx. I do not know if the same thing would occur
with a Riva TNT, but I wanted people to be aware this may be a problem.  I have filed this at the <a href="http://bugbase.xrgn.com/eqindex.htm">RPG Bug Base</a>.

Your friends tell you that you have been acting strange lately, 
then you hit them several times with a Mino Axe. 
<p>
Everyone you meet appears to have blue skin and grunts a lot. 
<p>
You write to your mother in Freeport every week, even though she 
sends you mail from Iowa asking why you never write.
<p>
Every commercial you hear on the radio reminds you of death, and long treks back to your corpse. 
<p>
You begin to stop and /consider all of the blades of grass you are 
stepping  on, and hear voices that their comrades will  one day seek revenge. 
<p>
You have meaningful conversations with your tavern's bartender. 
<p>
Your father pretends you don't exist, he simply closes the computer room door when company comes.
<p>
You like dwarves. Especially with mayo. 
<p>
You scream "I've got a  dagger!" to NPCs who try to sell you 
things. 
<p>
You scream "I've got a dagger!" to people at your family reunion 
<p>
You cry at the end of every episode of Gilligan's Island, because 
you know there's no Gilligan's Island zone in the game.
<p>
Every time you see the commercial for the Hair Club For Men, you 
think to yourself, "Ugg.. gud wepon." 
<p>
You argue with yourself about which is better, to be eaten by an 
Ogre or to be loved by a barbarian woman. 
<p>
You like to sit in cornfields for prolonged periods of time, 
waiting  for a respawn.

The Qeynos Madam opened the brothel door to see an elderly wood elf. His
tunic was disheveled and he looked like he foraged for his food.  "Can I help you?" the
madam asked.
<p>
"I want Verjica," the old elf replied.
<p>
"Sir, Verjica is one of our most expensive ladies, perhaps someone else..."
<p>
"No, I must see Verjica."
<p>
Just then Verjica appeared and announced to the old elf that she
charges 100 plat per visit. The man never blinked and reached into his
backpack and handed her a heavy coin purse. The two went up to a room for
an hour whereupon the elf calmly left.
<p>
The next night he appeared again demanding Verjica. Verjica explained
that no one had ever come back two nights in a row and that there were
no discounts... it was still 100 plat . Again the old elf  took out the
money, the two went up to the room and he calmly left an hour later.
<p>
When he showed up the third consecutive night, no one could believe it.
Again he handed Verjica the money and up to the room they went. At the
end of the hour Verjica questioned the old guy: "No one has ever used
my services three nights in a row... where are you from?"
<p>
The old elf replied, "I am from Kelethin."
<p>
"Really?" replied Verjica, "I have a sister who lives there."
<p>
"Yes; I know," said the old elf. "She gave me 300 plat to give to you."
