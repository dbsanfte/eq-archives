<p><strong><font color="#98D698">The Perfect Couple</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Friday, October 5, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br><i>From Mordieth</i><br>Once upon a time, a perfect man and a perfect woman met. After a perfect courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life together was, of course, perfect. One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple was driving their perfect car (a Grand Caravan) along a winding road, when they noticed someone at the side of the road in distress. Being the perfect couple, they stopped to help. There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded Santa and his toys into their vehicle. Soon they were driving along delivering toys. Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple and Santa Claus had an accident. Only one of them survived the accident. The mind numbing question is: Who was the survivor? <br><br>                      Scroll down for the answer... <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The perfect woman survived. She's the only one who really existed in the first place. Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a perfect man. Women stop reading here. That is the end of the joke. <br><br>                      Men keep'a scrollin'... <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the perfect woman must have been driving. And that explains why there was a car accident. By the way, if you're a woman and you're reading this, this illustrates another point: Women never listen, either.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#98D698">Developer's Chat Notes</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Friday, October 5, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br><i>Thanks to Keroppi on this</i>:<br><br>This is what was said: <br>------------------------------------- <br>As part of this melee balancing patch, I'm looking over the quality of<br>post-epic items and trying to guarantee each class has equal quality<br>weapons available across the board. I'll be looking over the items on<br>Vulak, along with the rest of Temple of Veeshan and I think it's safe to say a few items will be getting some stat changes. Yes, with the new UI you will be able to change the graphics for UI elements including the mouse cursor. <br><br>We're not planning on including any advantages or disadvantages to gameplay based upon being mounted with possible exception to giving<br>the horse some "mass" from a physics perspective. Adding another<br>balance component of that magnitude (e.g. affecting all of melee) would have made doing horses difficult in the first place. As Brad said earlier, Horses are being included primarily for Travel, and the players desire to futher differentiate themselv <br><br>Ponies do NOT Mooo. <br><br>Beastlords are a melee/shaman hybrid with the melee aspect leaning more towards a monk than a warrior. They have some of the special properties of a monk such as an unencumbered armor class bonus, better ac bonus for high agility and are second only to monks in unarmed combat damage.<br><br>Like a monk they will have to rely on tanks or their pet to soak up a large percentage of the damage that would otherwise be directed at them. In addition to their pet enhancement spells they will also receive some unique non non-pet oriented beastlord spells and spells from their Shaman parent class. You can think of them as primitive spiritual warriors with close ties to the wild and the shamanistic cultures they emerge from. <br><br>We are currently addressing some of the problems that casters are having in the higher end encounters as part of our rebalancing on the test server. I really can't elaborate any more on that right now, but we will be releasing more information sometime soon. <br><br>As a class, the warrior is incredibly useful in both group and raid<br>situations, and in fact is often thought of as crucial to making an efficient group. The warrior does have a lot of things going for him now - the highest quality armor, excellent damage output, a large advantage in hit points and actual tanking ability, taunts, stuns & slams, a vast selection of weapons with interesting and useful procs, as well as many useful disciplines.<br> <br>We're quite happy with the role a warrior currently plays in EverQuest, happy enough that we used the warrior as a baseline to measure the performance of other classes as we were balancing. With this round of changes, we will be upping the warrior's taunt skill at level 60 to a cap of 230, to help deal with other classes gain in melee damage.  We'll keep an eye on future changes, to guarantee a warrior always has an important role in the game, but there aren't any immediate class changes we feel are needed to make warriors more effective than they are. <br><br>Hail, I have hoping for years that you will implement "chat groups" - where a message will be automatically sent to multiple people - will that be implemented in SoL ? <br><br>Not as part of Luclin, but yes, it remains one of the many things that we'd like to do at some point. <br><br>A few of the old monsters will receive new models, particularly the ones that players can summon or turn into such as skeletons and elementals. Most of the old world critters will remain the same however as there just isn't the time or resources to do that much remodelling.  Familiars will follow the Wizards around. They do not attack, and can recieve no commands other then /pet get lost. They will zone with the Wizards, and be there waiting for them when they log in (they do not stay in the world when the wizard is gone though)...  They will grant added resistances to the Wizard, as well as some other benefits that will aid in casting efficiency, as well their mana pool, and mana regen. That being said, they currently have not gone through final balancing and are still very much in the process of being worked on. <br><br>We've already made one pass through some high end quests, making the top level Velious quest armor un-sneakable in most cases, as an example. We're likely to go through again to make sure we're happy with the faction requirements of high end quests, and will be keeping that in mind as we develop the Luclin quests. <br><br>Unfortunately there was an accident in the Akanon clockwork horse<br>manufacturing plant last weekend that resulted in..well...a big mess. Due to this unfortunate turn of events the Gnomish Horse Crafters Union has sadly announced that their people will have to use real horses for the next several years. Sad..but its the truth it was a big mess.... <br><br>You have an item that you can keep in your inventory such as a bridle or whistle or something along those lines that will allow you to summon your horse again should you die or dismiss it, whether or not these will have charges is undecided at this time. <br><br>We're definitely planning to make some accomodation for people with<br>existing characters to choose a face they like when the new character<br>models become available. <br><br>You can expect to see some unconventional methods of spawning both<br>standard and high-end unique mobs in Luclin. Can't elaborate any further than that or it would spoil the fun. <br><br>The new graphics engine doesn't limit the distances we can set the<br>clipping plane out to, at least not in the sense of what you're experienced with. So in general, I expect that you'll have more control over the clipping plane, with exception to cases where we limit how far you can see as purely a gameplay feature. <br><br>Chardok was a dungeon that wasn't seeing as much use as we'd like. People would go there to raid the Royals for epic pieces, and<br>occasionally you'd see a group camping the zone in, but overall it just wasn't getting many people coming in. I've always been impressed with the architecture of the zone, and it seemed like a perfect zone to get a bit of a revamp. The amount of roaming mobs has come down quite a bit, things still roam but they don't wander from the very back of the dungeon to the front. You'll find a higher amount of named mobs in the zone, some very interesting new treasures dropping, some quests and conveniences for people with good Sarnak faction, as well as a lot of fun encounters there. Another guy on the team, Azaliil, has worked in some incredible story elements and flavor that really make the zone stand out. It's been very well received on test server, and I think people will be really pleased when they get a chance to adventure in new Chardok. <br><br>question: any chance of getting a "keychain" or someting with SOL? would be nice to consolidate all of my soul bound keys in one spot. getting a 9th one is a current impossiblity. <br>              <br>We're working on something for that, essentially marking your character as having completed a particular quest and then having doors and such check that flag rather than requiring an item. I hope to see it in by Luclin. <br><br>* Auric reminds everyone about the Orlando Fan Faire October 19th and<br>20th! There is still time to register. We would love to see you there. Please visit www.everquest.com and click on the Fan Faire link for more details. <br>* Abashi will be at the Brell party <br>* EstertheTester wants pictures this time.... <br>* Absor DOESN'T want pictures this time... <br>you're no fun Absor <br><br>We've had tons of questions and I really do apologize if we did not get to yours. Hopefully (/eye absor) we can do these more often to help reduce the load some</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><font color="#98D698">A Rant From Mareth</font> </strong><br><small>Posted Friday, September 28, 2001 by <a href="mailto:raene@2amstudios.com">Raene</a></small><blockquote><br>From <a href="http://pub92.ezboard.com/ffinalsanctuaryfrm1" target="new window">Mareth</a>:<br><br><b>Its 5am</b><br><br>And I should be sleeping. Verant however is busy making horses in the new expansion. And zones like kerra isle still need fixed. Kerra isle is a waste of space. They could have put nude halfling hookers there and noone would ever know.<br><br>I ponder to think how cool expansion will be in those 3 zones that will be playable. The other 80 new zones will look real cool, have a billion ways to kill you and most definitely have that dumbass that was in KC tonight pulling to zone. "TRAIN TO ZONE!" Ok I want all you newbies to get something straight: 3 mobs is NOT a train its a PULL. Trains are something that will most likely wipe out the people at zone and then go outside to see if they can finish off anyone else they might have missed. THATS a train.<br><br>My god and you idiots that are in my way...look dude yer a monk. FD when I pull past you. Its not hard. Why yes I realize I'm a monk. i realize you only pull singles. I however think singles are boring and I AM actively trying at the moment to destroy my group. WHY? BECAUSE ITS FUN THATS WHY. So get the @#%$ outta the way or its not my problem you die to 5 mobs. I don't want to hear you whine. Well actually I do. I'm going to record it and then play it at a goth gathering so I can watch them all commit mass suicide. Yes your whining is THAT bad.<br><br>Its not KC as a zone. Its the people. I pulled singles (purely by accident I assure you...I still want to kill my group) all last night. KC is rather warm and fluffy when you think about it. Pulls are easy, mobs have jack @#%$ for hps. Ok now read what I just said. Now if you disagree with either of those things get your @#%$ level 43 ass out of that zone. I'd rather get my anus attacked by some exotic killer bees than group you. Well unless you are funny. That makes up for it.<br><br>Want to know another thing? Everyone who hasn't been to a zone yet please do NOT give me your impressions of it. I don't care. See thats why I don't give out my impressions of zones unless asked. And its real simple:<br><br>"dude whats VP like?"<br>"Hell if I know"<br><br>See??? Noone wants to see this:<br>"Whats it like in ST?"<br>"Well its got giant hampsters that rampage on you and fluffy kitties that deathtouch if you don't pet them. Thats what I heard anyway."<br><br>Oh and I warn you idiots NOT to steal my pulls as they are inc. Its purely for your own safety. And yes I'm laughing my head off when that single you think I pulled is actually 3 + more inc. Again, single pulls are for uber mobs, girlfriends, or for when you are lacking something like a cleric.<br><br>And GOOD GOD if I get another monk coming up to me, inspecting me, asking me my stats AND THEN acting as if they are all superior because they have 3 more ac points I'm going to stab myself in the eye with a pencil. Look dude I do NOT care about your stats, your gear, your face, your race OR your 30 other halfling warrior twink accounts. Why does everyone think I'm in competition with them? I don't care! I like my stuff, I like my race, I like my face. Well ok I could do with a leather thong of DOOM(TM) but hey nobody's perfect.<br><br>Do ya'll realize that a level 45 sk/pallie/warrior/rogue or anything is just a BAD idea for a tank? Me too.<br><br>I'm gonna go lick a car battery now. </p></blockquote>
