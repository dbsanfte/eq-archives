            Enchanter Guide, Pt. 1<br>
            <br>
            Perhaps one of the most misunderstood (as well as underestimated) classes in Everquest is
            the enchanter. In a system where the major theory of battle is kill or be killed, we play
            a vital yet subtle role in a group or guild. We are at the same time extremely flexible,
            yet very fragile. Before we get into specifics, let's see where exactly the Enchanter fits
            into the combat equation...<br>
            <br>
            The basics of EQ combat are deal damage and prevent damage. The two common forms of
            dealing it are melee and spells (nukes or DoT). The common form of preventing it is
            healing. Since the enchanter can't heal, and has very weak damage dealing ability, our
            talents lie in elsewhere: both controlling a fight, and shifting the odds in our favor.
            Controlling a fight is perhaps one of the most difficult and rewarding roles in the entire
            game. Everything from spell choices and personal stats up to the moment you choose to cast
            can influence how effective you are at controlling the ebb and flow of battle. Common
            &quot;crowd control&quot; spells are the Mesmerize series, Stun series, Memwipe Series,
            and the most fun (and dangerous) of all, the Charm series. As for shifting the odds of
            battle, we offer a large range of buffs and debuffs, from the infamous Clarity and speedup
            buffs to our nasty stat and speed debuffs. Filling in the gaps of our repertoire are a
            grab-bag of utility spells like Illusions, animations, invisibilities, sight and travel
            enchancements and the like. I'll try to cover our ability to buff and debuff first. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Shifting the Odds:<br>
            <br>
            Where most classes excel in dishing out and preventing damage, the Enchanter helps to add
            more of the former and prevent less of the latter. A few key spells, then we'll get into
            how and when to use them.<br>
            <br>
            1. AC series - this series includes spells like Haze(4), Mist(12), Cloud(20), Obscure(29),
            Shade(39) and Shadow(49). These are fair Armor Class buffs, but not often used, since a
            cleric's AC series will overwrite them. Use them on yourself and pet when soloing, or in a
            group without a cleric or paladin handy.<br>
            <br>
            2. Stat Buff series - this is a variety of stat boosters, but should not be overlooked.
            Spells like Strengthen(1), Sympathetic Aura(20), Augmentation(29), Insight(39), and
            Brilliance(44) make up the meat of this series. The Charisma boosters are VERY critical to
            your crowd control ability, so always keep your best one up during any combat. Although
            Shaman and to an extent Druids get better pure stat buffers, only Enchanters can boost
            Intelligence and Wisdom, so these become fairly important in giving your healers and
            casters an increase in mana supply. Augmentation is nice when no shaman are around, or you
            want an edge solo; it'll make you harder to hit, which means harder to interrupt, which is
            a good thing. Then there's clarity (a.k.a. crack), which isn't a specific stat booster,
            but increases mana regeneration by a few magnitudes depending on your level. <br>
            <br>
            3. Debuff series - the debuff series is perhaps our second most efficient use of mana
            during combat outside of crowd control. Some examples are Weaken(1), Languid Pace(12), and
            Disempower(16). These drop your opponent's stats, making them easier to hit as well as
            doing less damage to your tanks. Slowdowns like Languid Pace(12) and Tepid Deeds(24) slow
            down your enemy's attack rate, which is critical in reducing damage. Use both whenever
            possible, but keep in mind they won't stack with the similar series Shaman have. I've seen
            many an Enchanter NOT use these spells, because there's no glaring evidence of how
            effective they are (read: tanks can't see it in the numbers) but they're worth every mana
            point. Use them, especially the slowdowns. <br>
            <br>
            4. Speedup series - by far the most powerful buff in our arsenal, as no other class comes
            close to our ability with them. Spells like Quickness(16), Celerity(39), and Swift Like
            the Wind(49) make this series our trump card in shifting the odds. Shaman get the same
            series later on, but cap out earlier than an Enchanter. Your tanks will love you for this,
            so try to keep it on them at all times. Also works very well on a pet during soloing. <br>
            <br>
            5. Rune series - this series is a mixed blessing, and includes Rune 1 through Rune 4.
            Don't get me wrong, they're great spells, as they are one of our only forms of
            pseudo-healing; but the cost can be prohibitive, especially for Rune 1 and 2. They add a
            nice damage shield to players when you know a tough opponent is coming up, and they can
            even be used in a pinch to save someone's life if a cleric isn't paying attention or is
            out of mana. Tip: in a hairy evac situation (Guk, Solusek B trains come to mind) when your
            gater is being hit, here's an Ubertaunt - rune yourself then the gater. All mobs will
            switch to you (yes, you'll get beat up soon) but it will buy that druid or wizzy the few
            vital seconds they need to get the evac off.<br>
            <br>
            Use of these spells is fairly self explanatory; some you use prior to combat, some during,
            some in-between fights. Don't underestimate any of them, and don't forget to keep that
            Charisma buffed!<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Crowd Control:<br>
            <br>
            This side of Enchanters is by far the most exciting, rewarding, and efficient aspect of
            our class. The only way to get good at controlling is to start using it regularly, as with
            experience comes insight into how mobs work and how you can prevent disaster. Some of the
            ways we can control fights is by making mobs &quot;off&quot;, stunning them, and
            controlling them via charms. Expecting a pull of 2 mobs and 5 came? &quot;No
            problem!&quot; says the experienced controller.<br>
            <br>
            1. Lull series - this line includes spells like Lull(1), Soothe(8), and Calm(20). Very
            important at low levels when pulling camps and multi-mob arrangements is common, don't
            hesitate to use them. Cast this series on mobs you don't want to aggro (attack you),
            starting from the closest mob and working your way back. Done properly, you can keep a
            nasty 5-mob camp down to single pulls.<br>
            <br>
            2. Mesmerize series - this is it ladies and gentlemen, the bread and butter of
            controlling. This lineup includes everything from the basic single-mob Mesmerize(4) to AOE
            shut-downs like Blanket of Forgetfulness(49). The basic premise of this series is turning
            a mob &quot;off&quot;, or otherwise making it incapable of fighting, casting, or even
            moving until it takes further damage. Charisma drastically effects how often your Mezzes
            will stick to a mob, so keep it as high as possible at all times. There's nothing worse
            than having a nasty mob slice you up because it resisted your initial Mez, so stack the
            odds in your favor whenever possible. More on how and when to use this line below.<br>
            <br>
            3. Stun series - this series includes everything from Color Flux(4) to Color Skew(44), and
            consists of AOE stuns. Be VERY careful when using this series, it's a double-edged sword.
            On one hand you can keep a mob from attacking every few seconds by a quick stun, allowing
            someone to heal or step back. On the other you can kill yourself by recklessly using it
            when your group is sorrounded by mobs that aren't mad at the tanks yet, or consider a stun
            more of a threat than a warrior's presence. <br>
            <br>
            4. Root series - I know quite a few Enchanters who don't bother to keep root loaded in
            their spell sets, but it's a good idea to keep one up at all times. I've lost track of how
            many times I've saved my own or another's skin using a root, buying enough time to step
            back or run away. Spell need may dictate you swap it out, but I regret the times I went to
            cast it and found a debuff or nuke in it's slot. In this series are constant upgrades,
            from the simple Root(8) to Paralyzing Earth(49). <br>
            <br>
            5. Whirl series - a distant cousin to Root, Whirl til You Hurl(12) and Dyn's Dizzying
            Draught(29) are nice to have, but hard to justify taking up a spell slot with. Both spells
            completely hold your opponent against it's will, during which time it cannot cast, move,
            or attack, regardless of any damage it's taking. Both spells are susceptible to breaking
            from someone stunning or bashing the mob, and both have an indefinite duration, meaning
            they may last under a second, and they may last many seconds. Personally, I can't justify
            using a slot for these spells when I can stun or root in combination (both much faster
            casting, too); the exception is when I must try to keep something from casting at all
            costs. In these instances, &quot;accept no substitute&quot;.<br>
            <br>
            6. Charm series - charm is a very powerful weapon, but must be used with good judgement.
            Included are versions from Charm(12) to Allure(49). It can completely turn the tide of
            battle, or it can get you killed faster than any cleric can heal. Charisma directly
            effects how often this spell takes hold, and how long it lasts, so once again keep that
            Charisma up. A basic rule of thumb is to charm only when your group is severely
            outnumbered and must have an ally, or you're lacking tanks; in most instances, you want to
            charm the weakest opponent (ie. lowest /con) in order to keep the charm as long as
            possible. Tip: Invisibility breaks charm, but most chanters know that. =)<br>
            <br>
            To cover every crowd control strategy would not only take up way more pages than I care to
            write, it wouldn't help much; the best way to get good at controlling is to get into messy
            situations on purpose, and do it. Think you know everything about controlling at 50? Try
            bringing one tank and one cleric to break up a tough spawn like the Froglok Lord or King.
            Still not a challenge? Solo them! =)<br>
            <br>
            The basics of control start in good communication. I can't stress enough how much easier
            things become if you and your puller set guidelines for mana checks, multiple pull
            signals, and the like. Make sure you know which mobs you'll be facing, the order that
            they're coming in, and whether or not any have been aggro'd beyond &quot;seeing&quot; the
            puller. <br>
            <br>
            Next comes a few decisions. As any good strategist knows, your best bet during the fight
            is to put all your tanks on the toughest mob, and remove it's damage potential as soon as
            possible. This leaves you with the job of mesmerizing (when I mention mesmerizing, I don't
            mean the literal spell, I'm referring to whatever your current version of it is) the
            weaker mobs and making sure your guys are only dealing with 1 attacker at a time. But that
            toughest mob is not always the one you want to drop first in a controlled environment. For
            instance, if your puller brings a &quot;tougher&quot; mob with low resistance, and a
            weaker mob with almost full resistance, you need to point out this exception to your
            group, and work around it. Shut down that tough one with a mez, and let your tanks switch
            to the weaker opponent who would normally resist your mezzing and probably chase you all
            over after the first resist. A good habit to get into is runing yourself prior to the
            pull; this gives you a few more chances to get off a second mez if a mob resists the first
            one and turns aggro on you. As for which version of the series to use, that's entirely up
            to you, and should be dictated by how fast you can react, how good your
            &quot;bodyguards&quot; are (more on this later) and what level you are. The lesser
            versions cast faster and have shorter duration, the stronger ones cast slower but last
            longer. Also, make sure your group knows not to DoT or otherwise damage anything you're
            going to turn off; DoT put on before a mez will wake the mob up as soon as the next
            &quot;tick&quot; comes, and you can bet the mob will be coming after you first.<br>
            <br>
            A good strategy is to use a &quot;bodyguard&quot; system to keep you alive during heavy
            controlling. Pick a tank (paladins make the best, due to stuns, root, and healing/lay
            hands) and a cleric that you trust to keep you alive no matter what. Both of them can use
            stun spells to buy you time if a mez or charm fails, both can try rooting as a secondary
            attempt, and the paladin can always taunt or get the mob's attention with a quick slash or
            bash. Make sure your bodyguards know what you're trying to turn off and whether or not
            you're going to get hit if something wears off. <br>
            <br>
            The AOE stuns Enchanters get can be used in primarily two ways: self protection and taking
            away damage potential. They're a real life saver when a mob is aggro on you, and you need
            a quick moment to get off another mez attempt or a root/whirl. Also, use stuns to
            generally keep a mob from attacking, by using it every time it cycles around again. They
            take very little mana, cast quickly, and your tanks will thank you for it. <br>
            <br>
            That's about it for the basics of control. Hopefully I'll get around to writing a control
            guide for more advanced enchanters soon, which will include tips for the higher level
            zones, dragons, planes, and the like. Until then, keep your wits about you, a trusted
            paladin at your back, and your Charisma as high as possible. =)<br>
