              <p class="MsoNormal">Having played a significant number of
              different character types in EQ (especially melee characters of
              various kinds), I have been absolutely astounded by the amount of
              misinformation that seems to just float around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              </span>Everyone seems to have an opinion of what makes a melee
              character, especially a warrior, an effective and valued group
              member in EQ, and this guide is my attempt to add my two cents to
              the whole discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This guide is based on my experience playing
              a troll warrior to level 52 (as of this writing), but some of the
              tips and tricks I’ve picked up along the way will benefit nearly
              anyone, particularly if you play a ranger, rogue, bard, SK, or
              paladin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The opinions
              expressed below are my own, but have been formed from long
              experience, significant experimentation, and a mountain of trial
              and error.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">I’m also not trying to over-glorify the
              warrior class or gloss over the problems that warriors face in
              writing this guide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Warriors
              are an underpowered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
              goal is to make this very difficult class as easy and as much fun
              as possible, and to smooth out the rough spots as much as I can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">This guide is also not for newbies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I’ve seen a number of thorough guides out there for newer
              players, and this isn’t one of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This guide is meant to be an eclectic mix of tips and tricks
              for frustrated veterans, and will hopefully breathe a bit of new
              life into the warrior class.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">There are several kinds of warriors out
              there, and you need to know the differences between them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">stats-based
              warrior</b>, the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">AC seeker</b>,
              the <b>brawler</b>, <b>Mr. Good-looking</b>, and the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">lost
              boy</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let me
              explain…</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When I was <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">a
              stats-based warrior</b>, I pushed my dex, agi, and other stats as
              high as they could go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Those
              stats were on my character screen, so they must be important,
              right?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When choosing equipment, I often chose armor and jewelry that
              buffed up my stats at the expense of my AC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Besides, I had read some warrior guides that emphasized how
              important stats were.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
              guy (named Talon Boysenberry or something like that) wrote at some
              length in his guide about the many defensive benefits of agility,
              and how he hit more often because his dexterity was high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I read another by a dark elf warrior who wrote how his high
              intelligence caused him to learn his weapons skills so darn
              quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">High intelligence, indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Yep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh yeah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Sure thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yesiree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Way important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
              do you know what you get if you dump six points into your agility?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>An increase of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">one</i>
              AC.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Big whoop.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Needless to say, these guys were both <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">way</i> off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The offensive
              melee bonus you get from dexterity is minimal, if anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The defensive benefits of agi are almost nonexistent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>And intelligence does <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">not</b>
              help you improve your combat skills one bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The result of listening to these prodigies of
              war craft?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was one
              gigantic walking injury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              could hang in a fight for all of about 15 seconds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Clerics complained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              bled everywhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
              voice got hoarse from yelling, “Heal me!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I spent more time zoning out than I did fighting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>My corpse recovery skills became exceptional because of my
              constant practice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              even earned the lovely nickname ‘Mana-sponge’ from my healer
              buddies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
              horrible, and if you are a stats-based warrior, you are likely
              having this same experience yourself.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You see, the stats-based warrior has spent
              his time, effort, and money on all the wrong things, and it all
              adds up to some serious hurting.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After much frustration, I became the second
              type of warrior, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">the AC
              seeker</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When it
              comes to your stats, you must remember that Verant wants warriors
              to be the defensive masters of the game. You don’t get any
              save-your-skin maneuvers (like gate or FD), or any mana to heal
              yourself or nuke your opponent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Your survival really depends on your AC.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When choosing equipment, I benefited
              tremendously by pushing my AC as high as I possibly could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This was no easy task, but I consistently emphasized AC.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Stats were very much a secondary consideration (well, read
              on), but I learned that AC is of critical importance.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I want AC in every single item I wear.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Even my earrings have AC in them, and they are the highest AC
              earrings I can find.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              </span></h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The result of seeking to raise my Armor Class
              as high as possible?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I’m
              became a much more solid tank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I could hang in even truly ugly fights for long periods of
              time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mobs missed
              me more often, and when they did hit me, it was for less damage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>My fellow group members expended less mana healing me, so
              we had less down time, and gained more experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I feel that Hit Points are the second most
              valuable defensive statistic for the warrior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>As a result I also emphasize raising my HP as high as
              possible, but I rarely sacrifice AC to do so (well, read on a bit,
              and you’ll see what I mean).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Any piece of equipment that offers both high AC and high HP
              is defensively very strong, and I seek these kinds of items out
              regularly.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After spending some time as an AC seeker (and
              publishing the first edition of this guide), I became increasingly
              frustrated with my poor offensive output.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I could hang in fights longer due to my high AC, but the
              mobs were simply outlasting me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>It took longer for me to get beat up, but I was still
              getting beat up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              was surviving, but not really thriving.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I received a number suggestions and questions
              by players via email and posting comments regarding the guide.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This led to several experiments with haste items, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>One single warrior posted a <i>very</i> interesting
              suggestion in the forums at the end of the guide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>He suggested that his monumental strength was doing him a
              great service, in that he was hitting more often, and doing more
              damage, than the pure AC seeker.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>After much consideration and expensive experimentation I
              came to agree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              pushed my strength from 166 to 215 without buffs. This was no easy
              task, but I was careful with my equipment selection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I also acquired cobalt boots, which have a 25 pt. Str buff
              (for a mere 15k-ouch!), so I could self-buff up to 240 strength.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I found that I was suddenly much much more powerful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Thus I evolved again, and became the next
              type of warrior, the <b>brawler</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              <p class="MsoNormal">Strength is the one statistic that directly

              </span>Strength affects how often you hit, the maximum amount of
              damage that you do (high strength raises the damage cap), and the
              average amount of damage that you do over time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If you hit more often, you get more crits (which are
              broken, but occasionally add more damage to your attacks),
              crippling blows (which are actually pretty good), and you’ll
              stun mobs more often from your normal attacks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              benefit, it allows you to carry more weight, and thus more gear to
              switch out when you need it, as well as more loot before you have
              to go and sell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Last,

              </span>In order to have an effective offense, you must be

              <p class="MsoNormal">Many warriors have voiced a very strong
              belief that haste items, like the FBSS, are a tremendous boon to a
              warrior’s ability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
              some extent, I agree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
              for the many reasons listed above, I think that pushing your

              results were nearly identical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Wearing the TBB, however, I threw harder, more accurate
              blows, and added significantly to my AC while doing so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>In throwing fewer attacks, I saved a bit of stamina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The FBSS made my attacks faster (I threw 20% more sword
              strokes, basically, but they were weaker), added nothing to my AC,
              and exhausted me more rapidly.</p>

              </span>In the experiment I illustrated above, equipping my warrior

              high-end haste items like the COF, Rune Branded Girdle, Seblisian

              </span>The AC multiple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
              you equip an AC item, your character’s armor class jumps up at a
              ratio of (approximately) 1.6 to one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If a bracer has an AC of 10, your warrior’s AC will not
              increase by 10 pts when you equip it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Your characters AC will go up by about 16 points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This truly adds up, if you have been
              sacrificing ‘just a little’ AC here and there to gain some
              supposed statistical benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Remember, AC is a primary defensive consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Just take a good look at your character, and see where you
              could replace an item that gives a few eclectic stats (i.e., a
              bracer that gives +3 dex and +2 int) with a high AC item. When I
              did this, I bought items with a combined AC of about 13 for my
              character to wear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              was very surprised that when I equipped these items, my characters
              AC did not go up by 13 pts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
              went up by 20.</p>

              </span>A pair of these babies raises your AC by a nice chunk, and
              adds 130 hit points to your total.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              </span>Maybe if you hunch your shoulders up a little, and duck

              <p class="MsoNormal">Having said all that about AC, I will, on
              occasion, trade off a point of AC for a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">significant</i>
              statistical benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
              is because I do believe that stats do have <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">some</i>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As you might imagine, I’m <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

              </span>The system I use is subjective, so take it for what its
              worth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have come up
              with this system of trade offs after much thought,
              experimentation, and practice, and I offer it to you to use as you
              see fit, young grasshopper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              will sacrifice one point of AC, if the item has one of the
              following:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>1 pt of
              Str, 15 HP, 6 Dex, 6 Agi, or 5 Sta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I’ll also trade off one point of AC if the item has a
              save of +5 or better in it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              will not trade away any AC for int, wis, cha, or charges of
              anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I can’t

              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Mathematically, the formula could be
              expressed this way:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An
              items combat value (CV) is equal to its AC, plus one for every 1pt
              of Str, 15 HP, 6 Dex, 6 Agi, and 5 Sta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I also add one to its CV for every 1% haste increase.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>

              </span>CV = AC + Str + (total of hp, dex, agi, sta, and save

              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">You can see that this formula emphasizes
              (strongly) the primary offensive and defensive measures of warrior
              effectiveness (AC and Str), and emphasizes the secondary and
              tertiary considerations accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">So a Thick Banded Belt, with 8 AC and +15 Str
              would have a total combat value of 23.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Pretty easy to figure out.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">To further illustrate this point, lets

              </span>The crafted helm is AC 14, which is quite high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>It also gives +5 Int and +5 Wis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The stats, in this case, add nothing to its total combat
              value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus the CV of
              the crafted helm is 14.</p>

              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The skull shaped barbute is only AC 13.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The SSB has 35 hit points in it, however, which adds two
              points (one point for every 15 HP) to its value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>As a bonus, the SSB adds +10 to your save vs. magic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This gives it an additional +2 CV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The total CV of the SSB?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>17.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">What about the Flowing Black Silk Sash?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>It offers no AC, Str, or any other stats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Instead it offers 20% haste (depending on who you listen
              to).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So its total CV
              is 20.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not bad, but
              not the uber item some think it is.</p>

              has a regeneration effect on it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I have not come up with a way to calculate the usefulness

              </span>Each has its advantages, but these three races, in my
              opinion, hold the most promise as warriors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">When spending your points designing your
              warrior, I’d suggest putting every possible point into strength,
              for the reasons I’ve listed above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Dumping points into agi (if you haven’t heard what I’ve
              said about this by this point, you’ve obviously taken a few too
              many sling stones to the head.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Stop reading this and go buy yourself a helmet.) or dex or
              intelligence or anything else is a gigantic waste of points.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You will hate yourself later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If you have points left over after maximizing your
              strength, put a few points into your con.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">No formulas have been released, but there are
              minimums that might affect you somewhat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If your agility is below 75, you lose a significant amount
              of AC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I believe that
              if your dex is below 75, there is a parallel corresponding loss in
              crits, crips, procs, etc (but this is a guess on my part).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If you are designing a warrior with agi or dex below 75,
              push it up to 75.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pushing
              it over 75 is a waste.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Other races can be successful as warriors,
              but it should be obvious that the other races do not have as many
              points in their stats as do the three large races.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Also, you will not be able to push their strength up toward
              150 from the start (the max you can have in the design phase), and
              you will start with a strength that is significantly lower.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>A starting strength of 150 is a huge benefit, and makes
              equipment selection much much easier throughout your career.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If you really want to play a wood elf or gnome or munchkin
              or gremmie sand man or kobold or shaved monkey or mole man or
              whatever, knock yourself out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They can be successful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>It’s just a bit harder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Also, don’t lose hope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If you made some mistakes in designing your warrior, they
              can be fixed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              personally picked a solid race (the troll), but dumped every point
              into dex, agi, and int.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Because of that guy Boysenberry’s stupid guide!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              </span>Grrrrrr!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
              I’ll burn his village, and kill his pet hamster!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>And I’ll trample his garden with my smelly troll feet!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I’ll eat his dog’s food right out of its dish!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>And ….. but wait, I wax philosophical.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If you are like me, and either picked poorly suited race,
              or dumped your points into the wrong stats, or both, there is
              hope.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">The difficulty is that fixing this is no
              small task:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>you’ll
              need to seek items that are both <i>very</i> high AC and <i>very</i>
              high strength, all in one.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>These are <i>very </i>expensive, and <i>very</i> rare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Compare this situation to that of the ogre who started out
              with a strength of 150.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
              can pick up a few nominally priced items, and have his strength up
              to 200 easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He can
              spend 5k buying Greasy Grimy Pants (21 AC and 5 strength) and do
              well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You’ll need
              to push for that uber rare set of Gangly Green Greaves (with 20 AC
              and 15 str) for 250k in plat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>He has more options, and spends a bit less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You just have to work harder (and spend more) but it can be
              done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Also, when designing a new warrior, choose
              Rallos Zek as your deity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
              helps in a number of ways, particularly with the giants of Kael
              Drakkal.<span style="mso-spacerun:

              city to the rest of Velious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Choose something else, even agnostic, and you’ll have
              faction problems with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now
              personally I hate the idea of having to choose a deity even if
              this is only a game (because of my RL religious beliefs), but this
              does help make the game a bit easier.</p>

              fight, I can slap a patch on them while they med up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Some healers don’t care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              </span>Between fights, when the casters are medding, don’t run
              in big circles, and jump on and off nearby objects, go swimming,

              little.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was once in
              a group with a barbarian warrior who repeatedly just stood in one
              spot while the casters medded up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>When I asked him why he didn’t sit and heal, he said

              </span>Yes it does, Ironhead, and it takes 3 times as long if you

              <p class="MsoNormal">Kick does a bit more damage than slam does,
              but only at lower levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
              reasons no one can understand, kick caps at 150.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Slam goes to 200.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
              your warrior gets older, slam gets better and better compared to

              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In addition, slam will often stun a mob, and
              kick will not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
              means that slam is perfect against casting mobs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              to say is at that a warrior, who has no save-your-skin maneuver
              (like FD or gate), must at some reasonable point stop fighting and
              run for the zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
              are forced to rely on your AC and HP to save you, and if those get
              too low, you’ll die waiting for a heal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Wait too long, and you’ll be a very brave, very noble,
              corpse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And we’ll
              all be proud of you for your chivalry, as you loot your stuff.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">I recommend that you do not go below 25% of
              your hit points at midlevels, and 20% at high levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You must adjust this a little higher if you are deep in the
              zone, and you can go a little lower if you are fighting right near
              the zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Saving a
              few hit points for this purpose affords you a margin of safety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>With a significant number of hit points left when you
              choose to flee, you can still make it to the zone even if you take
              a few hits along the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Wait
              too long and you’ll experience that run-down (i.e., I’m too
              slow and not gonna make it) feeling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>And with one or two hits, and you’ll be that good looking

              </span>The healers then are well aware of the fact that they need
              to keep you above that point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>And if you do run, you will undoubtedly pull a few of the
              mobs with you away from your group when you go, so they will have
              less to deal with as you run screaming like a little girl for the

              they are a little expensive (at 10pp each) but they have saved my
              life many times, when no other sow was available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>When in a group with no sow, or running across that scary

              <p class="MsoNormal">One last thing on sow potions.<span style="mso-spacerun:

yes">&nbsp; </span>The casting time for them is like 5 seconds or more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>So if you think you will run un-sowed across the Emerald
              Jungle, then sow yourself when you get attacked, it won’t work.
              So go ahead and use it, it’s worth the 10pp to not have to

              be found deep in Sol A.<span style="mso-spacerun:

              these folks are useful to keep track of.<span style="mso-spacerun:

              all that profitable, finding potions can sometimes be challenging.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Also, try out some other potions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              <p class="MsoNormal">Now take your last two inventory slots (lower

              buttons out of those.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Place

              your off hand (a popular and effective combination).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You may choose to place a clay guardian shield (25 AC, and
              50 HP) in one of the inventory slots, and a jade green mace in the
              other slot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You now

              </span>Seeing this is about to occur, you quickly pick up the mace
              from inventory, and drop it into your primary weapon’s slot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You’ll find that the WS is now attached to your mouse
              pointer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now just
              click on the inventory slot, and your WS is in inventory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You fight on, using your mace and yak, and find that you

              self-preservation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
              you are a medium sized warrior, you don’t have slam, so you have
              no ability to stun them while casting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>But wait, that shield is now very handy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You pick it up on your mouse pointer, and drop it in your
              off-hand slot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Push
              the bash button, and the mob’s casting is interrupted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You can even try to time it just right, so that you are
              dual wielding most of the time, but dropping the shield in and
              bashing just at the right moment, then dropping in the yak again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              you as the healer tells you he’s oom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You quickly drop in your clay guardian shield, and keep
              your WS in your primary hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This is your highest AC combination, and gives you 50 hp on

              <p class="MsoNormal">Verant has repeatedly stated that they did
              not intend that bows, or ranged weapons in general, become primary
              forms of attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
              lousy damage/delay ratios, poor range, the fact that targets can
              be too far above/below you, too close to use a ranged weapon, or
              the oddly frustrating ability of arrows to disappear if a player
              or object gets in the way of your target, they succeeded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I’m the only warrior I know that uses his bow with any
              effectiveness.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When in town, I buy (or fletch) about 100
              arrows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I go
              through them quickly.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I often use the shoot and scoot method of
              pulling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Shoot the
              mob, run (sow’ed, of course) midway to your party, shoot again,
              run to your group, and shoot as it makes its final approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I have done up to 60 pts (total) damage or more to a mob by
              doing this, and although not extremely effective, I think it makes
              a little difference, and I have not taken <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">any</b>
              damage in so doing.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The alternative, widely used, is to run up to
              the mob, hit it with your sword, and run back to your group.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You get hit two or three times by the mob and his buddies
              before you can turn and run, sometimes more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You return to your group injured, and you’ve done minimal
              damage to the mob.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
              benefits of bow pulling are obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">In addition, if a mob runs, and I cannot
              pursue effectively, shooting often does enough damage to slow him
              down.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This is effective in situations where the geography and
              pathing causes the mob to run in odd patterns, or when the mob
              gets a good head start.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Bow pulling is also the preferred method when
              the mob spawns in an odd place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>When hunting the planks in Cazic-Thule, for example, you
              could shoot a mob, do some damage, and run back to your group
              without having to make too many turns (and end up in the water).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If I’m not the puller, I wait with the
              group with my bow in hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
              the mob follows the puller in, I get off a free shot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Again, not super effective, but it’s a few hit points
              less that we have to chop off of the baddie.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Occasionally a party member will root a mob a
              short distance away from the group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I take this opportunity to sink 6 or 8 arrows into dummy,
              and he is doing absolutely zero damage to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>When he breaks root, guess whom he aggroes on?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>That’s right, me, the tank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Saves the rooter a scary moment.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>

              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Training in the use of the bow is fairly
              easy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I often do this
              during down time, when I’m waiting to find a group.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I just dump arrows into the mob that the nearest group is
              pulling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My archery
              skill goes up, and they appreciate the help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I have found that I almost never need to dump training
              points into my other weapon skills, but archery just goes up too
              slowly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have had to
              dump a bunch of points into this skill, but its now up to a level
              that is close to my other weapons skills, and I seldom miss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">There were some recent changes in quivers
              that cause them to reduce the delay on your bow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This is, in effect, a minor haste item for your bow only.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I have not had the chance to experiment with this, but it may
              prove beneficial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Experiment,

              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Due to the poor quality of bows in general,
              and their very limited usefulness as weapons, many warriors put AC
              items of various kinds in their ranged weapons slot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">This has some advantages in melee combat
              (obviously), as your AC is a bit higher, and the item can add to
              strength or other stats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
              this advantage is negated when this melee-only warrior has to
              pull, and gets whacked doing it because he has no bow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">The only way to avoid this, it seems, is to
              quick switch out your AC item with your bow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This is a bit problematic, as you have to have a third open
              inventory slot, and the timing of that last shot as the mob is
              making his final approach to your party, then making the switch,
              is all a bit tricky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              use my bow quite a bit, so I personally have little experience
              with this, but it certainly can be done.</p>

              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Many weapons have a proc effect on them, and
              these can be quite effective, as they add to your offense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I have noticed, however, that DD procs (which do one shot
              of damage to a mob) are better than DOT procs (which do damage
              over a period of time).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There are two reasons for this.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>First, DOT procs often do not stack with the spells of your
              party members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had
              a Kunzar Ku’juch for a while, and I liked the damage, the low
              delay, and the mob slowing 100pt DOT Engulfing Darkness proc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The problem was that the proc did not stack with snare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Every time I was in a group with a ranger or druid (which
              was all the time) they would snare the mob at the start of the
              fight (so it couldn’t reach the casters) and my procs wouldn’t
              take hold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Engulfing
              Darkness does not stack with snare.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Secondly, procs go off at random times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Your DD proc might go off right now, then again 2 seconds
              from now, then again 5 minutes from now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You never know.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If your DD proc goes off three times in a row, so much the
              better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You just
              nuked the mob three times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
              you have a DOT proc on your weapon and it goes off two or three
              times in a row, it will not stack with itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>In other words, the proc is not doing much more damage than
              if it had gone off only once.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

              </span>I’m amazed at how often all the melee types in a group
              will stand right in front of the mob and hack away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Jump in behind it, and your offensive production goes up
              (for you ogres out there, that means you’ll do more damage).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If you are behind it, and your buddies are all gathered in

              never, if at all possible, let a mob get behind you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You are taking lots more damage from him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              your group after you’ve already started fighting something.<span style="mso-spacerun:

              <p class="MsoNormal">Recently, Absor/Alan hosted a “warriors
              forum” on the EQ message boards (he did this for all the
              classes), soliciting responses from players on suggested
              changes/improvements/nerfs to the warrior class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Now warriors are usually a very quiet class on the boards.
              In fact it seems every other class has an opinion about warrior
              issues and posts on any warrior topic I’ve ever seen, and they
              post as often as the warriors themselves do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>In this case, however, I was surprised to see literally
              hundreds, if not thousands, of posts, most by warriors themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The majority were highly intelligent, well thought out, and
              class balancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
              concerns voiced by player-warriors were nearly unanimous, and the
              suggestions were outstanding.</p>

              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Alan posted to the boards exactly once,

              <p class="MsoNormal">After hundreds of insightful player posts, he
              posted his list of “fixes.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Upon seeing the list, I got the impression that he looked
              at the player posts in an extremely cursory manner, missed the
              point of what most of us were saying, and published a list of
              watered down suggestions, some of which appeared to be his own
              ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In saying this
              I am not trying to be insulting in any way, but it really appeared
              that Alan took all of about 15 minutes in reading the posts and
              making up his list.<span style="mso-spacerun:

              player-warriors made about the warrior class in EQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>My purpose in this is to (hopefully) revive something of a
              discussion between player-warriors and Verant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>My purpose is NOT to disparage the other melee classes in
              any way at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
              fully understand that other classes have their issues as well, and
              I truly do empathize with those issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Although I do compare warriors to other classes, I try to
              do so fairly, without in any way minimizing that class’s

              <p class="MsoNormal">I encourage each of you to do a simple
              experiment, the next time you are grouped with another melee class
              your level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ask them
              what their HP and AC are unbuffed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>You will be amazed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both
              AC and HP are very close to your own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If they self buff, they may even be higher than yours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>And the vast majority of the other classes have hidden
              caches of HP they can draw upon at will (using the <i>root and
              heal</i> strategy, <i>lifedraw</i>, <i>mend</i>, <i>LOH</i>, etc),
              giving them more HP than is initially obvious.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The sad fact is that the other melee classes
              have very nearly what you have in AC, and they actually have more
              functional hit points (FHP) than you do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Don’t get me wrong, at high levels you’ll have 200-300
              more hit points than they do (which is maybe worth 3 to 4 hits at
              most by a mob at this level), but they’ll have immediate access
              to a lot more HP at will.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Now you do have the highest <i>potential</i>
              AC in the game, if you can get the uber gear you need.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This is unbelievably difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>In other words, you’ll probably never get much of this
              stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So you’ll
              probably have to buy it piecemeal at the EC tunnel, and bankrupt
              yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A whole
              suit of sentient armor sells for 13k; cobalt boots sell for 15k
              alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Get the idea?</p>

              </o:p>
              </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As a small example, when I was 51 I grouped
              with a 51 troll SK, and asked my AC and HP questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>My AC was NINE points higher than his, and I had 220 more
              HP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He told me that
              he never self buffed (with shieldskin or vampiric embrace) and
              never bothered to get his 280 pt uber-lifetap spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>He didn’t need to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
              advised me that he could lifedraw for 75pts per cast, and if he
              had full mana, this was worth about 1k of HP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>I thought maybe he was bragging until he did it right in
              front of me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Never
              missed a tap, either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
              keep things brief, I’ve done similar experiments with paladin
              (nice self buffs, greater heal, and LOH), and they have way more
              FHP than even the previous example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>In fact, when everything was figured in, the pali had
              almost double the FHP my warrior had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Everyone speculates, but no one really compares.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Ask them yourself, and weep.</p>

              </span>They fixed the bonuses on two-handed weapons a number of

              they don’t do all that much, they are all on the same timer, and
              they have incredible reload times.<span style="mso-spacerun:

              class, is so badly flawed that you probably forget about it most
              of the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offensively,
              warriors aren’t exactly pushing the overpowered envelope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

              </span>Fix the Disciplines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
              the disciplines are to be regarded as the result of a veteran
              warrior learning new skills, tricks, tactics, strategies, and
              physical abilities during the course of a long career, they should
              reflect these superior abilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>The disciplines, as discussed above, are of very limited
              usefulness the way they are now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They are all on the same timer, that timer is too long, you
              only get them at the end of your career, and some of them are
              useless (i.e., </span>Fearless<span style="font-style:normal">.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Every discipline should be on a separate timer, each should
              be useable once per game day, and there should me many of them,
              spaced out across the levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>They should not stack with each other. If a warrior is
              using a discipline that lasts ten minutes, and five minutes into
              it he uses a second discipline (as the tactical situation
              demands), the first discipline is immediately cancelled out, and
              the effects of the current discipline are felt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This gives warriors some strategy to employ, as well as
              several dozen tactical choices to make.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>These could make up for the warrior’s lack of skills and
              spells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
              appropriate use of a discipline could be the thing that sets one
              warrior above another, and their use in a critical situation might
              save the party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-style:normal">If you want
              the warrior to be simply a tank, you have to give him some ability
              to actually do that job—take a ton of damage, and keep the mob
              off the casters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
              warrior could be a viable character class if he were given the
              ability to absorb massive amounts of damage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>As I discussed earlier, the HP and AC issues that currently
              exist preclude this from actually occurring. <o:p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-style:normal">This fix
              would include giving the warrior a damage reduction ability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>This would reflect a warrior’s ability to “roll with
              the punches” in melee situations (much like a talented boxer
              does in our day), thus negating a portion of the mob’s blows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>If a warrior got a 1% damage reduction skill every level,
              he would be able to absorb far more damage than he does now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>A warrior at level 50, who has far fewer HP than he needs
              to do his job, and has an AC that is the same as the other melee
              classes out there, isn’t the tank he’s cracked up to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>Give him a 50% reduction to every blow against him, and he
              suddenly becomes formidable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
              </span>He can travel more safely, do CR better, is a better tank
              than the other melee classes, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If warriors were meant to outlast the mobs and other classes
              during a fight, this ability would enable them to actually do
              that.<o:p>

              (the raising of skill caps, the recent mana increases, etc) were
              all appropriate. I’ve tried, in writing this, to point out that
              there should be some type of corresponding improvement to the
              long-ignored warrior class as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
