     <td> Velium Blue Diamond Ring - one faceted blue diamond, one pure enchanted velium bar, and your clay signet in a jewelry kit (trivial &gt;250). <br />
<br />
Filled Sacred Urn - three sacred waters and your wooden signet in the sacred urn (no-fail combine). <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel is located at the top of the elevator in the Library in the Plane of Knowledge. Also<br />
<br />
Be Flagged for Bertoxxulous<br />
Be Flagged for Myler and Adier<br />
Be 220+ in Blacksmithing<br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Aid Grimel' <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel says 'Greetings and Salutations! I am Grimel, aid to the mighty paladin Councilman Taldarius. In between his duties to the city, Taldarius and I spend most of our time in the Planes cleansing evil. Even now I am preparing for battle. Taldarius intends to go further into the Planes than ever before on our next trip and I am working on gathering the special supplies we need. If you are willing to help I may have some use for your skills if you are a master of trades and have traveled in the Planes.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am willing to help and am a master of trades.' <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel says 'Excellent! I am looking for a smith to add a special imbue to Councilman Taldarius's armor. Are you well versed in the art of smithing?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am well versed in the art of smithing.' <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel says 'Thank you for offering to help. Take this breastplate and clean it with a diluted acid wash to get all of the debris out of it. Brew the wash by combining acid and three celestial essences. Once the armor is cleaned, coat it with hurricane temper. Finally add two black diamonds of nightmare to the breastplate. This should provide adequate protection for our next journey.' <br />
<br />
(He gives you a filthy breastplate) <br />
<br />
Make Acid Wash in a brew barrel by combining one jar of acid and three celestial essences.<br />
<br />
Clean the breastplate by combining it in a forge with the acid wash (trivial 231). <br />
<br />
Coat the Cleaned Breastplate in a forge with one hurricane temper (trivial 231). <br />
<br />
Combine the Coated Breastplate by combining it in a forge with two black diamonds of nightmares (trivial 250). <br />
<br />
Give Aid Grimel Decorated Breastplate. <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel smiles. 'What a wonderful job! Councilman Taldarius shall wear this on our next adventure, I am sure he will find it more protective than his old one. Take this signet as a token of my gratitude. If you are not too busy I have another task, do you have any brewing skill?'<br />
<br />
Reward: <br />
Hardened Leather Signet <br />
<br />
You say, 'I have skill in brewing.' <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel says 'I bet you could make a wicked brew! However I am forced to drink a refreshing drink while out adventuring. I do have this powder that will give the best drinks quite a bite though. Mix the powder in with two Kaladim Constitutionals and a flask of pure water. If you need more dust just ask for it! Put three twice brewed constitutionals and the signet in this drink barrel. As hard as drink barrels are to get these days, you need to return it to me along with the drink you create with it.' <br />
<br />
(Aid Grimel hands you a Portable Drink Barrel and Fermenting Dust) <br />
<br />
Purified water - mix one celestial essence with two flasks of water in a brew barrel (trivial of 66). <br />
<br />
Twice Brewed Constitutional - fermenting dust, purified water, and two kaladim constitutionals in a planar brew barrel (trivial 250). <br />
<br />
Portable Drink - three twice brewed constitutionals with the hardened leather signet in the portable drink barrel (trivial &lt; 250). <br />
<br />
Give the portable drink and portable drink barrel to Aid Grimel. <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel gulps down a Twice Brewed Constitutional and burps loudly! 'Ahhhh that was refreshing! That should hold me over for quite some time. I see you are quite deft of hand, perhaps you would care to put your jewel craft skills to the test?' <br />
<br />
Reward: <br />
Clay Signet<br />
 <br />
You say, 'I would like to put my jewel craft skills to the test.' <br />
<br />
(Aid Grimel hands you etching dust) <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel says 'My hand was crushed when I used it to deflect a blow from a War Boar that was headed towards Taldarius's back. For some time afterwards my hand was crippled but Brell saw to it I regained full use of it. The ring I used to wear was damaged beyond repair and my hand was never steady enough to etch a new one. If you would make me a new one by combining a mounted blue diamond, the etching dust and etching tools in a jewelry kit. Then take the faceted gem and combine it with a bar of pure enchanted velium and my signet. I have no idea how the pure bars are made. You may want to seek the help of the ice dwarves.' <br />
<br />
Go to Thurgadin and hail Meg Tucter.<br />
<br />
You say, 'What bar of pure enchanted velium?' <br />
<br />
Meg Tucter says 'Wow that is an odd request. Very rarely do we make an item that requires a pure bar of metal. Pure enchanted velium bars are made by combining three enchanted velium bars in a forge along with a coldain velium temper, pure water and a Coldain smithy hammer. Tis quite expensive but it enables the crafter to obtain pure working materials.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I need a set of Etching Tools.' <br />
<br />
Meg Tucter says 'Oh, really? There are not many that work in faceting gems. I am surprised to see your interest. You can have this old set of mine. If you are working with Royal Velium and want to give it to someone else, you can use these etching tools and your jewelers kit to engrave the piece for them. Be careful though, because once the armor is engraved you cannot remove it and it will be useless to the Dain. There is no need to return the tools, Talem recently made me a new sturdy set. Brell bless him.' <br />
<br />
(Meg gives you etching tools) <br />
<br />
Mounted Blue Diamond - combine two velium bars with a blue diamond in a jewelry kit (trivial &lt;122). <br />
<br />
Faceted Blue Diamond - combine one mounted blue diamond, the etching tools, and the etching dust in a jewelry kit (trivial &gt;250). <br />
<br />
Pure Enchanted Velium Bar - three bars of enchanted velium, one purified water, one coldain velium temper, and one coldain smithy hammer in a forge (trivial &gt; 250). <br />
<br />
Velium Blue Diamond Ring - one faceted blue diamond, one pure enchanted velium bar, and your clay signet in a jewelry kit (trivial &gt;250). <br />
<br />
Give Aid Grimel the resulting ring. <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel grins. 'Quite a nice ring you have made for me. May it serve me as well as my old ring. Here take this signet. We seem to be finishing the tasks on my list at a nice pace. Tell me when you are ready to use some clay.' <br />
<br />
Reward: <br />
Wooden Signet<br />
 <br />
You say, 'I am ready to use some clay.' <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel says 'On our last tome gathering expedition a stray arrow in the Plane of War struck our urn filled with sacred water. It was quite a waste of sacred water! Three large enchanted blocks of clay, three lacquered opals, a vial of purified mana, a ceramic lining, sculpting tools and the urn pattern should make an unfired urn. The urn is so large you will need to fire it with three divine crystalline glazes. Once you have the urn it needs to be filled with three sacred waters and the signet as a cap.' <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel gives you an urn pattern!<br />
<br />
Unfired Sacred Urn - three lacquered opals, three large blocks of magic clay, sculpting tools, vial of purified mana, one ceramic lining, and the urn pattern in a pottery wheel (trivial &gt; 250). <br />
<br />
Sacred Urn - unfired sacred urn with three divine crystalline glazes in a kiln (trivial &gt;250). <br />
<br />
Filled Sacred Urn - three sacred waters and your wooden signet in the sacred urn (no-fail combine). <br />
<br />
Give the filled sacred urn to Aid Grimel. <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel says 'Outstanding work! I can feel the purity of the water radiating through the clay. Are ye skilled with the needle as well as an accomplished potter?' <br />
Reward: <br />
Metal Signet<br />
<br />
You say, 'I am skilled with the needle.' <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel says 'I appreciate the help. I need a new tunic made for Councilman Taldarius. Last trip through the Plane of Disease, one of those flies spit mucus on him and it dripped through his armor seams! The result was a gooey mess that ate away all the leather underneath. It was a blessing he was wearing something under all that metal! Combine three firesilk swatches, a vial of purified mana, an emblem of fire, a firestrand curing agent, a tunic pattern and the signet. Bring it to me when you have completed it.' <br />
<br />
Firesilk Swatch - two fire silk arachnid silks in a planar sewing kit<br />
<br />
Firestrand Curing Agent - Obsidiawood sap + vial of purified mana<br />
<br />
Emblem of Fire - red diamond of fire + blank emblem + enchanted bar of molten ore + planar jewellers kit<br />
<br />
Give Aid Grimel the fire undergarment tunic. <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel inspects the tunic. 'Good work. This will definitely serve Councilman Taldarius well. Here take this! If you have skills with a fletching knife I may have a job for you to do.' <br />
Reward: <br />
Marked Signet<br />
<br />
You say, 'I am skilled with a fletching knife.' <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel says 'Aye I can see you are skilled with the fletching knife. It is good too, I need to replace Councilman Taldarius's bow from Plane of Air. Combine a planing tool, two wind metal bow cams, an air arachnid silk string, a featherwood staff and the signet. I hope the bow will be up to his standards, he sure loved his old bow.' <br />
<br />
Give Aid Grimel the resulting bow. <br />
<br />
Aid Grimel says 'Masterful work! I can see your skill in the curves of the bow. Take this as a sign of my respect for your skill. The last item I need before we can be off is some food. I warn you this will truly test your skills. Do you fancy yourself a master chef?' <br />
Reward: <br />
