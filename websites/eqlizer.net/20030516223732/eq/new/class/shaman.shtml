     guide was user submitted. It was submitted by GreyWeasel(who forgot to
     leave his role playing name), and updated by Rimbuk Da'Hammie:<br>
     <br>
     Shamans are a strange class in Everquest. They can do a bit of almost
     everything from melee to all manners of casting, and are one of the most
     versatile classes in Everquest. The shaman is billed as an offensive-minded
     cleric according to the documentation, but that's really the druid's role.
     Druids are better offensive casters than shaman are, and can almost compete
     with wizards for effectiveness at times. Shaman are not as powerful at
     striking their enemies down, but are far more effective in wearing them
     down with curses, poison, and other dehibilitating effects. Shaman are also
     far more effective than druids at building up themselves and others through
     quickness/alacrity, ability buffs, and utility enchantments. Shaman can
     also melee better than any other priest class.<br>
     <br>
     <u>Weapons</u><br>
     <br>
     Shamans can use most 1H and 2H blunt melee weapons in the game. These are
     generally effective weapons that are a little slower or weaker than
     slashing weapons are. They are also generally a bit heavier. Blunt weapons
     are still pretty effective overall, and there are a lot of high-quality
     magic ones out there.<br>
     <br>
     Also, shamans have the ability to develop the piercing weapons skill.
     Recent changes have allowed the shaman to use many more piercing weapons
     than before, but it should not be your primary melee skill. You can usually
     find a better blunt weapon that corresponds to your level.<br>
     <br>
     In a similar fashion, shamans have the ability to use all
     &quot;standard&quot; axes. I say &quot;standard&quot; because shamans are
     not able to equip throwing axes or battle-axes. But there is a weapon type
     known simple as &quot;axe&quot; that shaman's can use. This includes the
     famous polished granite tomahawk, which is a fantastic weapon.
     Unfortunately shamans can never develop the skill to wield slashing
     weapons, and must rely on their base offense score to hit. This means
     shamans will almost always be better off using a blunt weapon anyhow.<br>
     <br>
     <u>Armor</u><br>
     <br>
     Shamans can wear most armor up to, but not including, plate mail. Shamans
     can also equip a shield. In most cases shamans can equip the powerful magic
     armor that exists in the game. They have a Rubicite replacement called
     Totemic Armor, which has the same AC as Rubicite, but gives a bonus of 5
     stat points to various stats, depending on the piece of totemic. Overall,
     you will not miss the chance to wear some of the best armor in the game.<br>
     <br>
     <u>Special equipment</u><br>
     <br>
     Shamans don't have all that much class specific equipment except for
     Totemic armor. Outside of the planes and dragon loot, they are limited to
     just a few weapons and some random low to mid level pieces of armor. And
     while powerful, they are certainly not some of the most powerful items in
     the game. Oh, and good luck getting these items, as they are off some of
     the rarest spawns in the game as well! An example would be the Mortificator
     Staff, found in Rathe Mtns. The spawn is so rare that 8mo's after release,
     you can only find a handful of these staves on each server, if that.<br>
     <br>
     On a lighter note shamans can use almost all equipment that clerics can,
     and most of the mana-bonus items that pure casters can get. Shamans also
     will be able to use all equipment limited to the large races. There are a
     limited number of such items available, but some of the nice 2H hammers do
     fall into this class of items that only the big races can handle. One is
     the now infamous Gatorsmash Maul, with a whopping 30/70 damage to delay
     ratio.<br>
     </font>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
     <u>Ability Scores:<br>
     </u><br>
     Shaman races by and large are big, strong, stupid, and unpleasant. By the
     books the main attributes of a shaman are his stamina, wisdom, and charisma
     scores.&nbsp; You are going to want to add points to your three prime
     requisites more than anything else.<br>
     <br>
     <strong>Stamina</strong> - the trickiest stat to judge. Stamina affects
     your hit points, but not signifcantly. In fact, 30 extra stamin will only
     add about 90-100 hps at level 50.. Keep stamina in mind for melee only. If
     you plan to melee alot at later levels, you may want to dump a few points
     into this stat.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><strong>Wisdom</strong>
     - Wisdom affects how much mana you have, and how often you succeed in your
     skill rolls. At level 50, you get 10mana per extra wisdom point your shaman
     has. While one or two points is not significant, 25 wisdom will equal 250
     mana, which may just be enough to save you in a tough fight. Also, wisdom
     and intelligence are the only 2 stats that a <em>shaman</em> can't buff
     with spells(enchanters can buff wisdom in a minor sense). Given these
     facts, most shaman will choose to dump as many points as they can into
     wisdom<br>
     &nbsp;<br>
     <strong>Charisma</strong> - actually quite useful. Charisma is the most
     widely useful ability to all classes/races at every level. It affects how
     much you buy and sell for as well as how your reputation is affected by
     faction hits. For shaman, it also affects the amount of time the spell
     'Befriend Animal' will affect a target ( how long you can charm an animal).<br>
     <br>
     <u>Race<br>
     </u><br>
     <strong>Trolls</strong> seem to have the worst shaman stats to start, but
     make up for that with their race modifier - regeneration. Regeneration is
     undoubtedly the best racial ability in the game and, to some, more than
     compensates for the slight difference in abilities. Trolls have better
     combat-specific stats than ogres do with higher dexterity and much higher
     agility. Agility adds directly to your AC and may be the best combat stat
     of all the four. Trolls are evil, however, and are therefore hated by most
     of the cities and inhabitants in Norrath. While it is not impossible to
     build faction, this should be a consideration before starting a troll
     shaman. Their newbie area, Innothule Swamp, is quite good, with an
     abundance of frogloks, skeletons, swampwater crocs, and other mobs
     wandering around to kill. Bottom line: Trolls have the least downtime, have
     the best melee stats, and are the easiest to solo with.<br>
     <br>
     <strong>Ogres</strong> have the most base stat points of the 3 shaman
     races, with Strength and Stamina making the real difference. They have
     higher wisdom than trolls, but are significantly lacking in agility and
     dexterity. Again, they are evil, so you should consider this when deciding
     what race to play. Their newbie zone, Feerrott, is probably the trickiest
     of the newbie zones. It is very dark, and a young shaman can easily get
     lost among the trees and hills. Bottom Line: Ogres are not wanted in most
     places because they are evil, and don't have regeneration, but have many
     more stat points than the other two races to start with, so they are a
     decent choice.<br>
     <br>
     <strong>Barbarians</strong> are the best casters of the three and have the
     advantage of not being a hated race. Barbarians have slightly better
     shaman-specific stats than ogres do, but both ogres and trolls are far
     better melee and better solo races than barbarians are. Barbarians,
     however, do not suffer from the racial hatred that plagues the other two
     evil races, and are far less likely to be soloing at any given time. Their
     newbie zone, Everfrost, is probably the most highly populated, and
     therefore the best newbie zone of the 3 shaman races. Bottom line:
     Barbarians are fine shamans and will give you the least headaches
     faction-wise, and as such, are the most popular shaman class.<br>
     <br>
     <u>Shaman Roles<br>
     </u><br>
     <strong>The shaman in melee:<br>
     </strong><br>
     Shamans are surprisingly effective at melee throughout the game. In the
     early levels (1-10) a shaman will be practically as effective as any true
     melee class. Shamans do not get as many skill points in melee skills as
     pure melee classes do, but this won't matter much until later levels.
     Shamans are limited to [ ( lvl + 1 ) x 4 ] ability points per level in all
     weapons skills. This will keep them from being true warriors throughout the
     game. But all shamans get a slam attack by virtue of being a large race,
     and that is a significant advantage.<br>
     <br>
     Slam only does one point of damage, and never increases. But it does stun
     targets effectively, and adds a second attack that no other pure caster
     gets. It is perfect for disrupting enemy casters when timed properly. It is
     also great for stunning a fleeing monster and preventing his escape. As a
     shaman gains levels he may have the odd role where he is the only character
     capable of stunning an enemy, as most warrior classes opt for 2H weapons or
     dual wield over using a shield. So be prepared to use slam frequently (
     Hotkey it! )<br>
     <br>
     Shamans also get respectable hit points at about 21 per level. That's going
     to be enough to hang out in a battle and take some hits. You will always
     want the best armor possible at any time, and shamans can wear all armor
     that isn't raw plate. That's most of the good armor in the game, and
     certainly enough to be melee-proficient for your first 20+ levels.<br>
     <br>
     Around lvl 20 you will notice that your shaman is quickly losing his
     effectiveness as a melee fighter, but you can still get in there and mix it
     up with your slam and your weapons. You will have adequate hit points to
     survive some attacks and enough armor to absorb some damage.<br>
     <br>
     On another note, shamans also have a unique line of spells that allows them
     to transform from a semi-melee caster into a near-melee non-caster. At
     level 19 shamans can cast <em>Frenzy</em>. It doesn't work like a normal
     spell that you pay the cost of and it takes effect. Instead, you cast it
     and it continues to drain your mana until you run out. In exchangee for
     this Frenzy adds greatly to your strength and also boosts your AC and
     attack speed significantly. Later spells along this line also add to your
     Hit Point regeneration considerably. This spell line won't make you a
     warrior, but it does allow you to melee better than any other non-melee
     class at a significant cost.<br>
     <br>
     <strong>The shaman as a caster:</strong><br>
     <br>
     Shamans are arguably the most versatile casters around. In most basic terms
     they have respectable offensive spells that do Direct Damage (DD) and
     Damage over Time (DoT). These are the spells that kill MOBs and are easy to
     understand. Cast them and watch as the enemy takes damage.<br>
     <br>
     Aside from the lvl 1 burst of flame, all shaman DD spells are all based on
     cold, so they aren't too effective in Permafrost and some other zones. That
     stinks for young barbarians but is great everywhere else. Most creatures
     are not very frost resistant. Shaman DD spells are some of the least
     efficient DD in the game, costing a ton of mana for the amount of damage
     being dealt. Shaman DD spells are relatively quite expensive. But while
     they are not efficient, they are certainly effective. In a party situation
     you may want to drop a big ice blast or two on a tough monster for a quick
     kill. Shamans cannot keep up with wizards or druids in dealing massive
     damage throughout combat, but they can contribute effectively if it is
     necessary.<br>
     <br>
     DoT spells, on the other hand, are far more efficient at dealing damage for
     the mana they cost you. Since your damage is spread out over a minute or
     two you get an overall much better damage/mana ratio. Shaman DoTs are all
     based on either poison or disease attacks. Poison spells do their damage
     within 45 seconds, while disease spells are slightly more mana efficient
     but take around 2minutes. Shamans can stack up both a poison and a disease
     spell to really wear down a monster quickly.<br>
     <br>
     Aside from the obvious damage spells, shamans have the very subtle buffing
     and debuffing spells. These spells will add to any physical attribute of a
     character or take away from most physical attributes of an NPC (non-player
     character). These spells are generally underappreciated by non-shamans
     because the affects are not drastic, yet they are very useful at increasing
     a characters (or parties) effectiveness over the course of the buff. The
     shaman Disempower and Drowsy line of debuffs are particularly effective, as
     they can slow down an NPC's attacks or considerably cripple his ability to
     deal damage. This mean less healing and, therefore, less mana spent. NPC's
     attacks are all based on their raw ability scores (ie. they do NOT work the
     same way players attacks do) so when you take away from an NPC's strength
     and stamina it DIRECTLY affects the maximum damage that NPC can do and how
     well he is attacking overall. 20 points of strength removed from an NPC can
     translate into 10-20% less damage from EVERY hit that NPC scores. And he
     won't be able to score as many hits, either.<br>
     <br>
     Furthermore, shamans have the fantastic ability to reduce the ability of an
     NPC to resist any kind of magical attack. The Malise and Insidious Fever
     lines together take down each of the 5 NPC resistances. A caster that is
     normally partially resisted by a mob will most likely have his DDs hit, and
     hit for full damage, when these spells are place..<br>
     <br>
     Shamans also have other spells that add direct bonuses to AC, hit points,
     magic resistance, and attack speed. Clerical HP and AC bonuses are
     superior, but ours work just fine when no cleric is around. And the bonus
     to attack speed is not to be underestimated. It should always be maintained
     on your group's tanks when possible. Same thing goes with magic resistance,
     which is obviously a handy ability to have in effect.<br>
     <br>
     A shaman's healing ability is also worth noting. Shamans heal e exactly the
     same as druids do. That's to say that shamans are not primary healers, but
     are effective healers nevertheless. Usually shaman's heals come one circle
     after the cleric's corresponding spell does. In the shaman's case this
     stops at lvl 29 with greater healing for ~300 hits. It's the tradeoff
     shamans must accept for their great versatility in all other areas...<br>
     <br>
     Shamans also get a short line of odd utility spells that are pretty
     helpful. Most significant of them is the Spirit of the Wolf spell. It very
     simply adds about 30-40% to your running speed. That may sound simple, but
     once you are travelling around in 30% less time than before it's great.
     Even better is the simple fact that now you can outrun most NPCs, and
     suddenly life outdoors is practically safe again. Spirit of the Wolf is a
     perpetual case for class jealousy amongst non-shamans or druids. Shamans
     get it 5 levels earlier than druids do as well. Other utility spells are:<br>
     <em>Levitate</em>- great for running over lava and water (lavastorm, Lake
     Rathe, Ocean of Tears)<br>
     <em>Enduring</em> <em>Breath</em> - Lets you breath underwater for
     25minutes or so. Necessary in Kedge Keep.<br>
     <em>Regeneration</em> - Significantly decreases downtimes, especially when
     used in conjunction with...<br>
     <em>Cannibalize</em> - Trades Hp's for mana at a rate of around 60/20.<br>
     <em>Ultravision</em> - Lets you see like a dark elf.<br>
     <em>Invisibility</em> - Obvious.<br>
     <em>Summon</em> <em>Food/Water</em> - Summons one food or water item for a
     minimal amount of water.<br>
     <em>Spirit Pouch</em> - Summons a bag that decreases the weight of all
     items in in. WARNING: When you log off, the pouch and all items in it will
     disappear!<br>
     <em>Befriend Animal</em> - Charms an animal for an amount of time
     determined by your charisma and level.<br>
     <em>Shrink</em> - Shrinks you to a managable size. Only usable in dungeons.<br>
     <em>Pets</em> - YES! At level 34, you will begin summoning your very own
     Fido (wolf pet). This is an invaluable asset to shaman at higher levels.
     While not as effective as a necro or Magician pet, they are capable of
     taking a bit of a beating from higher level mobs, letting you med, cast, or
     even run.<br>

     As a solo shaman, you must be smart and use a combination of your most
     useful spells. The root line, malise line, drowsy line, blinding line, DD,
     and DoT's used together make a shaman very powerful. Add to this the
     shamans buffing and debuffing spells, and you are nearly invincible. While
     Kiting (the use of SoW with DoT's) is used to be one of the most popular
     ways for a shaman to gain experience, changes made to DoTs have rendered
     this tactic fairly useless. Following is a table of some of the solo
     tactice a shaman can use:</font></p>

     </strong>In a group, the shaman can fill many rolls.<br>
     Buffer/Debuffer - You buff your party members (mostly the tanks) with dex,
     agi, str, quickness, etc... Debuff mobs with either malies, the disempower
     line, or drowsy line.<br>
     Primary/Secondary Healer - While not as affective as a cleric, you can save
     many party members lives' by healing at the right time..<br>
     Secondary Tank/Nuker - You can step in and take a few hits when needed, and
     casting a few straight DD's or heals is the best taunt in the game.<br>
     All-in-One-Superman - You buff, you debuff, you burn when necessary, you
     may root, and you may melee... Wow, you can do alot!<br>
     <br>
     <u>The shaman as a herbalist</u><br>
     <br>
     Shamans have the unique ability to create potions. There is absolutely
     nothing to get excited about here, as this skill is currently being
     re-worked. Someday Verant will get around to fixing this skill and I will
     re-submit more information about it. Right now it's just a way to waste
     money on weak potions that do things your spells can do better. Sorry, but
     that's the truth.<br>
     <br>
     <u>Developing your shaman</u><br>
     <br>
     When you start as a young shaman whelp you are best advised to purchase all
     your available buffs first. Don't even worry about DD until you have all
     your healing and buffing spells. You can melee like a champ for a long time
     as long as you keep up your strength and dexterity spells. Add in the
     occasional DD when you pick up Burst of Flame and you can level quickly.<br>
     <br>
     I advise that you pick up as much armor as possible as soon as you can.
     Armor is far more important than weaponry is in all cases and will continue
     to be so throughout the game. Always strive to maintain the best AC you
     can. Your club is a good weapon for quite a while, although you should
     strive to pick up a rusty morningstar and worn great staff from decaying
     skeletons as soon as possible. Once you aquire a 2H blunt weapon be sure to
     use it every level and keep BOTH 1H blunt and 2H blunt equal at all times.
     You get exactly 4 skill points times your level, plus 4 more points, and
     you should strive to keep your combat maxed at all times. It is very easy
     to keep both skills up if you do it from the start and alternate within
     every level. It can be very frustrating to learn one all the way from 0 if
     you make it to the teens and you never bothered to practice.<br>
     <br>
     You should start to learn how to best use your slam ability at this point.
     Remember that slam only does one point of damage. You want to use it
     constantly ONLY on non-spellcasting NPC. If you are fighting someone that
     can cast spells you must save your slam until you see him begin to cast.
     Once he pauses hit him with the slam. You will be surprised how much more
     effective you are this way, and you will survive many more battles.<br>
     <br>
     Also learn to time your offensive spells in with your enemy's attacks. As
     soon as you see him strike you want to immediately hit the cast button.
     Your DD and DoT spells mostly have a casting time equal to the delay time
     that an NPC has. So if you start to cast when he has just started to
     recover, you will often get your spell off without interruption.<br>
     <br>
     The first few levels are very easy to advance through. Save all your money
     and buy all your spells. Remember that sitting down doubles your mana and
     hit point recovery. Try to keep aware of where you are, because you will
     die from time to time and you need to find your corpse. By typing /loc you
     get a +/- divination of your location on the zone that will dramatically
     help you find your corpse. Hotkey /loc in your combat keys so you can hit
     it whever you get in trouble. Even if you are running away it will still
     give you some clue as to where to go. If you die somewhere hard to reach
     there is a /corpse command that will summon your body to you. This can help
     when monsters are hanging around your corpse or it is under water.<br>
     <br>
     Once you get to lvl 4 make sure to train yourself in channeling, as it
     allows you to cast spells faster and occasionally allows you to recover
     from being hit and still cast successfully. You can easily kill white
     creatures at this point and probably have no problem with a single yellow
     creature when you are fully buffed and full with mana. Up until lvl 4 you
     will get a full refresh of water and food when you get killed. I suggest
     that at the end of lvl 3 you die once near home and get some free food for
     the last time in your career. After that you need to buy it for a while
     until you get summon water at lvl 5 and summon food at lvl 9.<br>
     <br>
     At lvl 5 be sure to get as many spells as you can afford. You want your
     ability buffs, scaleskin, and spirit pouch, as well as drowsy and sicken.
     Then get frost strike when you can. Scaleskin is a much-maligned spell that
     is very, very useful. Kill some snakes for an hour and store up 20-40
     components. Just don't store them in your spirit pouch. Using sicken and
     drowsy with all your buffs you will notice a major difference in your
     melee. By now you should have learned that you always want to fight near a
     zone entrance or close enough to the guards that you can make it to them
     when you are under 2 bubbles of health. You are still able to take on
     yellow creatures for a while, but watch out since you start losing
     experience when you die at lvl 5.<br>
     <br>
     At lvl 8 you get meditate. This dramatically reduces your downtime and
     makes you feel less like a melee character. Now you can finally think about
     blasting away with your DD spells. From here on out you will be casting
     significantly and your melee will begin to fall behind the warrior classes
     more and more. By now you should think about grouping up when you can, or
     you need to be soloing blue monsters. Whites and yellows can be a real risk
     at this point.<br>
     <br>
     At lvl 9 you finally get SoW. Be happy with yourself, you are now a shaman.
     You can start making good money by hanging out in high level areas and
     /auctioning off SoW to high level characters. I would do it all the time
     when I was broke. Many players will give you a platinum per cast. You also
     get tainted breath, your first really effective DoT spell. Use it whenever
     possible. Also make sure you have summon food and water and light healing.
     All are important. SoW allows you to solo whites again without much risk.
     You can keep this up for a long time to come.<br>
     <br>
     At lvl 14 you want to buy almost every spell. This is going to be
     expensive, so buy Spirit of the Snake or Spirit Strike first and save a few
     gold. Be sure to buy the new AC buff Turtle Skin. Disempower is also a good
     choice for the cost.<br>
     <br>
     You get dodge at lvl 15. This is not much of a big deal since you have a
     fairly low skill cap. Still, it can help you avoid an attack every few
     combats and is worth training a few points in.<br>
     <br>
     At lvl 19 you are pretty advanced. Most likely you know how to run a shaman
     by now. If you made it to this level I am confident you don't need any
     further help from me. Turn around and help out the other shaman whelps in
     your home city become big and powerful like you now are.<br>
     <br>
     There is nothing quite like the feeling that a free SoW and super-ability
     buff can give a newbie. Be sure to help them out when you can. They'll
     usually thank you for it.</font><br>
