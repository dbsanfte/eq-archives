     In-depth Guide to the Estate of Unrest</font></strong></p>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Scribed
     by an old Unrest veteran, Mcanallen Foehammer of Sanctus Covenir, Povar
     Server</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Hello
     fellow Norrathians! It is good to see you reading this invaluable guide to
     one of the best designed and downright spookiest dungeons of Norrath. I am
     an old dog of Unrest, as any paladin should be. I came at level 16, fresh
     from practicing my new Ward Undead spell in Steamfont for countless of
     hours to knock off some skeleton heads and maybe make some cash. I left at
     level 30, sporting a massive collection of knowledge of the zone’s
     bestiary, loot, and layout. This guide will serve as light in a very dark
     tunnel when you are hunting around in the basement hoping a werebat won’t
     be around and see through your Invisible VS Undead. However, if you are
     foolish and unwise in the ways of basic arts such as pulling, ‘/assist’ing,
     and of course, running for your life, then consider yourself dead and out
     of half a bubble of hard earned experience.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     guide is in four parts: part one is a general introduction; part two is a
     guide to the various rooms and common spawn areas; part three is a
     breakdown of the loot of things both mundane and rare; part four is a
     collection of all of Unrest’s monsters, ranging from annoying Death
     Beetles to a cantankerous old dwarven ghost by the name of Garanel Rucksif.</font></p>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#DDDD00">Part
     One: general introduction</font></strong></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     old mansion of Unrest can be accessed via Dagnor’s Cauldron. When zoning
     in from the Butcherblock mountains, simply follow the lake coast to the
     right hand side. Along the way you will pass an NPC camp of assorted races
     and later on, a camp of aqua goblins. Players 15-20 can actually hunt the
     goblins here, as they sometimes drop bronze weapons and a few plat. Right
     past the goblin camp is a big slash in the cliff wall to the right again:
     this is where the fun begins. Try not to step all over the people healing/medding
     after being kicked out by a huge train, and enter if ye dare!</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     first thing you see is a long tunnel. This is where half of the deaths
     occur, since ALL trains will come down here. If you happen to be in the
     tunnel when a train comes, you might consider doing an about-face and
     making a run for the zone. The tunnel gives way to an outdoor area. You
     will first see a pair of stone fountains, and behind it, two hedge mazes.
     Come closer and you will see the mansion itself, ominous flags waving in
     the background. Around the mansion is a large stone wall that marks then
     end of the zone, with about 100 paces of ground in between the wall and the
     house. Dare approach the double doors, brave adventurer?</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     most dangerous aspect of Unrest is by far, the trains. They happen often,
     and they aren’t pretty. At peak hours, the trains stop since near every
     spawn point is being camped or constantly pulled from, therefore
     eliminating the threat. Note that peak occupancy is around 60-70 people. If
     you aren’t in a well entrenched group by then, you aren’t going to have
     a profitable night since EVERYTHING will be camped. Around 40 people is
     about ideal, as most of the rooms are camped, leaving the hallways and
     other places untouched, perfect hunting grounds for a group on the left
     wall. Remember, being caught in a train is no fun. If you are near the
     zone, either run for Dagnor’s, run for the wall, or invis yourself
     somehow.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">At
     odd times you will occasionally see people pulling to the aboved named
     fountains. This at first appears to be a good idea since they are near the
     zone. Wrong my friends. This is death alley since EVERY train will come
     rolling through here with a full head of steam and just drooling to jump on
     anyone who happens to be sitting near by. Save yourself some trouble and
     simply move your group to areas not near the front of the zone. You will
     have a much higher chance of not getting mobbed by an angry train.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Most
     importantly, don’t be inconsiderate and idiotic by making careless pulls.
     If there is one thing people hate more than being trained, its being
     trained by a person who does it time and again without never learning
     anything from his/her mistakes. Careful pulls are made by assessing the
     number of monsters in the room or hall you are about to grab from. If you
     see more than three do not pull. You will create a train because more oft
     than nought, there are quite a few other monsters very near by that are
     behind walls or doors. When you pull the three you see, the other eight you
     didn’t see will follow the others and chop you in two. However, if you
     see three monsters and you know the areas around are camped, then you can
     safely pull without picking up anything else. Pulling in Unrest quickly
     becomes a fine art. You had best learn to be a Michelangelo if you want to
     last long.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">As
     another note, Unrest is an outdoor dungeon. This allows druids, shamans,
     and bards to use spells like Spirit of Wolf and Selo’s Accelerando.
     Druids will also be delighted as they can use their outdoor-only
     lightning-based nuke spells. Unrest tends to be druid-heavy as few other
     dungeons with this level range are outdoor. Remember, there are two types
     of people in Unrest: the quick and the dead.</font></p>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#DDDD00">Part
     Two: the rooms and locations of Unrest</font></strong></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Levels
     12-16</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     place where many lowbie characters get their first taste of Unrest is
     around the mansion itself.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There
     are numerous areas that a group around 13-15 can do well in, or even solo
     for some. Level 12 is a might dangerous, as that is the lowest level of any
     of the beasts here. 16 can be high, since you can be in a group pulling
     from the 1st floor by now easily.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     first place are the two hedge mazes right behind the fountains. They are
     rather small, so don’t worry too much if you get lost: there isn’t much
     to get lost in. In here you will find tormented dead, jack o lanterns, and
     greater skeletons, with the normal death beetles roaming around as usual.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     gazebo: this area can be accessed if you take an immediate right after you
     pass the fountains.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">After
     a quick trip around the hedge maze, you will see a moderately sized ground
     area, upon which many beetles, TD, and skeletons roam. There is a structure
     right on the wall that sports some spawn points, a place commonly referred
     to as the gazebo. It is relatively out of the way of trains, but beware,
     the monsters are close together, so make sure you don’t bite off more
     than you can chew.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     back area: this is at the opposite end of Unrest from where you zone in.
     Here you will find a back entrance to the house that leads into a fairly
     tough room, meant for levels 16-20ish. However, numerous beetles, TD,
     skeletons, and jacks roam around, but in more spread out numbers than the
     gazebo area. Again, same level range as the gazebo, minus the risk of
     having to pull them all at once. However, beware the group that will
     undoubtedly be right next to you that is pulling from the house. Ghouls,
     mummy’s , and the odd dry bone skeletons will be coming out of there, and
     if the other group runs, their train will come back and kill you very
     quickly.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Levels
     17-22</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">By
     now, your group will be perched on what is called ‘the left wall’. To
     reach the wall, simply take a left at the fountains and you will see a long
     wall with a few groups camped out there. It is the main reference point in
     the zone and the main area that groups pull from. You can often find higher
     level groups perched here, as they will have a puller run into the deeper
     areas of the house to search for spawns that groups inside the house might
     have missed. You will likely begin pulling from the 1st floor to the left
     wall in groups at a level range of 16-23. 2nd floor groups range from
     22-28. Groups trying to camp either the tower or basement areas may be
     here, trying to clear out the grouped spawns. These high level groups range
     from 25-35.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     first floor: Inside the first floor you will find ghouls, lurking
     mummy’s, dark boned skeletons, and sometimes dry bone skeletons. The area
     is constantly pulled from by groups on the wall, and this area also gives
     birth to 40% of the trains here because people who are inexperienced at
     pulling can easily create a 10 monster death wagon. The best level range to
     hunt in here is between 16-22. However, most people at level 22 are in 2nd
     floor groups and only receive exp on mummy’s or the odd high level ghoul
     or dark bone. The area is fairly high risk since many of the undead are
     tightly packed, resulting in multi-monster pulls.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     mummy room: this area is found towards the back of the house that is just
     under the tower. The room is circular and has four spawn points within.
     Ghouls, mummy’s, dark bones, and a rare dry bone spawn here, providing
     excellent loot and exp for a group situated there. Groups can also pull
     from other 1st floor areas or even the beginning of the 2nd floor if they
     feel adventurous. Keep in mind that a lot of 2nd floor/tower trains run
     through here, so be prepared to zone or deal with some really mean backwash
     once the train returns. 2nd floor pullers also like to pull through the
     mummy room by taking the undead out the nearby door as opposed to the
     porch.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Levels
     22-28</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     2nd floor: after you get sick rotten of killing ghouls and mummy’s, you
     can now step up to killing undead between levels 21-27. The 2nd floor is a
     devious place indeed, as the undead are packed even tighter in than the 1st
     floor. A single monster sitting in the hallway when you first walk up the
     staircase can bring 10 of its friends with it when you pull it easily. You
     can easily bring the wrath of the hand, magi, tower, and bar rooms down on
     you with a single misstep. That’s a total of over 20 undead, and one dead
     player of course.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     magi room: this room is great camping for low twenties groups. The spawn
     rate seems fairly slow, allowing a weaker group to recover more from a
     fight before the next one commences. While this is simply caused by a small
     number of spawns, it quickly becomes VERY boring sitting around waiting for
     monsters to appear. There are four total spawn points in the room, one of
     which is above on the staircase where the ghoul magi himself spawns. There
     are some problems with the room because a 2nd floor train that bypasses the
     magi room has a decent chance of running right for you once it returns to
     the house, resulting in many of the deaths that occur in this room. Dry
     bones, CG’s, monks, barbed’s, and werebats spawn in the room. The loot
     is also fairly good since you can get dusty bloodstained gloves and sell
     them for a sizeable sum to a rabid INT caster. The ghoul magi spawn is on
     about 20 minutes, and a placeholder appears about 2/3rds of the time. Many
     groups in the magi room will often pull from the surrounding halls since a
     mid twenties group will get very bored after clearing the room out.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Camping
     the magi room can become a very tricky ordeal due to some irregularities
     with pathing. 3 critters spawn in magi room on the floor and the magi on
     balcony. Campers beware that right outside the room is a closet where a
     single monster spawns. The spawn outside in the closet is linked to the
     spawn point closest to the interior wall. This means that if you barge in
     to the magi room, the closet spawn will come too. This closet spawn will
     pull the other 2 fireplace spawns and quite possibly the entire hand room
     (around 10 more playmates for you). If you are extremely unlucky or you
     happen to actually fight on the balcony (this can happen when you battle
     the magi) you can even pull the barkeep room, with the attached tower room,
     down on your head. This room has the smallest number of spawns actually in
     it sans the tower but it is one of the most difficult to hold properly. You
     MUST keep the spawns killed down in order after you've managed to break
     this room.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     hand room: a fantastic room for mid twenties characters. While the loot
     consists only of FS and a fairly unimpressive Ivory Bracelet, the exp is
     not to be believed. Nearly TEN monsters spawn in this room!! The vast
     numbers of constantly spawning monsters makes for fast, furious, and a fun
     time had by all. The hand himself isn’t much of a challenge, but he is a
     wizard and thus can quickly kill off an individual who doesn’t pay
     attention or who has an idiot for a healer. The escape route out of the
     hand room is much more preferable to any other room in the house. There is
     a door that leads to an outside patio. Once outside, simply jump off the
     railing on to the roof and on to the ground for a minimally damaging fall.
     You will land right ahead of the first set of double doors and near the
     hedge mazes. The zone is only a quick scamper away and the monsters tend to
     take the long way out, buying you time to zone. This is a must-camp for
     groups who can survive. Monsters spawning here are the same as the magi
     room, with the reanimated hand spawning in the rug in the corner. A
     placeholder appears about 2/3rds the time.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     locations of the hand room spawns require a campers attention. The room
     consists of three parts: a waiting room, a little library, and a patio
     right outside. Three monsters spawn in the waiting room. Four monsters
     spawn in the library room (the hand included). A single monster will spawn
     right near the patio door. Keep in mind that your group will be sitting in
     the library awaiting the hand. You may not notice spawns appearing in the
     waiting room, as they will not jump on you if you are sitting in the
     library. If a monster appears in the library and your party jumps on it,
     you can quickly have the three spawns you forgot about on your head in an
     instant. It is a common practice to have a single party member stay in the
     waiting room so that the spawns can be staggered more, thus preventing
     further loss of life.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">While
     not related directly to any room in particular, it should be noted that
     there is a good chance that a monster spotted in the hallway of the 2nd
     floor is linked to the hand room or bar room. If these rooms are uncamped
     and you pull from the hall, you will most likely pull out these other rooms
     and anything linked to them unwittingly. Ever seen raw death on a railroad?
     When you spot the whole of the tower, hand, bar, and magi rooms storming at
     you, you had better start praying for a miracle. Remember people, SCOUT
     YOUR PULLS!!! Make sure that the pull you will make will not result in
     hordes of monsters spewing out of the house.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     bar room: another great camp for a mid twenties party. Beware, because it
     is directly linked to the tower above that has MUCH meaner monsters. It is
     usually necessary for both a bar and tower group to be present. While
     higher level tower groups can usually take on both at the same time, a mid
     twenties bar group cannot hold both rooms consistently. Inside the room
     there are around 8 spawn points, each with a dry bone, CG, monk, barbed,
     werebat, unrest noble, or undead barkeep present. This makes for a
     dangerous room. If you must zone, you will likely drag the denizens of the
     magi room out with you if the magi room isn’t camped. Despite this danger
     that the magi room and tower can unexpectedly come after you, it is a great
     place to pick up levels and some decent cash.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     tower: this is a very slow camp that a mid twenties group could possibly do
     if the bar room beneath is camped as well. There are a grand total of THREE
     spawn points here, all on an 18 minute timer. The slow spawn rate can turn
     a lively group into a bored one rapidly. If the tower group is camping the
     bar as well, it isn’t near as boring since there is a fairly constant
     stream of mid twenties undead running up the stairs to hit you. However,
     the monsters in the tower are much tougher (high twenties) than the other
     2nd floor rooms. In here, barbed bones, monks, werebats, festering hags
     (WARNING: very dangerous!) and greater dark bones spawn. The central spawn
     point is where the undead knight of Unrest spawns. He is the reason groups
     camp here. An individual can pick up a tunic worth 400 pp if they are
     having a lucky day.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Levels
     26-35</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     basement found by clicking on a bookcase on the first floor reveals the
     most dangerous and by far most fun part of the dungeon. Here you will never
     see creatures weaker than skeletal monks, giving a high twenties group
     plentiful exp. The first feature of the basement you will notice when you
     click on the bookcase is a short set of stairs that lead down to two
     monsters sitting pretty there. This little corner is camped by groups
     either desperate for exp when the zone is crowded or by groups trying to
     clear out the basement pit to move deeper in.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     pit: welcome to hell. In here, you will see torture devices and spikes
     sporting bloody human heads around. You will also find skeletal monks,
     barbed bones, werebats, hags, and greater dark bones. There are nearly 9
     spawn points here, making for a very hard room to hold on to. If it is
     fully spawned and a group is trying to clear it out, a ranger or druid with
     the harmony spell to pull only a few monsters at a time is essential. Once
     the spawn rate gets spread out, a group can sit here for hours just soaking
     up all the exp. You don’t get trained all that much, as only the blood
     pool and the ghost room (which are usually easy to manage) are past the
     pit. If you are lucky, a lesser blade fiend will spawn which will give your
     finances a respectable kick if you win the random loot. You can also find a
     dusty werebat who carries a quest item for those who need it. As another
     note, there is a hidden wall that the 2nd set of stairs leads up to. You
     can just walk right through it, leading you to the blood pool.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     blood pool: just past the pit is a hallway that gives way to a pit of
     bubbling red goo. It looks harmful, but you can swim in it as you please
     without any harm to yourself. Beware, there are two pits to the left and
     right of the pool that are covered by illusionary floor. You will fall down
     and take minimal falling damage and getting up is as simple as walking up
     the ladder there, so there isn’t a huge concern. However beware the
     single monster that spawns in the bottom of each pit. It tends to be a
     fungi, much to the dislike of the party's tanks. A group can camp here and
     do fairly well. By the pool itself there are two spawn points and there are
     a few others in the hall that leads back to the pit. Beware the mortuary
     fungus that appear, as its spell will slow your attack speed to a crawl.
     Like the pit, skeletal monks, barbed bones, werebats, festering hags, and
     greater dark bones spawn in here. The blood pool is usually camped by a
     group when Unrest gets crowded and both the ghost and pit are camped,
     leaving the blood pool and tower (but people trying to level quickly loathe
     the tower due to the turtle-ish spawn rate)</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     ghost pit: here is where it gets really fun. This pit is beneath the
     slender bridge that connects you to the ghost room. In here you will
     encounter terrors, living hell fiends that look and sound disgusting. A
     high twenties/low-thirties group can stake out here if the ghost above is
     camped. A ghost group will usually let you have the pit as they just want
     the boots and don’t care too much about the exp. Here barbeds, GDB’s,
     hags, mort fungi, and terrors spawn.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
     ghost room: danger, zombies and pale ghosts, oh my! This is the final step
     in the Unrest experience. While there are only three or so spawn points,
     (not including the pit below that a ghost group will almost always be
     pulling from at the same time) the cranky dwarven ghost Garanel Rucksif
     spawns towards the right hand corner of the room. His placeholder is a hag,
     and she can appear five times in a row before Garanel himself shows his
     head. This is where Jagged Bands and Dwarven Work Boots are found,
     incentives which occasionally place high level casters who are broke,
     bored, or both down here to camp/kill steal for the boots. Overall, this is
     the most sought after place for a high twenties/low thirties groups to
     camp. People regularly come down and ask you to put them on a list so they
     can join if someone in the ghost party leaves. As a final note, the ghost
     himself is as tough as a hill giant and therefore hits hard and can take
     quite a beating. Players in their high 20's and below will commonly find
     that he fully resists your spells (I despise the 6 level resist limit. For
     those of you who do not know, it is nearly impossible for you to
     successfully cast offensive spells against creatures 6 levels higher than
     you). It is best to hose him down as fast as you can before the tanks get
     too beat up. Even clerics should invest some mana in chain-casting Dismiss
     Undead.<br>
     Part Three: loot breakdown</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Fine
     steel weapons are found on the following creatures: a dry bone skeleton, a
     carrion ghoul, a barbed bone skeleton, Reclusive Ghoul Magi, a zombie of
     Unrest noble, an undead barkeep, a festering hag, a greater dark bone, an
     undead knight of Unrest, Mortuary Fungus</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Small
     ringmail armor can be found on some of the middle-of-the road creatures
     here. The stuff is fairly worthless as very few people consider buying it,
     as banded chainmail is lighter and has greater AC. Consider it vendor food,
     as it sells for a few pp per piece. It is rarely found on the following
     creatures: a ghoul, a lurking mummy, a carrion ghoul, dark boned skeleton.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Small
     bronze platemail armor can be found here. It is about 20% heavier than
     store bought platemail of the same size and has the exact same AC. The
     other difference is that bronze looks a lot cheaper and tackier than steel
     &lt;grins&gt;. As of now, bronze is as common as rusty weapons and
     therefore sells for very little money. The banded armor economy took a
     severe hit as the price on bronze kept going lower and lower as it’s
     availability increased. It is sometimes found on the following creatures: a
     dry bone skeleton, a barbed bone skeleton, a greater dark bone, an undead
     knight of Unrest.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Savants
     Cap (stats are AC 2, +3 WIS and +3 INT) [ALL/ALL] this low level caster
     item is found on the Reclusive Ghoul Magi and sells for something between
     20-40 pp.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Dusty
     Bloodstained Gloves (stats AC 2, +25 mana) [WIZ, NEC, MAG, ENC] A fair
     caster item that many use until they get Impskin gloves. A friend of mine
     sold a pair for 200pp, while I sold the lone pair I found for 80 pp. This
     item is rarely looted off of the Reclusive Ghoul Magi.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Ivory
     Bracelet (stats +3 AGI, +20 mana) [ALL/ALL] another lower level caster
     item. While I don’t have a set price on the top of my head, I recall
     selling one for 35 pp, but prices may range from as low as 20 pp to as high
     as 80. It is rarely looted off of a reanimated hand.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Gladius
     (stats 1H slashing, 7 damage 29 delay) this is a irregular drop off of the
     lesser blade fiend. I doubt there are many people out there using one, not
     only because of its rarity, but because slightly better items can be found
     at a lesser expense of both time and money (hint: barbed leather whip).
     Many wield it just for bragging rights.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Pugius
     Dagger (stats Piercing, 5 damage, 21 delay) a more common drop off of the
     lesser blade fiend. Like Gladius, it isn’t worth that much effort to go
     camping for since dragoon dirks are highly superior. It is useable by
     casters, but they would prefer a dirk for the + magic resist.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Thick
     Leather Apron (stats 8 ac, weight 1.0) [WAR, PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, DRU, SHM,
     MNK, ROG, BRD] the apron is one of the most preferred waist slot items for
     mid level players. The AC is higher than plate and has a much, much lower
     weight. Any class who can wear leather items, including monks and druids,
     can wear this, making for a near perfect piece of general purpose armor. It
     is found on an undead barkeep regularly. Standard market price is 20-30 pp.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Opaline
     Earring (stats AC 2, +5 CHA, ALL/ALL) an enchanters dream earring. They
     fall all over themselves for that little extra bit of charisma. I carry one
     around with me for making vendor runs, which just adds a copper or two to
     my finances. It is found irregularly off of an undead barkeep.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Bloodstained
     Mantle (stats AC 6, +3 STR, +10 SV MAGIC) [WAR, PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, SHM,
     ROG, BRD] an excellent item for melee classes. The AC is decent and the
     extra MR is fantastic. I had a hard time letting go of mine (I replaced
     them with Adamantine Epolets for the extra AC and wisdom for additional
     chain-healing) I would strongly recommend this item for people in their
     late teens and high twenties until they get something like crested
     spaulders, carnal pauldrons, or the epolets. It is commonly dropped off the
     undead knight of Unrest and sells for 40-50 pp (in the old days they went
     for double that, which my bank account didn’t mind in the least
     &lt;grin&gt;)</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Bloodstained
     Tunic (stats AC 13, +4 AGI, +4 WIS) [WAR, PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, SHM, ROG, BRD]
     this is one of the most sought after items for shamans and clerics. I
     sometimes find paladins and rangers wearing it if they obsess about
     casting. I am a worshiper of AC, so I shunned it for standard bronze plate.
     The only reason a melee class should consider wearing it is if they are
     below the 75 AGI mark (if your AGI is below 75, you take a massive AC hit.
     For me it is in excess of 50 points). There are those out there who wear
     equipment sheerly for looks, and the BS tunic has a distinctive red tint
     that looks pretty cool. It is rarely dropped off the undead knight of
     Unrest and sells in excess of 400 pp.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Jagged
     Band (stats AC 5, +3 STR) [ALL/ALL] this is an extremely sought after melee
     item. Since it is a ring, you can wear two of them and get a fair AC boost
     off of them. The extra STR works great for carrying around more loot (stats
     are meaningless for the most part after Verant tells us that AGI doesn’t
     affect dodge/parry/riposte and that DEX doesn’t affect duel wield or
     double attack). While I will have trouble letting go of my plat fire
     emerald ring (+5 STR, +5 DEX) to repurchase a new set of bands, I am sure
     that it will be justified when monsters suddenly can’t connect a hit on
     me anymore. They are commonly found off of Garanel Rucksif deep in the
     Unrest basement, which usually causes DWB campers to vex in anger and sell
     the band for dirt cheap. Common price is 50 pp.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Dwarven
     Work Boots (stats AC 8, +3 STR, +5 DEX) [WAR, PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, DRU, SHM,
     MNK, ROG, BRD] this is one of the most highly sought after melee items for
     mid to high levels. They carry the most value of any item found in Unrest.
     While the introduction of class specific armor lead many to drop their
     DWB’s, they still are highly sought after and still very expensive or
     trade only. I personally will take the 11 ac on Boots of Ro over the slight
     statistical bonus on the DWB simply because I believe strongly in AC.
     Still, many druids and monks who can’t get anything nearly as high in AC
     or stats for that matter will gladly buy a pair from you. The boots are
     rarely dropped off the dwarven ghost Garanel Rucksif and the price range
     goes from 1500 to 3000 pp, or even trade only!</font></p>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#DDDD00">Part
     Four: the bestiary</font></strong></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Common
     monsters, arranged by level</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     death beetle (12-15): you can hear them coming a mile away: the mindless
     &lt;clack clack clack&gt; quickly becomes an earsore. They are commonly
     hunted by groups levels 12-16, and are most often no more than nuisances to
     wall groups who are pulling much bigger game out now. They will not attack
     you unless you attack any undead. They don’t drop anything (including
     money) other than scarab eggs, cracked giant scarab carapaces, and very
     rarely, pristine scarab carapaces.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">tormented
     dead (13-17): coming in both male and female versions, these creepy zombies
     are often fodder for gazebo or back wall groups. They have a low-middle
     aggro radius and will charge you until you are around level 20. They often
     bear rusty weapons and even shields. They also drop zombie skin, a
     component used in a few quests. Rarer still, they carry bronze weapons that
     are excellent to sell for characters hunting them. Common cash loot ranges
     up to several gold. They are commonly referred to as TD for obvious
     reasons.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     greater skeleton (13-17): the weakest skeletons of Unrest who are usually
     just bony headaches that must be dealt with. They spawn everywhere around
     the house and are hunted by gazebo and wall groups. They have the same loot
     as TD, except they drop bone chips instead of zombie skin for obvious
     reasons.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     jack o lantern (13-17): you will quickly grow to hate these pumpkin-crowned
     hedge-dwellers, not only for their maniacal laugh (much more grating on
     your ears than the skeletons) but a spell they randomly cast in battle
     called ScarecrowFear. It is a stunning spell that lasts around 5 seconds
     that is easily resisted. Beware, you won’t see them cast, as it goes off
     randomly much like weapons with a random process effect. They drop
     plentiful gold and rusty weapons, but are not nearly as common as TD or
     greater skeletons. Commonly referred to as jacks.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     ghoul (15-19): these critters are only found in the mansion. High teens
     groups like to pull them out of the house, as they are the primary first
     floor residents. Excellent exp and loot for their level. Beware, they have
     a VERY nasty effect they use on you, the dreaded GhoulRoot. One moment you
     are fighting a ghoul, when pop, you can’t move. Once you see the message
     ‘Your legs feel weak’ you are now rooted for about 30 seconds unless
     your magic resist prevails and you break it earlier. Very deadly in a train
     situation, as you can’t run while all the undead bash you into the dust.
     In terms of loot they are worth killing, as they sometimes drop rusty
     weapons and even bronze weapons. Rarer yet off them is small ringmail
     armor, armor with the same AC as store bought chainmail, but more weight
     and less AC than player-made banded armor. Though you might get worked up
     at first, it is usually vendor food as no players with banded mail will so
     much as look at your ringmail.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     dark boned skeleton (15-19): For some reason, these dark colored skeletons
     like to attack you regardless of level, or so it seems. They are the same
     level as ghouls and drop highly similar loot. They are less dangerous since
     they do not root you, but I have noticed that they tend to hit a bit
     harder. They are found on the 1st floor of the mansion and are slightly
     more common than mummy’s.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     lurking mummy( 18-21): again, these towering beasts are found in the
     mansion only. They hit hard and they like to disease you. If you get rabies
     off them, it isn’t a huge deal. It will only cut your natural
     regeneration rate in half, but it will last an entire day. Bring a cleric
     or similar priest class to cure you once you have finished fighting a
     mummy. They drop rusty and bronze weapons, small ringmail armor, and
     strange items that sell for a few plat called silver amulets (as far as I
     know they are nothing but vendor food). Great for high teens groups to kill
     en masse, but they are less common than ghouls.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     dry bone skeleton (20-24): welcome to your first 2nd floor monster. Though
     you may RARELY see a level 20 dry bone spawn on the 1st floor, other than
     this they are seen only on the 2nd floor. They are mean skeletons who hit
     hard and pack sweet loot to boot. If you ever see the text, ‘You feel
     your skin smoulder’, that means a dry bone is chasing you. The effect is
     called DryBoneFireBurst and it does around 25 damage more or less depending
     on your fire resist. They cast it every 15 seconds or so and you can see
     them cast, allowing you to get a kick, slam, or bash in before it hits.
     Don’t try casting a stun spell to interrupt them as it only takes them
     half a second or so to get off. Their availability is tied with carrion
     ghouls, but the carrions tend to be more deadly. The loot off of dry bones
     are fine steel weapons (no rusty or bronze at all) and the excellent small
     bronze armor. Expect the loot of these guys to make a large amount of money
     for high teens-low twenties characters.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     carrion ghoul (21-24): enter the big brother of all those little ghouls
     running around. Like their smaller, weaker counterparts, they randomly
     throw GhoulRoot on you which is a primary cause of death for many players.
     When your party is trying to run and you have been rooted, expect to die
     unless you are a paladin and can Lay hands to buy yourself time for the
     root to break ( I have prevented many a death on myself and others when I
     or a party member was rooted). They hit slightly harder than dry bones and
     are a bit tougher as well. Loot consists of fine steel weapons and small
     ringmail. As an important notice to shamans, they randomly drop an item
     called ghoul carrion (no drop), a piece of the totemic armor quests. They
     are commonly called CG’s.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     skeletal monk (23-26): ooh I hate these guys, real real bad. As their name
     suggests they are monks, giving them the ability to block attacks and use a
     special strike move. They are hard to hit and hit like bricks in return.
     Even if you are connecting on them, you notice they have quite a few hit
     points, which makes for a very unpleasant fight. You will hate them even
     more because they NEVER drop any kind of weapon, only a variety of bone
     chips and some coppers. Unlike CG’s or dry bones, they will spawn in any
     2nd floor area, many basement areas, and the tower, making them common
     kills for twenty-somethings. Beware them, they are frequent killers.
     Whether the haste effect that was recently implemented to monks gives these
     guys an extra speed zap, I am not sure of.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     barbed bone skeleton (24-27): you dislike monks? Then get ready to
     absolutely loathe and despise barbed bones. To begin with, they hit like
     Mack trucks on a runaway ramp and have a personal damage shield that can
     become a death certificate for a ranger or rogue duel wielding fast delay
     weapons. Their spawning locale’s are the same as skeletal monks. As for
     loot, they never ever carry money of any sort. They have fine steel weapons
     sometimes and strangely enough, they drop small bronze at a much lower rate
     than dry bones. They rarely drop bone barbs (keep in mind they are no drop)
     for use in a quest that I do not know about.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     werebat (24-28): Oh how I hate these disgusting vermin! They are NOT undead
     unlike 90% of the other residents of the estate, rendering your fancy invis
     to undead useless. A common problem is when a puller invisible to undead
     makes for the 2nd floor and walks in to a room of undead. He decides not to
     pull as the numbers would overwhelm him and decides to check elsewhere.
     However, he didn’t spot the werebat that was in the room who could see
     right through that invis...</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Mcanallen
     shouts &quot;Bar room to zone, run run run this is a big one!&quot;</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Not
     only do werebats see through deceptions against the undead, but they have a
     built in Spirit of Wolf effect that makes fleeing fairly pointless unless
     you happen to have SOW on yourself. They hit hard and fast for their level
     and never drop anything that will make you money. They will sometimes drop
     a werebat wing (note, it is no drop) that may be used for the rubicite
     replacement armor quests.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     zombie of Unrest Noble (22-25): an upgrade to TD. They aren’t especially
     tough nor do they drop anything special. They are only found in the bar
     room with around 8 of their friends hanging around. Their loot is standard
     fine steel and cash, with odd zombie skin dropping.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     greater dark bone (27-29, possibly 30): welcome to true pain. You will now
     experience being smacked across the face for 65 damage for the first time
     on a consistent basis. You will only find them in the basement and tower
     areas, as they feel they are too strong for hanging around the 2nd floor.
     They frequently wield fine steel weapons and they like to hurt you lots
     with them. As a trend I have noticed, they tend to resist my ward undead
     more often than not and also have a huge mess of hit points. Bringing these
     guys down is never pleasant, but fortunately they don’t cast any sort of
     spell or put those accursed damage shields over themselves like barbed
     bones. Other loot besides FS includes an odd piece of bronze, greater dark
     bone skulls (for use in a quest), and a dark bone bracelet (used in bard
     armor quests). Both the skull and bracelet are no drop. Commonly called
     GDB’s</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     festering hag (29-30): Have you ever seen a level 29 wizard get off three
     Inferno Shock spells and watched as a monster was burned to ash in seconds?
     Have you ever had the spell cast three times on you? If you ever fight
     hags, you will. They are wizards and cast a myriad of offensive spells that
     will lay you in your grave for about 40% of your deaths here. They Inferno
     Shock you for 237 damage, Frost Shock you for 160, Force Shock you for 170,
     Lightning Shock you for 80, etc. etc. ad nauseum... In a multiple player
     situation, they use AoE spells, but believe it or not that is a good thing.
     If the hag hits you all for 50-60 damage with an AoE, she just forfeited
     the time and mana to hit a single character for 240 damage. However, their
     casting power is met with a few hindrances. First of all, they have very
     low hit points, allowing a caster to quickly blast them into little zombie
     chunks. They have a lower AC and don’t hit as often as most of the
     skeletal denizens of the Estate, allowing for quicker kills. Don’t think
     that these disadvantages make them easy, they are the most hated and most
     difficult undead to deal with in the zone. You know a hag is around when
     you are fighting a monster and you are hit by a burning damage shield.
     While this is not a concern (the damage shield hits for a pitiful 2 points)
     it means that a hag is in the basement or tower and just caution should be
     exercised for lower level groups if you are pulling near these areas. At
     high twenties and up, they become regular kills and are much less of a pain
     to deal with. Still, it is good to beware them regardless of your level.
     Standard loot is fine steel weapons and even gossamer armor. In addition,
     they drop necromancer only festering cloaks. They also drop globes of mist,
     another quest item. Not surprisingly, the globes are no drop.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Mortuary
     Fungus (29-31): another truly loathed beast. They are living creatures,
     destroying the advantage many have against only the undead. You can find
     these creatures only past the pit in the basement, in rooms like the ghost
     room or the pit below. They make for such a menace because of a spell they
     cast every so often called Mort Drowsy. Ever had shamans cast walking sleep
     or Tagar’s insects on you? This is worse. The spell turns my BIBS from a
     20 damage 47 delay weapon to a 20 damage 70 delay weapon or probably even
     slower. This spell renders tanks utterly useless in a fight. Aside from
     this spell, they don’t have exceptional strength or hit points, so a
     caster can take them down without excessive difficulty. They drop fine
     steel weapons some times, but you won’t know they have it as they never
     wield anything. You only find it on its corpse when you loot. Rarely, they
     drop fungus eyes, no drop quest items.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     tentacle terror (29-31): for those who have hunted in Najena, keep in mind
     these are much different beasts. Of course, they are living creatures,
     making them immune to undead only spells. They cast two spells that are
     usually just mildly annoying. The first one is TerrorLifetap, a lifetap
     that hits you for 20 damage and restores 20 of their hitpoints. Not a huge
     concern to worry about. The second spell is called Throwback, a spell that
     hurls you a good distance unless you strike a wall first. Again, usually
     just a minor nuisance and actually a lifesaver if one is chasing you and
     you are trying to run away. The spell will send you flying away from them,
     which means you don’t have to run as much &lt;grin&gt;. They are fairly
     tough and hit hard in addition to their spells, but in a decent party they
     die very easily. Unlike the Najena terrors, they do not drop terror spines
     or Tentacle whips. Instead, they carry odd gems and even beer sometimes.
     Don’t ask, and I hope Verant doesn’t tell why ; )</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     dark terror (30-33): again, completely dissimilar monsters from the
     Tentacle terrors of Najena. They are the exact same as TT’s here except
     they are slightly higher level. Same loot, same spells, just takes a little
     more effort to take down.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">As
     a side note about terrors and their Knockback spell is that it can be far
     more dangerous than it seems. While in many cases it will send you flying
     all of three inches backwards against a wall, it can also knock you down
     from a place like the ghost room down into the pit below. Now imagine that
     you haven't cleared it out yet and you are trying to get back to the ghost
     room with two hags nuking you, a fungi slowing you, and 2 GDB's beating on
     you. And to think you have to climb a ladder with all that stuff reducing
     you to a pulp.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Uncommon
     or unique monsters, arranged by level:</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     gnomish spelunker (20ish): here is a little gnome that spawns in a tiny
     cavern that is right near the gazebo (notice how gnomes are always in the
     strangest of places...) You must swim to access it, and with the gnome a
     barbed bone, greater dark bone, skeletal monk, werebat, or hag will be
     right next to it. Don’t ask me why they don’t have at each other, but
     they will leave each other alone. The gnome is non-aggro to most people,
     but will come after you if you attack the creature next to it. He carries
     no loot except for rusty or bronze weapons.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Reclusive
     Ghoul Magi (21-22): a mean necromancer ghoul who spawns in the
     appropriately-titled magi room. If he has enough time before being
     attacked, he will summon up a pet or two. He buffs himself with Harmshield
     and Shieldskin, which usually just annoy players rather than really hurt
     them. His spell arsenal is somewhat limited: he casts no lifetaps or poison
     DOT’s. Instead, he casts Heat Blood, Engulfing Darkness (deadly if he
     casts it on you while pulling him to the wall as it slows like snare),
     Infectious Cloud (more of a nuisance than a threat), and a stun spell
     called Fear2. In his room, around four other monsters spawn, usually barbs,
     dry’s, CG’s, monks, and werebats. The magi commonly drops a Savants Cap
     and rarely drops Dusty Bloodstained Gloves.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A
     Reanimated Hand (21-23): this frightful collection of fleshy fingers is
     completely dissimilar from the much tougher version in Lower Guk. However,
     he is a deadly wizard who can get off three force shocks very quickly for
     170 damage each (fortunately you can fully resist the spell half the time).
     He also has plentiful hit points and hits fairly hard and fast as well. He
     spawns in the appropriately titled hand room and is surrounded by nearly 10
     other monsters! His room is hell to clear out and just about as bad to keep
     clean. His loot isn’t much of a hoot either, since he drops a cookbook
     much of the time. He rarely drops an Ivory Bracelet, an item that is fair
     for casters in their 20's. He is usually camped for the awesome exp the
     room offers.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">an
     undead barkeep (mid-twenties): this creature can be found behind the bar in
     the bar room (where else would you find a barkeep?). Unrest Nobles, CG’s,
     dry’s, monks, barbs, and bats are all around him, and on top of this the
     tower just above is linked to the bar. In short, you pull the bar and you
     also pull the tower. The barkeep himself is a rogue and usually has a fine
     steel piercing weapon, allowing him to backstab for nearly 100 damage. He
     commonly drops a Thick Leather Apron and rarely drops an Opaline Earring.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     lesser blade fiend (level unknown, probably mid twenties): this is a VERY
     rare spawn, rarer than the priest of Najena. He spawns in the basement pit
     less than once a week at best. He looks like a swarming mass of shields and
     swords, and every time you hit him he makes a parrying noise. He is easy to
     kill, considering where he spawns, and he drops either a Pugius dagger or a
     Gladius sword.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     dusty werebat (25-27): he commonly spawns in the basement at a specific
     point in the upper mini-floor towards the back. He is just a little tougher
     than a standard werebat who uncommonly drops a pouch of silver dust, a part
     of a quest.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a
     priest of Najena (30): he has one spawn point that can be accessed via the
     2nd floor. He is a very rare cleric ghoul who is linked to the Najena
     faction. He drops a special no-drop key that can be used by casters to
     complete a quest for a Mystic Cloak.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">an
     undead knight of Unrest (30): wisdom casters rejoice, here comes your great
     loot. The knight spawns in the tower in the central spawn point and is
     accompanied by hags, bats, monks, barbs, and GDB’s. Fortunately, only two
     other spawn points are in this room, so you will never have more than 3
     monsters to deal with, not including the bar room. The knight is a
     shadowknight who casts harm touch and lifetap spells. He will sometimes
     summon a pet also. He usually drops a piece of small bronze, a fine steel
     longsword, and a Bloodstained Mantle. If you are lucky, he will drop a
     Bloodstained Tunic for you!</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Garanel
     Rucksif (35): ahh, the grand finale of my bestiary. Old Garanel was
     probably an old time dwarven miner who just had a bad day and was slain
     here years ago, only to be resurrected as a malignant ghost. His room can
     be accessed deep in the basement over the large pit. He is very tough and
     is around as mean as a sand giant. I think he has his own set of polygons
     and sounds, as I have yet to see a creature at all looking or sounding like
     him. Garanel is the toughest creature in Unrest period. He is mean and
     rotten, so don’t think that he won’t butcher you just because you are
     also a dwarf. He hits frequently in the 80's and 90's, allowing him to wade
     through casters like a scythe to corn. A well balanced group 30+ is
     necessary, with a healer being absolutely vital. When you kill him, your
     reward is watching his head disconnect itself from the ethereal body, then
     fall down again after levitating a moment. It is the most hysterical
     animation in EQ that I have seen yet. He always drops a small kite shield
     and a battle axe, the same kinds of things purchased at vendors. Other
     common loot is a Sphere of Unrest (I have no idea what it is used for) and
     a Jagged Band. Rarely he may reward you with a pair of Dwarven Work Boots,
     the most valuable item found in Unrest.</font></p>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#DDDD00">Conclusion</font></strong></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">What
     can I say? Unrest makes for one fun night after the next. I have met the
     fewest percentage of jerky and ignorant people here and the greatest
     percentage of knowledgeable and friendly folks here to boot (I could
     mention a few names of some truly evil people I have encountered here, but
     I figure why further ruin their already shoddy reputation). Now I remind
     myself to get out of Cazic Thule and head elsewhere, as Cazic has more
     filthy, obnoxious vermin for players in it than a cheap apartment in NYC.
     Not to mention a paladin’s special abilities versus the undead are
     absolutely useless here (I just got my Ghoulbane and seeing the message
     &quot;This spell only works on the undead.&quot;time after time is just
     downright depressing).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">If
     you are between levels 13 and 34 than this is an ideal place to come. You
     simply cannot equal the amount of loot and exp to be found here if you are
     in a well entrenched group. Keep in mind that 80+ other people might have
     the same idea in mind and come down to Unrest, creating a massive
     bottleneck of players pulling in the house and camping inside down to the
     last spawn point. If you are level 25+ and Unrest is packed full, you might
     be able to take your party down to Mistmoore (or trainmoore as some call
     it. Gah I loathe that zone) For players 18-22 ish, you can take your group
     right outside the Unrest zone and camp an aqua goblin camp there. The
     goblins provide excellent exp and loot. Just watch out for the shaman's
     there who like to SOW the camp members, making a root/snare spell essential
     unless you want your kill to swim off in the lake and be near impossible to
     catch.</font></p>
