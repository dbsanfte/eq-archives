            <strong>Level by level tactics</strong><br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 1-5</strong><br>
            <br>
            The early levels can sometimes be frustrating for a first time
            shadowknight. This is especially true for smaller race shadowknights
            because they do not have the benefit of slam and can not cast any
            spells to make up for their melee deficeincies. Luckily the first
            five levels go by rather quickly.<br>
            <br>
            Here are a few bits of general advice during these levels.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            First and foremost stay near your home town. Nothing slows your
            advancement down more than a long run for corpse recovery. In
            general I wouldn't recommend travelling more than 2 zones from your
            home city.<br>
            <br>
            Be sure to save your harm touch for emergency situations. I would
            only use it if I were under one bar of health as a last resort. It
            is very effective at these levels. Having harm touch in your back
            pocket allows you to take some risks knowing that you can use it to
            bail you out if things go sour. Once it is gone you will have to be
            more conservative so hold on to it as long as you can.<br>
            <br>
            Unless you are a twinked character or are being given bandages from
            others I would not recommend using the bind wound skill at this
            point. That money could better be spent buying weapons or armor.<br>
            <br>
            Another common mistake by young shadowknights is using big and bulky
            weapons. Until level 10 the maximum damage that any player can do is
            21. This means that any weapon with a damage factor or more than 10
            is not being used to it's full potential.&nbsp; Bear this in mind
            when calculating weapon efficiency.<br>
            <br>
            Be sure to train one point into taunt when you first visit your
            trainer. The skill will not go up until you do. During combat
            constantly hit the taunt button after it refreshes even when not in
            a group to keep it maxed out. I would also recommend doing the same
            for sense heading until you get it up to a reasonable level.<br>
            <br>
            Large race shadowknights may have a problem increasing their defense
            at early levels. This happens as a result of their high strength
            allowing them to tear through their opponents. As a result they get
            hit less. The best way to increase this is to pick a fight with two
            or three low blue mobs and allow them to hit on you for a while.
            Defense will increase much faster this way but be careful not to let
            them do too much damage. =)<br>
            <br>
            Another important thing to note at early levels is that it is faster
            to advance via quest than via hack and slash. Concentrate on killing
            monsters that carry quest items if you can. This way you gain
            experience and have the potential of getting a piece of a quest
            which will not only reward you with an item or cash but also with a
            decent chunk of experience. Some quests which are good for this
            level range include:<br>
            <br>

            Armor</a>(Cabilis)<br>

            Slashed Belts</a>(Freeport)<br>

            Beetle Eyes</a>(Neriak)<br>
            <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/lizmeat.html">Lizard Meat</a>(Oggok)<br>
            <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/pskletterdelivery.html">SK
            Letter Delivery</a>(Paineel)<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 6<br>
            <br>
            Bash</strong><br>
            <br>
            The addition of the bash skill into a shadowknight's arsenal is a
            very important step. Not only does this skill allow small sk's to
            gain a secondary attack when using a shield but it also allows large
            race sk's to slam(without a shield) for more than one damage.<br>
            <br>
            Bash not only does additional damage via a secondary attack but it
            also has a chance of stunning your opponent. This is very important
            versus spellcasters and also can be used to momentarily stop
            runners.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Tips<br>
            </strong><br>
            Level 6-8 allow you a bit more freedom than the previous five. At
            these levels you can begin to explore some of the lower level
            dungeons such as <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/zone/crushbone.html">Crushbone</a>,
            <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/zone/befallen.html">Befallen</a>,
            <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/blackburrow.html">Black Burrow</a>,
            <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/zone/kurnstower.html">Kurn's
            Tower</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/upperguk.html">Upper
            Guk</a> or <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/kerraisle.html">Kerra
            Ridge</a>.<br>
            <br>
            There are also a couple of quests that you will probably want to
            complete including...<br>
            <br>
            <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/liztail.html">Lizard Tails</a>(Oggok)<br>
            <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/quest/ogreshadowtunic.html">Black
            Shadow Tunic</a>(Oggok)<br>
            <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/quest/drosco.html">Drosco</a>(Qeynos)<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 9</strong><br>
            <br>
            Level 9 is a huge step in a young shadowknight's life as it grants
            thiem the ability to cast spells. I will attempt to explain each
            spell in detail below but before I do so I want to give a brief bit
            of advice.<br>
            <br>
            When you go to train your spell skills train one point into each
            school of casting with the exception of evocation. You do not
            receive an evocation spell until level 22 and you should wait to
            train until then. This way your evocation will start at 22 rather
            than 9.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Spells<br>
            </strong><br>
            Disease Cloud<br>
            <br>
            This spell will most likely be used as a fetch spell. Use this spell
            to attack monsters from distance rather than running up on them and
            taking damage puling them to a safe location. It does up to 5 points
            of direct damage(DD) followed by a long lasting damage over time(DOT)
            effect which does one point of damage per tick(six seconds) and is
            disease based.<br>
            <br>
            Disease cloud is useful at early levels because it khurts a monsters
            regeneration(due to the DOT). This helps with runners because if you
            miss they will not be healing(which could cause them to move
            faster).<br>
            <br>
            It has also come to my attention(thanks to Leafweir) that this spell
            has an additional use at higher levels. When disease cloud is on a
            mob they will stay aggroed on the user even after they reset back to
            their home location. This is useful for feign death pulls. You can
            let all mobs reset then run a ways back and feign again(just to be
            sure). Hopefully this will allow you to pull singles a bit easier.<br>
            <br>
            It is also useful for raising conjuration. It's easier to raise it
            this way than by summoning pets which use much more mana.<br>
            <br>
            Invisibility vs. Undead<br>
            <br>
            This spell allows you to render your target(group or self only)
            invisible to undead beings. This is a useful spell in dungeons such
            as Befallen which are primarily undead.<br>
            <br>
            Leering Corpse<br>
            <br>
            This spell summons a skeletal pet. It is the first in your line of
            pet summoning spells. This pet will be from level 3-5. It requires
            bone chips.<br>
            <br>
            Some players will tell you that a shadowknight pet is useless.
            Ignore those people. A shadowknights pet may be low level in
            comparison to that shadowknight . This is true. A pet does damage
            though. It may not be a lot of damage but it is extra damage during
            the course of a battle. When you take into consideration the amount
            of damage that your pet does compared to the amount of mana it took
            to summon him then you will find it to be very efficient when
            compared to other spells.,<br>
            <br>
            A pet can also be used to save you a few seconds when fleeing the
            battle scene. Those couple of seconds could save your life.<br>
            <br>
            One thing that should be noted is that your pet will not make a very
            good tank. You should not allow him to absorb very much damge or he
            will die. One thing you should always do when summoning a pet is use
            the /pet notaunt command. This will prevent him from taunting and
            being killed.<br>
            <br>
            Other useful pet commands include:<br>
            <br>
            /pet follow me - This will inform your pet to follow you
            around(default)<br>
            /pet guard here - This is a very useful command when fetching or
            when pulling to a particular location. Your pet will assist you in
            any battles which take place near him. After the battle is over he
            will return to the spot that you told him to guard.<br>
            /pet attack - This command will order your pet to attack whoever or
            whatever you have targetted.<br>
            /pet report health - This command will cause your pet to tell you
            what percentage of his total hit points he currently has.<br>
            /pet sit down - This command will tell your pet to sit where he is
            currently located. Ihave not found this to increase healing time in
            any way so I would recommend using /pet guard here instead or else
            you will have to issue this command afer every battle.<br>
            <br>
            Lifetap<br>
            <br>
            This is the first in the line of lifetap spells. This spell will
            drain up to five hit points from your target and transfer them to
            you. This spell is useful to reduce downtime if you are injured but
            is not very useful in combat at this point because of the
            shadowkinight lifetap mana penalty. Until level 50(and life leech)
            all shadowknight lifetaps pay a mana penalty in comparison to their
            necromancer counterparts.<br>
            <br>
            This spell is still useful for casting on a mob that someone else is
            fighting to heal yourself but I would not recommend using it during
            combat unless you are desperate for hit points and in a group. In a
            group you can then back up from the fight and lifetap until you are
            ready to resume the battle.<br>
            <br>
            Locate Corpse<br>
            <br>
            This spell can be used to help find a player's corpse. There are two
            ways to use this spell.<br>
            <br>
            The first way is to deselect your target(hit escape) then blindly
            cast this spell. You will turn to face(and target) the nearest
            corpse.<br>
            <br>
            The second and more common useage is to find a specific players
            corpse. If you target a player you can then cast the spell and it
            will point you to their nearest corpse.<br>
            <br>
            Sense the Dead<br>
            <br>
            This spell will point you to the nearest undead being. This can be
            useful for example in an outdoor zone where you might be seeking
            wandering skeletons(for bone chips).<br>
            <br>
            Siphon Strength<br>
            <br>
            Siphon is a very useful spell at this level. It ranks right up there
            with Leering Corpse as your most effective level 9 spell. This spell
            transfers up to ten points of strength from your target and gives
            them to you. This has the effect of raising your ATK while lowering
            your targets.<br>
            <br>
            This spell is a very effective fetching spell at all levels because
            it only uses 5 mana. This allows you to fetch for longer periods of
            time without stopping to regain mana. Even high level players often
            keep this spell memorized for fetching purposes.<br>
            <br>
            It can also be useful in a duel. Some characters weight allowances
            are not much different from their current weight. This is especially
            common among low-mid level characters who wear bronze armor. This
            spell might push them over the weight limit which will reduce their
            armor class and movement speed.<br>

            <strong>Level 10<br>
            <br>
            Dodge</strong><br>
            <br>
            The dodge skill allows you to avoid damage that you might have
            previously taken. There appears to be a seperate roll that checks
            for dodge aside from the normal armor class check that occurs. Dodge
            is not that effective when first gained but will gain in usefulness
            as it raises in later levels.<br>

            <strong>Tips</strong><br>
            <br>
            Levels 10-25 can be an exciting time in a young shadowknight's life.
            During these levels you will be able to defeat some of the bosses of
            the lower level dungeons and venture into the mid level dungeons
            such as <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/cazicthule.html">Cazic
            Thule</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/najena.html">Najena</a>,
            <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/permafrost.html">Permafrost</a>
            and the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/estateofunrest.html">Estate
            of Unrest</a>.<br>
            <br>
            It shoudl also be noted that at level 10 the damage cap is raised a
            bit. You will now be able to do into the 30s damage wise. This will
            allow you to use weapons with larger damage factors(normally on two
            handed weapons).<br>
            <br>
            It is during these levels that you will likely begin to accrue a
            number of magical items and will be able to complete some
            interesting quests. Below is a list of useful items and quests that
            are obtainable in this level range.<br>

            <strong>Level 12<br>
            <br>
            Meditate</strong><br>
            <br>
            Meditate is as an important skill for shadowknights as it is to all
            spellcasters. This skill allows you to regain mana at a quicker rate
            than when normally sitting.<br>
            <br>
            From level 12-34 you will need to click on the meditate button from
            the spellbook menu to meditate. While meditating at these levels you
            will be unable to see what is going on in the outside world.<br>
            <br>
            At level 35 you gain the ability to meditate while sitting. You can
            then view the action of the outside world. Meditation will
            automatically occur as soon as you sit at these levels.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Level 15<br>
            <br>
            Spells</strong><br>
            <br>
            Bone Walk<br>
            <br>
            This spell is an upgrade to the leering corpse spell. It will summon
            a pet that is approximately level 7-9 to act as your servent. The
            same rules apply as with your earlier pets.<br>
            <br>
            Clinging Darkness<br>
            <br>
            Clinging darkness is the first in your line of darkness spells.
            These spells slow your opponents running speed and also do damage
            over time(DOT). This particular spell does 30 points of damage in
            six ticks(36 seconds).<br>
            <br>
            While this spell does not slow nearly as much as a snare spell it is
            very useful for slowing down runners. When soloing you will find
            this invaluable. It can also be used for fear kiting which will be
            explained below.<br>
            <br>
            Endure Cold<br>
            <br>
            This spell adds 20 points of cold resistance to the targetted
            player. It will prove to be useful when going up against cold based
            attacks later in your lifetime when battling wizards or Lady Vox for
            example. When you first obtain the spell it's primary use however is
            simply to practice your abjuration.<br>
            <br>
            Fear<br>
            <br>
            This spell will cause your target to run in fear if succesfful. It
            is primarily of use in outdoor zones. In a dungeon it will likely do
            nothing more than buy you a few seconds before it causes a train.<br>
            <br>
            Fear has two typical uses.<br>
            <br>
            The first use will be readily available for a level 15 caster. This
            is to buy some time while you are fighting a mob to either run or to
            allow other party members to meditate long enough to get enough mana
            for the heal or the direct damage spell that will finish a mob.<br>
            <br>
            The second useage is for reverse kiting or fear kiting. This tactic
            has become very popular among shadowknights and necromancers. At
            level 15 you do not really have enough mana to be an effective fear
            kiter solo. In a group with a necromancer, druid, or ranger however
            you can still take advantage of this tactic.<br>
            <br>
            Fear kiting involves two steps. The first is a snare style spell.
            Clinging darkness can be used to substitute for this but it does not
            slow your opponent near as much as a true snare spell. Later
            darkness spells such as engulfing and dooming darkness will do the
            trick much better.<br>
            <br>
            The second step is to cast a fear spell. The mob will now be fleeing
            from you but will be slowed because of the snare spell. Melee types
            and pets then follow behind the feared mob and gain free attacks on
            it while it can not fight back.<br>
            <br>
            Fear kiting has become immensely popular because it allows players
            to conquer foes that they would not be able to under normal means.<br>
            <br>
            Lifespike<br>
            <br>
            Lifespike is the upgrade to the lifetap spell. It drains 11 hit
            points from your opponent and grants it to you. This spell is
            effective than teh level 9 variant but is still a drain on mana and
            is primarily useful for reducing downtime.<br>
            <br>
            Numb the Dead<br>
            <br>
            This is the first in your line of undead calm spells. This spell
            lowers an undead beings aggressiveness if it is successful. This can
            be useful for example in Befallen if you see two or three undead
            next to one another. You can use the numb the dead spell on all but
            one mob and then fetch it with a spell. If succesful it can be a
            great way to pull singles.<br>
            <br>
            Shadow Step<br>
            <br>
            Shadow step is a mini random teleport. This spell will teleport you
            a few seconds away in a random directino. This spell is not very
            effective indoors but can be used in outdoor zones to give yourself
            a couple seconds of seperation from a mob. Unforuntately it often is
            disorienting and by the time you gain your bearings the mob has
            reacquired you.<br>
            <br>
            This spell is very effective in duels with other melee classes. This
            can disorient them and give you time to cast your dot's or lifetaps
            on them.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Level 17<br>
            <br>
            Parry</b><br>
            <br>
            Parry is a defensive skill that is similar to dodge. It allows you
            to avoid damage that you would not avoid otherwise.<br>
            <br>
            You may be wondering why you should need parry if you already have
            dodge. The reason is because it gives you a second chance roll to
            avoid damage. The two of them together allow you to avoid more
            damage than either one would alone(because you get a second chance
            if one roll is not succesful).<br>
            <br>
            <b>Level 20<br>
            <br>
            </b>Level 20 is a huge step in a shadowknights life for several
            reasons. The most obvious reason is the double attack skill which
            will be discussed below. However there are a couple of not so
            obvious reasons that we will discuss now.<br>
            <b><br>
            </b>The first is that your regeneration will be increased. From
            level 20-50 you will regain 3 hit points per tick when sitting.
            Trolls and iksars will gain 3 hit points per tick while standing and
            6 hit points per tick while sitting. This will be very beneficial
            for reducing downtime.<br>
            <b><br>
            </b>The second reason is that the damage caps are lifted. At level
            19 a dark reaver(for example) might only do 33 points damage
            maximum. Once you hit level 20 you will be hitting in the 40s or
            higher(depending on your strength) with that same weapon.&nbsp;<b><br>
            <br>
            Double Attack</b><br>
            <br>
            For the last several levels you probably will have noticed your
            melee damage output slipping behind that of a warrior, ranger or
            rogue. This is because they had gained dual wield and double attack
            skills which allowed them to do quite a bit more damage than a
            single attacking shadowknight or paladin.<br>
            <br>
            After gaining the double attack skill much of this will change. In
            this level range dual wield is not effective enough to outdamage a
            two handed weapon in most cases. You will find yourself doing the
            same melee damage output as a warrior of the same level with the
            same quality weapon.<br>
            <br>
            Double attack works by having an addition roll. It is either
            succesful or not succesful. If it is succesful you gain a second
            attack during that melee round. It will dramatically increase your
            damage output.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <b>Level 22<br>
            <br>
            Spells</b><br>
            <br>
            Convoke Shadow<br>
            <br>
            Convoke shadow is the third in your line of pet spells. It summons a
            skeletal pet that is roughly level 9-11. The same rules apply as
            with earlier pets.<br>
            <br>
            Dark Empathy<br>
            <br>
            Dark empathy allows you to transfer a portion of your hit points to
            another player. This spell can be useful for reducing downtime if
            there is no other healer present or if your healer is low on mana.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The major drawback of this spell is a long recast delay. Still, it
            is quite useful when you first obtain it. It is especially useful
            for a troll or an iksar because of their regeneration.<br>
            <br>
            Deadeye<br>
            <br>
            This self only spell grants the caster both infravision(useful for
            humans or erudites) and the ability to see invisible beings.<br>
            <br>
            Engulfing Darkness<br>
            <br>
            Engulfing darkness is an upgrade to the level 15 clinging darkness
            spell. It slows your opponent more than the previous incarnation but
            it is still not as good as a snare spell for slowing down your
            opponent. It does make you more effective as a fear kiter however.<br>
            <br>
            It also does more damage than the original. In this case it does 110
            points of damage in 10 ticks(one minute).&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            One major hindrance is that the snare spell overwrites engulfing
            darkness as do higher level versions of the spell. Thus if you are
            in a group with a ranger, druid or necromancer you may find this
            spell of limited use.<br>
            <br>
            Spook the Dead<br>
            <br>
            This is an undead only fear spell. It is much more mana efficient
            than your level 15 fear spell when fighting undead beings. Using
            spook the dead in conjunction with engulfing darkness you will find
            yourself pretty effective in fear kiting giant skeletons in rathe
            mountains. At later levels you will find it useful for fear kiting
            spectres and other undead beings.<br>
            <br>
            Vampiric Embrace<br>
            <br>
            Vampiric embrace is the most mana efficient lifetap that you will
            ever receive. The problem is that you can not decide when it will
            tap.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The spell works like this. You cast it and for the next few minutes
            your hand will begin to glow(use your imagination here). During that
            duration every time that you swing a weapon you have a chance to
            proc vampiric embrace. The higher your dexterity the greater your
            chance to proc.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            When the proc does go off you will lifetap from your opponent. The
            amount of damage you will tap varies by level. The formula is
            (level/2)+1. Examples:<br>
            <br>
            At level 22 you will proc for 12 points of damage.<br>
            At level 41 you will proc for 21 points of damage.<br>
            At level 50 you will proc for 26 points of damage.<br>
            At level 60 you will proc for 31 points of damage.<br>
            <br>
            One problem with this spell is that even though it is a proc it can
            be interupted. This commonly happens when you are moving during
            combat. So if you use this spell while moving around or while fear
            kiting it may be wise to move in spurts and then set your feet.<br>

            Ward Undead<br>
            <br>
            Ward undead is the first in your line of anti undead spells. It is
            also the first spell that you gain that uses the evocation skill.
            Hopefully you did not train your evocation until level 22 as we
            suggested earlier in this document. If you did then you will have a
            few more points to raise.<br>
            <br>
            This spell will do direct damage(up to 41 points) against undead
            beings. When you first obtain the spell it is semi useful for doing
            direct damage but it is borderline. Later versions of this line of
            spells will be more useful but for a shadowknight level 22 is a bit
            too late.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            There are a few cases when it is of use however. Some prefer to use
            it as a fetch spell. I would rather use engulfing darkness as it is
            more mana efficient. However engulfing darkness can be overwritten
            by snare. So depending on party make up this may not be a bad idea.<br>
            <br>
            Others prefer to use it to finish off runners. This can be useful
            for example if a mob has distance on you and there are other mobs in
            teh way.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The largest problem you will face with this spell is raising your
            evocation. Even if you waited until level 22 to train evocation, you
            will fizzle a lot at first. The best way to raise your evocation is
            to summon a skeletal pet and practice the spell on him. Use all your
            mana. Sit and meditate. Then do it all over again. It works best if
            you can find an enchanter to cast clarity on you or if you have a
            bard play the mana song.<br>
