     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#DDDD00">An

     In-depth Guide to the Estate of Unrest</font></strong></p>

     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Scribed

     by an old Unrest veteran, Mcanallen Foehammer of Sanctus Covenir, Povar

     Server</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Hello

     fellow Norrathians! It is good to see you reading this invaluable guide to

     one of the best designed and downright spookiest dungeons of Norrath. I am

     an old dog of Unrest, as any paladin should be. I came at level 16, fresh

     from practicing my new Ward Undead spell in Steamfont for countless of

     hours to knock off some skeleton heads and maybe make some cash. I left at

     level 30, sporting a massive collection of knowledge of the zone’s

     bestiary, loot, and layout. This guide will serve as light in a very dark

     tunnel when you are hunting around in the basement hoping a werebat won’t

     be around and see through your Invisible VS Undead. However, if you are

     foolish and unwise in the ways of basic arts such as pulling, ‘/assist’ing,

     and of course, running for your life, then consider yourself dead and out

     of half a bubble of hard earned experience.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     guide is in four parts: part one is a general introduction; part two is a

     guide to the various rooms and common spawn areas; part three is a

     breakdown of the loot of things both mundane and rare; part four is a

     collection of all of Unrest’s monsters, ranging from annoying Death

     Beetles to a cantankerous old dwarven ghost by the name of Garanel Rucksif.</font></p>

     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#DDDD00">Part

     One: general introduction</font></strong></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     old mansion of Unrest can be accessed via Dagnor’s Cauldron. When zoning

     in from the Butcherblock mountains, simply follow the lake coast to the

     right hand side. Along the way you will pass an NPC camp of assorted races

     and later on, a camp of aqua goblins. Players 15-20 can actually hunt the

     goblins here, as they sometimes drop bronze weapons and a few plat. Right

     past the goblin camp is a big slash in the cliff wall to the right again:

     this is where the fun begins. Try not to step all over the people healing/medding

     after being kicked out by a huge train, and enter if ye dare!</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     first thing you see is a long tunnel. This is where half of the deaths

     occur, since ALL trains will come down here. If you happen to be in the

     tunnel when a train comes, you might consider doing an about-face and

     making a run for the zone. The tunnel gives way to an outdoor area. You

     will first see a pair of stone fountains, and behind it, two hedge mazes.

     Come closer and you will see the mansion itself, ominous flags waving in

     the background. Around the mansion is a large stone wall that marks then

     end of the zone, with about 100 paces of ground in between the wall and the

     house. Dare approach the double doors, brave adventurer?</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     most dangerous aspect of Unrest is by far, the trains. They happen often,

     and they aren’t pretty. At peak hours, the trains stop since near every

     spawn point is being camped or constantly pulled from, therefore

     eliminating the threat. Note that peak occupancy is around 60-70 people. If

     you aren’t in a well entrenched group by then, you aren’t going to have

     a profitable night since EVERYTHING will be camped. Around 40 people is

     about ideal, as most of the rooms are camped, leaving the hallways and

     other places untouched, perfect hunting grounds for a group on the left

     wall. Remember, being caught in a train is no fun. If you are near the

     zone, either run for Dagnor’s, run for the wall, or invis yourself

     somehow.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">At

     odd times you will occasionally see people pulling to the aboved named

     fountains. This at first appears to be a good idea since they are near the

     zone. Wrong my friends. This is death alley since EVERY train will come

     rolling through here with a full head of steam and just drooling to jump on

     anyone who happens to be sitting near by. Save yourself some trouble and

     simply move your group to areas not near the front of the zone. You will

     have a much higher chance of not getting mobbed by an angry train.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Most

     importantly, don’t be inconsiderate and idiotic by making careless pulls.

     If there is one thing people hate more than being trained, its being

     trained by a person who does it time and again without never learning

     anything from his/her mistakes. Careful pulls are made by assessing the

     number of monsters in the room or hall you are about to grab from. If you

     see more than three do not pull. You will create a train because more oft

     than nought, there are quite a few other monsters very near by that are

     behind walls or doors. When you pull the three you see, the other eight you

     didn’t see will follow the others and chop you in two. However, if you

     see three monsters and you know the areas around are camped, then you can

     safely pull without picking up anything else. Pulling in Unrest quickly

     becomes a fine art. You had best learn to be a Michelangelo if you want to

     last long.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">As

     another note, Unrest is an outdoor dungeon. This allows druids, shamans,

     and bards to use spells like Spirit of Wolf and Selo’s Accelerando.

     Druids will also be delighted as they can use their outdoor-only

     lightning-based nuke spells. Unrest tends to be druid-heavy as few other

     dungeons with this level range are outdoor. Remember, there are two types

     of people in Unrest: the quick and the dead.</font></p>

     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#DDDD00">Part

     Two: the rooms and locations of Unrest</font></strong></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Levels

     12-16</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     place where many lowbie characters get their first taste of Unrest is

     around the mansion itself.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">There

     are numerous areas that a group around 13-15 can do well in, or even solo

     for some. Level 12 is a might dangerous, as that is the lowest level of any

     of the beasts here. 16 can be high, since you can be in a group pulling

     from the 1st floor by now easily.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     first place are the two hedge mazes right behind the fountains. They are

     rather small, so don’t worry too much if you get lost: there isn’t much

     to get lost in. In here you will find tormented dead, jack o lanterns, and

     greater skeletons, with the normal death beetles roaming around as usual.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     gazebo: this area can be accessed if you take an immediate right after you

     pass the fountains.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">After

     a quick trip around the hedge maze, you will see a moderately sized ground

     area, upon which many beetles, TD, and skeletons roam. There is a structure

     right on the wall that sports some spawn points, a place commonly referred

     to as the gazebo. It is relatively out of the way of trains, but beware,

     the monsters are close together, so make sure you don’t bite off more

     than you can chew.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     back area: this is at the opposite end of Unrest from where you zone in.

     Here you will find a back entrance to the house that leads into a fairly

     tough room, meant for levels 16-20ish. However, numerous beetles, TD,

     skeletons, and jacks roam around, but in more spread out numbers than the

     gazebo area. Again, same level range as the gazebo, minus the risk of

     having to pull them all at once. However, beware the group that will

     undoubtedly be right next to you that is pulling from the house. Ghouls,

     mummy’s , and the odd dry bone skeletons will be coming out of there, and

     if the other group runs, their train will come back and kill you very

     quickly.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Levels

     17-22</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">By

     now, your group will be perched on what is called ‘the left wall’. To

     reach the wall, simply take a left at the fountains and you will see a long

     wall with a few groups camped out there. It is the main reference point in

     the zone and the main area that groups pull from. You can often find higher

     level groups perched here, as they will have a puller run into the deeper

     areas of the house to search for spawns that groups inside the house might

     have missed. You will likely begin pulling from the 1st floor to the left

     wall in groups at a level range of 16-23. 2nd floor groups range from

     22-28. Groups trying to camp either the tower or basement areas may be

     here, trying to clear out the grouped spawns. These high level groups range

     from 25-35.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     first floor: Inside the first floor you will find ghouls, lurking

     mummy’s, dark boned skeletons, and sometimes dry bone skeletons. The area

     is constantly pulled from by groups on the wall, and this area also gives

     birth to 40% of the trains here because people who are inexperienced at

     pulling can easily create a 10 monster death wagon. The best level range to

     hunt in here is between 16-22. However, most people at level 22 are in 2nd

     floor groups and only receive exp on mummy’s or the odd high level ghoul

     or dark bone. The area is fairly high risk since many of the undead are

     tightly packed, resulting in multi-monster pulls.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     mummy room: this area is found towards the back of the house that is just

     under the tower. The room is circular and has four spawn points within.

     Ghouls, mummy’s, dark bones, and a rare dry bone spawn here, providing

     excellent loot and exp for a group situated there. Groups can also pull

     from other 1st floor areas or even the beginning of the 2nd floor if they

     feel adventurous. Keep in mind that a lot of 2nd floor/tower trains run

     through here, so be prepared to zone or deal with some really mean backwash

     once the train returns. 2nd floor pullers also like to pull through the

     mummy room by taking the undead out the nearby door as opposed to the

     porch.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Levels

     22-28</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     2nd floor: after you get sick rotten of killing ghouls and mummy’s, you

     can now step up to killing undead between levels 21-27. The 2nd floor is a

     devious place indeed, as the undead are packed even tighter in than the 1st

     floor. A single monster sitting in the hallway when you first walk up the

     staircase can bring 10 of its friends with it when you pull it easily. You

     can easily bring the wrath of the hand, magi, tower, and bar rooms down on

     you with a single misstep. That’s a total of over 20 undead, and one dead

     player of course.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     magi room: this room is great camping for low twenties groups. The spawn

     rate seems fairly slow, allowing a weaker group to recover more from a

     fight before the next one commences. While this is simply caused by a small

     number of spawns, it quickly becomes VERY boring sitting around waiting for

     monsters to appear. There are four total spawn points in the room, one of

     which is above on the staircase where the ghoul magi himself spawns. There

     are some problems with the room because a 2nd floor train that bypasses the

     magi room has a decent chance of running right for you once it returns to

     the house, resulting in many of the deaths that occur in this room. Dry

     bones, CG’s, monks, barbed’s, and werebats spawn in the room. The loot

     is also fairly good since you can get dusty bloodstained gloves and sell

     them for a sizeable sum to a rabid INT caster. The ghoul magi spawn is on

     about 20 minutes, and a placeholder appears about 2/3rds of the time. Many

     groups in the magi room will often pull from the surrounding halls since a

     mid twenties group will get very bored after clearing the room out.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Camping

     the magi room can become a very tricky ordeal due to some irregularities

     with pathing. 3 critters spawn in magi room on the floor and the magi on

     balcony. Campers beware that right outside the room is a closet where a

     single monster spawns. The spawn outside in the closet is linked to the

     spawn point closest to the interior wall. This means that if you barge in

     to the magi room, the closet spawn will come too. This closet spawn will

     pull the other 2 fireplace spawns and quite possibly the entire hand room

     (around 10 more playmates for you). If you are extremely unlucky or you

     happen to actually fight on the balcony (this can happen when you battle

     the magi) you can even pull the barkeep room, with the attached tower room,

     down on your head. This room has the smallest number of spawns actually in

     it sans the tower but it is one of the most difficult to hold properly. You

     MUST keep the spawns killed down in order after you've managed to break

     this room.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     hand room: a fantastic room for mid twenties characters. While the loot

     consists only of FS and a fairly unimpressive Ivory Bracelet, the exp is

     not to be believed. Nearly TEN monsters spawn in this room!! The vast

     numbers of constantly spawning monsters makes for fast, furious, and a fun

     time had by all. The hand himself isn’t much of a challenge, but he is a

     wizard and thus can quickly kill off an individual who doesn’t pay

     attention or who has an idiot for a healer. The escape route out of the

     hand room is much more preferable to any other room in the house. There is

     a door that leads to an outside patio. Once outside, simply jump off the

     railing on to the roof and on to the ground for a minimally damaging fall.

     You will land right ahead of the first set of double doors and near the

     hedge mazes. The zone is only a quick scamper away and the monsters tend to

     take the long way out, buying you time to zone. This is a must-camp for

     groups who can survive. Monsters spawning here are the same as the magi

     room, with the reanimated hand spawning in the rug in the corner. A

     placeholder appears about 2/3rds the time.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     locations of the hand room spawns require a campers attention. The room

     consists of three parts: a waiting room, a little library, and a patio

     right outside. Three monsters spawn in the waiting room. Four monsters

     spawn in the library room (the hand included). A single monster will spawn

     right near the patio door. Keep in mind that your group will be sitting in

     the library awaiting the hand. You may not notice spawns appearing in the

     waiting room, as they will not jump on you if you are sitting in the

     library. If a monster appears in the library and your party jumps on it,

     you can quickly have the three spawns you forgot about on your head in an

     instant. It is a common practice to have a single party member stay in the

     waiting room so that the spawns can be staggered more, thus preventing

     further loss of life.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">While

     not related directly to any room in particular, it should be noted that

     there is a good chance that a monster spotted in the hallway of the 2nd

     floor is linked to the hand room or bar room. If these rooms are uncamped

     and you pull from the hall, you will most likely pull out these other rooms

     and anything linked to them unwittingly. Ever seen raw death on a railroad?

     When you spot the whole of the tower, hand, bar, and magi rooms storming at

     you, you had better start praying for a miracle. Remember people, SCOUT

     YOUR PULLS!!! Make sure that the pull you will make will not result in

     hordes of monsters spewing out of the house.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     bar room: another great camp for a mid twenties party. Beware, because it

     is directly linked to the tower above that has MUCH meaner monsters. It is

     usually necessary for both a bar and tower group to be present. While

     higher level tower groups can usually take on both at the same time, a mid

     twenties bar group cannot hold both rooms consistently. Inside the room

     there are around 8 spawn points, each with a dry bone, CG, monk, barbed,

     werebat, unrest noble, or undead barkeep present. This makes for a

     dangerous room. If you must zone, you will likely drag the denizens of the

     magi room out with you if the magi room isn’t camped. Despite this danger

     that the magi room and tower can unexpectedly come after you, it is a great

     place to pick up levels and some decent cash.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     tower: this is a very slow camp that a mid twenties group could possibly do

     if the bar room beneath is camped as well. There are a grand total of THREE

     spawn points here, all on an 18 minute timer. The slow spawn rate can turn

     a lively group into a bored one rapidly. If the tower group is camping the

     bar as well, it isn’t near as boring since there is a fairly constant

     stream of mid twenties undead running up the stairs to hit you. However,

     the monsters in the tower are much tougher (high twenties) than the other

     2nd floor rooms. In here, barbed bones, monks, werebats, festering hags

     (WARNING: very dangerous!) and greater dark bones spawn. The central spawn

     point is where the undead knight of Unrest spawns. He is the reason groups

     camp here. An individual can pick up a tunic worth 400 pp if they are

     having a lucky day.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Levels

     26-35</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     basement found by clicking on a bookcase on the first floor reveals the

     most dangerous and by far most fun part of the dungeon. Here you will never

     see creatures weaker than skeletal monks, giving a high twenties group

     plentiful exp. The first feature of the basement you will notice when you

     click on the bookcase is a short set of stairs that lead down to two

     monsters sitting pretty there. This little corner is camped by groups

     either desperate for exp when the zone is crowded or by groups trying to

     clear out the basement pit to move deeper in.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     pit: welcome to hell. In here, you will see torture devices and spikes

     sporting bloody human heads around. You will also find skeletal monks,

     barbed bones, werebats, hags, and greater dark bones. There are nearly 9

     spawn points here, making for a very hard room to hold on to. If it is

     fully spawned and a group is trying to clear it out, a ranger or druid with

     the harmony spell to pull only a few monsters at a time is essential. Once

     the spawn rate gets spread out, a group can sit here for hours just soaking

     up all the exp. You don’t get trained all that much, as only the blood

     pool and the ghost room (which are usually easy to manage) are past the

     pit. If you are lucky, a lesser blade fiend will spawn which will give your

     finances a respectable kick if you win the random loot. You can also find a

     dusty werebat who carries a quest item for those who need it. As another

     note, there is a hidden wall that the 2nd set of stairs leads up to. You

     can just walk right through it, leading you to the blood pool.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     blood pool: just past the pit is a hallway that gives way to a pit of

     bubbling red goo. It looks harmful, but you can swim in it as you please

     without any harm to yourself. Beware, there are two pits to the left and

     right of the pool that are covered by illusionary floor. You will fall down

     and take minimal falling damage and getting up is as simple as walking up

     the ladder there, so there isn’t a huge concern. However beware the

     single monster that spawns in the bottom of each pit. It tends to be a

     fungi, much to the dislike of the party's tanks. A group can camp here and

     do fairly well. By the pool itself there are two spawn points and there are

     a few others in the hall that leads back to the pit. Beware the mortuary

     fungus that appear, as its spell will slow your attack speed to a crawl.

     Like the pit, skeletal monks, barbed bones, werebats, festering hags, and

     greater dark bones spawn in here. The blood pool is usually camped by a

     group when Unrest gets crowded and both the ghost and pit are camped,

     leaving the blood pool and tower (but people trying to level quickly loathe

     the tower due to the turtle-ish spawn rate)</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     ghost pit: here is where it gets really fun. This pit is beneath the

     slender bridge that connects you to the ghost room. In here you will

     encounter terrors, living hell fiends that look and sound disgusting. A

     high twenties/low-thirties group can stake out here if the ghost above is

     camped. A ghost group will usually let you have the pit as they just want

     the boots and don’t care too much about the exp. Here barbeds, GDB’s,

     hags, mort fungi, and terrors spawn.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The

     ghost room: danger, zombies and pale ghosts, oh my! This is the final step

     in the Unrest experience. While there are only three or so spawn points,

     (not including the pit below that a ghost group will almost always be

     pulling from at the same time) the cranky dwarven ghost Garanel Rucksif

     spawns towards the right hand corner of the room. His placeholder is a hag,

     and she can appear five times in a row before Garanel himself shows his

     head. This is where Jagged Bands and Dwarven Work Boots are found,

     incentives which occasionally place high level casters who are broke,

     bored, or both down here to camp/kill steal for the boots. Overall, this is

     the most sought after place for a high twenties/low thirties groups to

     camp. People regularly come down and ask you to put them on a list so they

     can join if someone in the ghost party leaves. As a final note, the ghost

     himself is as tough as a hill giant and therefore hits hard and can take

     quite a beating. Players in their high 20's and below will commonly find

     that he fully resists your spells (I despise the 6 level resist limit. For

     those of you who do not know, it is nearly impossible for you to

     successfully cast offensive spells against creatures 6 levels higher than

     you). It is best to hose him down as fast as you can before the tanks get

     too beat up. Even clerics should invest some mana in chain-casting Dismiss

     Undead.<br>

     Part Three: loot breakdown</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Fine

     steel weapons are found on the following creatures: a dry bone skeleton, a

     carrion ghoul, a barbed bone skeleton, Reclusive Ghoul Magi, a zombie of

     Unrest noble, an undead barkeep, a festering hag, a greater dark bone, an

     undead knight of Unrest, Mortuary Fungus</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Small

     ringmail armor can be found on some of the middle-of-the road creatures

     here. The stuff is fairly worthless as very few people consider buying it,

     as banded chainmail is lighter and has greater AC. Consider it vendor food,

     as it sells for a few pp per piece. It is rarely found on the following

     creatures: a ghoul, a lurking mummy, a carrion ghoul, dark boned skeleton.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Small

     bronze platemail armor can be found here. It is about 20% heavier than

     store bought platemail of the same size and has the exact same AC. The

     other difference is that bronze looks a lot cheaper and tackier than steel

     &lt;grins&gt;. As of now, bronze is as common as rusty weapons and

     therefore sells for very little money. The banded armor economy took a

     severe hit as the price on bronze kept going lower and lower as it’s

     availability increased. It is sometimes found on the following creatures: a

     dry bone skeleton, a barbed bone skeleton, a greater dark bone, an undead

     knight of Unrest.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Savants

     Cap (stats are AC 2, +3 WIS and +3 INT) [ALL/ALL] this low level caster

     item is found on the Reclusive Ghoul Magi and sells for something between

     20-40 pp.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Dusty

     Bloodstained Gloves (stats AC 2, +25 mana) [WIZ, NEC, MAG, ENC] A fair

     caster item that many use until they get Impskin gloves. A friend of mine

     sold a pair for 200pp, while I sold the lone pair I found for 80 pp. This

     item is rarely looted off of the Reclusive Ghoul Magi.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Ivory

     Bracelet (stats +3 AGI, +20 mana) [ALL/ALL] another lower level caster

     item. While I don’t have a set price on the top of my head, I recall

     selling one for 35 pp, but prices may range from as low as 20 pp to as high

     as 80. It is rarely looted off of a reanimated hand.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Gladius

     (stats 1H slashing, 7 damage 29 delay) this is a irregular drop off of the

     lesser blade fiend. I doubt there are many people out there using one, not

     only because of its rarity, but because slightly better items can be found

     at a lesser expense of both time and money (hint: barbed leather whip).

     Many wield it just for bragging rights.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Pugius

     Dagger (stats Piercing, 5 damage, 21 delay) a more common drop off of the

     lesser blade fiend. Like Gladius, it isn’t worth that much effort to go

     camping for since dragoon dirks are highly superior. It is useable by

     casters, but they would prefer a dirk for the + magic resist.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Thick

     Leather Apron (stats 8 ac, weight 1.0) [WAR, PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, DRU, SHM,

     MNK, ROG, BRD] the apron is one of the most preferred waist slot items for

     mid level players. The AC is higher than plate and has a much, much lower

     weight. Any class who can wear leather items, including monks and druids,

     can wear this, making for a near perfect piece of general purpose armor. It

     is found on an undead barkeep regularly. Standard market price is 20-30 pp.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Opaline

     Earring (stats AC 2, +5 CHA, ALL/ALL) an enchanters dream earring. They

     fall all over themselves for that little extra bit of charisma. I carry one

     around with me for making vendor runs, which just adds a copper or two to

     my finances. It is found irregularly off of an undead barkeep.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Bloodstained

     Mantle (stats AC 6, +3 STR, +10 SV MAGIC) [WAR, PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, SHM,

     ROG, BRD] an excellent item for melee classes. The AC is decent and the

     extra MR is fantastic. I had a hard time letting go of mine (I replaced

     them with Adamantine Epolets for the extra AC and wisdom for additional

     chain-healing) I would strongly recommend this item for people in their

     late teens and high twenties until they get something like crested

     spaulders, carnal pauldrons, or the epolets. It is commonly dropped off the

     undead knight of Unrest and sells for 40-50 pp (in the old days they went

     for double that, which my bank account didn’t mind in the least

     &lt;grin&gt;)</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Bloodstained

     Tunic (stats AC 13, +4 AGI, +4 WIS) [WAR, PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, SHM, ROG, BRD]

     this is one of the most sought after items for shamans and clerics. I

     sometimes find paladins and rangers wearing it if they obsess about

     casting. I am a worshiper of AC, so I shunned it for standard bronze plate.

     The only reason a melee class should consider wearing it is if they are

     below the 75 AGI mark (if your AGI is below 75, you take a massive AC hit.

     For me it is in excess of 50 points). There are those out there who wear

     equipment sheerly for looks, and the BS tunic has a distinctive red tint

     that looks pretty cool. It is rarely dropped off the undead knight of

     Unrest and sells in excess of 400 pp.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Jagged

     Band (stats AC 5, +3 STR) [ALL/ALL] this is an extremely sought after melee

     item. Since it is a ring, you can wear two of them and get a fair AC boost

     off of them. The extra STR works great for carrying around more loot (stats

     are meaningless for the most part after Verant tells us that AGI doesn’t

     affect dodge/parry/riposte and that DEX doesn’t affect duel wield or

     double attack). While I will have trouble letting go of my plat fire

     emerald ring (+5 STR, +5 DEX) to repurchase a new set of bands, I am sure

     that it will be justified when monsters suddenly can’t connect a hit on

     me anymore. They are commonly found off of Garanel Rucksif deep in the

     Unrest basement, which usually causes DWB campers to vex in anger and sell

     the band for dirt cheap. Common price is 50 pp.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Dwarven

     Work Boots (stats AC 8, +3 STR, +5 DEX) [WAR, PAL, SHD, RNG, CLR, DRU, SHM,

     MNK, ROG, BRD] this is one of the most highly sought after melee items for

     mid to high levels. They carry the most value of any item found in Unrest.

     While the introduction of class specific armor lead many to drop their

     DWB’s, they still are highly sought after and still very expensive or

     trade only. I personally will take the 11 ac on Boots of Ro over the slight

     statistical bonus on the DWB simply because I believe strongly in AC.

     Still, many druids and monks who can’t get anything nearly as high in AC

     or stats for that matter will gladly buy a pair from you. The boots are

     rarely dropped off the dwarven ghost Garanel Rucksif and the price range

     goes from 1500 to 3000 pp, or even trade only!</font></p>

     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#DDDD00">Part

     Four: the bestiary</font></strong></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Common

     monsters, arranged by level</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     death beetle (12-15): you can hear them coming a mile away: the mindless

     &lt;clack clack clack&gt; quickly becomes an earsore. They are commonly

     hunted by groups levels 12-16, and are most often no more than nuisances to

     wall groups who are pulling much bigger game out now. They will not attack

     you unless you attack any undead. They don’t drop anything (including

     money) other than scarab eggs, cracked giant scarab carapaces, and very

     rarely, pristine scarab carapaces.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">tormented

     dead (13-17): coming in both male and female versions, these creepy zombies

     are often fodder for gazebo or back wall groups. They have a low-middle

     aggro radius and will charge you until you are around level 20. They often

     bear rusty weapons and even shields. They also drop zombie skin, a

     component used in a few quests. Rarer still, they carry bronze weapons that

     are excellent to sell for characters hunting them. Common cash loot ranges

     up to several gold. They are commonly referred to as TD for obvious

     reasons.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     greater skeleton (13-17): the weakest skeletons of Unrest who are usually

     just bony headaches that must be dealt with. They spawn everywhere around

     the house and are hunted by gazebo and wall groups. They have the same loot

     as TD, except they drop bone chips instead of zombie skin for obvious

     reasons.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     jack o lantern (13-17): you will quickly grow to hate these pumpkin-crowned

     hedge-dwellers, not only for their maniacal laugh (much more grating on

     your ears than the skeletons) but a spell they randomly cast in battle

     called ScarecrowFear. It is a stunning spell that lasts around 5 seconds

     that is easily resisted. Beware, you won’t see them cast, as it goes off

     randomly much like weapons with a random process effect. They drop

     plentiful gold and rusty weapons, but are not nearly as common as TD or

     greater skeletons. Commonly referred to as jacks.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     ghoul (15-19): these critters are only found in the mansion. High teens

     groups like to pull them out of the house, as they are the primary first

     floor residents. Excellent exp and loot for their level. Beware, they have

     a VERY nasty effect they use on you, the dreaded GhoulRoot. One moment you

     are fighting a ghoul, when pop, you can’t move. Once you see the message

     ‘Your legs feel weak’ you are now rooted for about 30 seconds unless

     your magic resist prevails and you break it earlier. Very deadly in a train

     situation, as you can’t run while all the undead bash you into the dust.

     In terms of loot they are worth killing, as they sometimes drop rusty

     weapons and even bronze weapons. Rarer yet off them is small ringmail

     armor, armor with the same AC as store bought chainmail, but more weight

     and less AC than player-made banded armor. Though you might get worked up

     at first, it is usually vendor food as no players with banded mail will so

     much as look at your ringmail.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     dark boned skeleton (15-19): For some reason, these dark colored skeletons

     like to attack you regardless of level, or so it seems. They are the same

     level as ghouls and drop highly similar loot. They are less dangerous since

     they do not root you, but I have noticed that they tend to hit a bit

     harder. They are found on the 1st floor of the mansion and are slightly

     more common than mummy’s.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     lurking mummy( 18-21): again, these towering beasts are found in the

     mansion only. They hit hard and they like to disease you. If you get rabies

     off them, it isn’t a huge deal. It will only cut your natural

     regeneration rate in half, but it will last an entire day. Bring a cleric

     or similar priest class to cure you once you have finished fighting a

     mummy. They drop rusty and bronze weapons, small ringmail armor, and

     strange items that sell for a few plat called silver amulets (as far as I

     know they are nothing but vendor food). Great for high teens groups to kill

     en masse, but they are less common than ghouls.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     dry bone skeleton (20-24): welcome to your first 2nd floor monster. Though

     you may RARELY see a level 20 dry bone spawn on the 1st floor, other than

     this they are seen only on the 2nd floor. They are mean skeletons who hit

     hard and pack sweet loot to boot. If you ever see the text, ‘You feel

     your skin smoulder’, that means a dry bone is chasing you. The effect is

     called DryBoneFireBurst and it does around 25 damage more or less depending

     on your fire resist. They cast it every 15 seconds or so and you can see

     them cast, allowing you to get a kick, slam, or bash in before it hits.

     Don’t try casting a stun spell to interrupt them as it only takes them

     half a second or so to get off. Their availability is tied with carrion

     ghouls, but the carrions tend to be more deadly. The loot off of dry bones

     are fine steel weapons (no rusty or bronze at all) and the excellent small

     bronze armor. Expect the loot of these guys to make a large amount of money

     for high teens-low twenties characters.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     carrion ghoul (21-24): enter the big brother of all those little ghouls

     running around. Like their smaller, weaker counterparts, they randomly

     throw GhoulRoot on you which is a primary cause of death for many players.

     When your party is trying to run and you have been rooted, expect to die

     unless you are a paladin and can Lay hands to buy yourself time for the

     root to break ( I have prevented many a death on myself and others when I

     or a party member was rooted). They hit slightly harder than dry bones and

     are a bit tougher as well. Loot consists of fine steel weapons and small

     ringmail. As an important notice to shamans, they randomly drop an item

     called ghoul carrion (no drop), a piece of the totemic armor quests. They

     are commonly called CG’s.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     skeletal monk (23-26): ooh I hate these guys, real real bad. As their name

     suggests they are monks, giving them the ability to block attacks and use a

     special strike move. They are hard to hit and hit like bricks in return.

     Even if you are connecting on them, you notice they have quite a few hit

     points, which makes for a very unpleasant fight. You will hate them even

     more because they NEVER drop any kind of weapon, only a variety of bone

     chips and some coppers. Unlike CG’s or dry bones, they will spawn in any

     2nd floor area, many basement areas, and the tower, making them common

     kills for twenty-somethings. Beware them, they are frequent killers.

     Whether the haste effect that was recently implemented to monks gives these

     guys an extra speed zap, I am not sure of.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     barbed bone skeleton (24-27): you dislike monks? Then get ready to

     absolutely loathe and despise barbed bones. To begin with, they hit like

     Mack trucks on a runaway ramp and have a personal damage shield that can

     become a death certificate for a ranger or rogue duel wielding fast delay

     weapons. Their spawning locale’s are the same as skeletal monks. As for

     loot, they never ever carry money of any sort. They have fine steel weapons

     sometimes and strangely enough, they drop small bronze at a much lower rate

     than dry bones. They rarely drop bone barbs (keep in mind they are no drop)

     for use in a quest that I do not know about.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     werebat (24-28): Oh how I hate these disgusting vermin! They are NOT undead

     unlike 90% of the other residents of the estate, rendering your fancy invis

     to undead useless. A common problem is when a puller invisible to undead

     makes for the 2nd floor and walks in to a room of undead. He decides not to

     pull as the numbers would overwhelm him and decides to check elsewhere.

     However, he didn’t spot the werebat that was in the room who could see

     right through that invis...</font></p>

     shouts &quot;Bar room to zone, run run run this is a big one!&quot;</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Not

     only do werebats see through deceptions against the undead, but they have a

     built in Spirit of Wolf effect that makes fleeing fairly pointless unless

     you happen to have SOW on yourself. They hit hard and fast for their level

     and never drop anything that will make you money. They will sometimes drop

     a werebat wing (note, it is no drop) that may be used for the rubicite

     replacement armor quests.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     zombie of Unrest Noble (22-25): an upgrade to TD. They aren’t especially

     tough nor do they drop anything special. They are only found in the bar

     room with around 8 of their friends hanging around. Their loot is standard

     fine steel and cash, with odd zombie skin dropping.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     greater dark bone (27-29, possibly 30): welcome to true pain. You will now

     experience being smacked across the face for 65 damage for the first time

     on a consistent basis. You will only find them in the basement and tower

     areas, as they feel they are too strong for hanging around the 2nd floor.

     They frequently wield fine steel weapons and they like to hurt you lots

     with them. As a trend I have noticed, they tend to resist my ward undead

     more often than not and also have a huge mess of hit points. Bringing these

     guys down is never pleasant, but fortunately they don’t cast any sort of

     spell or put those accursed damage shields over themselves like barbed

     bones. Other loot besides FS includes an odd piece of bronze, greater dark

     bone skulls (for use in a quest), and a dark bone bracelet (used in bard

     armor quests). Both the skull and bracelet are no drop. Commonly called

     GDB’s</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     festering hag (29-30): Have you ever seen a level 29 wizard get off three

     Inferno Shock spells and watched as a monster was burned to ash in seconds?

     Have you ever had the spell cast three times on you? If you ever fight

     hags, you will. They are wizards and cast a myriad of offensive spells that

     will lay you in your grave for about 40% of your deaths here. They Inferno

     Shock you for 237 damage, Frost Shock you for 160, Force Shock you for 170,

     Lightning Shock you for 80, etc. etc. ad nauseum... In a multiple player

     situation, they use AoE spells, but believe it or not that is a good thing.

     If the hag hits you all for 50-60 damage with an AoE, she just forfeited

     the time and mana to hit a single character for 240 damage. However, their

     casting power is met with a few hindrances. First of all, they have very

     low hit points, allowing a caster to quickly blast them into little zombie

     chunks. They have a lower AC and don’t hit as often as most of the

     skeletal denizens of the Estate, allowing for quicker kills. Don’t think

     that these disadvantages make them easy, they are the most hated and most

     difficult undead to deal with in the zone. You know a hag is around when

     you are fighting a monster and you are hit by a burning damage shield.

     While this is not a concern (the damage shield hits for a pitiful 2 points)

     it means that a hag is in the basement or tower and just caution should be

     exercised for lower level groups if you are pulling near these areas. At

     high twenties and up, they become regular kills and are much less of a pain

     to deal with. Still, it is good to beware them regardless of your level.

     Standard loot is fine steel weapons and even gossamer armor. In addition,

     they drop necromancer only festering cloaks. They also drop globes of mist,

     another quest item. Not surprisingly, the globes are no drop.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Mortuary

     Fungus (29-31): another truly loathed beast. They are living creatures,

     destroying the advantage many have against only the undead. You can find

     these creatures only past the pit in the basement, in rooms like the ghost

     room or the pit below. They make for such a menace because of a spell they

     cast every so often called Mort Drowsy. Ever had shamans cast walking sleep

     or Tagar’s insects on you? This is worse. The spell turns my BIBS from a

     20 damage 47 delay weapon to a 20 damage 70 delay weapon or probably even

     slower. This spell renders tanks utterly useless in a fight. Aside from

     this spell, they don’t have exceptional strength or hit points, so a

     caster can take them down without excessive difficulty. They drop fine

     steel weapons some times, but you won’t know they have it as they never

     wield anything. You only find it on its corpse when you loot. Rarely, they

     drop fungus eyes, no drop quest items.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     tentacle terror (29-31): for those who have hunted in Najena, keep in mind

     these are much different beasts. Of course, they are living creatures,

     making them immune to undead only spells. They cast two spells that are

     usually just mildly annoying. The first one is TerrorLifetap, a lifetap

     that hits you for 20 damage and restores 20 of their hitpoints. Not a huge

     concern to worry about. The second spell is called Throwback, a spell that

     hurls you a good distance unless you strike a wall first. Again, usually

     just a minor nuisance and actually a lifesaver if one is chasing you and

     you are trying to run away. The spell will send you flying away from them,

     which means you don’t have to run as much &lt;grin&gt;. They are fairly

     tough and hit hard in addition to their spells, but in a decent party they

     die very easily. Unlike the Najena terrors, they do not drop terror spines

     or Tentacle whips. Instead, they carry odd gems and even beer sometimes.

     Don’t ask, and I hope Verant doesn’t tell why ; )</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     dark terror (30-33): again, completely dissimilar monsters from the

     Tentacle terrors of Najena. They are the exact same as TT’s here except

     they are slightly higher level. Same loot, same spells, just takes a little

     more effort to take down.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">As

     a side note about terrors and their Knockback spell is that it can be far

     more dangerous than it seems. While in many cases it will send you flying

     all of three inches backwards against a wall, it can also knock you down

     from a place like the ghost room down into the pit below. Now imagine that

     you haven't cleared it out yet and you are trying to get back to the ghost

     room with two hags nuking you, a fungi slowing you, and 2 GDB's beating on

     you. And to think you have to climb a ladder with all that stuff reducing

     you to a pulp.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Uncommon

     or unique monsters, arranged by level:</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     gnomish spelunker (20ish): here is a little gnome that spawns in a tiny

     cavern that is right near the gazebo (notice how gnomes are always in the

     strangest of places...) You must swim to access it, and with the gnome a

     barbed bone, greater dark bone, skeletal monk, werebat, or hag will be

     right next to it. Don’t ask me why they don’t have at each other, but

     they will leave each other alone. The gnome is non-aggro to most people,

     but will come after you if you attack the creature next to it. He carries

     no loot except for rusty or bronze weapons.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Reclusive

     Ghoul Magi (21-22): a mean necromancer ghoul who spawns in the

     appropriately-titled magi room. If he has enough time before being

     attacked, he will summon up a pet or two. He buffs himself with Harmshield

     and Shieldskin, which usually just annoy players rather than really hurt

     them. His spell arsenal is somewhat limited: he casts no lifetaps or poison

     DOT’s. Instead, he casts Heat Blood, Engulfing Darkness (deadly if he

     casts it on you while pulling him to the wall as it slows like snare),

     Infectious Cloud (more of a nuisance than a threat), and a stun spell

     called Fear2. In his room, around four other monsters spawn, usually barbs,

     dry’s, CG’s, monks, and werebats. The magi commonly drops a Savants Cap

     and rarely drops Dusty Bloodstained Gloves.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">A

     Reanimated Hand (21-23): this frightful collection of fleshy fingers is

     completely dissimilar from the much tougher version in Lower Guk. However,

     he is a deadly wizard who can get off three force shocks very quickly for

     170 damage each (fortunately you can fully resist the spell half the time).

     He also has plentiful hit points and hits fairly hard and fast as well. He

     spawns in the appropriately titled hand room and is surrounded by nearly 10

     other monsters! His room is hell to clear out and just about as bad to keep

     clean. His loot isn’t much of a hoot either, since he drops a cookbook

     much of the time. He rarely drops an Ivory Bracelet, an item that is fair

     for casters in their 20's. He is usually camped for the awesome exp the

     room offers.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">an

     undead barkeep (mid-twenties): this creature can be found behind the bar in

     the bar room (where else would you find a barkeep?). Unrest Nobles, CG’s,

     dry’s, monks, barbs, and bats are all around him, and on top of this the

     tower just above is linked to the bar. In short, you pull the bar and you

     also pull the tower. The barkeep himself is a rogue and usually has a fine

     steel piercing weapon, allowing him to backstab for nearly 100 damage. He

     commonly drops a Thick Leather Apron and rarely drops an Opaline Earring.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     lesser blade fiend (level unknown, probably mid twenties): this is a VERY

     rare spawn, rarer than the priest of Najena. He spawns in the basement pit

     less than once a week at best. He looks like a swarming mass of shields and

     swords, and every time you hit him he makes a parrying noise. He is easy to

     kill, considering where he spawns, and he drops either a Pugius dagger or a

     Gladius sword.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     dusty werebat (25-27): he commonly spawns in the basement at a specific

     point in the upper mini-floor towards the back. He is just a little tougher

     than a standard werebat who uncommonly drops a pouch of silver dust, a part

     of a quest.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">a

     priest of Najena (30): he has one spawn point that can be accessed via the

     2nd floor. He is a very rare cleric ghoul who is linked to the Najena

     faction. He drops a special no-drop key that can be used by casters to

     complete a quest for a Mystic Cloak.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">an

     undead knight of Unrest (30): wisdom casters rejoice, here comes your great

     loot. The knight spawns in the tower in the central spawn point and is

     accompanied by hags, bats, monks, barbs, and GDB’s. Fortunately, only two

     other spawn points are in this room, so you will never have more than 3

     monsters to deal with, not including the bar room. The knight is a

     shadowknight who casts harm touch and lifetap spells. He will sometimes

     summon a pet also. He usually drops a piece of small bronze, a fine steel

     longsword, and a Bloodstained Mantle. If you are lucky, he will drop a

     Bloodstained Tunic for you!</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Garanel

     Rucksif (35): ahh, the grand finale of my bestiary. Old Garanel was

     probably an old time dwarven miner who just had a bad day and was slain

     here years ago, only to be resurrected as a malignant ghost. His room can

     be accessed deep in the basement over the large pit. He is very tough and

     is around as mean as a sand giant. I think he has his own set of polygons

     and sounds, as I have yet to see a creature at all looking or sounding like

     him. Garanel is the toughest creature in Unrest period. He is mean and

     rotten, so don’t think that he won’t butcher you just because you are

     also a dwarf. He hits frequently in the 80's and 90's, allowing him to wade

     through casters like a scythe to corn. A well balanced group 30+ is

     necessary, with a healer being absolutely vital. When you kill him, your

     reward is watching his head disconnect itself from the ethereal body, then

     fall down again after levitating a moment. It is the most hysterical

     animation in EQ that I have seen yet. He always drops a small kite shield

     and a battle axe, the same kinds of things purchased at vendors. Other

     common loot is a Sphere of Unrest (I have no idea what it is used for) and

     a Jagged Band. Rarely he may reward you with a pair of Dwarven Work Boots,

     the most valuable item found in Unrest.</font></p>

     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#DDDD00">Conclusion</font></strong></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">What

     can I say? Unrest makes for one fun night after the next. I have met the

     fewest percentage of jerky and ignorant people here and the greatest

     percentage of knowledgeable and friendly folks here to boot (I could

     mention a few names of some truly evil people I have encountered here, but

     I figure why further ruin their already shoddy reputation). Now I remind

     myself to get out of Cazic Thule and head elsewhere, as Cazic has more

     filthy, obnoxious vermin for players in it than a cheap apartment in NYC.

     Not to mention a paladin’s special abilities versus the undead are

     absolutely useless here (I just got my Ghoulbane and seeing the message

     &quot;This spell only works on the undead.&quot;time after time is just

     downright depressing).</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">If

     you are between levels 13 and 34 than this is an ideal place to come. You

     simply cannot equal the amount of loot and exp to be found here if you are

     in a well entrenched group. Keep in mind that 80+ other people might have

     the same idea in mind and come down to Unrest, creating a massive

     bottleneck of players pulling in the house and camping inside down to the

     last spawn point. If you are level 25+ and Unrest is packed full, you might

     be able to take your party down to Mistmoore (or trainmoore as some call

     it. Gah I loathe that zone) For players 18-22 ish, you can take your group

     right outside the Unrest zone and camp an aqua goblin camp there. The

     goblins provide excellent exp and loot. Just watch out for the shaman's

     there who like to SOW the camp members, making a root/snare spell essential

     unless you want your kill to swim off in the lake and be near impossible to

     catch.</font></p>
