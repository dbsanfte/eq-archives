Legionnaire Halle can be found laying in the water just barely off the shore to the right of the Katta Castle entrance in Twilight Sea. Her spawn point is near -980,-1800. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Legionnaire Halle' <br />
<br />
Legionnaire Halle coughs a few times and reaches out to you, 'Please help me.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will help' <br />
<br />
Legionnaire Halle reaches out and puts something in your hand, 'Find Magistrate Phenic, he is the only one that I know I can trust.' With a look of someone who has left unfinished business behind her, Halle lets go and dies. <br />
<br />
You recieve a note. <br />
<br />
Phenic Dionicas is in the castle to the left of the Tenebrous Mountains zone. Approximate location is 200,-20, on the second floor. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Phenic Dionicas' <br />
<br />
Phenic Dionicas says 'Greetings adventurer. I am Phenic Dionicas, Magistrate of the Loyalist Combine Empire. I hope the [vampyres] did not cause you troubles on your journey here. <br />
<br />
Hand him the note. <br />
<br />
Phenic Dionicas says 'I was afraid of this. I do not know how much Halle managed to tell you, but we have had our suspicions about one of the Legionnaires ever since she overheard him talking in his sleep. She was <br />
meant to get close to him, I guess she found something out... I should have been more careful! Take this to Governor Markil, it concerns his men and I've no doubt he can handle it. Thank you much for your help. <br />
<br />
You recieve a scroll. <br />
<br />
Markil Jurbac is in the same building, but on the first floor. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Markil Jurbac' <br />
<br />
Markil Jurbac says 'Greetings, Waffuru. I am Governor Markil Jurbac. It is my primary duty to uphold the law in Katta Castellum. How may I be of assistance to you? <br />
<br />
Hand him the scroll. <br />
<br />
Markil Jurbac lowers his head and mourns the loss of Halle. 'Tis the greatest shame of all when good people are lost to the most cowardly of deeds. I will seek Governor Tilbok's council in this matter... I have never been able to wrap my head around this kind of treachery and he may very well have more information. Give this dossier to Tilbok, it has all of the information he will need. <br />
<br />
You recieve a book. <br />
<br />
Tilbok is right across from the smithing shop. Tilbok's location is -143,-1973. He's on the second floor. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Tilbok Furrunner' <br />
<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'Hello there. Pleasure to meet you, I am Governor Tilbok Furrunner. I am tasked with the gathering and security of information for the Concilium Universus, the ruling council of our fine city. <br />
<br />
Hand him the book. <br />
<br />
Tilbok Furrunner reads through the dossier and then looks at you, eyebrow raised curiously, 'look at the mess you have gotten yourself in the middle of,' he says with a chuckle, while beginning to jot a note. 'Here take this and...' he stops midsentence. 'I guess I haven't even given you the chance to say whether or not you want to help. Would you like to see this through to the end?' <br />
<br />
You recieve a scroll. <br />
<br />
<br />
You say, 'I will help' <br />
<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'Excellent. Find Claudius and give that to him- it's gibberish but he and his new friends won't know that now will they? We have been watching someone named Vahn enter the city under the guise of a trader. We know he works for Seru, but we were not sure what he was doing here, so we let him be- trouble was he kept giving us the slip passing through the tunnels. Looks now like we may have found a connection. The plan sounds <br />
complicated and I don't want to confuse you, but if you stick with me it will all go just fine. You with me so far. <br />
<br />
He hands you a gem. <br />
<br />
You say, 'I'm with you' <br />
<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'OK, now you follow Claudius but not so closely that he can see you. Keep this stone on you, it is imbued with the power to record anything spoken within a certain distance and will be a great asset to us when this is all said and done. If Claudius does meet up with Vahn, I <br />
want you to walk right up to him and say, 'traitor to the Validus Custodus' and do it quickly- they won't give you much time. That should rattle him a bit and it will be the signal for my men to come in and take care of them. After the arrest, just give that recording stone to Condor. Best of luck to you. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Where is Claudius?' <br />
<br />
Tilbok Furrunner says 'Claudius is a bit of a lazy sod anyway. If he ain't asleep in a bunk downstairs right now, you can bet your undergarments he will be soon. <br />
<br />
Go downstairs. You can find him asleep on a bed at location 100,-2100 <br />
<br />
Hand him the scroll. The gem will go to Condor at the end of the quest. <br />
<br />
Legionnaire Claudius says 'Huh? What? Oh, umm, let's see here... OK I best get these taken care of right away. Thank you.  <br />
<br />
You will follow Claudius all the way down to where the bank is. He will walk around to the back and Vahn will spawn. Once this occures, walk up and say &quot;traitor to the Validus Custodus&quot; and this will trigger a small skirmish. <br />
<br />
Vahn steps out of the shadows as though appearing out of thin air. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Traitor to the Validus Custodus' <br />
<br />
Condor shouts 'Behind the Nectar of Unity man!! Surround them!! <br />
<br />
Legionnaire says 'For the good of the empire you shall be punished for you crimes! <br />
<br />
Vahn says 'You will not take me alive!!! <br />
<br />
Condor says 'You would be best served to yield, I warn you. <br />
<br />
Legionnaire Claudius says 'I have been discovered! You should have left well enough alone!!! <br />
<br />
Three guards will jump on Vahn, while an Elf by the name of Condor will jump on Claudius. Both of these conned blue to me at 52. All you need to do here is make sure Condor live. If worse comes to worse, training Vahn and Claudius to the guards will get them killed. As long as Condor lives, you can complete the quest. <br />
<br />
After the fight is won, hand the gem you recieved to Condor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Condor says, 'Perfect, this should give us some idea of what they may or may not know,' as he puts the stone in his belt pouch. ' Very well done my friend, have you ever considered a career in espionage? Take this, I have little need for it these days- Tilbok will know how to recharge it,' he says with a wry grin before disappearing back into the shadows. <br />
