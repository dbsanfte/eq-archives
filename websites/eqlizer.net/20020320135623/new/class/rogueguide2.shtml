<P><B><CENTER>Rogues by Arttemis the Rogue, Fennin Ro</CENTER></B>


<P><B>Overview</B>
<P>A silent dagger from the darkness, an unseen hand in your purse, a creaking footstep in your home… this is the Rogue, a class for those who enjoy the subtle art of lawbreaking, and also for those who enjoy living life to it’s fullest (on everyone else’s platinum, of course).

<P>A rogue’s role in a group combat situation is usually fairly simple… get behind the big ugly and backstab it until it’s a bleeding pulpy mass. However, if this is the ONLY thing a rogue does in a group, he’s being rather silly. A rogue makes an excellent scout, as his combined skills of sneak and hide make him invisible to all but the most observant of creatures, and a rogue is never bothered by silly things like locked doors or swinging pendulum traps.

<P>Rogues are NOT tanks in any sense of the word, and have abilities to keep them from being made into a ‘emergency tank’, or that last guy who gets pounded by the train as everyone else bolts for the zone. Rogues can lessen aggro by pressing the ‘hide’ button after they reach skill 50 in hide, also known as ‘evade’. Ducking out of combat like this is a great way to get that mob back where it belongs, beating in the head of the tank. Hey, he wasn’t going to use his brains anyway, right? 

<P>Rogues are mainly a group class, but soloing can be done at great personal risk, in case the rogue in question is feeling suicidal. A barbarian rogue can use his innate Slamming ability to stun, and then run behind the creature for a backstab, or any rogue with a death wish can use Instill Doubt and backstab when (and if) the nasty starts to run away. At low levels, however, rogues can solo fairly well, but once you obtain Backstab at level 10, grouping is the best way to increase that skill.

<P><B>Debunking the rumors<BR>
Rogues steal everything from the baddies we’re killing!</B><BR>
Well, we *can*, if we so chose. It’s always nice to ask your group if you can pickpocket the monsters (and /splitting what you picked afterwards) to get your skill up. If anyone has a problem with it, politely refrain from pickpocketing… don’t forget to ask them where they have their main bank account, though.

<P><B>Rogues die too often in groups!</B><BR>
With proper usage of the evade skill, you can usually avoid dying at ALL. However, if things are looking grim, suggest to the party leader that you move back to someplace a little less ugly, and if he refuses, sit in the corner and hide. At least that way, you won’t be trampled when the train comes through.

<P>Which Rogue is Which?</B><BR>
Rogues can be fairly diversified in stats, from the high agility and dexterity found in the Dark and Wood Elves, to the brute strength and stamina of the Dwarves and Barbarians.

<P><B>Race</B><BR>
Before you look at stat tables, compare damage ratios, calculate the relationship of the number Pi to the speed a halfling levels at, think about what race you really want to play. All the stats in the world don’t matter if you don’t want to be an XXXXX race rogue. Of course, if you really do want to compare stats and races…

<P><B>Half Elf</B><BR>
A good choice over all if you are looking for balanced stats and a small experience penalty. They also have the infravision of the wood elves but do not have the same agility, or the wisdom of high elves. They also have the choice of starting in Qeynos, Freeport, or Kelethin. I highly recommend not starting in Kelethin. It is a good city, but as a medium size it is hard at the early levels to find sufficient armor.

<P><B>Human</B><BR>
I would not recommend a human rogue at all, simply because humans are doomed to be the ‘average’ Joes and Jimmys. Without night vision, or particularly high dexterity or strength, humans will have trouble skulking about in the darkness to ambush that a_orc_pawn_01.

<P><B>Wood Elf</B><BR>
This race has the dexterity and agility to make a good rogue, however their strength is lacking, keeping those obscene amounts of backstab damage just out of reach. Kelethin is a good starting zone, and has other areas nearby that can be branched out into relatively safely.

<P><B>Dwarf</B><BR>
This is a good choice if you are looking for the stats to make an excellent rogue… high Agility, Dexterity, and Strength make a well balanced rogue, and Dwarves have infravision as well, making it easier to find one’s way in the darkness. 

<P><B>Dark Elf</B><BR>
Having about the same stats as a Wood Elf, except for the fact that they have Ultravision. Dark Elves will find it extremely hard to travel in certain areas, but rogues can bypass this because of our wonderful ability to sneak and hide.

<P><B>Barbarian</B><BR>
This race of rogue is all about the backstab damage. With the largest strength of any of the rogues, Barbarians can always drive the dagger that extra inch. Their ability to slam also provides a good way to stun a baddie so you can slip behind and backstab. Their drawback is that they have no night vision.

<P><B>Gnome</B><BR>
Good Dexterity and Agility and Infravision are what the gnomes have going for them. Gnomes are the only race who can Tinker, a trade skill that makes useful (and not so useful) items that can be sold to other players to make a little money (as if a good rogue is ever short on cash). The downfall of the gnome is a lack of strength.

<P><B>Attributes</B><BR>
Where should a rogue concentrate his statistic points? I’ll give a few suggestions here, but remember that these stats are NOT final; one can always find some nice jewelry to give the stats a leg up!

<P><B>Strength</B><BR>
Influences your maximum and average damage output in melee combat--the more strength you have, the more likely you will hit harder. Additional strength will let you learn your offensive skills faster and let you carry more weight. This is what backstab damage is based on, and what I consider to be the primary statistic of a rogue.

<P><B>Stamina</B><BR>
Affects how many total hit points you have and how long you will be able to hold your breath under water. Rogues don’t need excessive stamina, because if you’re being hit on enough to where the extra hit points make a difference, you aren’t doing a very good job at being a rogue. Remember, the Hide skill lessens your agro. 

<P><B>Agility</B><BR>
Affects how often your attacker misses you in melee combat. Agility also determines how much AC you get. Also, affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills. The dodge line of skills (dodge, parry, riposte) rely on this skill, but, as said before, you shouldn’t need to worry about being hit at all. 

<P><B>Dexterity</B><BR>
Affects how often your weapon will proc. It also affects how often your offensive melee skills raise. Arguably helps with picking locks and disarming traps, but some do not subscribe to that theory. In any case, Dexterity usually comes in handy, as this is the stat that the growth rate for Backstab is tied to.

<P><B>Wisdom</B><BR>
This is the source of mana for priest classes like clerics, shamans, druids, paladins, and rangers. It also affects skill growth of some normal skills if higher than your intelligence. This affects success rate with trade skills also. Whether you’re a wise rogue or a foolish rogue makes little difference usually.

<P><B>Intelligence</B><BR>
This is the source of mana for magi classes like necromancers, wizards, magicians, enchanters, and shadowknights. A stupid rogue usually manages to hit something just as well as an educated one. 

<P><B>Charisma</B><BR>
Affects how much NPCs like you. With a higher charisma, you will get better prices from merchants and get higher faction with many races/classes. This really doesn’t matter for a rogue, because you are disliked by most anyway. A substitute for having good Charisma is the sneak skill, which allows you to trade with merchants as if they were indifferent (even if they would normally put your head out on a stick to show the neighbors!)

<P><B>Combat</B><BR>
There are many tactics Rogues can use to fight effectively. I’ll list some of those here.

<P><B>Solo</B><BR>
Rogues can solo, but the cost of doing so is usually not worth the gain. If a rogue can pull it off well, however, soloing can usually be entertaining, and a good source of income.

<P><B>Instill Doubt</B><BR>
When a rogue is about level 28, he gains the ability to instill doubt, causing the target to run away screaming in terror (if it works). What this means for the rogue is a nice slot of time to slip in backstabs. Without heals, though, and lacking the AC to tank effectively, a rogue may find himself in dire straits.

<P><B>Slam</B><BR>
Barbarians are the only ones who can use this tactic, as they are the only rogue with the ability to Slam. The rogue slams their opponent, then runs behind for a backstab. This is EXTREMELY dangerous, as the ugly will be on you at ALL times, and there are no times when you can catch your breath while the creature runs away, as there are with the Instill Doubt methods.

<P><B>In a group?</B><BR>
This is the rogue’s strong field, because there’s someone else to take the heat off of him. A rogue’s job in a group is usually a damage dealer, sitting behind the monster and backstabbing it repetitively, although they are not limited to such. They can make decent pullers, but they are a huge asset as damage dealers.

<P><B>Circle of Death</B><BR>A strange tactic I’ve seen a group of 4 rogues and a cleric performing… One of the rogues pulls back to the party, and the other three rogues form up around the ugly as the points of the compass, with the target in the middle. This way, the creature’s back is always facing someone, leaving him wide open to get a spear jabbed into his hindquarters. The cleric heals as necessary.

<P><B>Conclusion</B><BR>
The Rogue is truly the class for the free at heart, and for those who wish for fun over pure leveling speed and power. Play wisely, and remember, an intelligent rogue always makes off a little bit richer… and a little less dead!
