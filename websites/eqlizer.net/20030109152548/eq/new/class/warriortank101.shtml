     guide was user submitted. It was submitted by Lady Solitica Destiny.</font>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
     ya think ya got what it takes ta be a warrior, huh? Got the guts ta stand
     toe-to-toe with a critter that’ll try ta make ya it’s meal? Think ya
     can stand the long sword fights with bandits? The strenuous activity of
     running around in plate mail? The sweat and grim of a hard earned battle?
     Think ya can stand the fact of being the first ta battle, and the last ta
     run? If ya said no to any of these questions, ya should try another class,
     cuz warriors are the very basis of the terminology &quot;tanks.&quot; If ya
     said yes to all, then you already possess the warrior’s mentality. Let us
     begin with the trainin!</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
     right, lets start at the very beginning. Race? What ta be, hmmm? Well, the
     choices are all up ta you, but donna listen ta anyone saying that a warrior
     *should* be a Ogre, Troll, or a Barbarian. Ya donna have ta be big and
     strong ta be a lethal killing machine. I’m a wood elf, and any other
     guide ‘ell tell ya they are the worst warriors. Bah, they just are power
     hungry. They donna see the beauty of a wood elf, not ta mention all our
     racial benefits. But, once more, you be who and what ya wanna be. I’ll
     just be here ta train ya. Not reprimand ya.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By
     the way, High Elves and Edruties donna believe in the warrior ways. They
     cannot, and will not, choose the mind set of a true warrior, therefore they
     cannot be warriors.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Barbarian</b>
     - Strong, big, yet a lil on the dumb side. Their charisma doesn’t do
     ‘em much good either, but they are a strong race, if ya can deal without
     infravision. There are a few weapons that require you to be a strong or big
     race, and barbarians are definitely big and strong. These guys have a bonus
     for combat, they can Slam. This donna do much damage, and most likely will
     be replaced with Shield Bash, but they got it so use it while ya young.
     Barbarians also have a blessin on their resistance towards cold.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Human</b>
     - Average in stats, which is a blessin and a curse. They accelerate at one
     thing though: experience. All the races suffer a experience point penalty
     save for humans. They learn quicker. They also have the least bit of racial
     tension from other races. Like barbarians, humans donna have infravision.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Dwarf</b>
     - Strong, enduring, and small. Dwarves are a sturdy race that donna seem to
     think working hard and overtime is a bad thing. The heavier, louder, and
     stronger a piece of armor is, they love it more. Ya donna have ta tell me
     twice that dwarves are great warriors, although I’ll tell ya something or
     two about BO with these guys. &lt;phew!&gt; Nonetheless, dwarves possess
     the nerves and mentality to be a true warrior. They possess infravison, a
     nifty bonus, high stamina, and high strength, although they lack in
     dexterity and agility. They might be able ta dish it out and take a few
     more impacts than I, but I prefer ta not be hit than ta be able ta
     withstand a few more hits. Just my view on life.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Halflings</b>
     - Their not as strong as the other races, but they are mighty agile and
     dexterous. They might not hit hard, but they can hit more often and they
     can evade hits better than any I know. They have infravision, which is a
     great thing. Their only flaw is their strength. Without any magical
     assistance, I donna know how a halfling will ever get around to wearing
     plate mail…</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Gnomes</b>
     - Uh oh! Someone said a four letter word! (I can count, gnomes is a six
     letter word. =P ) Gnomes (oops!) are a sturdy race like dwarves, yet they
     are far more intelligent, well they presume to be. They aren’t as strong
     as dwarves nor as wise, but their intelligence definitely shows. They can
     learn quicker than any other warrior; skill wise that is, not experience
     points wise. They have infravision and they have a unique racial ability,
     tinkering. I donna know if that’s a good thing. Gnomes usually come up
     with weird stuff, but half the time it’s actually useful. Note that: <b>half</b>
     the time. =)</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Dark
     Elves</b> - The dark children of Norrath, but donna thing just cuz their
     shun from the world they canna be warriors. They are far more vicious than
     others would presume. Their not strong, but strong enough to get by. Their
     strength lies in their dexterity, agility and intelligence. They possess
     some truly remarkable racial abilities: Ultravision, the ability to see
     perfectly at night; and the hiding skill. They can vanish into thin air,
     sorta like invisibility, but at will. It only works 50% of the time, but
     it’s better than nothing in my opinion. They just suffer a big racial
     tension around the world, although their tension isn’t as bad as with
     ogres and trolls.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Trolls</b>
     - Bigger than barbarians, but smaller than ogres. These guys are stronger,
     and more sturdier than dwarves, although their lights aren’t always on
     upstairs. Um, they lack intelligence and wisdom that is. True, a warrior
     donna have to be smart in order ta swing a sword or kick a critter where it
     counts. Trolls have infravision like and they have an admirable trait,
     which causes jealousy ta other warriors. Troll warriors possess
     regeneration, therefore they have a much shorter down time than anyone
     else. Their weakness is they have low tolerance to fire and their racial
     tension with the world is something to consider. Cuz they ain’t welcomed
     at my home town. Like Barbarians, they can Slam.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Ogres</b>
     - Biggest of all, strongest of all, UGLIEST of all! BO, Brushin their
     teeth, BATHING all come ta mind when I see, no *think* of these guys. But,
     if ya can stand that, let me tell ya, a swing from an ogre might not hit
     often at first when their young, but when their older, a hit might be the
     difference between ya life and death. These guys are walking muscle. They
     can start off with a strength of 150, which has inspired lots of warriors.
     But once again, donna think strength is everything. Ogres have infravision
     but they have the worst racial tension with the world. Their KOS, killed on
     sight, with NPC’s, non-player characters. Ta be honest, their strength
     has allured my attention (forget their looks!), but the fact that they
     canna travel the world as easily as the good races, makes ‘em dwindle in
     numbers around the world. Ogres can Slam like trolls and barbarians.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Half-Elves</b>
     - Handsome, agile, strong, yet a lil on the frail side. Half-elves are a
     very similar ta humans save for a humans have slightly better strength and
     stamina. Half-elves possess infravision and occasionally laugh at their
     human counterparts when they go bump in the night. =)</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wood
     Elves</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> - Ahh, my race and choice in
     life. We wood elves are quick and agile, although halflings are more agile
     I will admit. We can be strong, getting a strength of 100. While weaker
     than the big races, we can boast a high agility <b>with</b> that 100
     strength, we can have a 100 agility as well. So we can hit hard in battle,
     and avoid blows with ease. We also have a few nifty racial abilities. We
     can hide like dark elves, and we can forage for food like rangers, druids,
     and bards can. We can hide and forage 50% of the time, but it’s better
     than having ta make food runs or if ya low in health and danger is near, ya
     can always hide while ya recover. =)</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well,
     I’ve said all there is about the races. Ya choose whatcha wanna be and
     have fun, that’s all that really matters. Donna look at the numbers, stat
     wise, look at the fact that magical items can always boost ‘em and ya can
     do a lot more with a different race than ya can do with a strong race.
     Ogres and trolls have ultravision. Barbarians and humans don’t. But Ogres
     and trolls canna travel all over Norrath without doing <b>a lot</b> of good
     deeds. Barbarians and humans are accepted. Elves are quick and agile, but
     lack in raw power. So? Just takes me another swing or two ta take down my
     opponent…gives me such a rush! =)</font></p>
     <u><b>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Warriors
     in Depth</font></b></u></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">First
     off, we warriors can wear almost any armor. Can wield almost any weapon.
     Lastly we have the most hit points per level there is. At levels 20, 30,
     40, and 50, we obtain more hit points. Therefore be prepared ta see some
     astronomical numbers for health. When ya get hit for 94 points, ya’ll
     just say it was a scratch and see ya health bar barely move. Warriors get
     the ability to go berserk if they drop down to 30% of their health, and the
     ability to cause critical strikes and crippling blows in combat. We donna
     get spells, but that just separates the strong from the reliant. Spell
     casters rely on their mana and usually spend half their adventuring time
     meditating…boring if ya ask me. Even the half breeds, paladins, rangers,
     and shadow knights rely on meditating. Their a shame to us fighting
     classes. But donna let the fact that they can heal themselves slip ya mind.
     It’s a nice ability that we lack. My advice to you is to train in bind
     wounds. It won’t help you get passed 50% of ya health, but it’s better
     than sitting down for half an hour or so. The higher ya level is, the more
     the down time is. Ya can either heal ya self to 50% or beg a cleric for
     healing. I’m not into beggin…</font></p>
     <u><b>

     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Armor
     Training</font></b></u></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Decided
     yet? Good! Let’s get down to ya most important factor: Armor. Trust me,
     it’s a BIG difference when ya levels start climbing. Patchwork armor is
     good until level 5, afterwards I’d look for leather until 8. Beyond 8
     I’d try for banded until 15. At 16 and up, I’d suggest trying to get
     bronze plate mail, or if ya can afford it, steel plate which offers the
     same AC as bronze plate it’s just steel is a bit lighter. If ya need to
     know why armor is more important that weapons, I’ll tell ya. When I was
     six, I had leather armor and was fairing well, until I met a wonderful
     person that bought me a full suit of bronze plate mail. I was in shock for
     about half an hour! That armor was terrific, although very heavy for me. I
     couldn’t carry much loot. But with that armor, I lived all the way to 14
     without dying once. From 1-14 without any deaths is pretty good. But others
     will tell you that I was &quot;twinked&quot; because I had that armor
     earlier than most would’ve. Prolly, but it was given to me. =P</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">(
     Twinked, by the way, is a term used in EQ for people walking around with
     very high level stuff at a very low level. )</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Donna
     worry about twinkers. Worry aboutcha self. Strive for breastplates first,
     cuz they give the best AC, then go for the rest of the armor. Now,
     there’s a choice that will come to you one day. Some armor have magical
     enchantments on ‘em but have a horrible AC compared ta other non-magical
     armor. Your choice again. I, like a lot of other warriors, firmly believe
     in STRENGTH enhancing armor pieces. But it’s up to you. AC or ATK. In the
     beginning I’d like ta think AC is more important due to most warriors
     will want ta solo. When ya get passed 20, forget ya soloin days and look
     for a group. ATK is more important now mainly cuz ya most likely will have
     healers with ya that will make up for ya loss in AC.</font></p>
     <u><b>
     <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Weapon
     Training</font></b></u></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
     best part. Weapons. They come in all sizes and shapes. From fists ta huge
     axes. Warriors are the master of melee. We can wield almost any weapon in
     all of Norrath save for pure mages wimpy stuff. We donna need a water
     crystal staff that can choke our enemies, I’d rather slice ‘em down
     with a reliable axe and kick ‘em ‘til he screams like us women. =)</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Note:
     To train in weapon skill faster, always strive ta wield a weapon in the
     field with a short delay time. Quicker strikes means the skill is checked
     for often and therefore the skill will rise quicker than a slower weapon in
     the field.</font></p>

     Blunt</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> - As stated before, there
     aren’t any high end 1H blunt weapons for warriors only, but it donna mean
     you should over look this field. I personally am training in both, ya never
     know when one might pop up in the world. Weapon masters, such as myself,
     train in every weapon we are allowed.</font></p>

     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">2H
     Slash</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> - The fun toys. These bad
     boys can really get a monster’s attention. Just give ‘em a tap or two
     with these weapons and watch them turn to you in fear.</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">2H
     Blunt</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> - There are actually a few
     good 2H Blunts out there for warriors, but these weapons are extremely
     slow. The only offset they have is that they pack a mighty punch! A hit
     with these weapons takes out teeth from giants!</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Piercing</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
     - These weapons aren’t favorable by warriors, mainly because their weak
     in power. Their perfect for rogues, especially for their backstabs, but for
     a warrior, it’s much preferred to use a sword or mace.</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hand-to-Hand</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
     - A decent training skill, but most warriors don’t train in it. Mainly
     because we excel at weapons, and not fists like Monks do. This field is
     best left to them, still if you ever want to avoid being disarmed, this is
     a fine choice. Ya will always have a backup weapon. =)</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Archery</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
     - This is a great skill, or throwing if ya like that better, for getting
     monster’s attention. Since we donna have spells, and we don’t need
     spells, ta lure critters ta us instead of running up ta them and wackin at
     them. It’s also great when ya in a group and ya low in health, you can
     back up and fire away.</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Throwing</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
     - Same as Archery, save for they have a shorter range than arrows. But ya
     can fire ‘em a lot faster!</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kicking</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
     - We may not be Monks with our feet, but we still know how ta kick ‘em
     where it counts. Aim low, below the belt. Even the shins will do finely.
     When fighting magical creatures, ya gonna need magical boots in order to
     effect ‘em injury.</font><u><b></p>

     Skill Training</font></b></u></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
     will cover our skills we’ll get as we progress throughout our years as
     warriors. Ya canna live without, these skills, and therefore train in ‘em
     often. Donna worry about putting skill points inta ‘em though, they rise
     quickly as you fight tougher and tougher critters. Save ya points for
     weapon skills that ya want to train but haven’t had the time ta. Note: ya
     need ta put at least one training point in the following skill in order ta
     learn it.</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Berserk</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
     - This isn’t a skill really. All warriors begin with this ability. If ya
     fall beneath 30% of ya health, ya’ll flip ya lid and go insane. While
     berserk, ya strength will improve by 10, which increases our ATK.</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shield
     Bash</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> - This obviously requires a
     shield in order ta be utilized in battle. Ya then use the flat end of the
     shield and SLAM the shield inta the critters face which can stun ‘em
     sometimes. The only thing is that kicking generally does more damage. But
     donna over look this skill, when ya up to ya neck against magic users, show
     ‘em how PO ya can get with a shield. It’ll disrupt their magic and ya
     might walk away with no actual harm. Remember, magic users need their
     spells in order ta be effective, show ‘em ya shield and they’ll run in
     fear of ya. =)</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dodge</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
     - A great skill I must say. Ya donna believe how many times I’ve dodged
     death with this skill. With our ability to wear plate armor, use shields,
     parry, reposite, and dodge, a warrior can be a difficult being to injure
     when their skills if properly trained.</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Parry</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
     - I like this skill, ya use ya weapon ta stop incoming melee attacks and
     avoid damage. It’s a nice warriors touch.</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Critical
     Strikes </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">- This isn’t a normal
     skill that ya have to train in. It’s bestowed upon us warriors upon
     achieving ya 12<sup>th level. We then can teach critters not ta mess with
     us. A critical strike is a very rare event, so don’t get ya hopes up
     high.</sup></font></p>
     <sup>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
     we go berserk, our critical strikes become crippling blows. Crippling blows
     do a hell of a lot more damage than a critical strike and even stun
     opponents. My record a this time is 59 points with a critical strike, and I
     did a crippling blow that did 95 points. See the difference?</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dual
     Wield</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> - This skill is what a lot
     of warriors dream of. Wielding two powerful swords, or maces, against a
     critter in an amazing display of weapon talent. Just remember, put ya
     quickest weapon in ya right hand so this skill will raise fast. I’d
     practice this skill in a group, while soloing I’d just stick to a sword
     and shield or a two hander.</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Double
     Attack</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> - This is what we live for.
     Our ability to swing twice as fast in combat is a great thing, especially
     if ya mastered dual wield. Ya can sometimes get four ta five swings before
     someone wielding a two hander can swing once! Yeah, a two hander can swing
     for more damage per swing, but dual wielders with double attacks have
     better chances of getting critical strikes in combat. Still, double attack
     with a two handed weapon is still something to train in.</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reposite</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
     - This is an attack that’ll really tee-off ya opponents. When they swing
     at you, you get a counter-strike. Ya can bet this skill will be worth it
     except I don’t think it works as often as I would presume. It comes
     almost as rare as critical strikes do.</font></p>
     <b>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Disarm</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
     - I haven’t gotten this high yet, but I believe it’ll getcha some nifty
     weapons, and be useful when against critters wielding powerful weapons such
     as two handed swords. Most critters donna know how to use their fists
     effectively. Don’t over look this skill. Although ya have to be 35 in
     order ta obtain this skill. So it’s a long journey…donna rush. Ya’ll
     get there eventually.</font></p>

     I have ta thank ya for readin my guide and havin the patience ta understand
     my accent. I hopes I helped ya on deciding whatcha wanna be and what ta
     train in. Warriors are a beautiful class. Donna let anyone tell ya that
     their the way of life is a boring and uninteresting one. Bah! They just got
     no patience. Warriors are masters of battle. A wizard may do 1000 points of
     damage ta one critter in the blink of an eye…but he needs room ta cast
     it, and while that beast will be battering him down, he’ll never get that
     spell off. In truth, it’s been said before, and I’ll repeat it.
     &quot;Tanks need blasters and healers, while healers and blasters need
     tanks.&quot; I heard this via OOC chat and I give credit ta the guy. Atlas
     I didn’t record his name. =(</font></p>

     Warriors are proud ta fight, and fighting everything on Norrath is part of
     my dream. So donna rush.</font></p>
