              her talisman into two pieces one of which I always will carry and
              the other half which my son Glanitar carries. My son has not
              returned to me for some time and I am deeply concerned for this is
              not normal behavior for him. I fear something must have happened

              Glanitar was practicing his skills as a young Wurm. Before long he
              quickly mastered many fighting skills and the development of his
              magical skills rapidly progressed. He was coming along so well in
              his training that he was quickly drafted for the Patrol. Even when
              he was away for his training he would often return to me and tell
              me of his progress. I was very proud of him for his involvement
              with the Patrol. Although I am very proud of his accomplishments,
              I have not seen him for longer then I have ever been away from him

              <br>
              Ralgyn says 'Ah yes, the patrol. Well in the Great Divide there is
              a collection of caves that the dragonkind holds as a sacred
              territory. For this reason we always have a number of our
              strongest up and coming younger ones train there with the great [Kardakor].
              They patrol the caved labyrinth to make sure it is free from
              unwanted intruders who are quickly dealt with upon discovery.<br>

              says 'Kardakor is a strong and powerful Warrior. He has fought in
              many battles against the vile Giants and is well respected amongst
              our people as a champion. For this reason when one was needed to
              train our young fighters seeking guidance in developing both their
              magical and fighting techniques it was clear to us who we should
              select for this honor, Kardakor.</span></font></p>

              Glanitar, I fear that something unfortunate has become of him. It
              is not like him at all to be away for this long. He was out on
              normal patrol with a few others when they disappeared. We have not
              heard from any of them.<br>

              says 'This, I do not know. There are a few Giant forces that I
              have heard word of moving into the area. It is tough to say where
              they could have gone and if something happened to them or not who
              would be to blame. I highly doubt the Coldain would dare attack
              one of our units. The last I heard of them was when they left for
              the patrol of the Divide; this could have been anywhere. I
              remember that Glanitar carries a talisman from his mother. If you
              are to find any sign of Glanitar or any of the others please come
              to me first along with something that would symbolize who you
              received or took it from.'<br>
