            <br>
            Riposte</b><br>
              <br>
              Riposte is the last of yoru defensive melee skills. Much like
              parry and dodge riposte gives you an extra roll to avoid an
              attack. Unlike the previous incarnations however riposte, when
              succesful, also gives you an extra attack.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Example: Your opponent swings at you and you riposte. You will now
              get an extra swing at your opponent. This does not count against
              your normal swing time or ability to double attack.<br>
            <br>
              <b>Spells</b><br>
              <br>
              Endure Disease<br>
              <br>
              Casting this spell on another player or pet will add 20 points to
              their disease resistance.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Feign Death<br>
              <br>
              Feign death is perhaps the best spell that you will ever receive.
              This spell allows you to play dead much like a monk. If succesful
              monsters will stop attacking you. If you are the only person who
              they have aggroed(attacked) then they will eventually return to
              their spawn locations or patrol paths.<br>
              <br>
              There are a couple of things that need to be noted when using this
              spell.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              First off you need to always take off auto attack before casting
              this spell. If you auto attack is on this spell will fail every
              time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Secondly is that this spell is not always succesful. If the spell
              is unsuccesful you will receive the message &quot;Soandso has
              fallen to the ground.&quot; If you see this message you will need
              to get up and run or try it again. Because of the lengthy recast
              delay one failure could mean death to you.<br>
              <br>
              Last but not least spellcasters are your worst enemy when using
              this spell. Let's say for example that you have succesfully
              feigned. The mobs that were meleeing you have stopped meleeing and
              are standing in front of you. If a caster had begun casting an
              offensive spell on you before you feigned and does not finish
              casting the spell until after you have feigned then you are in
              trouble. As soon as their spell hits you while feigned other mobs
              will re-aggro.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              So when using feign death while being attacked by spellcasters you
              have to be very careful. Try to cast it right after their spell
              hits you. Usually they will not recast another spell for a few
              seconds and you should have time to feign before they do so. When
              fighting multiple spellcasters however this can be very tricky.<br>
              <br>
              There are two primary usese for this spell: Escape and pulling.
              Escape is self explanatory. You get in trouble and you don't want
              to die. So you feign death. You lay down and wait to be rescued.
              Or you get up and run for it when the monsters have gotten far
              enough away from you.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Pulling is a bit more complex. Much as a monk can use feign death
              to pull single monsters where a normal character would pull
              several so can an SK. It's a bit more difficult for us because we
              fail more often and because the spell takes time to cast where a
              monks is instant. They can also mend wounds to escape trouble
              where we can not. However if a shadowknight is careful and is
              willing to bite the bullet and die himself rather than training
              his party then they can be just as effective as a monk at feign
              death pulling. The real key is not caring about death. If you
              choose to feign death pull you will die. You may die quite often.
              In doing so however you will save party members lives.<br>
              <br>
              Now that is out of the way let's cover how to FD(Feign Death)
              pull. You should use a fetching spell to hit a group of monsters.
              Some prefer to use a darkness spell because it will have one mob
              lagging behind the others. Others prefer to use siphon strength
              because of it's low mana useage. Conserving mana is essential when
              pulling if you want to keep pulling nonstop. As a result I
              primarily use siphon strength when I am the puller. There are
              certain times when darkness is useful however.<br>
              <br>
              After pulling the mobs you should run to a spot between where the
              mobs were originally and where your party is located. Try to make
              this a safe spot where you are not likely to run in to a
              patroller. Also make sure that you are far enough away from your
              group so that they will not be aggroed by the mobs. Last make sure
              that you have sufficient distance from where you pulled the mobs
              so that they do not re-aggro once you stand up. Next turn and face
              the mobs so you can see them coming and feign death. If there is a
              caster in the lot you may have to stand there and take a few hits
              until they cast a spell at you and then feign death.<br>
              <br>
              Hopefully your feign was succesful. If it was not you need to
              stand up and try it again. If it is not succesful and you are
              going to die then try to find a safe place where it will be easy
              for your party to pull your corpse back to them and ressurect you.
              Do not train your party with these mobs. If your party could take
              this many at once you wouldn't need to FD pull them in the first
              place. Bite the bullet and take one for the team.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              If your feign was succesful you should just lay there and wait. Do
              not allow your party to cast any spells on you at this time. Doing
              so will likely make the mobs rush after whoever cast the spell and
              will defeat the purpose of the FD pull. Just sit and wait for the
              mobs to slowly trickle back to their spawn point. They will
              usually do so one by one. Sometimes however they will all go at
              once and you will have to get up and refeign and wait all over
              again.<br>
              <br>
              What you want to do is wait until only one or two(if your party
              can handle two) are still standing over your corpse. If these mobs
              are not patrollers you need to wait for them to go back to their
              original spawn point where they will then reset. Then you can
              stand up and drag the remaining one or two mobs to your party to
              slay them.<br>
              <br>
              Sometimes you will become bugged. As soon as you stand up every
              time(even if the mobs have reset) they will begin running directly
              toward you. If this happens you will need to /q and wait for five
              minutes. After five minutes you can relog back in and this should
              be fixed.<br>
              <br>
              FD pulling takes a bit of practice. Those who are skilled FD
              pullers however are invaluable to a group. It elminates the need
              for an enchanter or bard for crowd control(although they are still
              useful just in case) and decreases the risk for all other party
              members.<br>
              <br>
              Gather Shadows<br>
              <br>
              Gather shadows is a self only invisibility spell. It does not
              stack with invisibilty versus undead(it is impossible in Everquest
              for any player to be both invisible to undead and living via
              spell). This spell works both indoors and outdoors and you will
              find it very useful for the rest of your Everquest lifetime.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              It should be noted that undead beings, beings over level 50 and
              certain other beings can all see through invisibility.<br>
              <br>
              Heat Blood<br>
              <br>
              Heat blood is the first in a line of the heat blood-&gt;boil blood
              line of dots. These spells do decent damage over time. They do
              more damage per tick than the darkness line of spells and are heat
              based rather than magic based. This makes them less resistable by
              many mobs but very hard to cast on mobs with high fire resistance.<br>
              <br>
              Heat blood does 17 points of damage per tick for 10 ticks(one
              minute). The importance of this spell is that it stacks with both
              the darkness line of spells and with disease cloud(if you are
              still using that). This means that you can now stack engulfing
              darkness and heat blood on a mob to do a total of 280 points of
              damage over time. This is useful if you plan on kiting any mobs or
              for extra damage in melee combat.<br>
              <br>
              Life Draw<br>
              <br>
              Life draw is an upgrade to the lifetap line of spells. It lifetaps
              for 45 points of damage. This is the first lifetap spell which is
              semi useful for healing yourself during combat.&nbsp; It is still
              very mana inefficient but in an emergency you will be happy that
              you have it.<br>
              <br>
              If you need to heal yourself in an emergency I recommend that you
              step back out of combat for a second. Hopefully the mob will
              begin(if it is not already) attacking another player rather than
              interupting you. Then lifetap away until you are oom or until you
              are ready to re-engage.<br>
              <br>
              Restless Bones<br>
              <br>
              Restless bones is your level 30 pet spell. It summons a level 16
              necromancer pet. Same rules apply to this pet as with the
              previous.<br>
              <br>
              Wave of Enfeeblement<br>
              <br>
              This spell is an area effect weaken spell. It will drain 15 points
              of strength to every enemy within the area of effect. It is one of
              those spells you will likely never use except to show off a new
              toy.<br>
            <br>
              <b>
            Level 35</b><br>
              <br>
              Level 35-45 are the last stretch before the real fun begins. You
              will be able to defeat the bosses of some of lesser high level
              dungeons and to attain the equipment that will allow you to
              succeed in the planes which are your next logical step post
              45.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              With this newfound power you also find a decent amount of new
              equipment is obtainable.<br>

            Hide</b><br>
              <br>
              Hide is an underused but useful skill. It allows you to hide in
              one place(you can not move). If it is successful then you will be
              invisible to both living and undead beings. This makes it a great
              skill to use if you need to go AFK(away from keyboard) for a few
              minutes or if you need to go invisible in a hurry and do not have
              the spell memorized.<br>
              <br>
              There is an easy way to check to see if hide is successful
              providing you are within sight of another NPC/Monster who is not
              indifferent to you. Right click(or use /con) the mob and see how
              they react to you. If they are not indifferent then hide has
              failed. If they are indifferent(and are not normally so) then it
              is succesful.<br>
            <br>
              <b>
            Level 39<br>

              Spells</b><br>
              <br>
              Animate Dead<br>
              <br>
              This is an ugrade to your line of pet spells. It summons a level
              20 necromancer pet. Same rule applies as with all other previous
              pets.<br>
              <br>
              Cancel Magic<br>
              <br>
              This spell will cancel a magical effect(a random one) from a party
              member or an NPC. Depending on the level of the caster of the
              original spell and the level of the person casting the spell it
              may take several times for this to be successful.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              You can atttempt to cancel a specific effect from yourself by
              clicking on that spells icon on your screen and then casting this
              spell.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              This spell can be used to cancel dot's cast upon you by your
              enemies. It can also be used to attempt to remove damage shields
              or other beneficial spells from your enemies.<br>
              <br>
              Expulse Undead<br>
              <br>
              This is the second in your line of anti undead spells. It does up
              to 94 points of direct damage against undead beings.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Similar to the original(ward undead) spell the damage output is
              somewhat outdated by the time you receive the spell. It is still
              useful in the same scenarios as the original however. It is also
              good to keep up your evocation skill for later levels when these
              spells will actually become useful.<br>
              <br>
              Heart Flutter<br>
              <br>
              Heart flutter is a new line of DOT spells. You will receive an
              upgrade to this spell at level 60(asystole). This line of spells
              not only does damage over time but also acts as a strength and
              armor class debuff. This makes it a very useful spell. It is also
              stackable with both the darkness and the heat blood line of
              spells.<br>
              <br>
              This spell decreases(debuffs) your opponents strength by 20 points
              and their armor class by approximately 15 points. It also does 12
              points of damage per tick over 12 ticks(1 minute and 12 seconds).
              Thus by stacking this spell with engulfing darkness and heat blood
              you will now be able to do 424 points of damage over time in just
              over a minute as well as debuffing your opponent.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Resist Cold<br>
              <br>
              This is an upgrade to the endure cold line of spells. They do not
              stack with one another. It adds 40 points to your targets cold
              resistance. This spell will prove to be very useful in raids
              versus Lady Vox. Your buff will be the same as the priests types
              which will allow them to save time and mana while you buff cold
              resistance.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Shadow Vortex<br>
              <br>
              Shadow vortex is an armor class siphon. It siphons 12 points of
              armor class from your opponent and gives it to you. This spell is
              extremely useful and is likely to hold a spell slot for the rest
              of your career.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              Not only is it useful because of the dual buff and debuff but it
              also is an excellent taunt. If you need to get your opponent off
              an ally but don't want to use harm touch a shadow vortex followed
              by a taunt is a good bet to do the trick.<br>
              <br>
              Shieldskin<br>
              <br>
              Shieldskin is a self only shielding. This spell requires cat's eye
              agate as a reagent. It will absorb approximately 50 points of
              melee damage that would otherwise occur on you. After absorbing
              that damage one time the spell will no longer be in affect. This
              means that it does not actually buff your hit points as a
              cleric/druid/shaman spell does. It is a one time protection that
              only works against melee damage(does not work against spells). It
              also does not provide protection against being stunned.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              I personally never found much use for this spell. I would use it
              occasionally before a big battle because every small bit of hit
              points can help. The fact that it uses a reagent and that it is a
              one time useage prevented it from holding a spell slot most of the
              time.<br>
              <br>
              Some shadowknights however truly enjoy this spell. A tactic which
              they often employ is to wait until they get a succesfull bash/slam
              to stun their opponent and then immediately cast the spell during
              combat which gives them a shield. This can eat up reagents rather
              quickly but thankfully cat's eye agate is relatively cheap.&nbsp;<br>

            Disarm<br>
              <br>
              </b>Disarm is the final of your melee skills and unfortunately it
              is all but useless. Do not get me wrong. This skill can be of some
              use(especially in PVP) to a warrior, rogue or monk. A
              shadowknights disarm caps so early however that I have never once
              had a succesful disarm with it. Not even while in the arena
              dueling with level 1's could I ever succesfully disarm.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>
              The purpose of this skill is to disarm your opponents weapon. The
              flaw of it is that with the delay changes this only really became
              useful for dual wielders. The problem is that even if you disarm
              their weapon they still dual wield. All in all I think this skill
              is of VERY limited use for any class and for a shadowknight it is
              of no use whatsoever.
