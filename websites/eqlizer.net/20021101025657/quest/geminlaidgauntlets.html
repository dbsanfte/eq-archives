              <br>
              WARNING: This quest is currently very buggy but is completeable.<b><br>
              <br>
              First travel to North Qeynos and go to Crow's Tavern, inside is an
              erudite named Umvera Dekash. Here is your conversation with him:<br>
              </b><br>
              You say, 'hail Umvera Dekash'<br>
              <br>
              Umvera Dekash says 'What, Southern ? Do I look like a merchant to
              you? Just because all these merchants are in my library, it
              doesn't mean that I am one. If you are interested in something
              other than spell scrolls, then, we can talk.<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'I am interested in something other than spell scrolls'<br>
              <br>
              Umvera Dekash says 'Ah, so you do have half a wit about you! Very
              well. As you can clearly see, I am the librarian here. I keep
              track of all of the mystic tomes that enter this divine building.
              I also take care of all of the purchasing. Have you something to
              offer?<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'I have something to offer'<br>
              <br>
              Umvera Dekash says 'Excellent! You have no idea how difficult it
              is to get good help these days. Do you think you would have the
              time to gather some information for me?<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'I have the time to gather information for you'<br>
              <br>
              Umvera Dekash says 'Even better! Well, it has been some time since
              the Tesch Val gnolls moved in on the Split Paw. That being said,
              we still know little to nothing of their origins. If you can bring
              me back the four scrolls that our diviners speak of, I believe I
              can reward you well.<br>
              <b><br>
              Ok now you need to go to Split Paw in the South Karanas, Collect 4
              different Tanned Split Paw Skin Scrolls. These are lore items, and
              look like a rolled up scroll. When you right click you can read
              the message written on them if you are fluent in gnoll. But even
              those unversed in gnoll can notice the number on the page. Collect
              scroll Volume 1, 2,3,and 4 and return them to Umvera in North
              Qeynos</b><br>
              <br>
              Umvera Dekash says 'It's about time. Let's see here. Right..
              right.. right. Very good. Right. There you are! I translated the
              text. Now the scrolls need to be bound. Take these scrolls to
              Jheron Felkis in Freeport. I believe he is staying in one of the
              spare rooms in Velith and Bardo's establishment. He will ensure
              they are bound correctly. Return to me when the binding is
              complete.<br>

              You gain experience!!<br>
              <b><br>
              Ok at this point you can notice the bad image number text i put in
              italics up above, this is because the note that he gives you to
              deliver is VERY bugged and will cause you to crash when you look
              at this item in any zone other than North Qeynos. The only way to
              complete this part of the quest is to put the note in a bag before
              you leave North Qeynos, and keep it in that bag until its
              delivered to Jheron Felkis. DO NOT EVER LOOK INSIDE THE BAG OR YOU
              WILL CRASH TO DESKTOP AND LOSE YOUR NOTE. Jheron Felkis is located
              in East Freeport in Velith and Bardo's establishment, 3rd Floor.
              Hand him the entire bag with the note inside (hope you didnt put
              anything else in the bag), do not open the bag!</b><br>
              <br>
              You say, 'hail Jheron Felkis'<br>
              <br>
              Jheron Felkis says 'Ah, greetings, traveler! Settled into one of
              these rooms, have you? Well, this room is mine, so get out! Hey,
              wait! You aren't here to deliver a shipment of books to me, are
              you?<br>
              <br>
              You say, 'What shipment of books?'<br>
              <br>
              Jheron Felkis says 'Oh, I typically receive monthly shipments of
              books from Umvera Dekash. I hear he has recently been promoted to
              senior librarian in Erudin. What a vaulted position! I could only
              aspire. I'm not going to be binding books forever, you know!<br>
              <DID TEXT OF SCREENSHOT A 
GOT BUT PART THIS LOG NOT>
              <br>
              Jheron Felkis says &quot;So you are from Umvera! What is this? Oh
              my! INtersting! I'll bind them right away! A little snip here..a
              little snip there.. All done! That didn't take long, did it? I
              won't be doing this forever, you know. After the milita burned
              down my father's home, he could not afford to send me through
              proper schooling. Ah well, such is life!<br>
              <br>
              You gain experience!!<br>
              <b><br>
              Ok at this point you are given a book called A Splitpaw Tome. You
              can open it up and read it, 8 pages of text, none of it seemed
              relevant to any type of monk quest so I wont bother posting the
              lore contained within, interesting history of the Torn Ear though.
              Now you get to run back to North Qeynos and deliver the book to
              Umvera</b><br>
              <br>
              Umvera Dekash says 'You have returned safely. That is wonderful!
              Where the heck is my book, child? In my hands, I see. Such a
              bright little twinkle you are! Well, let me scribble something
              down on this pad here. There you are. Take this note to Durkis
              Battlemore in the Butcherblock Mountains. He is a remarkable
              smith, but more importantly, he owes me for his smithing books.<br>
              <br>
              You gain experience!!<br>
              <b><br>
              Durkis Battlemore can be found inside one of the guard buildings
              at loc 2072, 400</b><br>
              <br>
              You say, 'hail Durkis Battlemore'<br>
              Durkis Battlemore says 'What have ye got there, lad? Ack. I
              thought I would never hear from that crazy old man again. He wants
              me to give you a pair o' me gauntlets. I suppose I kin do that.
              Here you are, Southern . Wear them in good health.<br>

              mountains zone will cause you to crash to the desktop! So pretty
              much keep it in the bank until they fix the graphic I guess lol.
