            <td>Necromancers delve in the dark art of animating and mastering the dead. The life of a
            necromancer is one of isolation. You will be treated poorly by most NPC's that view
            &nbsp;&nbsp; that your black art as evil. It will not be uncommon to be shunned by your
            own race(unless you are a dark elf). The necromancers guilds are often underground or
            outside of town. Perhaps it is the summoning of undead that these mortals fear, or perhaps
            it is your somewhat sizeable amount of power.<br>
            <br>
            Many races can be necromancers including humans, dark elves, gnomes and erudites. Dark
            elves are probably the best choice even though an erudites base intelligence is a few
            points higher. This is due to the fact that necromacners are not only accepted but they
            are embraced by the dark elves. While necromancers of other races will have problems
            finding places to shop a dark elf necromancer will feel right at home in Neriak.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Many players tend to think of necromancers simply as masters of the undead. While they are
            in fact the true masters of undead beasts they also feature one of the widest variety of
            spells in the game. To fully understand all of the spells which a necromancer has at his
            disposal we will group the types of necromancer spells below.<br>
            <br>
            First and foremost are the pet summoning spells. Every circle you will receive a new
            summoning spell. These pets are vital to your soloability. There are two popular tactics
            associated with using your pets. <br>
            <br>
            The first tactic is most effective at lower levels and all but suicidal at higher levels.
            This tactic is to firstsend in your pet to attack the monster. While your pet is tanking
            the monster you will get off your DoT spells(not many at lower levels but the lost grows
            as you go). When your pet gets down to about half health you will run and and share the
            damage load with him. You can always heal yourself with your lifetap spells so this is a
            rather effective tactic.<br>
            <br>
            The second tactic is less effective at lower levels but is the safest tactic at higher
            levels of play. This is to once again send in your pet to tank the monster. Once again you
            will fire off all of your DoT spells as quickly as possible. You will then use your
            offensive spells until you get low on mana. Heal your pet as well as you can and then
            meditate during the battle. The reason you will not personally enter the battle is because
            you will not last long with a high level monster striking you for 90+ points of damage and
            your melee capabilities are going to dish a lot less than you would be able to by
            meditating and launching spells.<br>
            <br>
            Now that we have covered summoing spells we will cover the spells which will be your most
            effective offensive spells under most circumstances. These are damage over time
            spells(DoT). These spells have a great damage to mana ratio however it will take a couple
            of minutes for them to do full damage. These spells are very effective when used in
            combination with your pet. Most importantly necromancers receive four seperate stackable
            lines of these spells including the heat blood, clinging darkness, poison and heart
            flutter lines of spells. When you stack the four of these together you will be very
            effective in a long fight.<br>
            <br>
            The most unique line of spells that a necromancer has are your lifetap line of spells.
            These spells have two effects. First they do direct damage to your opponent, and second
            they take those hit points and use them to heal yourself. There are two types of lifetap
            spells. The first is the lifetap-&gt;lifespike line of spells which can be used from long
            range. Second is the vampiric embrace line of spells which are more effective but require
            you to actually touch your opponent(without wielding a weapon). <br>
            <br>
            Another interesting type of necromancer spells is the siphon spells. At level 1 you
            receive siphon strength which not only weakenes your opponent but it also strengthens you.
            Higher strength will raise your ATK rating which is still quite useful at lower levels.
            Weakening the monster will mean that you or your party will absorb a bit less damage over
            the course of a fight which is always a good thing.<br>
            <br>
            Necromancers get several buffing and utility spells which most mage types do not. These
            spells can be beneficial to other party members. Spells included in this category are
            endure spells, cure spells and even spirit armor(an armor class buffing spell). The dark
            empathy spell will allow you to heal others while taking hit points away from yourself.
            This makes you more useful to a party even though your DoT spells will be less useful than
            when solo. This is due to the fact that a well balanced group will kill a monster too fast
            for DoT to take full effect. <br>
            <br>
            The ward-&gt;expulse-&gt;dismiss-&gt;expel-&gt;banish undead line of spells make
            necromancers the ultimate undead slayers. They receive these spells one circle later than
            their cleric counterparts however necromancers commonly have much higher intelligence than
            a cleric has wisdom. This extra mana means that necros will never be much behind their
            cleric counterparts even in the levels when necromancers are one spell behind.<br>
            <br>
            Adding to their undead mastery are several undead utility spells such as the calm line of
            spells for use versus undead, the hungry earth(undead root) spell and the charm undead
            line of spells. <br>
            <br>
            As if undead mastery wasn't enough necromancers can also cast anti-summoned spells all the
            way up to the expel summoned spell. These spells are extremely effective versus summoned
            foes such as elements.<br>
            <br>
            Just when you were beginning to think that you had too much power already the charm spells
            will begin to appear. Necromancers can not only charm undead beings but also(at a later
            level) living mobs. Some view charm as a mere parlor trick however it can be very
            effective in the proper situations. The weakness of charm is the unpredictable(and often
            short) duration.<br>
            <br>
            The word of shadow line of spells are area effect spells which center around the casters.
            I honestly would not recommend using these spells unless you are attempting to finish
            several monsters at once. Once you use these spells the monsters will often all turn and
            attack you. Necromancers usually don't have enough hit points to sustain this kind of
            offensive onslaught.<br>
            <br>
            The locate corpse spell which you receive at level 1 will make you a popular person in
            large outdoor zones. It is often hard to find ones corpse in outdoor areas and this spell
            will make your life easier. If you click on a player and then cast this spell it will
            point you in the direction of their corpse if it is nearby.<br>
            <br>
            The level 8 shadow step spell will be very useful for those situations when a monster
            begins pounding you a bit too much. It will teleport you a nice distance away and
            hopefully allow your group members a chance to taunt him off of you in that time.<br>
            <br>
            More important however is the level 16 feign death spell which will make the monster
            believe that you are dead(while you lay motionless). When successful this will buy you the
            time to heal up or to allow the monster to back far enough away for you to run or gate.<br>
            <br>
            Many useful necromancers spells are self only however. These include being able to grant
            yourself infravision and the ability to see invisible foes. Necromancers receive damage
            shields via the grim-&gt;banshee aura lines of spells. These damage shields are self only
            however. Necromancers also get invisibility at a relatively low level(8). Once again this
            is a self only spell. Breath of the dead will remove the need for air and acts as a water
            breathing spell.<br>
            <br>
            One of the largest weaknesses of necromancers is the lack of root spells. You will not be
            able to root living beings until level 34. Your darkness line of spells(engulfing darkness
            etc) will slow your opponents noticeably however and will need to act as a poor man's root
            spell in the meantime. <br>
            <br>
            Another weakness is the lack of good direct damage spells. Your lifetap spells and poison
            bolt will be your best direct damage spells throughout most of your career as a necro. <br>
            <br>
            All that having been said I feel that necromancers are perhaps the most interesting class
            in the game(right up there with druids, enchanters and bards). You can do a little bit of
            everything. Necromancers are probably the most suited class in the game for solo play.
            With recent changes your pets will no longer take a share of experience in a party unless
            they dish out the killing blow. This makes necromancers(and magicians) a much more viable
            option for group play than they once were. There was a time when necromancers were viewed
            as a great solo class who was often not on a groups &quot;must have&quot; list. At this
            point they are not only a viable solo class but also one of the more useful classes for
            group play as well.<br>
