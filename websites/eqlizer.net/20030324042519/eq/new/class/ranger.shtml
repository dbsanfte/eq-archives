            Rangers are the guardians of the woodlands. They are 3/4 warrior and
            1/4 druid which is quite a powerful mix indeed. Rangers can wear
            most types of armor(though they can not wear platemail) as well as
            being able to wield most weapons. They gain all of the meelee
            abilities of a warrior with the exception of bash. They also can
            cast some quite useful druid spells. They have the best direct
            damage spells of the hybrid classes. Paladins specialize in damaging
            undead, shadowknights specialize in damage over time where rangers
            are the master of the outdoors.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers are a great class for beginning players. They get their
            meelee skills earlier than other hyrbids. Where paladins and
            shadowknights will have to wait for their secondary attack(bash)
            until level 12, rangers gain theirs(kick) at level 5. Paladins and
            shadowknights do not get dodge until level 10 where rangers gain it
            at level 8. While all hybrids gain double attack at level 20 only
            rangers get the ability to duel wield and they get it at level 17.<br>
            <br>
            Each hybrid gains a special skill. Paladins can lay hands once per
            day and shadowknights can harm touch once per day. These abilities
            are special abilities that only those two classes have. Rangers
            share their special skill(tracking) with druids and bards but they
            gain it at level 1 in comparison to level 20 and 35 respectively.
            They also are the masters of this skill and have the largest range
            on it. This skill can be incredibly useful in outdoor zones. There
            are certain monsters in your level range and you might wander around
            for 5-10 minutes looking for a skunk for example as it is a level 2
            monster. With tracking you can simply track it down and move on to
            the next one. At higher levels this skill becomes even more
            important as you will be searching for those rare NPC's in outdoor
            zones and you might want to know whether or not a monster has
            spawned in a dungeon. If you enter a monsters lair and they haven't
            spawned you might voilate the anti camp code preventing it from
            spawning, but not if a ranger is in the group.<br>
            <br>
            This makes rangers a great hybrid for players who do not have the
            experience or patience to wait 22 levels for their class to peak. By
            the time you reach level 17 you will still be able to match a
            warrior pretty well(though they will already have double attack). At
            the same time you will have spells which will increase your armor
            class, hit points, act as a damage shield, heal you, protect you
            from fire, do direct damage, use as area effect spells, increase
            your agility, cure poisons, root monsters in place and render you
            invisible. It is probably safe to say that rangers peak earlier than
            any other hybrid class.<br>
            <br>
            The flip side of this coin is that you might not be as strong as
            other hybrid classes at later levels. Your spells will still be able
            to more than hold their own and your meelee will do that and more.
            However it is common knowledge that the paladins and shadowknights
            have some of the best class specific(if not the very best) class
            specific weapons in the game. Ranger specific weapons are powerful
            in their own right(and one handed which allows you to duel wield
            them) but will have to take a backseat to the holy swords. More
            importantly perhaps is that the lack of platemail armor will rear
            it's ugly head at higher levels when magical platemail begins to
            come within your reach. These are factors that you will have to
            strongly consider in creating this class however I wanted to take a
            paragraph to point out why these are not as large a factor as many
            would lead you to believe.<br>
            <br>
            Weapon wise you are the only hyrbid that can duel wield. Where
            shadowknights have powerful two handed swords which will cause some
            sinister effects from time to time and paladins have one handed
            swords which will rip undead beings to shreds the rangers will be
            able to have wield two of their special weapons at once. This
            doubles the chance of your weapons special effect going off. The
            ranger weapon currently in the game is also lightning quick which
            when coupled with double attack and duel wield means you will be
            able to hit not only hard but often.<br>
            <br>
            Armor wise there is no way around it. Platemail armor is simply
            going to give better armor class than non-platemail armor. There are
            many types of magical armor such as <a href="file:///E:/gameznet/eq/class/ranger.html/../equipment/lupinearmor.html">lupine</a>
            which are better than non-magical platemail. However magical
            platemail cannot be beat due to it's added armor class. One thing
            that should be mentioned however is the armor class difference
            between full plate and full chain is not all that much in the
            greater scheme of things. You can make up for the lack of platemail
            by having high agility. Agility has a huge affect on armor class and
            high agility when combined with your personal buffs can raise your
            armor class well above the average warriors. Without buffs you can
            be comparable to his if your agility is sufficiently higher.<br>
            <br>
            So what special skills can a ranger look forward to besides the
            aforementioned?<br>
            <br>
            At level 3 you gain the ability to forage. This skill will allow you
            to save tons of money that you would otherwise spend on food and
            drink. It will also allow you to stay out as long as you want or
            until you become overloaded.<br>
            <br>
            At level 10 you gain the ability to sneak. Sneak is a special skill
            which allows you to move silently. This can be used as a &quot;poor
            mans&quot; invisibility and will be somewhat useful until you gain
            the ability to cast superior camo at level 49.<br>
            <br>
            At level 15 you gain the ability to meditate and bind wounds.
            Meditate of course is one of the more useful skills in the game as
            it allows you to regenerate your mana at an accelerated rate.
            Meditating and then healing will allow you to drastically reduce
            your downtime when you are solo or in a group without a healer. The
            combination of meditate and heal really eliminate the need for bind
            wounds which requires a bandage and only can heal you up to half
            your health.<br>
            <br>
            Level 18 will grant you the parry skill. Parry like dodge will
            reduce the amount of hits you take and is a very welcome addition to
            your arsenal.<br>
            <br>
            At level 25 you will gain the hide skill. This skill is like casting
            an invisibility spell on yourself with one notable exception. If you
            move you will no longer be hidden. This is very useful when you are
            meditating or when used in conjunction with the sneak skill(where
            you can sneak behind a monster and then hide before the patroller
            knows your there).<br>
            <br>
            Level 35 sees the last of your special skills disarm and riposte.
            Riposte will keep you from getting hit and disarm will allow you to
            knock your opponents weapon from his hands. Disarm is very useful
            when it works(which isn't very often) because monsters with weapons
            hit much harder than those without them.<br>
            <br>
            The thing that really set's rangers apart from warriors however is
            the ability to cast spells. While you will never be as good as a
            pure caster your spells are good enough to make them useful in many
            situations and especially if you are solo or in a small group. There
            are several types of ranger spells and I will attempt to describe
            the more common lines of spells below:<br>
            <br>
            One of the first line of spells you will receive is the skin like
            wood-&gt;rock-&gt;steel series of spells. These spells add armor
            class and hit points. While these spells are not comparable to those
            of a similarly leveled cleric they are very useful if there is no
            priest around. The armor class and hit points granted by these
            spells are similar to the courage-&gt;center-&gt;daring line of
            spells that a paladin can cast.<br>
            <br>
            Probably the most useful line of spells when soloing is your heal
            spells. These begin with minor heal at level 9 and end with heal at
            level 39. While you will not be able to match the healing of a
            priest or a paladin these spells are still very useful as they
            reduce downtime and allow you to fill in as the healer in emergency
            situations.<br>
            <br>
            Root spells are the one thing that warriors are lacking the most.
            Rangers are able to snare at level 9 and cast grasping roots at
            level 15 which not only roots a monster but also does a bit of
            damage. The level 49 esnaring roots takes this a step further doing
            a decent amount of damage as well as rooting your prey. These spells
            will keep those runners from getting away and are very important if
            you do not have a pure caster and even if you do.<br>
            <br>
            Ranger direct damage spells begin with flame lick and grow from
            there. Your direct damage spells will never be a powerful offensive
            weapon and you should not attempt to use them as such. They are
            however good for finishing off runners, fetching monsters and
            getting that extra bit of damage to compliment your meelee skills.
            For example your level 15 burst of fire will do 13 damage and takes
            15 mana. At level 15 you will probably be able to hit for more than
            15 damage with your sword but burst of fire never misses and more
            importantly it has a much greater range. While these spells are not
            overly effective the other hybrid classes will envy you because this
            is an area where they are truly lacking.<br>
            <br>
            The ward summoned spell is an underated ranger spell. When you get
            this spell at level 22 the damage:mana ratio is still pretty good.
            This will allow you to have a leg up on elemental beings. The only
            problem with this spell is there mare not any elements that will
            give you experience at this level. By the time you are high enough
            to reach the elemental planes you will have the dismiss summoned
            spell(level 39). This spell has the best damage:mana ratio of any
            ranger direct damage spell.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking of damage spells rangers are the only hyrbid which can do
            area effect damage in the form of lightning spells. These spells
            will allow you to damage multiple targets at once. While your
            mana:damage ratio will not be high it is still better to have than
            to have not.<br>
            <br>
            One type of spells that keeps rangers interesting is the sight
            spells. At level 9 you will be able to cast glimpse which allows you
            to zoom in and peek at something in the distance. Much more useful
            however ist he level 22 bind sight. This spell allows you to bind
            your sight to your target and see things through their perspective.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers also can fill in and cast utility spells. You will be able
            to cure poisons and more importantly increase a players strength and
            agility scores. Perhaps the most popular utility spell in the game
            is spirit of the wolf which will allow you to double your speed in
            outdoor zones. This can be used not only to escape death but also to
            reduce travel time. You will be able to cast it at level 39. What
            spirit of the wolf is to land travel the level 22 enduring breath is
            to sea. Enduring breath will allow you to breath underwater. This is
            not only useful for those underwater expeditions but can also be a
            life saver if you get rooted while beneath the waves.<br>
            <br>
            At level 15 you will be able to cast camoflauge. This spell will
            render a player invisible in outdoor zones. This can be useful if
            you need to get by a powerful monster but as with all invisibility
            spells it has the habit of wearing off at the wrong times. At level
            49 you will be able to cast superior camoflauge which will render
            you invisible in indoor zones as well.<br>
            <br>
            One of the most useful ranger lines of spells is the thistle series
            of spells. These spells are damage shields.&nbsp; There are two
            different lines which can not be stacked with one another. One line
            grants you additional armor class as well as doing a small amount of
            damage to your attackers. This line can only be cast on yourself.
            The other line does not grant armor class but does much more damage.
            This line can be cast on others as well. Damage shields may not seem
            to do a lot of damage per hit but they add up over time and by the
            end of the battle can constitute for a lot of damage.<br>
            <br>
            At level 30 you can cast Stinging Swarm. This damage over time spell
            will slowly eat away at your opponent over the period of a couple of
            minutes. DoT spells such as this one have excellent damage:mana
            ratios the only problem is that they take time to do their full
            potential. However many of the monsters you will be fighting at this
            level are going to take time to kill anyway and these will more than
            do their fair share of the work.<br>
            <br>
            Rangers get a few other miscellaneous spells such as cancel magic,
            harmony, calm animal and levitate. These spells each can serve their
            own purpose and can be very useful in certain scenarios though will
            mostly stay un-memorized in your spellbook.<br>
            <br>
            As you can see rangers are an interesting mix of the warrior and
            druids classes. Rangers are one of the most(if not the most)
            intersting classes in the game. They make an excellent choice for
            soloing in outdoor zones because of their ability to track, heal and
            fight. They have the widest assortment of hybrid spells and are also
            the only hybrid which can duel wield. In exchange for these niceties
            they suffer the 25% hybrid experience penalty and forfeit the rights
            to wear platemail armor. You will never be as good of a tank as a
            warrior or as good of a caster as a druid however you will be a fine
            mix between the two classes and a welcome addition to most groups.<br>
            <br>
            Think you want to be a ranger but can't decide on which race to be?
            Well it's not much of a decision as there are only three races in
            the game which can be rangers, those being humans, half elves and
            wood elves. Humans will ease the experience penalty and have the
            highest strength and stamina. Half elves have the worst ability
            scores but do offer infravision and the ability to start on the
            mainland. Wood elves are the best choice ability wise. Wood elves
            will start off with the ability to forage and hide as it is their
            natural abilities. This will ease the failures when you first gain
            the skills and also allow you to take advantage of these two ranger
            skills from level 1. Wood elves also have the highest overall skills
            of the three in the longrun. Although humans have an extra 10
            strength and stamina wood elves have a 20 point agility advantage,
            and 5 point advantags in both dexterity and wisdom. My suggestion
            would be to create a wood elf and put all of your points into
            strength. This will help your meelee skills. Besides the 105
            starting agility should make up for the lack of platemail down the
            road.<br>
