            Grouping With Crowd Controlling Enchanter Guide to Easy Dungeon Fighting.<br>
            by Untos Gnomish Enchanter.<br>
            <br>
            This guide is meant to give better understanding of Enchanters' role in a&nbsp; group.
            &nbsp; Most people categorized different class as the following:&nbsp; Puller,&nbsp; Tank,
            Nuker, Healers.&nbsp; Enchanter (and Bard's in some extent) belong in&nbsp; another
            category.&nbsp; That is Crowd Control.<br>
            <br>
            An example:<br>
            <br>
            When you in Upper Guks, the puller pulls 3 frogs on your team, each of your&nbsp; member
            will try to engage each frogs and kill them all as fast as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; You and
            your team are taking damage from 3 different frogs at once.&nbsp; The&nbsp; healer is
            having a hard time retargetting his/her teammate to heal them and&nbsp; run out of mana
            real fast.&nbsp; It is more effecient that everyone in the group&nbsp; to concentrate on
            killing 1 frogs at a time, thus reducing the damages you&nbsp; are taking from 3 frogs to
            2 frogs..and then 1 frogs..and then non.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; Imagine the same pull, where the
            3 frogs come and everyone engage the first&nbsp; frog.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be great if the
            other 2 frogs would get inline and wait&nbsp; for his turn and doesn't do anything else
            but just watch the fight (kinda&nbsp; like some of those Chinese Kung Fu movie). &nbsp;
            That's what Crowd Control is, to <br>
            Reduce/turn the tide of a fight from Your group VS 3+ mobs to Your group VS&nbsp; 1 after
            another.&nbsp; (or even better.. Your group+1 frog vs 1 frog and other frog is drooling on
            itself).<br>
            <br>
            That is what a good Enchanter could accomplish (and bards).<br>
            <br>
            We all loves the fact that Enchanter in a group will BUFFs/Debuffs&nbsp; people(Clarity,
            Speeds attacks, slow the monster and lower their&nbsp; Str/Agi/AC..), but the Ability to
            Crowd Control was given to Enchanter since Level 4.(mesmerize)<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            1.&nbsp; Mesmerize (MEZ):<br>
            <br>
            This spell does:&nbsp; approximately 15sec stuns to a monster (if not resist).&nbsp; <br>
            The stuns will break when the NPC/MOBs is DMG in anyway (spells, DOT, Bash).<br>
            <br>
            This is our &quot;bread and butter&quot; crowd control line.
            (Mesmerize(15sec)/Entrall(30sec)/Entrance(50-60sec)/Dazzle(not sure about this one))
            &nbsp; These spells will put Monster on ICE while you take care of his friend. There's an
            Additional benefit to this spell.&nbsp; You can DEBUFFs monster that&nbsp; is Mermerized.
            (nonDMG type debuffs). You can Root, REduce Stats, Blind it...etc.<br>
            <br>
            In Addition to those spells we also have an Area Effect Mez spell <br>
            (Mesmerisation).&nbsp; This is what most enchanter call TRAINStopper.&nbsp; Because it
            &nbsp; will stop a trains of 10 mobs in a track.&nbsp; This spell works like normal AE
            &nbsp; spell where an Enchanter will Target someone/NPC and cast it.&nbsp; This spell can
            be cast from far away and effect an area near the target.&nbsp; This spell&nbsp; does
            15sec stuns also.&nbsp; It has one Disadvantage.&nbsp; If the Caster is within&nbsp; the
            AE area, he MAY get Mez also.&nbsp; Keep your eyes out for &quot;[Insert your enchanter's
            name] is mesmerized&quot;<br>
            <br>
            In these situation, it IS important that everyone in the GROUP attack the&nbsp; same
            MOB/NPC.&nbsp; You must use /assist and Reassist to make you sure attacking&nbsp; the same
            monster.&nbsp; There are chances where Monster will resist Mez and will&nbsp; bee-line
            toward Enchanter, be ready to (root/Stuns/Taunt that mobs).&nbsp; Make sure you go back to
            the original Monster once you got the Resist mobs attention, Enchanter will ICE him soon.
            &nbsp; Many Enchanters has die from people who like to SOLO in a group, because when a mob
            break off the ice by someone, it doesn't hit the one that hits it.&nbsp; It goes after the
            enchanter who iced/mezed him.<br>
            <br>
            2.&nbsp; Charm/Beguile/...the whole series.<br>
            <br>
            You all have seen this &quot;Powerful&quot; spells in action.&nbsp; It essentially takes <br>
            one of the mobs and turn it into Enchanters pet.&nbsp; (Some class has a form of
            &quot;charm&quot; like Befriend Animal and Beguile undead).&nbsp; This will help turn a
            tide in a fight because you now have 1 more member to your group and they(mobs) has 1 less
            to theirs.<br>
            <br>
            The Chaos of Charms is very unpredictable/unreliable at time.&nbsp; First of all, charms
            can last from 1sec to 1min+.&nbsp; You can never tell (think INVIS running out at the
            wrong place).&nbsp; Second, when a charmed mobs breaks, he is megataunt at the charmed
            (the enchanter usually) and will takes some taunt/nuking to get the mobs off him. &nbsp;
            Third, Charmed COULD wander and cause trains like any of &quot;PET&quot; in dugeon. &nbsp;
            Forth, Charmed mobs will not attack anything that's RED to it.<br>
            <br>
            Normal practice for enchanters that use charm is to charm one of the <br>
            pull..(and let the group know so they don't waste mana/time on it)&nbsp; And&nbsp; finish
            all the mobs and then...Break charms(invis, Cancel magic) to kill him last for this
            particular pull.<br>
            <br>
            3.&nbsp; ColorFlux/Color Shifts ...AE stuns.<br>
            <br>
            This line of spells are not very much crowd control but it can helps.&nbsp; This spells
            will do a AE stuns to mobs next to the Caster(enchanter).&nbsp; The Radius&nbsp; from
            Enchanter is very small so not all mobs in the fight will be effected.&nbsp; Color Flux
            last about 2-3sec, Color Shifts last about 6sec.&nbsp; Normally enchanter use this spells
            so that he/she can reapply AE mez and not getting interrupted.&nbsp; This is all the
            &quot;Feet move Fast&quot; tactic.&nbsp; He can AE stuns and run for the zone, which give
            you a head start (unless there's resists...)<br>
            <br>
            Notice that Enchanter doesn't really do Damage in a group.&nbsp; He/she may run up and
            poke them w/ this toys sticks or pokers but that's it.&nbsp; Most Enchanter will not DD,
            but will DOT.&nbsp; Our DD is megataunt (because of dual effect) and it's not Mana
            effcient.&nbsp; We will use it in emergency or finish runners.&nbsp; The recycle time on
            it is horrible.&nbsp; The DOT usually lower STR, AGI and maybe AC, so we use that. &nbsp;
            Usually we don't have enough spell slot to mem them anyway. (Charm, Cancel, Tashani[Lower
            MR], Slow, AE mez, Mez, AE stuns, Speed attacks).&nbsp; That pretty much covers all the
            spell slots.<br>
            <br>
            With this Guide, I hope all you adventurer of Norrath will now understand Enchanter's role
            in a group.&nbsp; (maybe we get into more groups now ;P.<br>
