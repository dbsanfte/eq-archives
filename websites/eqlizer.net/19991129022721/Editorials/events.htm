                    <tr>
                        <td>Ah the gm event. Upon hearing this
                        word most people search for a teleport to
                        the location, as if it was life or death.
                        The most recent major GM event was held
                        on Halloween, when they held a ceremony
                        of types to the date and the opening of
                        the plane of hate. Unfortunately the
                        event turned bad. As players were being
                        killed by the dozens, lag started flying,
                        and corpses were being duped, people who
                        didn't even want to be in the event were
                        dying, being butchered by the hundreds as
                        they tried to get to their corpses and
                        leave. Bugs were not absent, the zone
                        line to commons was being a little tricky
                        and throwing players back to high hold
                        pass. People were crashing non stop, and
                        many just shut down their cpu.<p>This
                        type of event is perfect in showing how a
                        gm event shouldn't be. It was fun for
                        many, but the lag and the corpse issues
                        were getting out of hand. Most events I
                        have seen allow the player to choose if
                        they wish to carry on or not. I
                        personally enjoyed the event, but I find
                        that many players didn't. The weapons
                        being droped by the mobs was A Grade, but
                        in the situation, was VERY hard to get.
                        If you are fighting something, but have
                        75% pl, it gets hard. Many lag spikes
                        were going on in all the zones, not only
                        effecting the woods. GM events are a
                        welcome addition any time they happen,
                        but they are rare, and usually end in
                        alot of people angry and confused. </p>
                        <p>On the Halloween event, I know a few
                        people who lost <strong>2</strong> levels
                        when they didn't even want to be in the
                        event. Myself, with many others feel that
                        GM events should be much more planned
                        out, and have a more sense of true
                        role-playing, such as the ButcherBlock
                        hammer saga. The turn of events in that
                        event have been unmatched as of this
                        date, and I doubt they will be. Only a
                        few people were in the quest for the
                        hammer, but I found the entire server
                        enjoyed it. It was <u>THE</u> mass event.
                        It had a beginning, a middle, a turn of
                        events, and an end. Many people think
                        that there are not enough events, I agree
                        with them, but, GMs should not just start
                        doing the standard event. That would be
                        creating 3 high level, and insanely
                        powerful mobs, and attacking players,
                        then at the end they drop a few very nice
                        items. </p>
                        <p>People want to see more events like
                        the Hammer quest, they want to see a saga
                        of events unfold infront of them, they
                        want to see a quest in the true sense of
                        role-playing, with a greater reward at
                        the end, after a long time of adventuring
                        and putting your life on the line for the
                        great sense of everything. The hammer
                        quest only rewarded one person, but I
                        believe many think that they had the best
                        reward of all, being able to be part of
                        the best GM event of all time. <br>
