     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Compliments
     of Brendan. <a href="mailto:webmaster@gameznet.com">Email</a> Additional
     info. Level 27 song by Pentar.</font>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">1-
     Chant of Battle - Adds DEX and STR to everyone in your party<br>
     Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: A great song. The STR bonus is pretty useless at low levels,
     since you don't get a damage bonus for STR yet, and it's unlikely you will
     be overloaded at the early levels. The DEX bonus might save you from
     getting hit a couple times, which is what it's mainly useful for.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">2-
     Chords of Dissonance - AE (Area Effect) damage to non party members.<br>
     Uses a stringed instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: I found this song to be pretty useless. Most of the low-level
     areas have mobs that are too close together to use this safely. If you are
     going to use it, make sure that the mob you are fighting is the only one
     nearby, or you'll get ganged really quickly. Be VERY careful when there are
     wandering guards nearby, because this will make them attack you. If you
     don't have much money, I wouldn't worry about buying this song.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">3-
     Jaxan`s Jig o` Vigor - Increases STA regen rate for all party members.<br>
     Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: Not too useful at lower levels, except for swimming long
     distances. Until you get Selo's at 5, it might be useful to sing when
     running from a mob, because you'll be able to jump more often with the
     extra stamina. At high levels, you might use this when your party is in a
     long fight, but there are probably more useful things you will be singing.
     Don't bother using the drum, singing it gives you more than enough STA.
     Sometimes a useful song, but I'd buy armor before it.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">4-
     Lyssa`s Locating Lyric - Locates the targeted person's corpse.<br>
     Uses the singing skill.<br>
     Analysis: A pretty handy spell. To use it, select the person who's corpse
     you want to find, and start singing. The song will point you in the
     direction of the corpse. It's a bit tricky to see if someone is following
     you, so you might want to switch to the 3rd person view. If you are finding
     your own corpse, juggle between this and Selos(5) so you get there faster.
     Some people will charge for this, I never do, just assuming that the person
     I helped might be around to save me sometime.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">5-
     Selo`s Accelerando - Speeds your party's movement rate and decreases STA
     loss.<br>
     Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: One of the bard's best songs. By itself, without a drum, it will
     let you go about as fast as Spirit of the Wolf (aka SOW). With a drum you
     can easily outpace anyone with SOW. This should save your skin frequently
     in outdoor areas, because it will let you outrun virtually any moster in
     the game (Aviak Egrets can outrun you if you don't use a drum). This song
     doesn't work indoors, so like druids I tend to stick to the outdoor zones
     and dungeons. If you are overloaded and running, juggle this and Chant(1)
     to get speed and an STR bonus at the same time; it should speed you up
     considerably.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">6-
     Hymn of Restoration - Increses HP regeneration.<br>
     Uses a stringed instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: Another of the bard's best songs. Until you get better songs, you
     should be juggling this with Chant(1), since it will help you last longer
     in battles. Investing in a stringed instrument is a good idea, since you
     will heal much more quickly with it. You can outheal most Poison and
     Disease spells with this, which is helpful if you don't have a party member
     who can cure those effects. I soloed many plague rats, since i didn't have
     to worry about not being able to regenerate health once i was diseased. You
     can make friends with this song as well - If you are at a dungeon entrance
     healing yourself, offer to group with other people and heal them. Every six
     levels your healing power goes up by 2 points. (at 12, 18, 24, etc)</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">7-
     Jonthan's Whistling Warsong - Increases your STR, AC, and Attack Speed<br>
     Uses the singing skill.<br>
     Analysis: A good soloing song, you might end up using this well into your
     20s (should you still be soloing at that point). Like Chant(1), the STR
     bonus is not very useful at lower levels. The AC boost is useful, but the
     real benefit of this song is that it speeds up your Attack Speed by 15
     percent or so. It's tough to notice, but it is there. At this point, you
     might be able to juggle 3 songs pretty well and should be juggling Chant(1)
     and Hymn(6) with it.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">8-
     Kelin`s Lugubrious Lament - Will Lull/Soothe the targeted mob.<br>
     Uses the Singing skill.<br>
     Analysis: A good song, it stops the targeted monster from ganging on you if
     you attack on of it's friends. Verant recently neutered this song a bit,
     and the duration is now very short. It's useful for pulling a monster from
     a camp without the rest coming along for the ride. In a camp of three
     monsters, you should be able to keep 2 lulled with this, while a party
     member pulls the third one away to a safe distance. If the mob resists,
     then it and all it's pals will come after you.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">9-
     Elemental Rhythms - Increases party member's Fire, Cold, and Magic
     resitances.<br>
     Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: I find most of the Rythms series of songs to be pretty useless,
     and haven't noticed much of a difference in my ability to resist. At one
     point the resistances were broken, but they are working now. I'd buy a
     piece of banded armor instead of this song, and buy it at a later point
     (when you have lots of cash).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">10-
     Anthem de Arms - Increases party member's STR and Attack Speed<br>
     Uses the singing skill.<br>
     Analysis: Your party will love this song, especially if you have a lot of
     tanks. It will increase STR (which is again not very useful until the
     higher levels); the real bonus is that it speeds your party's attack rate
     by about 15 percent. It will stack with Warsong(7), making it good for
     soloing, but not with Chant(1).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">11-
     Cinda's Charismatic Carillon - Adds the targeted NPCs faction to you.<br>
     Uses a wind instrument, can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: A useful song. If you cast it on an NPC vendor you can frequently
     get better prices (especially if they view you dubiously). Also useful for
     getting quests out of NPCs that view you indifferently (this will usually
     raise you to amiably).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">12-
     Brusco`s Boastful Bellow - Does DD to the target.<br>
     Uses the singing skill.<br>
     Analysis: A very useful song at lower levels, it can be compared to a
     warrior's Kick attack, in that you will be able to do additional damage per
     round. This is not a continuous song, you need to keep restarting it; as
     soon as the monster is hit by it, stop the song and sing it again - the
     extra time it takes for the song to stop is wasted time. You can use this
     song to kite monsters, although it takes a long time, although in a close
     fight, getting some distance with Selos(5) then bellowing while you are
     running away can be the difference between zoning and winning. You might
     want to juggle this song with Warsong(7).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">13-
     Purifying Rhythms - Increases party member's Poison, Disease, and Magic
     resitances.<br>
     Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: The second song in the Rhythms series. If you liked Elemental(9)
     then you'll like this song. It might stack with Elemental(9), but I can't
     remember for sure (that should show you how often i use it).</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">14-
     Lyssa's Cataloging Libretto - Identifies an item that you are holding.<br>
     Uses the singing skill.<br>
     Analysis: Broken right now, as there is nothing to identify. Supposedly at
     some point it will identify Lore that is associated with an item. Save your
     money on this one until there are items to identify.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">15-
     Kelin`s Lucid Lullaby - AE song that will put mobs to sleep for a short
     time<br>
     Uses a stringed instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: Sometimes useful, this song will put mobs in range to
     &quot;sleep&quot; so they don't attack you. It will also sometimes clear
     the monster's &quot;s-list&quot;, which is it's memory of who attacked it.
     I've found it useful on occasions, and too dangerous (like all AE songs) on
     others. Attacking the mob (or DoT damage) will wake it up. I've found that
     I have to sing this near continuously and can't juggle other songs with it.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">16-
     Tarew`s Aquatic Ayre - Gives underwater breathing to all party members.<br>
     Uses the wind skill, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: Breathing underwater is pretty fun, and can be useful for when
     your party wants to kill pirannas or aqua goblins. Since is the first wind
     song you are will get, you can use it to build up your wind skill (which
     you will want for Clouding(19)). This song works fine without a wind
     instrument; it's range might be increased with one but I haven't been able
     to notice a difference.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">17-
     Guardian Rhythms - Increases party member's Magic resitance and AC.<br>
     Uses a percussion instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: The last in the Rhythms series. You can juggle this with
     Elemental(9) but not Purifying(13) for a big Magic resitance boost. There
     is supposed to be a Spell Shield (absorb damage) effect as well, but it
     does not work.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">18-
     Denon`s Disruptive Discord - AE song that does DoT (Damage over Time).<br>
     Uses a brass instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: A good song in outdoor areas, carrying the same problems as other
     AE spells. In safe areas, it's better to use this than Bellow(12), as it
     will do more damage. It's the first brass song, so find a safe place (the
     Arena is good) where you can start singing and walk away from the keyboard
     for a few hours.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">19-
     Shauri`s Sonorous Clouding Grants your party invisibility.<br>
     Uses a wind instrument, it <u>cannot</u> be sung.<br>
     Analysis: The best song to go pull your corpse out with. Always keep a
     flute and a drum in the bank, so you can get them out to help retrieve your
     corpse. The range is not far, so if you are going to invis your party, they
     must all be near to you. Not very useful when your party is moving, but
     good when you are resting/medding and don't want someone to drop a train on
     you. In EQ, invisibility doesn't make you invisible to other monsters, it
     merely makes them view you with indifference. Monsters that you have
     already annoyed will not be effected, and will see right through the
     invisibility.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">20-
     Largo`s Melodic Binding - AE song that lowers non party member's Attack
     Speed and AC.<br>
     Uses the singing skill.<br>
     Analysis: This song mixes very well with Discord(18) and Anthem(10). It's
     an AE song, so caution must be used, but the combination of slower NPC
     attack speed (about 10 percent) and the party speedup of Anthem is pretty
     nice.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">21-
     Melanie's Mellifluous Motion - Will randomly teleport all party members.<br>
     Uses a wind instrument, but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: This song is pretty useless. If you are in a small room it's fun,
     as you will just pop up all over the room, but it's not much more useful
     than that. It's similar to the Shadow Step spell, but why teleport when you
     can outrun with Selos(5)?</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">22-
     Alenias Disenchanting Melody - Unknown effect<br>
     Uses a stringed instrument, <u>cannot</u> be sung.<br>
     Analysis: I haven't met anyone who has figured out what this song does yet.
     It doesn't cancel magic and it puts an icon in your effects list, although
     it is unclear why. It doesn't protect against charm, DoT, or DD spells,
     which leads me to believe it's broken.</font></p>
     <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">23-
     Selo's Consonant Chain - Lowers the target's Attack Speed and Movement
     Speed.<br>
     Uses the singing skill.<br>
     Analysis: A great song for use in fighting and in catching runners. The
     slowdown in attack speed is useful when you can't use Binding(20), and can
     be used the same way. The other benefit is that it slows down the target's
     movement speed, which makes it hard for them to run away (interestingly,
     you can completely stop their movement and they won't attack, unlike root).
     As well, it can be used to kite to an extent, although it tends to be
     resisted fairly frequently.<br>
     <br>
     24- Lyssa's Veracious Concord<br>
     Give party members Ultravision (and see invisible)<br>
     Uses a wind instrument, can also be sung.<br>
     Analysis: Not too exciting for half elves or elves, but the holy grail for<br>
     humans. Ultravision is even better than infravision, so it's fun to impress
     your human party members with; somewhat useless past it's novelty as a
     party trick tho, as it's a drag to keep people in range. Useful for killing
     the Froglok Warden (since he can fight while invisible) when you don't have
     a spellcaster to cast see invisible on you. This song will break Serpent
     Sight, in the same way that Selo's Accelerando breaks Spirit of the Wolf.
     You also cannot juggle this with Shauri's Sonorous Clouding, so forget
     about being able to see invis and be invis at the same time.<br>
     <br>
     25- Psalm of Warmth<br>
     Gives party members +35 Cold Resist, a couple AC, and a damage shield<br>
     Uses the singing skill.<br>
     Analysis: A great song, especially when your party is fighting multiple
     mobs at once. The cold resistance might be useful against ice shock and the
     like, but casters seem to always cast force strike on me instead. You get a
     couple AC from the song, nothing worthwhile really. The real plus is the
     damage shield. At level 25, it will do 5 dmg everytime a mob hits you or a
     party member, which makes it a great replacement for bellow (should you
     still be using it), since most mobs at this point have double attack and
     hit frequently.<br>
     <br>
     26- Angstlichs Appalling Screech<br>
     AE fear song<br>
     Uses a brass instument, can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: A song to look forward to. The AE radius of this song is very<br>
     small, probably limited to things you can hit or that can hit you
     (physically, not with spells). There are 2 uses for this song. The first
     being as an escape tool - just sing the song when your party is in trouble,
     when the mobs run away you will have a few seconds to get a head start
     running in the other direction. The second use is to fear-kite - juggle
     screech with chain [23] and walk behind the mob, smacking it as it runs
     away. This song seems harder to resist than many others, making it
     effective even when sung.<br>
     <br>
     Level 27: Solon's Song of the Sirens<br>
     Effect: Target Charm<br>
     Wind instruments but can be sung for lesser effect.<br>
     Analysis: As the song suggests, it's a targetted charm-song.&nbsp; Works<br>
     rather well and charms a target for around 10 seconds.<br>
     during this time, the taget will obey pet commands and thus<br>
     is effective for using the target to attack his friends, or<br>
     simply making him sit down and get out of your hair.&nbsp; The<br>
     song is probably more effective with a wind instrument,<br>
     causing the duration of the charm to last longer and the<br>
     resistances to be lower.</font><br>
