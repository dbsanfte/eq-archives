            </font>Several guides have been written on the Cleric class, so you may not see why
            another is needed. I have always felt that most guides are incomplete or give an overly
            simplistic definition of the life of a Cleric. I have also read too many times that it is
            not a fun or glorious life, but I totally disagree. So I decided to share my own views and
            impressions on the greatest healing class of Norrath. This guide is a good overall review
            of the class&#146; abilities, however it is not written for total newbies, so I will not
            take the time to explain the uses and level requirements of basic skills such as meditate
            or channeling. I will not give either any sort of walkthrough that is supposed, in theory,
            to help advance faster through the early levels. I will however explain in detail the
            various spells lines and abilities at our disposal.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For those who hadn&#146;t noticed it so far, Clerics are the best
            healers in EverQuest, they have access to more healing spells than any other class and at
            lower levels than others. During most of your career, except perhaps the lowest levels,
            your main duty will be to heal others and keep your group alive, if this does sound boring
            for you, I advise stopping reading here and creating a necromancer. It is true that it
            might not be the favorite path of most players, but it shouldn&#146;t be either. I believe
            most clerics belong to a different breed of players, a category of more social and helpful
            people, because these qualities are necessary to be successful in our profession. It is
            true that most of our time will be spent with the nose in our spell books trying to get
            mana, it is true that in the heat of battle, and our main spell will be healing. However,
            I dare anyone to tell me these heals are less needed than the warrior taking the blows or
            the wizard calling the elements to our help. Monks might get praise </p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that this has been said, lets begin, shall we? I will start by
            describing the abilities, strengths and weaknesses or the class. It should be noted that
            Clerics receive their spell circles, and their skills, at the same rate as the other
            priest classes, Druids and Shamans. First of all, if melee combat is important to you, I
            advise choosing a true melee class or an hybrid, because although they can wear platemail
            and wield some very good blunt weapons, Clerics in EverQuest are definitely not very
            strong in that aspect of things. They will hold their ground until about level 15 and
            remain able to take some hits and inflict some damage until about level 25. After that
            point, however, Clerics will become unable to be efficient at all in melee combat except
            maybe for short periods of tanking to take some heat off the main tanks. So, in the end,
            Clerics are pure casters, and their melee abilities are minimal. This is why Wisdom is by
            far more important than any other statistic for Clerics. The ability to wear platemail
            remains a true advantage though, as it allows you to wear tons of equipment that other
            casters cannot use, such as Adamantite epaulets.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, let&#146;s get to the interesting part: the spells. The first and
            main line of Cleric spells is the healing spells, from minor healing to complete healing,
            they are the main weapon in your arsenal. They allow you to keep yourself and your group
            fighting longer against the toughest monsters and live to see another day. Remember that
            healing will be your main duty through your life, so you have to know exactly how it
            works, know the casting times intuitively, etc. An important note is that heals works as
            AE taunts, and if you heal too much, monsters might aggro on you, causing a swift death if
            the warriors are not able to relieve you quickly. There is also a separate line that can
            heal your entire group, the Word of health series, that Clerics receive late in their life
            but that can be a lifesaver if used properly. Still in the healing lines, Clerics get the
            ability to cure poisons and diseases, which are useful but rarely vital except against
            some very powerful poisons. Perhaps the most needed of the healing abilities, that always
            makes high level clerics in high demand, are the revive lines that allows us to bring a
            fallen comrade back to his corpse, alive, and at higher levels, that also allows to
            restore some of the experience lost upon death. The healing abilities are indeed the most
            critical ones, especially at high levels, and they have lead some people to think that
            Clerics were only band-aids for their group. However an efficient use of the other
            abilities to our disposal can make us much, much more deadly for our foes&#133; and much
            more useful for our group.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second ability of Clerics, that is almost as important as healing,
            is buffing. Clerics receive three separate and stackable lines of buffing spells, as well
            as resistance buffs. First the main line, from Courage to Resolution will increase the HP
            and AC of the target, the most underestimated line, the Holy Armor line that increase the
            AC of your tanks and finally the costly Symbol line that requires to spend a precious
            stone everytime you use it, but that can add tremendous quantities of hit points to your
            tanks. The resistance buffs are also quite useful in specific situations but only the most
            patient or foolish of clerics will try to keep the 5 buffs on at all times on their entire
            party. Clerics also receive a self only combat buff, Yaulp, which is very useful,
            especially as an abjuration trainer, during the early levels, the upgrades are however
            much less useful since almost no melee battle is done at the levels where they are
            obtained. Since its somewhat of a buffing spell I will also speak on the Divine Aura and
            Divine Barrier spells here. These long recast time spells give you temporary
            invulnerability against everything but stuns for a short period of time. The upgrade,
            divine barrier also allows you to regenerate hp and mana while invulnerable at a fast
            rate. I keep these two spells memorized at all times, they saved my life, or sometimes my
            entire party, by allowing me to stay alive and keep healing, so many times that its not
            even funny. </p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let now see what offensive spells we have to our disposal: lets start
            with offensive spells. We have three lines of offensive spells, first, the VS. Everything
            DD spell, the strike-retribution line. Highly inefficient in most situations, especially
            in groups. Mostly used when soloing, which is definitely not the forte of a Cleric. The
            two other lines however are much more interesting: the VS. Undead line allows us to attack
            efficiently undead foes with mana/dmg ratios similar to those of a Wizard. It is not only
            useful when soloing but it&#146;s also worth using in groups, especially against undead
            casters to bring them to their knees quickly. In an undead dungeon, it gives us a purpose
            once we are full mana with everyone in good condition. The last but not least, there is
            the stun lines. Highly resisted but fast to cast and very useful in groups to give a few
            seconds of free beating to tanks, or to interrupt a caster in a DD that would have forced
            us to cast a greater healing spell. The re-cast time is slow, so a few clerics who can
            spare the slot keep several stuns memorized and chain cast them to keep casters stunned at
            all times. It is definitely an underrated line that I still use at level 50. I do not
            recommend trying to stun yellows or low reds though, unless they are MR de-buffed, the
            success rate would be ridiculously low.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I will explain the use of our crowd control spells. Although
            somewhat useless with an enchanter in the group, the spells could be of critical
            importance if you are the only one able to use them in the group. They include the fear
            series which allows you to make monsters run away for a short period of time to deal with
            their friends first, be warned that they may come back with friends though, very dangerous
            in a dungeon. Clerics also receive a VS. Undead variant of this line, spook the dead,
            which is more efficient but which can only be used against undead targets. Another vital
            line is the Lull line that allows a Cleric to calm some foes and make sure they will not
            harm you while you pass nearby or slaughter their friends. Finally, there is the root
            spell that could arguably fit in this category, it prevents a monster from moving. Snare,
            a druid/ranger ability is much more useful to prevent monsters from running, so no one
            should root if a member of one of these classes is present in the group.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clerics also receive a few utility spells, such as bind, gate, invigor
            stamina, reckless strength, etc. Useful in the correct circumstance, but not much more
            than that. Bind and Gate however are vital spells that can greatly reduce death downtime
            or increase the speed of selling trips to town.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you can see, the Clerics have a variety of spells available to them.
            Although their healing and buffing spells will always remain their main weapons, they
            aren&#146;t purely band aids in groups. If being the lifeblood of your group, the
            tide-turner, sounds exciting, the Cleric class is definitely for you. Some of our
            miscellaneous advantages are that we are always wanted in groups, we are always needed in
            Dragon and Planes raids and we have always a lot of fun if we like our job. We can also
            make a lot of friends very quickly. I have read that monks were praised for their pulls,
            warriors for the critical hits and wizards for their incredible blasts, well, personally
            I&#146;ve never seen anyone being praised as much as myself last time I menaged to get a
            complete heal off in time on a warrior who had fallen below 1/8 of a bubble of HP =) Being
            a Cleric have its glory, and people do realize how vital you are to them. That&#146;s by
            itself a very important satisfaction.</p>
            <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good luck young Clerics, go forward in the name of your Gods, and let
            nothing stand on your way until you stand at the top of the highest tower of the Plane of
            Air! </p>
