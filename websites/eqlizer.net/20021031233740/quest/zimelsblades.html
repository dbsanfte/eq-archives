            <td valign="top"><br>
            Zimel's Blades is one of the more long and interesting quests that a paladin will ever
            embark on. This is the quest that a player will need to complete in order to acquire <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/soulfire.html">Soulfire</a>. This quest guide
            is in no-nonsense style. The storyline will better present itself as you do the quest.<br>
            <br>
            1. You must first complete the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest/frepaltestimony.htm">Testimony
            of Truth</a> quest in Freeport. You will need this testimony to complete this quest.<br>
            2. Visit Kalatrina in the Hall of Truth(she is found upstairs on the balcony). She will
            give you a message to deliver to an agent in the Freeport militia. <br>
            3. Head to the Freeport Militia building. In the back(the courtyard area) of the Freeport
            Militia(underneath where the Captain who collects deathfist belts is) there is a guard
            named Alayle. He spawns right outside of the door. The problem is that he may not appear
            for a while. After he dies he will not return for several hours. Hail Alayle and tell him
            that, &quot;Truth is Good&quot;. He will then say something in response to you and you can
            hand him the letter. He will hand you back an encoded letter entitled &quot;Zimel's
            Blades&quot; and seconds later the Freeport Militia will slaughter him. (On a sidenote I
            have tried to save him before as the guards who come were green but other guards jumped in
            and he died anyway(and so did I)).<br>
            4. The quest is somewhat broken here. I believe that you are supposed to return the note
            to Kalatrina and she is supposed to hand it back to you. DO NOT hand her the note however
            as she will not give it back and you will have to do the 2nd and 3rd steps over again(and
            Alayle is a long spawn). Basically from doing the quest I can tell you that she will send
            you to the office of the people to talk to some lady who is tucked away in the back of the
            building. That lady will give you some more details on the quest. Since this is a no
            nonsense guide however I will inform you that you can completely skip that step if you
            don't want the information.<br>
            5. Go to Groflah's Forge(it's in the same zone as the paladins guild(North Freeport)). Go
            upstairs and find Groflah Steadirt. He may only be found here during the daytime so if you
            go and he is not here then wait for daytime to arrive. Ask him about Zimel's Blades or
            Ariska Zimel and he will become aggitated. Then hand him the Zimel's Blades note. He will
            then inform you that he can not talk her and to meet him at the Seafarer's Roost at night
            time and he will tell you more. <br>
            6. He will show up at the Seafarer's Roost(which can be found right next to the docks in
            Freeport) in the AM hours. He will be a bit more willing ot talk this time and will give
            you some background on the story.<br>
            7. Wait at the bar for a man named Tykar Renlin to show up. By him four Drom's Champagnes.
            They are lore items and are sold at the bar. You will have to feed him one at a time and
            then buy another until he gets the fourth in to his system. He will then hand you a
            blanket and give you a clue to Ariska Zimels location.<br>
            8. Before you go find Ariska Zimel you should first gather the components that you will
            need. You are going to have to use your brewing and cooking skills for this. Don't worry
            though the two items that you need are among the easiest to create and you can create them
            with 0 skill probably 25-50% of the time. The first item is Edible Goo and the second item
            is Bog Juice. It has been a couple of months since I have done this quest so I don't
            remember the recipe off hand they are both very simple to make however(requires items such
            as Fire Beetle Eyes, bat wings and water). Make sure to make a couple of each before you
            head down to visit Zimel.<br>
            9. Ariska Zimel is locked away underneath the Arena in Freeport(near warriors guild). You
            will find some prisons down there. There is a beggar looking character who is simply named
            a Prisoner. If you walk up to him and hand him one edible goo and one bog juice he will
            say something like, &quot;humph and goo and blankie too&quot;. That's how you know that it
            is the right person. Hand him one bog juice, one edible goo and the blanket that Tykar
            gave you at the bar and he will give you a key marked H.K. 102. <br>
            10. H.K. of course stands for High Keep(there's quite a few different High Keep keys in
            this game). You must take this key to the bank clerk in High Keep. In return you will get
            a letter which was meant to be delivered to Brother Hayle.<br>
            11. Brother Hayle can be found in Paw(a dungeon in the center of South Karana). Paw is a
            level 25-40ish dungeon now so it may be a deadly track for a low level paladin. You can
            buy some invisibility potions however and make it if you know your way around the
            dungeon(my paladin did this step solo at level 20). Brother Hayle can be found in a prison
            area. There is a lever which will open his cell. You must be very careful though to hand
            him the note quickly and step out of the cell. This cell will close behind you and you may
            become stuck if you do not. Brother Hayle will then ask you for several items in order for
            him to make you the Soulfire. He needs the hilt of Soulfire, the Brilliant Sword of Faith,
            the letter that he will give you back, and your Testimony of Truth(told you that you would
            need that).<br>
            12. The hilt of Soulfire can be found on Xichotl a troll shadowknight who roams around in
            Mistmoore. He's in his mid-upper 30's so be careful. It is NO DROP.<br>
            13. The <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/swordoffaith.html">Brilliant Sword
            of Faith</a> can be obtained via another Freeport quest. This is a one step quest however.
            What you need to do is kill Sir Lucan D'Lere(who resides in the Freeport Militia
            building). This is a daunting task. You will need someone who is not KOS to pull him out
            to near the gate. This person must pull him from range so that they do not get hit by him
            in the presence of any of the other guards. Make sure they have SOW on so they can get
            away quick. Smack Lucan and pull him outside. You will likely get him and two other guards
            so be sure to bring an enchanter to charm one of them. <br>
            <br>
            Lucan himself is a bad mofo(level 49). You will probably need two groups to pull this off
            though it's possible to do it with one group if you have a well balanced group(enchanter
            important). Lucan will drop his testimony(or should). Return this testimony to Valeron in
            the Hall of Truth and he will give you the Brilliant Sword of Faith.<br>
            14. Take your(not Lucan's) testimony of truth, the brilliant sword of faith, the hilt of
            soulfire, and the letter to Hayle back to brother Hayle and you will be rewarded.<br>
