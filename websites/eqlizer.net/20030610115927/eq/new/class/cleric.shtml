     <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clerics

     are the most powerful healers in all of Norrath. Clerics are the best class

     in the game at healing and buffing other players. The ability to cure

     diseases and protect players from other dangers is their prime domain.

     Clerics are the only class in the game who can ressurect the dead. They can

     banish undead in a with their mighty spells that can rival those of a

     wizard. When it is all said and done every party is always in need of a

     cleric.<br>

     <br>

     That having been said if you are considering a cleric you will need to know

     a few things up front. Do not be caught up by the fact that clerics can

     wear <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/plate.html">platemail</a>

     and wield <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/ogremaul.html">ogre war

     mauls</a>. If your primary reason for considering a cleric is because you

     believe they can fight well and also cast spells then get that idea out of

     your mind right away. In <a href="http://www.everquest.com">Everquest</a>

     clerics are not very strong on the meelee side of things. At lower

     levels(1-12) you may be able to stand toe to toe with your enemies healing

     yourself and getting away with it. However at higher levels the life of a

     cleric is one of a healer. Your duty in a group will be to heal, buff, and

     god forbid ressurect your team members. If this sounds like your kind of

     fun then a cleric is definately for you. If it does not excite you then you

     will probably be better off with another class.<br>

     <br>

     Clerics can don most armor up to and including platemail and they can use

     most blunt weapons. This makes them the best suited of the pure casters and

     priest classes when it comes to meelee. However cleric weapon skills only

     go up at a rate of 4 points per level in comparison to 5 points per level

     for a true meelee class. In addition to this clerics only gain one

     defensive skill that being dodge(at level 15). Clerics dodging skill maxes

     out at Very Good where a meelee classes dodging skill can raise much

     higher. In addition meelee classes gain parry, riposte and disarm. Meelee

     classes also receive double attack and in some cases duel wield, bash, slam

     and kick. This means that while clerics can fill in as a tank at higher

     levels they will not be able to actually meelee anything blue to

     death(unless they have a couple people healing and rooting for them and a

     lot of time to spare). This is not only a problem with clerics and combat

     but with all other casters other than hybrids.<br>

     <br>

     The ability to dawn powerful armor such as platemail is definately a plus

     but it also makes decisions tough on a cleric. Plate armor is extremely

     expensive. Clerics are the only non-hybrid casting class which has to not

     only buy spells but also has to save money up for plate mail at the higher

     levels. This can make a clerics life one of poverty.<br>

     <br>

     As with all other priest classes clerics gain the channeling skill at level

     4. Channeling allows you to regain your concentration and continue casting

     a spell if you have been hit in the middle of casting your spell. This does

     not always work and will work very seldomly at first. However it is a great

     skill and will save your life more than once at higher levels. It is

     important to remember to train at least one point in this skill after you

     reach level 4.</font>

     <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clerics

     also gain meditate at level 8. Once you get meditate your life will be much

     easier as you will have less downtime waiting to regain your mana. It is

     important to remember to train at least 1 point into meditation once you

     hit level 8 so you can begin practicing this great skill.<br>

     <br>

     The last skill which clerics attain is specialization at level 30.

     Specialization allows you to specialize in a particular school of magic.

     For example you can specialize in Evocation and be more powerful using your

     offensive spells. Most clerics will choose to specialize in Alteration or

     Abjuration which will allow them to be more efficient with their healing

     and buffing spells.<br>

     <br>

     Enough of this boring stuff let's get to the <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/spells/cleric.html">spell</a>

     breakdown:<br>

     <br>

     Clerics are the most powerful healers in the game. They generally get their

     healing spells one circle before other priest classes. Meaning that while

     druids and shamans must wait until level 19 to get the heal spell clerics

     will gain that spell at level 14. Clerics are also the only class in the

     game that gets the complete heal spell at level 34. This spell will be very

     important for fighting the highest level(45+) mobs in the game as it is the

     only spell or ability in the game that can heal a warrior completely at

     those levels.<br>

     <br>

     Clerics buffing spells are also very powerful. The main strength of a

     clerics buffing spells is the fact that there are three different lines

     that can be stacked. The courage-&gt;center-&gt;daring-&gt;etc line of

     spells adds both armor class and hit points. The holy armor-&gt;spirit

     armor-&gt;etc line of spells adds armor class. There is also a third line

     of spells the symbol of transal line of spells which grants additional hit

     points though this line requires a spell component. With the combination of

     these three buffs a cleric can buff a player to extremely high statistics

     that are unattainable with the buffs of any other class.</font></p>

     <p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 8px; MARGIN-RIGHT: 8px"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clerics

     have a very useful line of spells that begins with divine aura(at level 1).

     These spells grant the cleric total invulnerability for a brief period of

     time. I cannot tell you how many times these spells have saved my tail.

     This spell not only can be used for self evasion but also will allow you to

     remain confident in your ability to stay behind and heal your party members

     making sure that they all get out because you know that you can divine if

     things get bad. The higher level versions of this spell(including the level

     29 divine barrier) not only render you invulnerable but also regenerate

     your hit points and stamina.<br>

     <br>

     Clerics also feature a calming line of spells. These spells can be very

     useful inside of dungeons. Clerics never receive invisibility versus normal

     monsters(though at level 14 they do get invisibility to undead) but calm

     spells can be used as a substitute to invisibility if used carefully. Calm

     can also be used to limit the number of monsters that your group will have

     to face. Say for example you come up against 3 different monsters and your

     group has no chance of defeating all three. You could calm two of them and

     then pull the third out with a spell. Your group will now only have to

     fight one monster at a time. Be careful with these spells however becauase

     if the monster resists he will be very angry and will charge straight for

     you.<br>

     <br>

     As we mentioned at the beginning of this guide clerics are the only class

     in the game which can raise the dead. At level 29 clerics gain revive which

     basically teleports a player back to his corpse saving him a lot of travel

     time and potential danger. The level 39 and level 49 variants of the spell

     not only teleport the player to his corpse but also restore a portion of

     the experience that the player lost upon death. This is the one line of

     spells that truly gives clerics their own identity.<br>

     <br>

     Clerics are also mighty warriors against undead foes. Clerics offensive

     spells versus undead are by far the most powerful versus these beasts at

     the early levels. Necromancers also get these same spells but not until a

     circle after the clerics. Undead are plentiful in the game and frequent

     many dungeons including <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/befallen.html">Befallen</a>,

     <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/najena.html">Najena</a>, <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/unrest.html">Unrest</a>,

     and <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/lguk.html">The Ruins Of Old Guk</a>.

     If powerleveling is your game then you will be happy with a cleric if you

     stick to undead dungeons. At higher levels(24+) wizard spells begin to

     become just as efficient versus everything as clerics are versus undead.

     They never become more efficient than cleric spells they do however has a

     faster recast time. This means that clerics at higher levels will still be

     better than every other casters versus undead other than wizards and they

     will be close to them.<br>

     <br>

     Verus non-undead monsters cleric offensive spells could use a lot of help.

     There are three different lines of spells that work on all monsters.<br>

     <br>

     First there is the stun-&gt;holy might line of spells which stun your

     opponent for a brief period of time and do a small amount of damage. These

     spells are only really useful versus casters or runners and then they are

     only useful in a group. They have a long recast delay which limits their

     usefulness.<br>

     <br>

     The second line of offensive spells is the word of pain-&gt;shadow line of

     spells. These are person based area effect spells. Word of pain may allow

     you to take out low blues when you first receive it at level 9 however

     after that these spells are only really good for clearing hall trash. Only

     time you can actually use these spells to kill blue monsters is if you have

     several clerics all casting the same spells.<br>

     <br>

     The third line of offensive spells are the only ones that are really

     useful. This is the strike-&gt;smite-&gt;wrath-&gt;etc line of spells.

     These spells are the only thing that allows a cleric to be able to solo

     anything blue(non undead) post level 20. These spells have a pretty bad

     damage:mana ratio in comparison to the spells that other classes receive.

     They also briefly stun your opponent. One problem is not only the bad

     damage ratio but also the fact that they have a long recast delay. But by

     far the biggest problem with this line of spells is that they are few and

     far between. For example strike is totally useless around level 6 or so,

     smite becomes useless in the low 20s, and wrath is totally useless by

     around level 40. That having been said you will still be glad to have these

     spells as they do allow you to stand some kind of a chance against your

     foes and also are great for cleaning up running prey.<br>

     <br>

     One other glaring weakness in the cleric line of spells is the lack of

     utility spells. Clerics basically have two utility spells at their

     disposal. The first is the reckless strength line of spells. These spells

     are somewhat useful but they pale in comparison the a shamans spells. The

     second is the invigore line of spells which restore a players stamina.

     While this is useful you rarely have the extra mana to spend in a battle on

     restoring ones stamina.<br>

     <br>

     Now let's assume your convinced that you want to be a cleric. What race

     should you choose? As always I feel that race is purely a matter of

     personal playing style but some races are more suited for the task than

     others. My personal favorite pick would be a <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/race/dwarf.html">dwarf</a>.

     Dwarven clerics are good for several reasons. They have naturally high

     strength, stamina, and wisdom which are very important statistics for a

     cleric. The glaring weakness of a dwarven cleric lies in his agility. I

     would recommend you pour most of your training points into agility and give

     it at least a score of 80. Spread the rest between strength or wisdom.<br>

     <br>

     All in all I feel that clerics are a very good class and one that is

     neccessary in this game. There will always be a place for you in any group.

     However don't be surprised if at higher levels you become nothing more than

     a band aid. You will spend the majority of your time with your nose in the

     spellbook trying to meditate for mana. This is a challenge in itself as you

     try to balance the amount of mana at your disposal with a players need to

     get healed. It will take careful timing to get the most out of your mana

     and not waste any, all the while you may have some panicked tanks. If this

     is your idea of fun and challenge then a cleric is the class for you. If

     you would rathe be the disher of punishment then perhaps you should choose

     another class.</font><br>
