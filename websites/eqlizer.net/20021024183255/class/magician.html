          <tr>
            <td>This class guide was submitted by Bloodmoon.<font FACE="Arial"><p>Note: All opinions
            herein are the opinions of the Author, who is not responsible for any damages he may
            incur, etc., etc.</p>
            <p>Out of all classes in the game, Magicians are probably the most self-sufficient. At
            level 1 they can Summon Food and Drink, as well as being able to summon a Magical dagger.
            At level 4 they can summon bandages and their own tank (an elemental)! Magicians also do
            massive damage with their spells, second only to Wizards and occasionally Druids.</p>
            <p>I love the magician. While other classes are out spending money buying food and drink,
            you just summon it up (and laugh at them when they have to go in to town in the middle of
            a battle to get more). They also have some other nifty summon spells. With Summon Dagger,
            they can summon magical daggers. They're fairly good and can hit magical creatures.
            However, daggers in general don't do much damage. If you're just figuring on being a
            &quot;nuker&quot; (sitting back and pounding guys with spells), then you're probably going
            to use these for the extra things to put in your other hand that add to mana and
            intelligence. However, I consider magicians the &quot;Warrior Mage&quot; because they have
            their tanks and great damage spells, so I like to use staffs. Staffs do more damage
            (though they're slower) and sometimes have benefits (like the Runed Totem Staff), but are
            more expensive in general.</p>
            <p>They do have more summon spells than that, though! At level four they can summon
            bandages, which is very nice for spellcasters. Spellcasters generally have low hit points,
            and so in a few hits from a monster they get down fairly low. While Bind Wounds (the skill
            that uses Bandages) can only heal you up to 1/2 life, it still helps you recover quicker.
            Also, bandages can help bring in extra income for low level characters. At level 8 they
            get Dimensional Pocket which summons a bag, but when you log out the bag dissapears (like
            all Summoned items) and everything inside of it dissapears! This is a <i>major</i> bummer
            if you get disconnected. Also, Magicians generally have low strength and thus can't hold
            much on them anyways, and two backpacks (about 1pp 2gp) are all you'll really need. After
            that I'll let you discover for yourself but here's a hint: Magicians start to get summon
            magic items that can give you extra abilities, like make you fly or give you Ultravision.</p>
            <p>Ah, and what would the Magician be without it's pets? Pets are the backbone of the
            Magician. These let you solo up to a medium level (I'm soloing at 25), and save your butt
            when you need to run. You get four elementals every level, but can only have one out at a
            time. The first is the Earth Elemental. The Earth Elemental has a high strength
            (comparable with that of an Ogre) and thus has massive hit points and does the least
            amount of damage. The Fire Elemental has low hit points, but has O'kiels Radiation cast on
            him, which is a Wizard damage shield (when something hits him, it takes damage). The Fire
            Elemental also does the most amount of damage. The Air Elemental does the the second most
            amount of damage and is hard to hit because of a high agility. In addition, it casts a
            spell that makes it even <i>harder</i> to hit, when not fighting, casts invisibility on
            itself, and with it's attack spell stuns the opponent. However, in my experience they die
            too quickly to be of any use as a tank (which is mostly what you'll use them for unless
            you like grouping). The last is my favorite, the Water Elemental. The Water Elementals are
            the middle of the class Elemental. They do a medium amount of damage but have second most
            amount of life of any elemental. All elementals have a regeneration rate better than that
            of a Troll. Also, you might want some commands for those pets of yours:</p>
            <p>/pet follow me</p>
            <p>They automatically do this. They follow you around and generally be a nusince.</p>
            <p>/pet kill</p>
            <p>The pet attacks the selected creature if it can.</p>
            <p>/pet sit down</p>
            <p>The pet sits down in one place and won't move unless you're attacked.</p>
            <p>/pet guard me</p>
            <i><p>Don't</i> use this! The pets will attack random things <i>including</i> your races
            town guards!</p>
            <p>And add to all this great damage spells. They have extremely efficient spells (the mana
            to damage ratio), but they don't get a new direct damage spell every new rank. Sometimes
            they get a Rain spell instead. Rain spells will damage you and your pet (if you damage
            your pet too much, it will attack you =P), but hurt a radius of creatures. It will
            generally do 3 waves of damage, like it will &quot;rain&quot; down first 25 damage then a
            few seconds later another 25 damage, then a few seconds later <i>another</i> 25 damage.
            Great in groups, but it really turns monsters on you.</p>
            <p>The races that can be this class are the Dark Elf, Erudite, Gnome, High Elf, and Human.
            Humans have the lowest natural intelligence. Dark Elves and High Elves both have obscenely
            low Strength, but have a high Agility and have a fairly high Intelligence. High Elves are
            slightly less intelligent that Gnomes and Dark Elves 1 point more. Gnomes, however, have a
            lousy Charisma where High Elves have a fairly high one. Erudites have most of their scores
            crappy but are naturally <i>very, very</i> intelligent and are fairly wise, too.<br>
