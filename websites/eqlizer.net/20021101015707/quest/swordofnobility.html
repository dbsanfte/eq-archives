              <p>You say, 'I seek enlightenment'</p>

              that you are looking for something more than just enlightenment.
              Perhaps you are looking for a [sword] crafted by a noble man.</p>
              <p>You say, 'What sword?'</p>
              <p>Ryshon Hunsti says 'It is not just a sword my friend. It is
              much more than that. This sword carries with it a special [power],

              <p>You say, 'What power?'</p>
              <p>Ryshon Hunsti says 'It is an instrument fashioned together by
              noble man. It is said to be blessed by the gods themselves. Only a
              man whose bloodline comes from nobility may wield it. Do you seek

              with me as I tell you a tale. A tale about a true friend of mine,
              a great man known as [Amstaf Trunolis].</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You gain experience!!</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'Who is Amstaf Trunolis?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Kanthuk Ogrebane says 'Amstaf Trunolis was
              a good man. I've followed him into [battle] many times. We've seen
              many of our friends die by the sword of others.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What battle?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Kanthuk Ogrebane laughs. 'I remember the
              first time we charged into battle. I was so scared. My hands
              wouldn't stop trembling. Amstaf pulled me off to the side before
              the initial attack began. He held my hands within his. I saw his
              hands begin to glow and felt his energy pass into me. I felt
              [courage].'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What courage?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Kanthuk Ogrebane says 'I'll never forget
              what he did for me that day. He gave me the courage to continue.
              No one's ever done anything like that for me. I vowed that day
              that I'd follow him into any battle. I'd be there fighting
              alongside him, no matter what. As time went on we came across an
              elven woman named [Ambreen].</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'Who is Ambreen?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Kanthuk Ogrebane says 'Ambreen was younger
              than he and I. She knew of the powers of nature. She was able to
              control the rain which fell from the heavens and would call upon
              the spirits to aide her. It was obvious that Amstaf took a liking
              to Ambreen. She ended up coming along with us on our crusades. The
              last that I saw of Ambreen was when we went to the snow covered
              lands of Everfrost. We were wandering the lands when a freak
              [snowstorm] hit us. We were separated from one another for quite
              some time.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What snowstorm?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Kanthuk Ogrebane says 'I don't know where
              it came from, but it was so sudden that it caught us all off
              guard. The snow quickly became unbearable. I tried to move to
              higher ground, but was unable to. I was stuck within the snowy
              confines. I didn't know what to do [next].</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What happen next?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Kanthuk Ogrebane says 'As I laid there my
              body began to slowly freeze. I knew death was near and accepted
              the inevitable. Suddenly I felt something clutching at my cloak. I
              was being dragged upwards out of the snow. A hand pressed against
              my chest and began to glow. I felt energy pass into my body. Do
              you know [how] he had saved me?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'How did he save you?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Kanthuk Ogrebane says 'He saved my life by
              laying his hands upon my body. A few moments later we found
              Ambreen lying in the snow, her body frozen by the harsh
              surroundings. We lifted her up off the ground and began to look
              for [shelter].</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What shelter?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Kanthuk Ogrebane says 'We ended up taking
              refuge within a deserted cabin not to far from our location. We
              knew that we didn't have much time left to bring life back to her
              body. However, the storm didn't pass through and we knew we
              couldn't venture to far without the fear of freezing. I warmed the
              cabin and rested for some time thinking about what we were going
              to do. It wasn't long before my exhaustion took over. I fell into
              a deep [slumber] that night.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What slumber?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Kanthuk Ogrebane says 'That night I dreamt
              of many things. Random thoughts kept swirling around my mind. I
              kept seeing the image of a cloaked being and of Amstaf circled
              around a fire. I saw Ambreen's body convulsing above the fire as
              if life was being brought back to it. I don't know what happen
              that night. I don't even know if what I dreamt was real, but
              before I awoke I saw a [strange image].</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What strange image?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Kanthuk Ogrebane says 'I saw Amstaf lower
              his head and walk away in silence. He was surrounded by two beings
              carrying a torch. I don't know what it meant, but I swear it was
              so real. When I awoke both Amstaf and Ambreen were gone. Please
              find Llara and give this pendant to her. This pendant belonged to
              Amstaf. She too had a vision that night that may clear things up.
              If she asks where you got it from mention my name.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Next you need to find Llara she is
              standing on a rock outside of Unrest</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Llara says 'Oh my! This belongs to Amstaf.
              Where did you get it?</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You gain experience!!</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'kanthuk gave it to me'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Llara says 'I take it you're here to find
              out more about [Amstaf].'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'Who was Amstaf?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Llara says 'I've known Amstaf since he was
              a child. We grew up in the same city together. Ever since I've
              known him there's always been something [unusual] about him.'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What was unusual?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Llara says 'When we were growing up we
              used to venture outside the city gates. Some times we would
              encounter a wandering ghoul or an undead spirit of some sort. He
              was always able to quickly dismiss the undead being with very
              little effort. I [learned] many things growing up with Amstaf.'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What did you learn?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Llara says 'Amstaf told me many things
              when we were younger. Once Amstaf told me that life isn't about
              how you get there, it's about where you end up. I miss my dear
              friend. Its been a long time since I've seen him. The night of the
              snowstorm I dreamt about him. I remember seeing Amstaf's face. I
              saw something I've never [seen] before.'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What did you see?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Llara says 'I saw desperation. I spoke to
              many people who knew Amstaf trying to find out if anyone heard
              anything about that night. No one knew anything about it. When I
              had reached the dwarven hunting grounds I ran into a woman named
              Walnan. She kept rambling on and on about the power of the Orb and
              something about Magi`kot. I didn't understand what she was saying.
              She didn't know anything about my situation either, but she did
              tell me that there were others that may be able to help me. She
              told me that I should find [Ruathey].'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'Who is Ruathey?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Llara says 'Ruathey is known for her
              ability to look into people's souls and find truth. Though I
              wasn't able to find Amstaf, I was able to recover his sword. I
              believe that by having his sword I am closer to finding him. Take
              this note to Ruathey and tell her that I sent you.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Next you find Ruathey she is in Lavastorm,
              near the Nek zone, a lil to the west</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'Hail Ruathey'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Ruathey says 'Hello Chork .'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Ruathey says 'I see that you've spoken to
              Llara. She too came to me looking for Amstaf. Though she wasn't
              able to find her friend, she was able to recover his [sword].</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You gain experience!!</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What sword?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Ruathey says 'I've heard stories about a
              holy sword. There are many rumored to be hidden all throughout the
              world, yet only a few have actually been found. Amstaf had one of
              these swords. It is known for its ability to dismiss the undead.
              Perhaps by having this sword it'll bring you closer to finding
              your friend. Gather a ghoul's heart, Amstaf's Scroll, the Blade of
              Nobility, a noblemans hilt and place them in this [bag].'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">You say, 'What bag?'</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Ruathey says 'Take this bag and gather the
              items I've mentioned. I've been told that the Ghoul's Heart can be
              found in the estate of the undead, while the scroll can be found
              in the Keep not far from the Karanas. One of the others are
              rumored to be found near the dwarven city among the goblins. While
              the last should be found in the caverns of Najena.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">For those of you who haven't figured it
              out, you will need to go to ButcheBlock, HighKeep, Unrest, and
              Najena.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Your target is Crazed Ghouls in unrest</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana">Your target is Crazed Goblins (possibly
