	<div class="entryHeading">Recruitment</div><p>An important message from our Membership Officer Lancelac:<blockquote>Endorean has decided to increase it's ranks and thus will an organize an expedited application and flagging process to do so. We would rather backflag many people at once instead of a few at a time, since we hate backflagging with a passion =P. <br /><br />For the next week (until August 10th) we will be taking applications and starting immediately afterward, will be doing a FULL backflagging run as quickly as possible. Please see the below set of points for important details.<br /><br />ACTIVE PLAYERS ONLY<br /><br />For your application to be considered you must be a VERY ACTIVE PLAYER. Endorean raids every day, so you should will willing and able to raid a minimum of 4 days a week, and pretty much every time you are online during raid hours (approx 7 EST til 12 EST). You CAN'T miss any major flags due to lack of attendence or you will be dropped from the application process, although it will be allowable to have a friend or Endo box your char with PRIOR approval. In addition, during the first 2 month as an Endorean member, you MUST earn at least 50 percent of all possible DKP to remain in the guild.<br /><br />SHORTENED APPLICATION PROCESS<br /><br />Our application process has been shortened for this round of recruiting, but we still retain high standards of personal behavior and game skill. <br /><br />Those accepted to the application pool will be allowed to raid without a sponsor, but you must find one before the flagging reaches Rallos Zek to be allowed to continue. This does not mean you should spam random Endo for sponsorship, but it does require some social skill and demonstration of the ability to play your class, want to learn and follow directions. <br /><br />Normally, 35 YES votes are required for Endo membership, but during this process that number will be reduced to 25. Endorean members can still vote NO though and all NO votes are taken very seriously and investigated. Even 1 NO vote can halt your membership application. <br /><br />BACKFLAGGING<br /><br />As indicated above, after we gather and review the applications, backflagging will begin on approximately 8/11. There will be no set schedule for individual flags since we don't know what will be up on what particular day. DO NOT MISS ANY FLAG YOU NEED. In addition, even if you have a given flag, you should show up (see the first paragraph on active players) if at all possible.<br /><br />WHAT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR APPLICATION<br /><br />1. Information about your character. Class, guilds you've been in, other characters you played or still play, equipment, AAs etc. Be truthful and reveal anything you think people might care about, even if negative. <br /><br />2. Why you want to join Endo and why you play EQ.<br /><br />3. Which Endo members you already know.<br /><br />4 SEND APPLICATIONS TO <a href="mailto:endorean_apps@yahoo.com">endorean_apps@yahoo.com</a>. Also, feel free to contact me (Lancelac) in game. I am often swamped, so keep trying. <br /><br />You don't need to write a book, but your application should show serious effort. For those of you who don't already know many Endorean, this is all most people will have to go on when they evaluate you as a candidate.<br /><br />APPLICANT REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />1. Must be level 65 (pretty much no exceptions)<br /><br />2. Equipment - You don't need uber equipment, but you do need to be interested in it. Your equipment makes you more useful to the guild, and that is extremely important.<br /><br />3. AAs - Each class has it's set of "gotta have" AAs. You should have them or be well on your way. I could detail them here, but this post is already long enough. Needless to say, if you don't have 100+ AAs this is an area you will need to work on immediately.<br /><br />4. Overall you must be an upstanding member of the Luclin community. If you post all the time on F&R, argue with people in /ooc, or engage in generally juvenile behavior, Endorean is not for you.<br /><br />CLASS NEEDS<br /><br />Bard - Medium<br />Beastlord - Medium<br /><em>Cleric - Medium High<br /><strong>Druid - High</strong></em><br />Enchanter - Medium Low<br /><em>Magician - Medium High<br /><strong>Monk - High</strong></em><br />Necromancer - Medium<br />Paladin - Medium Low<br />Ranger - Medium<br />Rogue - Medium<br />Shadowknight - Medium<br />Shaman - Medium Low<br /><em>Warrior - Medium High</em><br />Wizard - Medium<br /></blockquote><br>

	<div class="entryHeading">Coirnav the Avatar of Water</div><p>This right here is the reason I have not posted anything since our post-change Rallos... I'm not sure on the specifics but I understand we are at least the 6th or 7th guild to do this mob.<br><p><center><img src="coirnav/coirnav.jpg"></center><br><p>Loot was amazing... Congratulations Rezgard for these two:<br><p><center><img src="coirnav/coirnav_shoulder.jpg"></center><br><p><center><img src="coirnav/greaves.jpg"></center><br><p>Also, grats Saijo, this next loot is absolutely amazing:<br><p><center><img src="coirnav/belt.jpg"></center><br><p>Sadly, we are pretty behind on Xegony. Due to countless problems with getting Avatars to spawn in Air, we had to wait until this last patch day for a clean reset before we got our first 3 Xegony keys. I assure you, she will die soon. Still, we are doing pretty well for a guild with a "lame ankle" for just doing Vex Thall twice...<br>
