    <p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>This week's topic:</strong></font><font color="#800000"> </font><font
    color="#000000"><strong>Miscellaneous ramblings, including &quot;How to be a Troll&quot;
    tips from your favorite Half-Elf, Bixby</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Before I get into the main issues, I just wanted to say
    thank you to everyone who participated in the guild Bazaar on May 21, and also who
    participated in Kirena and Cinin's wedding that evening.&nbsp; The Bazaar raised about
    1700pp total just from items donated to the guild for sale.&nbsp; We also made some good
    money on the kissing booth and had a lot of fun with the everjack tables and lottery.
    &nbsp; And though it was tough for some of us to go -- because we all consider her to be
    our own ;) you are all to be commended for attending the wedding and forwarding your
    congratulations to the couple throughout the game.&nbsp; I know that Kirena personally had
    a wonderful time and it made the event just that much more happy for her to have all of us
    there to cheer her on.&nbsp; And it appears that love has laid the smackdown on quite a
    few people this week, Doomie and Braina, Driz and Kil... hopefully I can get some more
    wedding cakes flown in from the beautiful customer service department.&nbsp; If that
    doesn't work, well, I'm quite good at making edible goo now so I'll be happy to provide
    you all with the gooiest edibles you've ever had the chance not to enjoy.</strong></font></p>
    <p><font color="#008040"><strong>Being mostly of the elven variety, you might think that
    my little help section this time on how to be a troll is way off base.&nbsp; Wrong-O my
    friends.&nbsp; Having adventured much throughout the lands I've seen trolls... plenty of
    them, and I know what they all do to be the best characters they can be.&nbsp; However, I
    cannot promise that this information won't be hard hitting and accurate, so I must put
    forth this notice:</strong></font></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="http://www2.50megs.com/keeperoflife/offensive.jpg" width="260"
    height="169" alt="offensive.jpg (20035 bytes)"></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font color="#008000">Right, now with that out of the way, let's
    continue.&nbsp; If you're not quite catching on to the troll-like ways, this will surely
    give you some good ideas.&nbsp; The first rule of being a troll is that you are your own
    best friend.&nbsp; Sad, but true, you're no Cindy Crawford or Tom Cruise, and with the
    B.O. of a dumpster on trash day, you just aren't going to attract flocks of folks with
    your charisma.&nbsp; So since you don't have to worry about impressing others, let's see
    what you can stop doing now to start saving time and gold and start getting on with your
    adventuring life.</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font color="#008000">Tip: Soap is VERY overrated.&nbsp; You don't
    need it!&nbsp; In fact, some trolls I know have contests going to see how long they can go
    without touching water.&nbsp; The dirtier the better!&nbsp; It might even keep the baddies
    away from you if their eyes start watering within 100 feet of where you're standing.
    &nbsp; Never swim and for Pete's sake if it starts raining go inside.&nbsp; Water's for
    drinking, and even then if you can find some nice Ogre Swill instead that would be much
    better.</font></strong></p>
    <p align="center"><img src="http://www2.50megs.com/keeperoflife/soap.jpg" width="115"
    height="238" alt="soap.jpg (8415 bytes)"></p>
    <p align="center"><em>Soap, Lose it, don't Use it!</em></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>Next Tip:&nbsp; Scratch your butt - A LOT!
    &nbsp; It could be just evolution that has made the brains of the larger folks move south
    the the rear end region, causing the instinctual &quot;scratching of the head&quot; when
    puzzled effect.&nbsp; Or it could just be that being so large trolls and ogres are always
    picking pieces of squished dwarves off of their pants.&nbsp; Whatever the cause, butt
    scratching is a MUST.&nbsp; Do everything in your power to get an itchy rear.
    &nbsp; Whether it be using a lot of public restrooms or playing &quot;shake your
    booty&quot; with a festering hag, do it!&nbsp; It's the law.</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>You might be saying now &quot;But Bixby, how
    can trolls be so repulsive yet still look so suave in the eyes of our fellow race?&quot;
    -- to which I say homemade plastic surgery.&nbsp; Yes, remember your little elven mothers
    and fathers saying to you &quot;Don't run with that or you'll poke your eye out!&quot;?
    &nbsp; Troll parents tend to give knives, ice picks, and sharp sticks to their babies
    instead of rattles and teddy bears.&nbsp; If you can run around with a short sword and
    poke your eye out, scar your face, or give yourself accidental open heart surgery, then
    you, my friend, are one sweet looking troll!&nbsp; Look out for those hot troll chicks --
    they will come running, I guarantee!</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>Lastly, but certainly not least of all, eat.
    &nbsp; You cannot be a troll and be as thin as a dark elf.&nbsp; It's not going to happen.
    &nbsp; Eat anything that comes into range.&nbsp; Chunks of meat, berries, bread, gnomes.
    &nbsp; Slightly more than a mouthful, those gnomes are good fat sources -- and tasty when
    served with BBQ sauce.&nbsp; Save the nose for that special someone... all that fat and
    crispy goodness... mmmmm.&nbsp; Pardon me :)&nbsp; I know what I'll be cooking tonight ;)</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>Start using these tips and the rest should
    follow quite nicely.&nbsp; </strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#008000"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font color="#0080C0"><strong>I've noticed something about bards lately.
    &nbsp; Guards could care less if you kill a bard NPC in any town area.&nbsp; Why is that?
    &nbsp; Is it the constant singing that makes the guards happy to look away while we try to
    shut the bards up by bashing their lutes over their heads?&nbsp; Are bards part of some
    major underground crime scheme that the guards are powerless against but are happy to see
    be destroyed?&nbsp; Bard maffia!&nbsp; Are bard the brutes in the game that are extoring
    money and goods from the innocents?&nbsp; Hmmm... more details later as I continue my
    research.&nbsp; So far I can kill bards in Rivervale and Highkeep with no resistance from
    outside.&nbsp; Though try to slice up a normal merchant and look out or you'll be guard
    fodder.&nbsp; There's just GOT to be something to this that I'm missing.&nbsp; Comments
    and suggestions welcomed -- and if there is anything about the game you'd like me to
    research and write about, e-mail me at: <a href="mailto:jmsteen@havilandtelco.com">jmsteen
    @havilandtelco.com</a> and I'll get right on it!</strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font color="#FF00FF">That's it for today kids!&nbsp; Be safe out
    there while adventuring, be kind to those you meet along the way.&nbsp; And by all means,
    make friends!&nbsp; They are a valuable resource indeed.&nbsp; Whether you need someone to
    find your corpse, or just someone to talk to about life, you can never have too many
    friends.</font></strong></p>
