<div align="left"> 

<p>I'm an under served part of the Massively Multi-player Online 
Game (MMOG) player-base. I'm not a large part, and you'd be a 
fool to base your whole game around me. But I think I'd make a 
welcome addition to your bottom line. Evidence suggests that I 
don't cost a lot to support and that I tend to stick around when 
I find a game that I like. I also add to your game in other, less 
tangible, ways. But you'll have to decide what those intangibles 
are worth. 

<p>I'm also a fairly untapped market. It's been a few years since 
a game has come out that even attempted to attract me. Many of 
my members have never played a MMOG. We like simulations that 
deal with people: SimCity, Railroad Tycoon, Capitalist Pig, The 
Sims. The type of game where we're "making a name for ourselves" 
without a lot of violence. Most of us don't even know there are 
games like that with other real people playing. When many of these 
potential players of your game hear "multi-player" they think 
Quake. Show us that there's more available. 

<p>Some game developers have even told me that I'm not welcome in 
their game: 

<blockquote><i>
<b>Shadowbane:</b> "We don't play games to bake bread, we 
play them to crush!" <br>
<b>Legends of Kesmai:</b> "Tired of making furniture? Want some real 
monsters to fight?"
</i></blockquote>

<p>That's fine. In fact, I appreciate knowing ahead of time that 
there won't really be much in your game of interest to me. It's 
certainly better than being lead to believe that there will be 
something and then being disappointed. It's better for these developers 
as well, because it keeps me from spreading disparaging reviews 
of their game. 

<p>Because of Shadowbane's ad we rally around "baking" as our catchphrase. 
I've also called myself by the more generic --and more accurate-- 
term: "crafter". You see, it's not just bread I want to bake.I 
also want to bake armor and dresses, phasers and chairs, scrolls 
and steam engines, swords and plow-shears, blasters and potion. 
I want to bake bread and anything else that is a relevant item 
for me to bake in your game. 

<p>There are a few other things that you'll need to keep in mind 
to keep me as part of your player base. They are pretty obvious, 
and if you've thought about attracting me as a customer, then 
you've probably thought of most of these already. I'm just listing 
them in case you missed one or two: 

<ol>
<li> The things I make have to be desirable to at least some of 
the other players of your game. They should not be necessary 
for all other players (I know some of your other players have 
little or no use for me) but they should be useful to all of 
your players. Note that useful might also mean pretty, interesting 
looking, and so forth in this context. <br>
<br>
<li> It should be possible for me to reach the same status --fame, 
loot, rank, level, gold...(whatever you use)-- as other segments 
of your player-base (Monster Hunters, Explorers, Player Killers, 
Role Players...). But it is certainly reasonable to take into 
account the amount of risk involved in the reward. Standing 
next to a forge is certainly much safer than killing a Klingon. 
Mining may or may not be. <br>
<br>
<li> I want to be able to enjoy the other parts of your game too. 
I know that I won't be as effective as a sergeant or wizard 
at fighting, but I want to be able to develop some of those 
abilities. At least let me develop them enough to explore the 
game that you created and occasionally adventure with my less 
mundane friends. <br>
<br>
By the same token, I have no problem with other players who 
want to bake a little bread, but they should not be as good 
as someone who devotes more time and effort to it. <br>
<br>
<li> As much as I like the idea of the items I make having a permanent 
place in your world, it's more important to me in the long run 
that your economy works. With that in mind, don't forget to 
include mechanisms for the items I create to: age / break / 
be consumed / need repairs / need recharging / decay / wear 
out / or whatever seems appropriate in your game. <br>
<br>
<li> It should be easy enough to buy goods from me that other 
players do not feel that they need to create mules to ensure 
that they have an adequate supply of the bread I bake. <br>
<br>
It should also be expensive enough to become a good baker that 
it is not cost effective to make a mule to produce bread for 
just one player. This cost does not have to be just in terms 
of shekels. I also consider the time that I have invested as 
part of that cost. <br>
<br>
<li> Baking bread need not be a complected "sub game" that takes 
a lot of time for you to program. In fact, most of my members 
are at least as interested in using and/or selling what they 
make as they are in the process of making it. <br>
<br>
But they don't want the baking to be tedious either. If someone 
wants 100 apple pies then there should be a way for them to 
make the pies without getting Carpel Tunnel Syndrom. They understand 
that this has to be "balanced" (perhaps with higher failure, 
less ability gain or lower quality pies) that's okay with them. 
<br>
<br>
<li> If you are interested in making a more involved "subgame" 
for baking then many of us would find it enjoyable. But --in 
deference to those of us who would not-- it should probably 
be optional. If recipes are needed to make sweet rolls, let 
us sell those recipes to players who do not enjoy the "research 
subgame". Those of us who are not interested in a particular 
"subgame" understand that this too needs to be balanced in some 
way. <br>
<br>
<li> The economy in your game has to work. Your players have to 
have enough money that the most expensive things we can make 
are within reach of and useful to-- at least some of them. By 
the same token, your players cannot have so much money that 
our lesser goods --those made by new bakers-- sit on the shelves 
and prevent new bakers from enjoying your game. <br>
<br>
<li> Our cost to produce things has to scale well. It doesn't 
work for our cheapest goods to cost 10 shekels to make and for 
our most expensive goods to cost 40 shekels to make. Everyone 
will buy the 40 shekel variety and those that cannot yet make 
the 40 shekel variety will not sell anything. The necessary 
cost difference will depend on how scarce shekels are in your 
game. Keep in mind that the scarcity of shekels will change 
over time, and adjustments may be needed. <br>
<br>
<li> Help us diversify. If every baker in your game is exactly 
the same we'll be bored, and the things we make will be viewed 
as commodities. Those things will cause us to quit playing your 
game sooner. We would rather be able to strive to be one of 
a few who are the best at baking a particular cuisine than to 
be among hundreds who are all equally "the best" at baking everything. 
We're okay with having limits on what we can make, or the quality 
of what we make based on our choices in the game. We don't necessarily 
like it, but we'll put up with it, because the alternative is 
worse. <br>
<br>
<li> We don't like competition from your game servers. If you 
don't spawn computer controlled characters to go out and kill 
monsters, then you should not spawn computer controlled characters 
to go out and sell things that are substantially the same as 
the stuff we make. <br>
<br>
However, we do understand that you will want to have computer 
controlled characters sell some items that are craftable --that's 
no problem-- but please do so in a way that does not make it 
impossible for new bakers to get started in their profession. 
This can be done by differentiating the items made by players 
and servers in terms of price, availability and/or quality. 
<br>
<br>
<li> We don't like selling things to computer controlled characters. 
Those people who bake bread and sell it to computer controlled 
characters for money are not us. They are just looking for easy 
shekels without risk and without interacting with your other 
players. But you have to understand that if you want this to 
work then our lesser skilled members have to be able to make 
something that is useful and desirable to the other lesser skilled 
members of your player-base (see 9 above). <br>
<br>
<li> We hope you can devise some way that we can advance our skill 
without requiring us to make 10,000 widgets. It's not that we 
dislike making (and selling) widgets, it's just that we tend 
to flood the market if that's the only way for us to advance. 
We really can't help ourselves; we like to gain skill like anyone 
else. But we do know that flooding the market isn't good for 
anyone. Please give us a way to avoid that. <br>
<br>
<li> It's probably not a good idea for us to become increasingly 
more efficient at producing relatively low level items. It is 
certainly nice for the egos (and purses) of crafters with high 
ability, but it tends to lower the price of items to the point 
where crafters of lesser ability are forced to sell their products 
at a loss if they want to sell them at all. This then urges 
everyone to strive solely for the quickest advancement to the 
highest (ie profitable) abilities instead of enjoying your game 
at each stage as they come to it. <br>
<br>
<li> The amount of time it takes us to bake a few cakes should 
not depend on how quickly we can click our mouse button; it 
should not depend on how fast our connection to your game is; 
it should not depend on how advanced our macro program we use 
is. Characters with the same traits, abilities, equipment and 
raw materials should take the same amount of time to whip up 
some cakes. Please don't make us into "twitch bakers". <br>
<br>
<li> When you're writing your game, give some though to expanding 
crafting in the future; then don't forget us entirely. We tend 
not to be as vocal as some of your player- base, and the additions 
need not be large. But they will encourage us to keep playing, 
and let us know you're listening. We generally think it's more 
important to tweak things to make them both balanced and useful 
than it is to add new things. <br>
<br>
<li> Find some way to let us know about your game. There's a chance 
we'll stumble across it on our own, but you can increase that 
greatly by letting us know you've done these things. No one 
is marketing their game to us now. In fact, some games clearly 
don't want us baking bread anywhere near their players. We don't 
expect a major marketing campaign, but if you do some of the 
things listed above let us know so we can try them out. 
</ol>
<p>The next game to really try to support our "style of play" will 
not only gain many loyal players, but will also be enhancing the 
quality of their player-base. Not many kewl doodz bake bread. 
<p>Thanks, and we look forward to playing your game.
