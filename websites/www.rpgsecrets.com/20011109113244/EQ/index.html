      <p> The Unauthorized Secrets of
      EverQuest first came out in August of 1999 and started with only 50 pages
      and a great idea – to finally have a guide that can keep up with
      EverQuest. As of September 2001, US-EQ is over 1000 pages and growing.
      Be sure to check out our <a href="Samples/index.htm"> samples</a> for the
      guide and we hope you enjoy
      reading and using US-EQ as much as we enjoy writing and keeping you updated!</p>

      <p><b><u><br>
      Current News and Update Information</u></b></p>
      
      <p><b>October 29, 2001</b> - Just an update to let you know the email
      service is still being worked on and should be resolved shortly (the
      sooner the better of course). We are just as excited to get this new
      update out as you are to read it! Again, we apologize for the delay and
      are working diligently to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.</p>
      
      <p>October 27, 2001 - Our update did not hit as expected yesterday
      due to a malfunction with the new email system. After working on it for
      nearly 20 hours, we have a few experts coming in to resolve it for us on
      Monday. Our updates will resume as soon as the email service is up. We are
      not placing the updates within the same links as we have done in the past.
      I will post here again on Monday to give you an update on the progress -
      please do not email us about an ETA. I know you are all excited about this
      overdue re-vamp to the Kunark guide, and I promise to have it out to you
      as soon as I can. I should also mention that the update will include an entirely
      new <i>How to Make Platinum Guide</i> as I described in older news. The
      Velious Guide is also underway and should be out within 2 weeks of this
      update. We apologize for the delay and will continue to make updates to
      the Kunark Guide while waiting for the email system to be up again.</p>
      
      <p>October 22, 2001 - The date is finally here for our new updated
      Kunark Guide! This Friday, October 26, 2001 will be our official release
      date for the new guide! All members still waiting for the CD ROM will get
      it in the mail shortly after the update is released. This revamp will
      include many new quests, dungeon and zone information, and much more! We
      will also have the new Velious Guide out by the following week! All
      members will receive an email once these updates come out with the newest
      links (all the old links will no longer work).</p>
      
      <p>September 25, 2001 - Before we talk about the next USEQ update,
      we would like to send out our deepest sorrows for the family and friends
      of the victims in the Sept. 11th attack in NY and DC. RPG Secrets is not
      located in either town of course, but one of our writers did work next to
      the towers and did not make it out. RPG Secrets took some time off after
      the attack. We continued working on the next update however that should
      hit by the end of this week. We also finished implementing our new email
      service that will also begin with the new update. We will keep you posted
      here and by email.</p>
      
      <p>RPG Secrets is looking for new writers! We have an opening for the
      EverQuest Guide, and we now have a few openings for the upcoming Dark Age
      of Camelot Guide. Please email the editor with your background and
      which game you would like to write for at <a href="mailto:mike@RPGSecrets.com">mike@RPGSecrets.com</a>
      - include all information you feel that qualifies you for the position
      (wages will be discussed via email). All Dark Age of Camelot writers will
      be put on the beta right away.</p>
      
      <p>August 18, 2001 - Just wanted to let everyone know that we are working
      on a very large update and that is why there has not been one since July
      28th. I have been playing non-stop myself for the past couple of weeks in
      Kunark and Veliuos (including Sebilis, Karnors Castle, Chardok, Howling
      Stones, Velk's Lab, Frozen Tower, and many open zones). The Kunark guide
      will reflect all the extra playing in the next update as well. Our Velious
      guide is near completion! We also have 5 new methods of making platinum
      (for the higher levels - this means making over 1000 plat an hour). There
      is no exact ETA on this yet, but should be very soon! Thanks for being
      patient. Current members who ordered the CD ROM and did not get it, you
      will be receiving it shortly (after this update). We wanted to make sure
      the CD ROM you get is up to date.</p>
      
      <p>July 28, 2001 - New Update! We now have a separate guide for class
      resources - every class is listed with all spells and class information in
      our new 193 page <b>Player Resource Guide! </b>Ibsen really went above the
      call of duty on this one! <i>Current members can re-download the files that have been updated
      - the links have not been changed yet (this file is with the main EQ guide
      zip file)</i></p>
      
      <p>July 17, 2001 - New Update! We have 2 updates for you today - we
      updated the <b>Make</b> <b>Unlimited
      Platinum Guide</b>.&nbsp; We also updated our Zone maps by adding The
      Overthere Maps made exclusively by our cartographer<b> Ibsen</b>! <i>Current members can re-download the files that have been updated
      - the links have not been changed yet. The update email notification
      service should be back up and running very soon!</i></p>
      
      <p>July 6, 2001 - New Update! In this update, we have changed the
      formatting of the guide in an effort to standardize how we deliver the
      information you crave. Also added are two appendix sections that will act
      as quick reference guides and checklists to enable you to keep track of
      your character more easily. There are a few “place holder” pages to
      serve as formatting guides, but as time goes by we will add content to the
      appendix sections. This will enable you to print the pages that are relevant
      to your character and keep hard copies on hand for reference. Special
      thanks to <b>Ibsen</b> for all his work on this one! <i>Current members can simply check here for updates for
      now, and re-download the files that have been updated (this would
      be the US-EQ.zip file for this update).</i></p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;July 4, 2001 - <b>Happy Independence Day</b> from all of us at RPG
      Secrets! We will not be writing today, but we will be sending out guides
      to new customers of course. Enjoy the fireworks!</p>
      
      <p>June 28, 2001 - <b>RPG Secrets is looking for writers!</b> Get paid to
      play and write about your favorite game! We are looking for creative
      people to play and write for EverQuest and Anarchy Online. If you are
      interested, please send a writing sample, what game you are interested in
      writing for, how much you would like to write per week to the editor, <a href="mailto:mike@RPGSecrets.com">mike@RPGSecrets.com</a>&nbsp;</p>
      
      <p>June 26, 2001 - We just added <b>International Shipping</b> for CD
      ROM's! We had a large amount of requests from outside the U.S. asking for
      the optional CD ROM version of USEQ. Please check our <a href="Purchase/index.htm">Purchase</a>
      page for more information.</p>
      
      <p>June 25, 2001 - We are moved and settled into the new place! Thanks to
      all of those that helped with the move, and for the new customers that
      were patient getting their guides over the weekend. We have a large update
      coming out this week - stay tuned!</p>
      
      <p>June 23, 2001 - Just wanted to let everyone know we are moving our
      office today - the new mail address was already updated last week
      throughout the site. We will be checking email of course, but response
      time will be much slower until we are at 100% on Monday. The move is only
      10 miles away (from Aurora to Naperville, Illinois). For those purchasing
      the guide this weekend, we will be answering your emails first. Next
      update will be at the end of this week - including a new layout for the
      main guide (thanks to Ibsen) and a lot of additions to the Kunark guide.</p>
      
      <p>June 14, 2001 - New Update! We have just added a new 24 page section to
      the <b>Power Leveling guide for Enchanters</b>! This was done by our very
      own <b>Ibsen</b> (who most of you know as the Map God around here). We
      also added the Shadowknight Epic Quest for all you SK's. Many of you have
      noticed that you have not been getting emails from us about updates - and
      this is true, our current list server has not been doing the job we had
      hoped, but when you have as many members as we do here, it was due to fail
      sooner or later. We are now implementing a new email system that will
      ensure everyone gets an update email (this will be done by the
      end of this month). Current members can simply check here for updates for
      now, and re-download the files that have been updated (this would
      be the USEQ.zip file for this update).</p>
      
      <p>June 1, 2001 - New Update! We added Foraging and Fishing to the Trade
      Skills guide today. We also had to update the Platinum Guide since there
      was a nerf as of the patch on May 30, 2001. You can now only make up to 100
      Platinum per hour (still very good for a level 5). (Current members can
      re-download the Trade Skills Guide to get this update)</p>
      
      <p>May 25, 2001 - New Update! We added 9 of the 14 <font color="#CC0000"><b>Epic
      Quests</b> </font>to the main guide. This includes Bard, Cleric, Druid,
      Enchanter, Magician, Monk, Paladin, Ranger and Warrior - all complete
      walkthrough's for each Epic Quest. Shadowknight, Shaman, Wizard,
      Necromancer and Rogue will be
      added in the next update. (Current members
      can re-download the main US-EQ guide to get this update)</p>
      
      <p>May 17, 2001 - We have started using Adobe Acrobat 5.0 since our last
      update on May 15th, so be sure to download the latest version of the free
      reader for use with the guide. The link for Adobe Acrobat 5.0 can be found
      <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">here</a>.</p>
      
      <p>May 15, 2001 - New Update! We added a small update to the main guide
      for Power Leveling using a Quest! You will need Velious in order for this
      to work, but you will level very quickly while making hundreds of plat per
      hour. If done right, you can level from 1-25 in one day! (Current members
      can re-download the main US-EQ guide to get this update) <font color="#CC0000">(As
      of May 30th, this quest will no longer produce fast leveling)</font></p>
      
      <p>April 27, 2001 - New Update! We have added a guide to help you make <font color="#CC0000"><b>Unlimited
      Platinum</b></font>! All you need is a level 5 character and you can make
      up to 250pp an hour! (Current members can re-download the Trade Skills
      guide to get this update)</p>
      
      <p>April 19, 2001 - As many of you know already, Sony announced a new
      expansion for EverQuest called the <b>Shadows of Luclin</b>. RPG Secrets
      will start writing the guide for SoL when it comes out in December 2001.</p>
      
      <p> April 2, 2001 - Our new USEQ Items Program and Trade
      Skill Guide has been released! You can view more info in&nbsp; <a href="Updates/current.htm">Current
      Projects</a> for now, we will add new pages under samples soon.</p>
