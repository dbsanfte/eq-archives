      <p>There are over 700 Quests listed in US-EQ, and here is one of the biggest - one nearly every class needs - good luck on your journey!<br>
      <br>
      <u><b>Quests:</b><br>
      </u><br>
      <b>Journeyman Boots:</b><br>
      <br>
      This is one of the most important quests in the game of EQ (unless you have SoW or have that wonderful speedy Bard song of course). The boots that increase your running speed....<br>
      <br>
      You don't need to find Hasten Bootsrutter in Rathe to start this quest, but if you do, this is exactly what he will say to you:<br>
      <br>
      <b>You say</b> 'Hail Hasten Bootstrutter'&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Hasten Bootstrutter says</b> 'Stopped I have done. Greet you I will. What business do we have? Hmm? Speak up!!&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>You say</b> 'What journeyman's boots'<br>
      <b>Hasten Bootstrutter says</b>  'Jorneyman's Boots are what you seek? Ha!! I have those upon my feet and disinigrate will they if my life is taken. Extra pair have I and [rare trade] can we make.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>You say</b> 'What rare trade'&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Hasten Bootstrutter says</b> 'I call for three things and Journeyman Boots are yours. I call for a [Shadowed Rapier], call for the [Ring of the Ancients] and call for Gold,.. 3250 Gold Coins!! This the trade that I call.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>You say</b> 'What shadowed rapier'&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Hasten Bootstrutter says</b> 'Shadowed Men, foes to all, have appeared. Many lands do they walk. Invisible are they, but items they wield can be seen. Seek them out and return to me a Shadowed Rapier. Return it with haste before 'poof' goes the rapier!! No time to camp have you.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>You say</b> 'What ring of the ancients'&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Hasten Bootstrutter says</b> 'Ancient Cyclops do march the land. Long have they lived and crafted the Ring of the Ancients have they. I must have one and you shall go and fetch one for me. Seek the lands of the oldest Cyclops clans. Seek the plains, seek the island in tears and seek the dunes for there is one who is last. His clan was blown from the sands.<br>
      <br>
      The first item of this quest you will want to obtain is the Ring of the Ancents found on an Ancent Cyclops. There are 2 that spawn in the land of Norrath - 1 in Ocean of Tears and the other in South Ro. The Ancent Cyclops in Ocean of Tears spawns on the first Island that is due west of  Sister of Erollsi Island (if you take the boat, get off at the Sister Island, head West and swim to the next island - that is where you want to be). Once there, you will see a roaming Cyclops - kill him to make the Anceint spawn (this could be a long camp btw). Now if this Ancent Cyclops seems a bit hard for you, there is another one that is lower in level (about 8-10 levels in fact). That Ancent resides in South Ro - and to make him spawn, you must go around killing everything in the sand (Mummies, Ghouls, Tarantulas, etc) - eventually he will spawn (and you might even get the Terrorantula to spawn as well - I think a Sand Giant and a Tarantula got a little too friendly one day to create that huge spider) :)<br>
      <br>
      Once you aquire the Ring, you must seek out a Shadowed Rapier (these are dropped by Shadowmen which you can locate in West Commons, South
      Karana, Lesser Fay, or Innothule Swamp - if you find the Ancient Cyclop in South Ro, your
      quickest place to get the Rapier will be in Innothule Swamp at that Shadowman camp, which is loc -440, 980).<br>
      <br>
      Take your Ring, Rapier and 3250 gold pieces and head out to find the always roaming Hasten Bootsrutter in Rathe Mountains. I have seen him at loc 1050, -750 before, but like I said, he does roam around the zone....and you are looking for a male gnome in leather (and he does use the boots, so he is quite fast). Now you know why you have to use 3250 gold instead of 325 platinum (they want you to be slow). The trick to finding Hasten is to have a druid friend that can SoW you, give you added
      STR, and use tracking. His spawn spot is near the Cyclops and Hill Giant area which is located in the SW area of the zone, close to the guard tower. If you do not find, it is possible you will have to kill his placeholder. The most common seems to be "A Drake" - not just any Drake of course, make sure it has that "A" in front of it. Another possible spawn for Hasten is Maldyn the Unkempt Druid (no faction hits if you decide to kill him - he is part of a Ranger quest as well). If you don't see either of those, the spawn might be Brother
      Zyphl. I would suggest not attacking Brother Zyphl since he is probably a level 60 monk :) Just wait for him to de-spawn and hope Hasten is next....<br>
      <br>
      Once you do find Hasten, hail him to stop him...give him the 3 items - Ring of
      Ancents, Shadowed Rapier and the 3250gold  and he will reward you with the Journeyman Boots!<br>
      <br>
      <b>
      Advice Upon Retrieving Ring of the Ancients</b><br>
      <br>
      Listen to my heed, never, ever try to take the Ancient Cyclops in Ocean of Tears. Player set rules forbid kill-stealing the Ancient Cyclops within the Ocean
      of Tears. You will never get your hands on the ring if you hunt at Ocean of Tears. It is a
      detriment to hunt there because there's always a problem of the camp first of all, and it takes
      days and nights, not just in Norrath time, but earth time! I had managed to see the Ancient
      Cyclops quite often in S. Ro. The common belief and rules set with players is that the Ancient
      Cyclops is kill-stealable, so you are quite right to steal that AC in S. Ro, and S.
      Karanas. Other
      zones than that, if any, will need to be set upon asking players within your server to see what
      agreement has been set.</p>
      <p>So you're in South Ro, eh? The desert is filled with the ends of worms. The
      Ancient Cyclops spawns most commonly on most servers from my study around the early morning and in the
      afternoon. I have yet to see an Ancient Cyclops spawn at night, since it has never happened to
      me while I was assisting friends to this ring. However, if you ever hear the rumor of killing
      Ortallius, the level 30 orc will help, do not try. He is healed quickly, and will lower your
      faction.</p>
      <p>You have heard many people say it is necessary to kill all those beasts right? Well remember,
      there is always a person looking for the Ring of Ancients. I can not stress this hard enough to
      not dwaddle around waste all your mana or AC on these slimy creatures. You should keep
      your mana bar up to at least 80% at 34 and above, 50% for level 50 and above (decrease
      5% for every additional level above).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      Hunt around the west wall from coming in to S. Ro from the Oasis. For I have heard in every
      instance that the Cyclops spawns there. If you see a cyclops, run to it. Do not hesitate. Also,
      kill mummies at times you see them, but do not spend your time looking for them! Remember,
      finders keepers.</p>
      <p>Stand on a high hill, look straight for anything that resembles a
      cyclops. If you follow these
      set of rules, you will be able to retrieve the Ring of the Ancients in 3 hours or less! But most
      importantly, hunt on the west wall.<br>
