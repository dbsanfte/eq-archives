    <td width="70%" valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" class="td1" height="85%">While playing in the beta of
      EverQuest, we realized the need for a solid strategy guide, but not just your typical strategy hard copy book - EQ changed everyday in beta, and would always continue to change for the life of the game - and a guide would have to be able to do the same.<br>
      <br>
      In early 1999, RPG Secrets was formed and the very first guide (EverQuest Secrets) was on
      its way. From phase 4 of beta to the final release of EQ, we had the layout set and ready to go into production. After hitting level 50, it would only take a few months and the first EQ Guide of it's kind would come out in August '99 - even though it was only 50 pages, it was a huge success.<br>
      <br>
      Over the next year and a half, US-EQ would grow into a huge book - over
      1000 pages in fact (and still growing now!). We are implementing new programs to help make this an even greater value (check out the updates page for more info). As customers can tell you that bought the guide in August '99, all updates are free and remain free - you will never be charged for additional updates and that does include expansions as well. We have always felt that the expansions were merely just one of the many ways the world of EQ changes and grows - and there is no reason to pay more then once for a guide that deals with a single game.<br>
      <br>
      The founder of RPG Secrets, Mike Szerlong, has been in the gaming industry for over 10 years with experience in writing for popular gaming publications and play testing. His love for EverQuest sparked the new idea for a guide that would be able to handle the amount of changes EQ goes through on a weekly
      basis
      <p>Our future projects include guides for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asheron's Call</li>
        <li>Shadowbane</li>
        <li>Anarchy Online</li>
        <li>Dark Age of Camelot</li>
        <li>Horizons</li>
        <li>Star Wars Galaxies</li>
        <li>And More!</li>
      </ul>
