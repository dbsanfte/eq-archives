      <p>Here is the Dungeon Walkthrough for Infected Paw. Originally this dungeon was setup as a low level dungeon starting at level 10, but last year the zone was revamped and increased to be more of a mid-level dungeon, and great for those groups in their low 20's (and NPC's get up to level 40 in this dungeon, so beware and good luck!).</p>
      <p>In the guide, all the Dungeon Walkthrough's are setup in the same way - starts you out at the beginning of the zone, and works you all the way through it. This is a relativly small dungeon compared to others, and walkthrough's such as Lower Guk will be much longer.<br>
      <br>
      <b><u>Infected Paw</u><br>
      </b><br>
      Infected Paw is located in South Karana - due South of the White Bridge.  Earlier this year, Paw got a face lift (and they increased this from a newbie zone to a mid level zone area). I used to tell people to go here after you finished Black Burrow (not anymore) :)  The revamp did not only increase levels, but brought out some new items worth camping for.<br>
      <br>
      As you enter the underground burrow of Paw, you run into a few Gnoll Guards (this zone is progressive of course just as the rest of them, so be careful as you go further in - the beginning guards are weak in comparison - and there are plenty of casters as you move forward). Invisible does work in this zone very well - works on all Gnolls, just not the Widemouths :)  Making your way in, go through the double doors and you will notice a bridge above you - pass under it and continue moving until you are on a bridge. If you jump off to your right, you will notice a hall section (one leading North, other leading East) - Head East and make your way to the very back room (to do this, take your first right, then your first left up the stairs and follow straight back). There you will find the spawn for the Tesch Val Kadvin (he drops Vacra Av Svin - 1hs). Going back where you entered this hall section, instead of taking the East hall, head down the North hall and follow that to your right around the small lake.  You will see a small body of water ahead (on the right) - jump in and swim into the tunnel - you will come out to an open area. Keep going (and fighting of course) past the room on the left, then right, and walk all the way to the back area - in that last room to the left spawns the Ishva Mal (drops the Robe of Ishva (rare) and the NEC spell, summon corpse) - You may see a Necro camping there often. Ishva Mal is probably the hardest monster in this zone (he is a necro keep in mind and usually spawns around level 40). Go back out the way you came, and continue going North (stay along the east wall). You will pass a large body of water on the left (that is also where those widemouths are - and no, they are not Bass) :)  Keep going North until you are in a narrow passage. Follow those turns until you get to your first cross section (West or North). Continue North, take your first right - go all the way to the end of that hall, and take that last right - you will now be at the Nisch Val Torash Mashk spawn spot.  This is a tough mob (cleric), but as long as you have your tanks bashing him everytime he tries to cast - he is quite easy to beat). His rare drop is the Devlas Ilkvel, and common is the Tesch Val Sinich. Go back to that cross section now, and head West this time (still staying along the right wall). You will quickly run into another hall (heading North), that will break off into 2 (take the path on the left - the one on the right doesn't lead to any droppers). Go all the way down to a room, and on your left you will see the spawn for Rosch Val L'vor (he drops the Gnoll Hide Tome). Rosch is a Magician and around the same level as the other boss's in this zone (high 30's). Go back the way you came and once you are back at the open area, continue by going right...follow that right wall around. You will see water to your left now and then a group of gnolls - within that group, 3 spawns - Kurpok Splitpaw (drops Jeweled Skull quest piece Ruby Pendant), Verishe Mal Judge and Verishe Mal Executioner. If you now continue to follow that wall you will go into a room with a door...enter the door and you will see a room on the left, and a hallway with a room at the end to your right...use the one on your right to find the Tesch Val Deval Nmak (drops the Kicsh Der Pavz). While traveling through Paw, you will run into other creatures of coruse - including Evil Eyes, Gelatinous Cubes, Skeletons, etc...so always be on your toes.</p>
