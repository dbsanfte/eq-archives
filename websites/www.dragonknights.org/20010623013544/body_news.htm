      news updates but I haven't been playing much lately to be able to keep up with
      everything going on in EQ.&nbsp; The web site has also been going up and
      down lately because of some technical problems with the web server.&nbsp;
      I'm having the site moved to a different server and I'm hoping that
      everything is running nice and smooth in about 2 weeks.&nbsp; I also
      thought the site needed a new look so I created this design.&nbsp; I hope
      you all like it and just so you know, it works best with Internet Explorer
      at a resolution of at least 800x600.&nbsp; If you're still running at
      640x480, e-bay your computer and buy a new one!</font>
