<br><p>May 15, 2002 - The Inquisition joins DK - The Dragon Knights warmly welcomes all the new members from Inquisition.  I'm sure this merger will benefit us all, except our enemies of course.  Welcome to DK!<BR><BR>


<br><p>Mar.16, 2002 - New Roster Page - Well, I made a easy changed and pointed the roster button found on the left of page to our guild listing on CamelotHerald's website.  Also be sure to check the members section on the boards, we ae discussing the posiability of changing our cloak colors and emblem.  If you don't have access, give someone a tell in game and we'll hook you up.<BR><BR>  Also congratulations must go out to Alby for being the first DK to reach 50 and also to Wonderwoman who reached it last night.  WOOHOO!!!<BR><BR>

<BR><p>Jan.15, 2002 - 1.42 Patch - The 1.42 patch went live today, you can check it out <a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/more/140.php" target="_blank">here.</a>  Part of the patch involves them putting effects on weopons.  I must say they look pretty nice, too bad nobody can see them but he who holds the weopon.  I put up two pictures of me holding them.<BR><BR><CENTER><A HREF="images\1hd_flamesword.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=160 BORDER=0 SRC="images\1hd_flamesword.jpg"></A>

I also cut and paste Brin's welcome message below.<BR><blockquote> <p>Dec 7, 2001</p>
  <p>Welcome to the home of the Dragon Knights.</p>

  <p>This page is just now setup with a new server - major changes are coming

  soon. </p>

  <p>As you may or may not know, Dragon Knight of EQ Rodcet Nife fame has merged

  into another guild, Altered Destiny, and resulted in Dragon Force. However, to keep alive some of our

  history a link to the old site can be accessed via the EQ pic below. </p>

  <p>Dragon Force can be found <a href="http://altereddestiny.dnsalias.net/">here</a>. </p>

<BR>Dec. 16, 2001 - Relic Heist - Many of us online Sunday witness the enfolding drama as our relics were taken.  Most sortof knew something was up when they took our relic without breaking down the doors or killing even one guard.  Shortly there after our other relic was stolen.  Then one of Albions was taken, but not without a witness, check it out <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=20951389" target="_blank">here.</a>  Shortly after Mythic caught the guy and returned our relics, Mythic had this to say on <a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/more/74.php" target="_blank">relics and cheaters.</a><BR><BR>
Dec. 7, 2001 - Thanks to Vahan and much work on Ciaran\Brin's part, the new server is up and running.  You can now start using <A href="http://www.dragonknights.org/" target=_top>www.dragonknights.org</A> again.<BR><BR><BR>Nov. 24, 2001 - Dragon Knights helped defend the gates of Midgard tonight.  I was way too busy having fun to take screenshots, but I did manage to get a couple.</P><BR><BR><center>
