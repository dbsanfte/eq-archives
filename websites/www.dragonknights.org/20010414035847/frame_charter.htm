    Knights prefer the invasion, the Raid! The challenge of a raid gets the blood boiling and
    burns away the excess of the body and the mind. Through this we elevate the group as a
    whole to a single fighting entity capable of seeking newer and more immense challenges.</font></small><p><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not to discount the need for updated gear and equipment.
    Indeed we pull together to gain those items. And we cannot discount the experience needed
    to attain the next level of progression. Indeed we pull together to this end also. But, be
    you mindful, these are but secondary to the Raid.</font></small></td>

    this regard, it is our experience that the time of the event is critical to a successful
    campaign. Most of us are on the Pacific Coast (PST) while others may be found oversees in
    Europe. And yet some others are closer to the East Coast. On this I must be blunt and get
    to the point, most raids are scheduled on Wednesday or Friday at 8pm PST. Weekend raids
    will generally start around 11am PST. There will be exceptions as we cherish our existing
    members for whom this is a problem. But, I ask that you seriously consider this when
    seeking membership.</font></small></td>

    <td width="100%"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">There have been many duels fought,
    friends parted, and tears shed over the right to jump in and claim the prizes of war. Alas
    reward is sorely missed for a battle well fought. 'Tis a tough and difficult decision to
    award a glorious item to one and and not another. The High Council has debated this manner
    for many moons seeking to be fair and just, being true to our fellows in arms. One cannot
    discount long standing and unflagging devotion. One cannot discount the merit that is
    bestowed to one just entering our ranks. We strive together as a family and we cannot deny
    reward to any of our number. In this vein, the Loot Officer of the High Council will
    enforce our policy and bestow items according to the policy set forth by the High Council.</font></small><p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><small>For most items, those discovered during normal course, a simple
    lottery is </small><small>exercised</small><small>. Members included will generally be limited to those who are
    participating in the raid and of a class best suited to the items use. Of the members
    meeting this criteria, ones who have previously won (any item) will be excluded until all
    members of the class have been awarded an item. Once all members of that class have
    received an item (any item) all are allowed back into the lottery for the next item.
    Members who will not put the item to use are asked to voluntarily exclude themselves from
    the lottery. In the event an item drops which may be passed from one to another
    (droppable) and all participating member most suited to its use own the item, then that
    item may be awarded to either another member in participation, held for a member not
    participating, or deposited in the Guild Treasury at the discretion of the Loot Officer.</small> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><small>On occasion some in attendance will not be a Dragon
    Knight, but this does not exclude them from the treasures of war all together. At the
    discretion of the Loot Officer these people may be included in an item lottery. However,
    this will likely be done only after </small><small>attending</small><small> members have received such an item. Indeed,
    many fine people have been awarded items on our journeys.</small></font></p>
    <p><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">Precious and rare loot (e.g., Rare Dragon Loot, BP,
    Robe, Rare weapon) is seldom discovered and is cherished above all else. All our members
    fight hard and die for the cause, but some more than others. Some uphold our honor daily
    while others are seen less often. Extraordinary effort and contribution to the guild
    cannot be discounted. For this reason rare items are awarded based purely on Guild
    Seniority. Seniority is based upon many factors and all must be counted: long standing,
    participation, and contribution. The High Council decides seniority based on all of these
    things and rare items will be awarded accordingly.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally, if an item is awarded but no longer needed
    by that individual (and the item is droppable) then we ask that the item be returned to
    the Guild for re-distribution to another member. If you find such an item in your
    inventory please notify the Loot Officer for guidance.</font></small></td>

    <td><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Times change... What once was, is no
      more - and in its place we strive to achieve something greater. We strive
      for something more complete and whole, more perfect...</font>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">The Dragon Knights now stand as a
      proud symbol in our land. What once began as a small unity has risen to a
      mighty roar. The name Dragon Knights inspires many to rally at our side
      and push the evils of our land deeper into the shadows. Brave souls from
      across Norrath have proven their bravery and valor in battle. These
      warriors have proven devotion to our cause and have been welcomed into our
      fold where they proudly stand with us. In number we are numerous and with
      our unity we are strong.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Now reaching to greater
      achievements we strive to mold and temper the steel of our friendship.
      This, so that we may pull even closer together in spirit - creating a bond
      no war, nor death, nor evil god may pull apart... With increased size is
      achieved strength - to a point. And at that point additional size becomes
      a weakness. A weakness that is, until the core of the warrior is again
      placed on the forge to be tempered even stronger still.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">In recognition of this cycle we are
      now choosing to severely limit additions to our guild so that this
      necessary part of the cycle may be fulfilled. All is not bleak however -
      for many weary travelers well deserve a place in our midst. A new cycle
      for acceptance has been enacted and, though the journey may be longer,
      still provides light in the lonely darkness.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">For those wishing to gain
      acceptance a Dragon Knight sponsor must be found. Our members do not take
      this responsibility lightly to be sure. I will leave it in your care to
      determine the best way to achieve this friendship and trust. Dragon
      Knights hold certain values in very high esteem, such as honesty, and it
      is these values which provide a basis for acceptance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Once a sponsor is found you should
      feel free to post your application on our message board. Be sure to
      include the sponsor and any information about yourself. As was custom
      before, it is still required that potential recruits join us on the field
      of battle. In battle the true nature of the warrior is revealed and it is
      the core of the individual we wish to know.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">As a sponsored applicant you are
      encouraged to attend raids and make every effort to team with our members.
      Actively seek Dragon Knights for company so that we come to know each
      other. In this rely upon your sponsor to make your introductions. If your
      sponsor is not available seek a member of the High Council (primarily
      Mystica or Garro). During this time our members will be invited to comment
      on your worthiness to join us. In this arena your past deeds may come to
      boost your effort or deny it. There is no set duration for this process
      except to say when we know you well enough your application will be
      decided.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Please take heed, we take these
      steps to limit those who would join us. Few will succeed where others may
      lose interest. We do this for those reasons I have mentioned and no other.
      If you are denied acceptance it may well be that we open our doors to you
      in times yet to come. For those who choose to endure this process the
      rewards are great and in our midst may you find peace.</font></td>

      fabric that binds us and the quality of people who now fight at your side.

      may encroach steadily nearer. Even in the most dire of times we stand as

      another, not of our guild. If you come to trust them as you trust us, if
      you see the true heart of a Dragon in them - then you may stand proudly at
      their side as a sponsor. It is the wish of the High Council that you carry
      the title of Dragon Knight for at least one month before becoming a
      sponsor and that you only sponsor one person at a time. As a sponsor you
      are asking us to depend on them as we do you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">In becoming a sponsor you are also
      accepting additional responsibility. A sponsored applicant likely does not
      know many of us - so we ask that you introduce them to others. If the applicant
      is to attend raids or general activities they must know of such things.
      Please keep them informed and make every effort to include them as
      appropriate. Ensure that they understand our charter and that any
      questions they may have are answered. These things we place in your care
      until the application is decided.</font></td>
