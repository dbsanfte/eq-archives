    race, but unified in mind and manifest in strength that flashes in greatness on the
    battlefield.&nbsp; Our bond to our guild mates
      is supreme and the power we thus possess exists is used to promote order
      and enforce all that is good.&nbsp; Our deeds speak of a heritage from which
    grand stories are told.&nbsp; Through blood spilt and souls transmuted, our fates are bound
    one to the other.&nbsp; Let all in Norrath come to respect the name: Dragon

    Knights, prefer the invasion, the Raid! The challenge of a raid gets the blood boiling and
    burns away the excess of the body and the mind. Through this we elevate the group as a
    whole to a single fighting entity capable of seeking new and ever more
      challenging exploits.</font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is not to discount the need for updated gear and equipment.
    Indeed we pull together to gain those items. And we cannot discount the experience needed
    to attain the next level of progression. Indeed we pull together to this end also. But, be
    you mindful, these are but secondary to the Raid.</font></td>

    campaign. Most of us are on the Pacific Coast (PST) while others may be found oversees in
    Europe. And yet some others are closer to the East Coast. On this I must be blunt, most raids are scheduled on Wednesday or Friday at 8pm PST. Weekend raids
    will generally start around 11am PST. There will be exceptions as we cherish our existing
    members for whom this is a problem. But, I ask that you seriously consider this when
    seeking membership.</font></td>

    <td width="100%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There have been many duels fought,
    friends parted, and tears shed over the right to jump in and claim the prizes of war. Alas
    reward is sorely missed for a battle well fought. 'Tis a tough and difficult decision to
    award a glorious item to one and and not another. The High Council has debated this manner
    for many moons seeking to be fair and just, being true to our fellows in arms. One cannot
    discount long standing and unflagging devotion. One cannot discount the merit that is
    bestowed to one just entering our ranks. We strive together as a family and we cannot deny
    reward to any of our number. In this vein, the Loot Officer of the High Council will
    enforce our policy and bestow items according to the policy set forth by the High Council.</font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For most items, those discovered during normal course, a simple
    lottery is exercised. Members included will generally be limited to those who are
    participating in the raid and of a class best suited to the items use. Of the members
    meeting this criteria, ones who have previously won (any item) will be excluded until all
    members of the class have been awarded an item. Once all members of that class have
    received an item (any item) all are allowed back into the lottery for the next item.
    Members who will not put the item to use are asked to voluntarily exclude themselves from
    the lottery. In the event an item drops which may be passed from one to another
    (droppable) and all participating member most suited to its use own the item, then that
    item may be awarded to either another member in participation, held for a member not
    participating, or deposited in the Guild Treasury at the discretion of the Loot Officer.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On occasion some in attendance will not be a Dragon
    Knight, but this does not exclude them from the treasures of war all together. At the
    discretion of the Loot Officer these people may be included in an item lottery. However,
    this will likely be done only after attending members have received such an item. Indeed,
    many fine people have been awarded items on our journeys.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Precious and rare loot (e.g., Rare Dragon Loot, BP,
    Robe, Rare weapon) is seldom discovered and is cherished above all else. All our members
    fight hard and die for the cause, but some more than others. Some uphold our honor daily
    while others are seen less often. Extraordinary effort and contribution to the guild
    cannot be discounted. For this reason rare items are awarded based purely on Guild
    Seniority. Seniority is based upon many factors and all must be counted: long standing,
    participation, and contribution. The High Council decides seniority based on all of these
    things and rare items will be awarded accordingly.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, if an item is awarded but no longer needed
    by that individual (and the item is droppable) then we ask that the item be returned to
    the Guild for re-distribution to another member. If you find such an item in your
    inventory please notify the Loot Officer for guidance.</font></td>

      for something more complete and whole, more perfect...</font>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dragon Knight now stand as a
      proud symbol in our land. The name Dragon Knight inspires many to rally to our side
      to push the evils of our land deeper into the shadows. Brave adventurers from
      across Norrath, who have proven their valor in battle and devotion to our cause,
      are welcomed into our
      fold where they proudly stand with us. Our unity makes us stronger. Now, reaching to greater
      achievements, we strive to mold and temper the steel of our friendship.
      This, so that we may pull even closer together in spirit - creating a bond
      no war, nor death, nor evil god may pull apart...&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">CLASS RECRUITMENT -- With increased size is
      achieved strength - to a point. And at that point, additional size becomes
      a weakness. A balance of classes must be struck. In order to strike the
      right class balance, we are
      now choosing to severely limit additions to our guild so that this
      necessary goal is met. Dragon Knights has some of the most skilled players
      in the game of the following classes. Thus, Dragon Knight is currently <b><i>not</i></b>
      accepting applications from the following classes: Druid, Necromancer,
      Paladin, Ranger and Shadow Knight.&nbsp; All is not bleak however -
      for many weary travelers well deserve a place in our midst. A new cycle
      for acceptance has been enacted and, though the journey may be longer,
      still provides light in the lonely darkness. Dragon Knights are recruiting
      noble players in the following classes: Bard (30), Cleric (100), Enchanter
      (80), Magician (80), Monk (40), Rogue (40), Shaman (30), Warrior (75) and
      Wizard (50). The number in parentheses is the Recruiment Priority Index.
      The higher number in parentheses, the greater is our interest in
      applicants of that class.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">LEVEL -- We strongly encourage all potential
    Dragon Knights to attain level 55 before seeking acceptance. If you are a
      member of a class with a high RPI score then exceptions may be made to the
      level restriction, on a case by case basis, and in concert with the guilds
      need for that class. In the members section of our
    site you may notice several people not of this level. Be at ease however in the
    knowledge that they are being trained by sponsors within the guild.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">GUILD AFFILIATION -- Dragon Knight will
      not consider the application of any player that is guilded.&nbsp; Only
      those who have been confirmed to be guildless in game will have their
      application accepted for consideration.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">SPONSOR -- For those wishing to gain
      acceptance to Dragon Knight, a guild sponsor should be found. Our members do not take
      this responsibility lightly to be sure. I will leave it in your care to
      determine the best way to achieve this friendship and trust. Dragon
      Knights hold certain values in very high esteem, such as honesty, honor
      and integrity, and it
      is these values which provide a basis for acceptance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">APPLICATION -- Once a sponsor is found you should
      feel free to email your application to <a href="mailto:Envino@aol.com">Envino@aol.com</a>. Be sure to
      use the form found on the applicants section of this message board. Use
      this link to view the form: <a href="http://pub9.ezboard.com/fthedragonknightsapplytojointhedragonknights.showMessage?topicID=370.topic">http://pub9.ezboard.com/fthedragonknightsapplytojointhedragonknights.showMessage?topicID=370.topic</a>&nbsp;
      Once the High Council finds nothing wanting in your application, you will
      be notified that your status is that of a formal applicant and your
      evaluation process will begin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EVALUATION PERIOD -- Following the custom
      of time immemorial, it is required that potential recruits join us on the field
      of battle. In battle, the true nature of the warrior is revealed and it is
      the core of the individual we wish to know. Applicants should not expect
      to share in loot that is attained in any of the raids they attend during
      the evaluation process.&nbsp; In the two week period from the notification
      of your promotion to Applicant status, you are
      encouraged to attend all raids and make every effort to team with our members.
      Actively seek Dragon Knights for company so that we come to know each
      other. In this, rely upon your sponsor to make your introductions. If your
      sponsor is not available seek out our Recruit Coordinator, Garro. At the
      end of these two weeks Garro, our Recruit Coordinator, will post a thread
      with your name in the Review section of our message board. During this time our members will be invited to
      formally comment
      on your worthiness to join us. In this arena your past deeds may come to
      boost your effort or deny it. After another two weeks of taking comments
      on your suitability, Garro will post your name for a vote.&nbsp; A single
      no vote will result in your application being rejected.&nbsp; Harmony is
      greatly prized among our guild members.&nbsp; If your vote goes well,
      Envino will inform you of your probationary membership in Dragon Knight
      and you will enter the final evaluation period wearing the guild name
      above your head. For the next 4 weeks we will get to know you as well as
      we can. After 4 weeks, if all goes well, you will become a full voting
      member. Thus, the entire evaluation period should last two months.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Please take heed, it is not an easy path
      you set out on when you endeavour to join Dragon Knight. Few will succeed.
      However, the quality of the guild must be maintained. If you are denied acceptance
      based on your class or level, it may well be that we open our doors to you
      in times yet to come. For those who choose to endure this process, the
      rewards will be great and in our midst you will find peace and
      brotherhood.</font></td>

      another, not of our guild. If you come to trust them as you trust us, if
      you see the true heart of a Dragon in them - then you may stand proudly at
      their side as a sponsor. It is the wish of the High Council that you carry
      the title of Dragon Knight for at least one month before becoming a
      sponsor and that you only sponsor one person at a time. As a sponsor you
      are asking us to depend on them as we do you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In becoming a sponsor you are also
      accepting additional responsibility. A sponsored applicant likely does not
      know many of us - so we ask that you introduce them to others. If the applicant
      is to attend raids or general activities they must know of such things.
      Please keep them informed and make every effort to include them as
      appropriate. Ensure that they understand our charter and that any
      questions they may have are answered. These things we place in your care
      until the application is decided.</font></td>
