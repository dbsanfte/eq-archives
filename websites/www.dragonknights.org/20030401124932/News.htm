<p class="ItemTitle">Well Folks Its updated yet again.. DK seems to be getting 
  back in the flow. I logged out last night to go to my god son's b-day party 
  with my roommate getting on to level with some DK, 3 hours later I come back 
  and they are still at it. My roommate wanted to quit so I took over and brought 
  along Baneling for buffs. Before I knew it we were pulling mass mobs and I was 
  running two chara's.. To say the least some of the lower levels leveled. most 
  did 3 levels a couple did 4. I would like to say Nice Work DK.. And Keep It 
  Up. </p>

<p class="ItemTitle"> Bump... The Website is under new management and will began 
  to be getting revamped soon. Thought you would all would at least like to know. 
  Dragon Knights are going through some changes and Guild Invites will be closed 
  until March or Cherok decides we are ready to take on new members. Just a quick 
  update for you all from your new local slave. Sibervirus.</p>

<p class="NewsItemText">Rather than the DF raid planned we shuttled off to
Albion to harass their relic. We took all of their keeps and had an excellent
defense of Renaris. Thanks to Ovarrd's master plan for keep defense Midgard beat
them back and had a blast. All the usual guilds contributed (The Enclave, Myth,
Black Knights, Bloodwinter Clan, Clan519, and others I might have missed) - nice
work all. Of course, we had to mop up by taking back 3 keeps of our own but
other than Albion's insistence on spending lots of BPs and money in our frontier
it wasn't hard. Merlin Midgard seems to be functioning on all cylinders :)</p>
<p class="ItemTitle">June 11, 2002</p>
<p class="NewsItemText">Congratulations to our recent additions to the level 50
club: Ked, Killcreek, Majinbuu, and Drakule. Now on to 50.5 --- NOT!<p class="NewsItemText">It's been a busy week both in the game and not. As you
can see the site has undergone a makeover.&nbsp;Hope you like it.<p class="NewsItemText">-

<p class="ItemTitle">June 9, 2002<p class="NewsItemText">Our relics came under
attack while we were seriously considering taking one from Albion. Midgard
rallied in premier style and the new alliance proved mobile and efficient.
Thanks to all who helped.</p>
<p class="NewsItemText">In other news... Legion died this week once again at the
hands of the Myth Alliance. Nice work!</p>

pointed the roster button found on the left of page to our guild listing on
CamelotHerald's website. Also be sure to check the members section on the
boards, we ae discussing the possibility of changing our cloak colors and
emblem. If you don't have access, give someone a tell in game and we'll hook you
up.<br>
<br>
Also congratulations must go out to Alby for being the first DK to reach 50 and
also to Wonderwoman who reached it last night. WOOHOO!!!</p>
<p class="ItemTitle">Feb.24, 2002</p>
<p class="NewsItemText">Photo Albums - Well I had to pry myself away from the
game to add the screenshots Alby sent me of the dragon. I also added an album of
screenshots I took. I'm gonna add more albums as I get around to it, please be
patient. You can check them all out by clicking the photo galery button on the

<p class="NewsItemText">1.42 Patch - The 1.42 patch went live today, you can
check it out <a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/more/140.php" target="_blank">here.</a>
Part of the patch involves them putting effects on weapons. I must say they look
pretty nice, too bad nobody can see them but he who holds the weapon. I put up
two pictures of me holding them.</p>

<p class="NewsItemText">Relic Heist - Many of us online Sunday witness the
enfolding drama as our relics were taken. Most sortof knew something was up when
they took our relic without breaking down the doors or killing even one guard.
Shortly there after our other relic was stolen. Then one of Albions was taken,
but not without a witness, check it out <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=20951389" target="_blank">here.</a>
Shortly after Mythic caught the guy and returned our relics, Mythic had this to
say on <a href="http://www.camelotherald.com/more/74.php" target="_blank">relics
and cheaters.</a></p>
<p class="ItemTitle">Dec. 7, 2001</p>
<p class="NewsItemText">Thanks to Vahan and much work on Ciaran/Brin's part, the
new server is up and running. You can now start using <a href="http://www.dragonknights.org/" target="_top">www.dragonknights.org</a>
again.</p>
<p class="ItemTitle">Nov. 24, 2001</p>
<p class="NewsItemText">Dragon Knights helped defend the gates of Midgard
tonight. I was way too busy having fun to take screenshots, but I did manage to
get a couple.</p>
