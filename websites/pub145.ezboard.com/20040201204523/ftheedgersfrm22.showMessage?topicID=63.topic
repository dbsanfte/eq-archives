for those that have not been on many raids or have little to no experience in this game aspect of Everquest.<br>
<br>
What is a raid? Well a raid is generally a large gathering of individuals working in cooperation to accomplish a goal. Should that goal be taking down dragons to farming rare items there are certain things people should keep in mind.<br>
<br>
[1] Just because you are going on a raid, do not expect to gain any Experience. There are a lot of people working together here and chances are you might not be in the group which gains any experience whatsoever. <br>
<br>
[2] Just because you are going on a raid, do not expect to get any loot. Unless an item is specifically reserved for you (you're probably organizing the raid or it is organized in your behalf) then chances are there will be several if not many people wanting to get that same uber drop you are looking for. If you go into a raid expecting a drop, then you will leave many raids dissapointed. <br>
<br>
[3] You will die! Maybe more than once. Going into a raid expecting not to die is shear folly. Sure there are great raids where everything goes perfectly as planned. However it doesn't take much to go from a perfect raid to a complete wipe out. Especially if we are talking about Large boss mobs, or plane raids. Just be prepared for a few deaths and be greateful of you don't die. <br>
<br>
Now that we've gotten those out of the way, lets move on to some of the do's and don'ts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DO</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> assist the Main Tank/Assist. Have a hotkey pre-made to assist whoever the MA is of the raid. That way whenever the assist call is made, you just have to mash one button and not worry about anything else. Here is my typical 'assist' button.<br>
<br>
/stand<br>
/assist &lt;NAME OF MA&gt;<br>
<br>
Notice I use the full name of the MA instead of %T. A reason for this is there is going to be lots of people and trying to target the MA would be a difficult feat with all that is going on, lag, etc. Also to keep spam down to a minimum, leave off any &quot;I am assisting %T with my massive powah&quot; type of messages. It just spams the channel where people could possibly miss important raid instructions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DO NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> attack until the assist call is made. The MA needs to generate enough aggro so that casters, or other melee will not pull aggro away from them. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DO NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> taunt the mobs. The MA principle is one where a single target receives all the damage taken up by the mob while dedicated healers keep that tank alive.  If you gain aggro then chances are you will not have the attention of the healers and die. This could lead to ping-pong'ing the mob around which could wipe out the raid. Ping pong is where the mob runs around from player to player attacking whoever and whatever is around instead of a single target. People will die one by one and the raid will wipe.  Try to use weapons that do not cause excessive aggro and try not to caste, nuke too early until deemed appropriate. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DO</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be on the raid in time. The person organizing the raid has to deal with formulating groups together with the forces present. This is obviously going to take a little time to do, and being there on time will go towards having the raid start in a quick and orderly fasion. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DO</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> listen to the raid leader and follow all instructions. The raid leader will give instructions on the raid and form groups. If you have any disagreements, tell them to your group leader who can relay the info to the raid leader.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DO NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> send direct tells to the raid leader unless absolutely neccessary. The raid leader is going to be busy forming groups, in tell hell, going over strats and plans, and generally will be very busy. Bring up any issues you have with your group leader and they will be able to relay that to the raid leader with more efficiency and weight. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DO NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> fight or argue with the raid leader. Constructive critism, rants, or raves are always welcome, but not during the raid. Save that for after the raid when all is said and done. During the raid, raid leader is in command and full responsibilty falls on them. So if after the raid is a bust, flame on. But to do so during the raid will only cause unwarrented tension, fighting, and bring down morale which could lead to making problems worse such as wiping out the raid, or 12 hour corpse runs. If you have any suggestions of why you think your approach is better, let your groupleader know and they can relay the information. Chances are the people in charge are fully aware of all the ways to approach the problem and have decided on a certain solution depending on the different variable involved.<br>
<br>
With all this hassel, large chance of dieing, little to no chance at loot, and probably a net loss of experience why even bother to raid? Well one thing you get a chance to do something or see things you could never do by yourself. You could be helping out your friends in one of their quest/epic battles. You get to meet many new people, who one day might be able to help you out later on when you might need it. <br>
<br>
You are working together towards a goal with your friends and peers and even if reaching the goal is a long and imposing task, more often than not the path is an even greater rewarding experience than the goal.<br>
