<br>
                       A Voice in the Night. <br>
<br>
<br>
My body was telling me it was late, demanding from me a respite from the fatigue induced aches I had forced upon my self. In recent days I had wandered Luclin in melancholy solitude seeking whatever battle I could find, offering my sword and gifts to whoever needed them. Penance for my sins. <br>
<br>
I rarely sleep anymore. The dreams of yesterday are too much for my battered psyche. I am beginning to think I am damaged beyond all hope. Too many crimes for my short life. Too many acts I can never undo. I used to understand the rage, now it leaves me confused and empty, so terribly empty. I have echoes in my mind of a time before, a time when I was filled with hope and light. What remains of my heart aches for the girl I once was. The sound of laughter close by me takes me back again. I remember all that I have lost. <br>
<br>
I had a family once. <br>
<br>
I grew up in a strong house. My parents served the lightbearer well. They raised me with love and taught me honor. I faced the world sure that I could make a difference. <br>
<br>
It was an arrogant and hollow belief. <br>
<br>
Those that I loved were ripped from my life one by one. Friends, lovers and finally one terrible day my family as well. <br>
<br>
I was home in North Freeport after a painful and nearly fatal journey across Norrath. My body was battered and my spirit all but broken. I was bedridden for almost a week healing from my physical injuries. My mother said it was a miracle I had made it home alive. Looking back I believe it to be no more than a cruel cosmic joke. Some strange fate of mine to be restored and then taken down layer by layer in unimaginably painful ways. It is a cycle that will not seem to end. <br>
<br>
My mother tended to my recovery with love. It was her way and I took refuge in her warmth. She waited with patience born of love for me to tell my story. Gently removing the walls I had erected around my self, walls I had placed in an effort to protect myself from the anguish of my losses. I remember our last conversation well. If I concentrate I can still hear her voice, the gentle melody of her love as she soothed my broken heart. <br>
<br>
There is nothing I wouldn't give to hear that again, to feel that again, Marr, to know I was loved and cared for. I miss her so deeply my marrow aches with the loss. <br>
<br>
It's a futile wish. She is gone. They all are. It's fates cruelty that I did not follow. They were killed. I lived, again. <br>
<br>
I have to concentrate to remember their living faces, but I only need close my eyes to remember their deaths. <br>
<br>
I fought so hard against the invaders. I gave everything I had to the fight, screaming at my sister to run for help. Dodging blow after blow, keeping myself between the militia and my younger brothers and sister. My mother and father fighting by my side, the grim looks upon their faces as they took the fight to the invaders. It was then I was lifted into the air and thrown hard to the ground. The air left my lungs in a rush and my vision grayed out. <br>
<br>
When my vision cleared I was on my knees, someone's hand fisted in my hair holding me upright. I felt cold steel against my throat and I was sure my death was near. Fate had another plan for me. <br>
<br>
I watched as my family was slaughtered. Seven times over I watched someone I loved more than my own life murdered. I screamed my fury and pain until my voice left me. <br>
<br>
The murderers of my family laughed. <br>
<br>
The man holding me removed his blade from my throat and plunged it into my shoulder. I heard them leave as I lay there bleeding, my blood mixing with the blood of my family. My living eyes locked on the dead. <br>
<br>
I survived to bury my family. I honored them during the burial rites with all the love I had for them. Once the ceremony ended I turned and walked away from my home. I did not look back. <br>
<br>
I died that day. <br>
<br>
The next I was reborn as vengeance. My existence became one of hate. I would hunt those that had wronged me to the last man. They would know suffering and fear. I gave my self to rage and became death. <br>
<br>
I traveled to Queynos and then Halas. I lived among the Barbarian warriors in that frozen city for 5 seasons learning from them everything I could. When I began my journey again I was a formidable foe. It was time to head home and avenge my family. <br>
<br>
I moved in the shadows as if I had been born to them. I was a silent predator; the closer to Freeport I came the more my bloodlust grew. I took the first of my victims in the West Commonlands. I did not care who the man was, only that he wore the mark of the militia. The mark of death. <br>
<br>
He was no more than a boy, but he was serving those that had slaughtered my family. He feared me. I held absolute power over him and it felt good. I asked him if he knew why he was going to die. He did not. He knew not of my family nor my house. I explained to him. One wound for each victim. I let his agonized cries wash over me as I rejoiced in his pain. I placed my dagger over his heart and said to him, &quot;This one is for Nishal.&quot;  Slowly I forced my weapon into his flesh, through bone and stilled his heart with a viscous twist of my blade. I left his body for the animals to feast upon and continued toward Freeport. <br>
<br>
I left a trail of death behind me. My rage grew with every kill. I was drunk on the power I held over my enemy. It was good, it was right and I would not stop until the whole of them were rotting in the sun. Days turned into weeks and I lost count of my victims. The last of my humanity had fled the remnants of my soul and I was free of conscience. I became legend in the streets of Freeport, people feared me though they knew me not. I had but one name to them. Death. <br>
<br>
I was stalking a Sargent in the East Commonlands when the past found me. I crested a hill and came face to face with a man I had once known. Someone I was sure was dead. He looked at me in shock at first and then his eyes warmed as recognition dawned on him. His face split with an open smile as he grasped my forearms. I took an involuntary step backward at his touch. No one had touched me in years. Not like that. <br>
<br>
I'd had my share of men. Used them to satisfy my needs, but never let them touch me with affection. I did not want nor need their love. I had no use for it in my life. I chose men who wanted nothing more than the carnal pleasures I offered. I was a fierce warrior and a feral lover. <br>
<br>
This man, Hatath, who stood before me, was from a long forgotten past. I had loved him once. The memory of those times came rushing back to me as he said my name. <br>
<br>
&quot;Nishal.&quot;<br>
<br>
I shook my head and took another step back, almost satisfied at the hurt confusion that crossed his face. &quot;You've mistaken me for someone else.&quot; I said curtly before fleeing the other direction. To my great relief he did not follow. <br>
<br>
I ran to my refuge, not stopping nor looking back. I had never thought I would see anyone from my past, least of all Hatath. One safely inside I curled myself into a corner. Alone in the darkness I tried to banish the memories that had surfaced. <br>
<br>
I remembered the day he died. The day I thought he died. That horrifying Day in Katta. I remembered the look on his face as he fell. I remembered my own scream of vain denial as he disappeared from view and my companions bodily holding me back, wrestling me in the other direction and forcing me to flee our pursuers.  <br>
<br>
I had believed him dead all these years. Unwanted guilt washed over me from my reawakened conscience. I had left him alone and broken to the tender mercies of the enemy. Within my perverse nature a voice hoped he would be the one to finally end my wretched existence one I had completed my mission. A louder voice fervently wished to never see him again. He was a threat to the mission, a threat to the ebony I had become. A threat because I could so clearly remember the love I had for him. Nishal was dead. In her place The Mistress of Death had arisen. Nishal was dead, she had to be for I could not afford the price of her compassion. <br>
<br>
My sleep that night was plagued with the memories of before. My nightmares were the dreams that most longed for. I dreamed of my family and friends, feeling in my subconscious the joy of times passed. In my sleep love washed me clean and I saw a future filled with hope. In my dreams that night Nishal lived once more. <br>
<br>
I awoke the next morning confused and alone. Emotions long dormant were at war within me. A new ache had developed deep within. The creature I had become did not understand and used her formidable will to wipe my mind clean of the unwanted feelings. I had work to do. I had a Sargent to kill. <br>
<br>
This man was to die differently from the rest. This man I knew. He was there that night. It was his face I had seen on the others I had killed. This was the man who drawn his blade across my mother's throat.<br>

<br>
Part two.<br>
An involuntary sigh escaped me as I lay my head against the smooth stone wall of the Nexus. Weary resignation clouded my heart as my mind once again bore me to my terrible past. <br>
<br>
I hunted Sargent Slate for two full days before I picked up his trail again. The hunt had become more difficult because of the phantom trailing me. I was certain my mind was crumbling. Living the way I had, it was inevitable. I was living, breathing madness; it was only a matter of time before it consumed me. <br>
<br>
On the fringe of my sight a figure in crimson and gray followed me. Hatath. I allowed him to follow, knowing what would be done should he interfere. The chill had reclaimed my heart and death would not be moved for him. <br>
<br>
Hatath had died and in my fragmented delusion I could keep him dead. This man following me was a stranger. I could kill a stranger if need be. <br>
<br>
I crouched beneath the brush along a seldom-traveled road. The Sargent would be passing soon. It was almost time. <br>
<br>
&quot;You've changed.&quot;<br>
<br>
I whirled around my blade drawn ready to gut the man behind me, but Hatath was on me with inhuman speed. I had not even formed my cry of rage when his hand clamped painfully against my mouth and nose severed it. I fought him with everything I had to no avail, my hate, pain and fury were impotent. The ice in my vein would not save me. My lungs spasmd with the pain of death and I stilled. My gaze locked on his. It was his right to gain retribution against me. <br>
<br>
The victory I expected to see in his face was not there. <br>
<br>
What I saw was grief and in the fading lights of my life a single tear. <br>

RL kinda kicked my arse this month. <br>
<br>
/IC<br>
<br>
“How did we come to this?”<br>
<br>
I opened my eyes to see a face full of pity staring back at me. Hatath was as I remembered him. His face open and compassionate; his eyes full of the love he held for me.  To the person I had become it was a revolting sight. <br>
<br>
“You should have killed me.” I said coolly as I rose from his bed. I stood before this man, my body naked, but my soul was cloaked in fury. “I would not have hesitated to kill you and I wouldn’t recommend turning your back on me anytime soon.” My voice held an arrogance I did not feel.<br>
<br>
No, indeed, just beneath my rage, other emotions lurked. Just under the mask of vengeance I wore, the person I once was fought to escape the hatred. The person who loved this man with every bit of light Marr had given her was working her way to the surface. She, I, still loved him and at that moment wanted nothing more than to be held by him and cry each tear I had denied for the past six seasons into his shoulder.<br>
<br>
I had hated for so long, the persona of Nishal was foreign to me. She had become a phantom of my fractured memory.  <br>
<br>
“You do not scare me, Nishal.” He said to me. His voice was firm but gentle. I could see he had no fear and it infuriated me. The voice of hate shouted above the voice of love. The two halves of my soul had gone to war, the chaos of it screamed through my nerves. The energy within became frenetic as I paced wildly about. <br>
<br>
“You are a fool!” I hissed, speaking both to Hatath and my self. He just shook his head and remained silent. “What do you want with me? Why bring me here?”<br>
<br>
“I wanted to speak with you.”<br>
<br>
“About what?” I snarled at him. “What do you want to know, Hatath?” His name sounded a slur upon my lips.  <br>
<br>
“What happened to you?”<br>
<br>
“YOU DIED!” <br>
<br>
“I did.” He said gently. <br>
<br>
“Yes! You did! Pavem died, Nali died, MY FAMILY, FAITH, HOPE AND LOVE ALL DIED!” I could feel my body shake with anger. “I was left with NOTHING! NO ONE! So I whored my self to hate. Innoruuk's slut and I bathed in the blood of those I held responsible. AND I LIKED IT!” My breath now came in great gasps as my hysterical rage grew. “I AM a Mistress of Misery, bringer of pain and death. Damned to walk still living of body but long dead of soul because I was unworthy of death's release. I am darkness complete!”<br>
<br>
“I would not be here if that were true.”<br>
<br>
I laughed at him. “You're dead! Go to your GOD and have him count for you my crimes!”<br>
<br>
“Your mother weeps, Nishal.”<br>
<br>
The words shook me to my core. I stood staring at him for a moment before I found my voice again. “My mother is dead, she cannot weep.”<br>
<br>
“I am dead and yet have brought YOU to the brink of death. Your mother most certainly can weep and she does Nish.”<br>
  <br>
My heart was compressed by a mournful weight and I could feel tears make their journey down my cheeks for the first time in nearly six seasons. Then he touched me. His hand gentle upon my face, wiping away my tears. A shuddering breath escaped me as the warmth of him began to thaw the ice in my veins. <br>
<br>
“Tell me how you became this.”<br>
<br>
For the first time since the deaths of my family I felt shame. I lowered my head, unable to meet his eyes and slowly began my story. I did not want to tell him. I did not want to recount my sin, yet the time had come for the telling. My life since I left him in Katta was laid bare for his scrutiny.  A grim confession from a shattered soul. <br>
<br>
The words came forth unbidden. The truth of what I had become explained with every painful and vile detail. When I finished my tale we sat in silence for long minutes. Finally I found the courage to look into his eyes, I found the courage to face the disgust and condemnation he must surely have felt for me. <br>
<br>
For the second time that day, Hatath surprised me. I saw sorrow in him. I saw regret, but no judgement. <br>
<br>
When he spoke his voice was breaking with emotion. “More than anything Nishal, I regret not being with you when you needed me the most. I am so very sorry.”<br>
<br>
I shook my head. “You've no crime here.” My voice was raw and breaking. “I could not save you. I could not protect you, Pavem or Nali.” Tears once again fell upon my face. “I tried so hard for you, for my family, I fought so hard and I still lost. I just don’t understand. I don’t understand Hatath.” My statement was more a plea. I had fought the best I could and still lost everything. I could not have loved them more than I did. I could not have cared for them better than I did and still I lost them. Everything I had to give was not enough to keep them safe. I did not understand how that could be. <br>
<br>
Hatath wrapped his arms around me as he spoke. “I could take you back to that day. You could live it a thousand times and still not save me. You bear no fault for my death or theirs and I love you too much to put you through that day again to prove it to you. You trusted me once, trust me now when I say you did everything you could have done for us. You fought bravely and well, we could not have asked more of you.”<br>
<br>
“Why wasn't it enough?”<br>
<br>
He turned my face to his. “There are evils in this world greater than one can face alone. They hold power that can only be overcome by a host of bright spirits. You have been tested and are still being tested. The shadows are seductive, they've battered you and now offer fallacious solace. They've perverted your pain and led you with entreaties of righteous vengeance.” Hatath sighed. “You cannot continue down this path, that is why I am here now. You have to fight them Nish, if you do not, much more will be lost than just your soul.”<br>
<br>

<br>
I looked at him, the question clear upon my face. “What do you mean? Surely, I am not so important?&quot;<br>
<br>
“You are, far more than I can say.” He stroked my hair as he spoke. “Think Nishal, when something unjust happened, you were always the first to ask why. You were always the first to take up arms in defense of the wronged. When you were wronged, you stopped asking why and allowed yourself to be led down this path of hatred. They wanted that. Nish, a great shadow rises, even as the followers of light take back what was theirs, the shadow of darkness grows and festers within the hearts of many on this world. Still, it is afraid. Nishal it fears you and people like you. Light and justice shine brightly with in you, though you have been trying to cloak them in darkness. This cannot continue. I cannot tell you more, it is not for me to tell and there is little time left for you here. Please Nishal, trust me, trust the light within you begging to be set free and trust those who will be with you when you wake. Your road will not be easy, but you must take it. Release the anger, your family and friends are well here and they love you so much.” Hatath’s voice cracked with emotion. “I love you, it will always be so. Never will you take a step alone Nishal, not until one worthy in life shall take my place. I promise you that.”<br>
<br>
I wept openly against his shoulder, confusion and loss reigned with in my heart, yet amidst the pain hope sang a gentle lullaby. My eyes and limbs were heavy, but I did not wish to surrender to sleep. I did not wish to leave his comfort so soon. I knew I would not wake alone, the knowledge was without foundation, but still I knew. A family of strangers awaited me, I could almost see them as varied as the lands I had traveled, they were a family, fighting, loving and loosing together. <br>
<br>
I sighed sleepily against Hatath’s shoulder. “I miss you.” I whispered to him as my eyes closed. <br>
<br>
“I miss you too my love, but I am with you always.” I heard him sing into my heart as darkness lay claim to my consciousness. <br>
<br>
All too soon, voices, living voices intruded upon my rest. <br>
<br>
“You say she is not injured?”<br>
<br>
“Nay, she is well.”<br>
<br>
“She does not wake!”<br>
<br>
“She will when she is ready! Now away with thee!”<br>
<br>
I faded into the darkness once more. When next I woke, it was to sunlight warming my face. I felt comfortable, warm and rested for the first time in what felt like ages. I sighed as my body stretched into wakefulness. <br>
<br>
“It's about time!” A firm but gentle voice came from above me. I opened my eyes to see a human man standing above me. “We though you might well sleep another day away.”<br>
<br>
I couldn’t help but smile at the thought. “It seems tempting. It's…”<br>
<br>
“What?” he asked as a small frown of concern creased his mouth. <br>
<br>
I sat up, gathered the blankets around me and shook my head. “Nothing, it's just been a long time since I have slept in a real bed.”<br>
<br>
He chuckled. “I'm sorry, forgive my manners. I should introduce my self. I am Coldarm, my brethren and I found you in the East Commonlands three days ago. We brought you here, to our Guildhall.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you. You have done me a great kindness. I am Nishal.” <br>
<br>
“Please forgive my asking, but we have been curious as to how you came to be in such a state? What happened?”<br>
<br>
I sighed and looked at him for a moment. “Alot.”<br>
<br>
He frowned at me, clearly not satisfied with my answer. I understood, but it was not yet within me to tell my story to the living. So much had changed in my heart so quickly that my mind was in crisis. I needed time to...reflect. “I am sorry for my cryptic reply, but the truth of it is, I myself am not entirely sure. When I have had the time to put all the pieces together I will tell you. I just need time to sort it all out. I’ve only just woken.” I smiled at him but the shadow of memory was settling over my heart. <br>
<br>
“It is I who should apologize. I did not mean to pry.” He rose from his chair. “I will let Aaldari know you have woken. She is most anxious to meet you.” He turned to leave and then stopped. “She is a fine leader and has a noble heart, but, she seems a bit...um...strong...no, that's not the right term...rough around the edges to those that don't know her.”<br>
<br>
“Ah, I understand. Thank you for the...information.” When the door closed behind him, I let out a long breath. “Hatath, where have you seen fit to put me?”<br>
<br>
I had not expected an answer, but received one none the less as his presence whispered through my soul. “Where you need to be.”<br>
<br>
To be continued....<br>

More to come very soon, just needed to get this transitional scene out of the way. This is relatively short but sets the stage for the major stuff next chapter.<br>
 <br>
/IC<br>
<br>
I had wandered from the Nexus to Shadow Haven in search of a quiet corner of a quiet inn in which to have a drink. The memories seemed to come to me wanted or not and if I could not quell them perhaps I could dull them with a stout ale. <br>
<br>
The memory of my first days among the Edger's as they called themselves warmed me. It was the closest thing to a home I had felt in many a season. They were good people, and Aaldari, while brash and simply spoken was a woman of great honor. I saw in her eyes pain and trials unspoken, her eyes were much like my own. We spoke at length of many things for we had both been witness to great evil. In her I saw a great leader and possibly for the first time since my family's death, hope. <br>
<br>
She had drawn to her a varied group of people, some born to the light others companions to the darkness. It surprised me to see them all defer to this woman with the same respect. She told me of many other members in her house scattered across the lands of Norrath and Luclin. Some in the house regarded me with a cautious eye but others were welcoming. I shared my story with Aaldari, for if she were to accept me she needed the truth. I was a hunted woman in the lands surrounding Freeport and she deserved to know why. <br>
<br>
“So it was you?” She regarded me with a critical eye. “You were the one laying waste to the militia?”<br>
<br>
“Aye.” <br>
<br>
“You have strength.” She said.<br>
<br>
“I am a murderer. I hid in shadows as a coward.”<br>
<br>
“I’ll not argue with ye about bein a murderer.” She nodded at me. “But...vengeance is a powerful thing. It clouds yer mind an drives ye to things ye wouldn't normally do. I don't see a coward in ye, no, a coward would not have told me what ye have this day. I stand by what I said, ye have strength.”<br>
<br>
I simply lowered my head in acceptance of her words. Though this woman before me lacked formal education she held a wisdom I had only seen in a handful of people before her. “Time will tell if this strength you see will last.”<br>
<br>
“Yer a stubborn wench, I'll tell ye right now!” She laughed at me. “I’m not blind Nishal, ye have a heart born of light. Yeh've been denying it fer too long!” <br>
<br>
“That may be true, but until the day comes that I can see and feel it for myself, the words mean nothing.”<br>
<br>
“Aye,” she nodded, “The road to redemption is a long one indeed. Yeh'll need the strength I see and then some to see it to the end.”  She paused looking at me thoughtfully. “I know more than most what kind o' trials ye face now. Sometimes it feels like yer heart is screaming. I know this, but I can’t advise ye.”<br>
<br>
“I know. The choices are as they always have been. Mine.” I sighed, the weight of what I had done settled around me with fierce oppression. <br>
<br>
“Indeed.”<br>
<br>
I shook the gathering clouds away, for there was still something I had to do before I could truly seek redemption. “I must beg your leave for a few days. There is someone I must meet.”<br>
<br>
Aaldari turned a hard eye on me. “The Tier'Dal.” She said cooly. <br>
<br>
“Yes.” I nodded. “Shadow or Light she takes great risk in meeting me. She has the right to know I will not be back.”<br>
<br>
“I'll not say I understand.” She said finally. “And I dun think I'll persuade ye not to go. Ye will have a companion. Groger will go with ye. Yeh'll not be walking into the den of snakes unprotected.”<br>
<br>
I thought to argue. Looking at this woman I knew that would be a futile endeavor, I would loose...badly. “Very well, I plan to leave at dusk. It is safer for me to travel by night and I would not put Groger to risk being seen with me.”<br>
<br>
“Fair enough. And Nishal, this should be clear, I expect the both o ye ta be returning to us. Understood?”<br>
<br>
I nodded. “Understood.”<br>
<br>
<br>
To be continued....<br>
<br>
Who is this Tier'Dal woman? What part does she have to play in Nishal's past, present and future? These answers and more next time!  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://atlas.imagemagician.com/images/nishal/nishal_lights2.jpeg " style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.showPrevMessage?topicID=120.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.showNextMessage?topicID=120.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=120.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.emailToFriend?topicID=120.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.threadControl?topicID=120.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=120.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=120.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub145.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="theedgersfrm17">Guild Announcements<option value="theedgersfrm9">You Have the Floor<option value="theedgersfrm32">Epics<option value="theedgersfrm12">The Soapbox<option value="theedgersfrm34">Testing Grounds<option value="theedgersfrm10">The Sales Room<option value="theedgersfrm13">Ye Seeking to Join Us?<option value="theedgersfrm21">Events<option value="theedgersfrm22">Raids<option value="theedgersfrm20">The Lunatic Fringe Tavern<option value="theedgersfrm15">Dude, Where's My Sword?<option value="theedgersfrm18">Postcards From The Edgers<option value="theedgersfrm30">The Game Room<option value="theedgersfrm23">Over the Edge<option value="theedgersfrm11">Training<option value="theedgersfrm19">The Armory<option value="theedgersfrm33">The Wishing Well<option value="theedgersfrm35">Suggestion Box<option value="theedgersfrm26">Officer Outpost</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FF0000>- </font><a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/btheedgers>The Edgers (Faveo Sulum Ipsemet Ascio)</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20>The Lunatic Fringe Tavern</a> <font color=#FF0000> - </font><a href="http://www.theedgers.com">Faveo Sulum Ipsemet Ascio</a><font color=#FF0000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
