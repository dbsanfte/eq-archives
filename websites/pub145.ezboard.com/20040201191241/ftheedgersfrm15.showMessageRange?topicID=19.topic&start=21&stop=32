<br>
It was a fine laggy day in Grimling Forest. Ephexian ran around rather methodically as he entered the zone. Put on swimming trunks, jump in the river and swim in the dark peace of the waters. Ephexian liked the river. It reminded him of Oasis...<br>
<br>
As he was about halfway down the waterway, he recieved a tell (Good thing for Free Nights and Weekends). <br>
<br>
&quot;Har har!&quot;<br>
&quot;?&quot; &lt;---- (l337 speak for 'huh?')<br>
&quot;Hail Ephexian from the Champions! This be Gnostik and we be requiring your assistance in the ways of Crance 'The Acrylia Freak'.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, why sure I'd be glad to help!&quot;<br>
<br>
So as the champions made thier way to the outpost, Ephexian swam around a bit, killed a few hundred grimling, swam around a bit more, took a nap, drooled on the vah shir shields, took a shower in the waterfall, sent provacative tells to Nynnia, swam around a bit more, then finally settled down at the Vah Shir outpost.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Ephexian, meet Crance and Steoff! Crance needs acrylia and Steoff even rivals your sleeping abilities. Shall we be off?&quot;<br>
&quot;Ready to rumble!&quot;<br>
<br>
So the hearty crew took off for Acrylia Caverns...<br>
<br>
[Acrylia Mines]<br>
&quot;DING!&quot;<br>
&quot;Oy!<br>
&quot;Oy!&quot;<br>
&quot;Congratulations Mimi!&quot;<br>
&quot;Heeep! Thanks everyone! I'm so excited because I just got my new charm spell! I can't wait to try it out!&quot;<br>
&quot;Ooooh, I dare you to charm lino over there into taking a shower.&quot;<br>
&quot;Hahahaa!&quot;<br>
&quot;LOL&quot;<br>
<br>
*grumble*<br>
&quot;Yeah, those casters always make fun of us while we get stuck wacking at this wall for these stupid ores. What are they for anyways?&quot;<br>
&quot;Hell if I know, some alien always comes around and beats me up and takes them. I hate those aliens. They look wierd and say strange things like... 'l337 and w00t'...&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, strange bunch they are. Hope we can make it to camp before we get jumped...&quot;<br>

<br>
[Entrance to Acrylia Caverns]<br>
&quot;Man, these little Grimling dudes sure look funny&quot;.<br>
&quot;You got that right Steoff, and they say funny things like 'Oy and Eeeep!'&quot;<br>
&quot;Har har!&quot;<br>
&quot;Ohh, look one of them is coming over now...&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Oy! Heeep! oogelibagiliboo&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&quot;Hehehe, see I told you! Oy&quot;<br>
&quot;Oy!&quot;<br>
&quot;Eeep!&quot;<br>
&quot;LOL&quot;<br>
&quot;Owie! He's attacking!&quot;<br>
&quot;Beat him up and see if he has any ores!&quot;<br>
&quot;Bah.. ok&quot;<br>
<br>
The hearty crew made short work of the miner and indeed got thier ore. It wasn't long before they got in &quot;the zone&quot;.<br>
<br>
[Acrylia Mines]<br>
&quot;OMG! What happened Lino?&quot;<br>
&quot;Damnit you were right. They beat me up and took my ore&quot;<br>
&quot;LOL, see I told you&quot;<br>
&quot;Well I tried to be nice and offerred them some blessed food and drink but then they started insulting my mother... I swear they can speak Grimling...&quot;<br>
&quot;That's strange, maybe they are intelligent after all...uh oh.. here comes Mimi and she looks pissed&quot;<br>
&quot;What happened to you Lino?&quot;<br>
&quot;Those aliens beat me up and took my ores&quot;<br>
&quot;Damn those aliens! I'll avenge you Lino!&quot;<br>
&quot;...&quot;<br>
&quot;?&quot;<br>
&quot;Dude, did you see that?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, what's up with Mimi?&quot;<br>
&quot;I bet she has a crush on you&quot;<br>
&quot;Shut up man, she doesn't!&quot;<br>
&quot;Damn, well she didn't up and 'defend my honor' when I got beat up!&quot;<br>
&quot;Whatever, just get back to work. We need to make up for all the lost ores those aliens are gonna take from us&quot;<br>
*sigh* &quot;yeah, you're right...&quot;<br>
<br>
[Entrance to Acrylia Caverns]<br>
&quot;Ready for a caster?&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, they make me use up a lot of mana&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't be a wimp, I'm pulling...here's one right now. Incoming &lt;&lt; Manathingymabopper &gt;&gt;&quot;<br>
&quot;OOhh.. sounds interesting&quot;<br>
<br>
As Ephexian pulled the caster he was hit by a spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll try and sneak up for a backstab&quot;<br>
&quot;Ok, medding for heals... owe... watch that axe Ephexian, you accidentally hit me... owe, OUCH! Damnit, he's attacking me!&quot;<br>
&quot;No he's attacking ME!&quot;<br>
&quot;OY!&quot;<br>
&quot;Dude, I think he's charmed... lets go Steoff! Zone out now!&quot;<br>
&quot;Sleepy... sleepy&quot;<br>
&quot;Grab Steoff and zone out before Ephexian waxes us.&quot;<br>
<br>
[Acrylia Mines: 5 minutes later]<br>
&quot;OMG! Mimi, are you ok?&quot;<br>
&quot;Owie..hehe, i got a little beat up but it was well worth it. I used my new charm spell on the pale dumb one and made him beat up his alien buddies a bit and even got a sleep spell off on one of the others. You should have seen it!&quot;<br>
&quot;Awe.. poor Mimi, lets get you some bandages for your bruises and cuts&quot;<br>
&quot;Err...I'll be mining some ores over THERE. Way over there. Give you room to 'bandage'. Cya two!&quot; /snicker<br>
&quot;Don't listen to Olof, he is dumb. I'll go grab a cleric and you'll be golden&quot;<br>
<br>
Well the brave bunch of Champions and Edger farmed the night away. Steoff eventually woke up and Crance got more ores. Gnostik tried to tank some and Ephexian even got charmed a couple more times. None of them could yet understand Grimling but maybe after a few more runs and charms, the language will become more understandable. Olof is still in the caves mining ores and Mimi and Lino ran off together to charm aliens in the harder stretches of Acrylia. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~wombat/WombatX_sig.jpg"><BR>

<br>
The hearty edger crew made their way to Trakanon's Teeth. Everyone waited in anticipation of &quot;UGLI SEB&quot; night. For some it would be thier first trip to Old Sebilis, but little did they know how UGLI it was going to get. <br>
<br>
&quot;I love you wubbi cakes&quot;<br>
&quot;I love you too Pooh bear&quot;<br>
&quot;Not as much as I love you...&quot;<br>
&quot;For the love of Tunare, shut...&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Nynnia tells Ephexian, &quot;Awe, don't spoil their fun Eph.. love is in the air&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ephexian tells Nynnia, &quot;Gah, ok fine&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
*grumble grumble*<br>
<br>
Nynnia gave Ephexian a scolding look then turned around. Ephexian felt a bit distracted. Maybe he was thinking of Evaline. Why did she have to go and cancel tonight anyways. He was supposed to meet her in Shadow Haven later on, but &quot;things&quot; came up. Women... sometimes best not to think about them... yet for a certain few, that task can be a great impossibility.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok everyoen, lest go turn in those medalions and get the trak keys for Cadldonr and Rose&quot;<br>
&quot;Sounds like a plan&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't we have to wait for Val?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, i bet his big forehead is slowing him down...&quot;<br>
&quot;Eph!&quot;<br>
&quot;Oopsie, I mean he sure is slow sometimes&quot;<br>
&quot;Happy Birthday Pooh bear!&quot;<br>
&quot;Not yet hunny bunny, a few hours yet&quot;<br>
*giggles* &quot;Awe... ok nookums, just got a little excited is all&quot;<br>
&quot;Thank the heavens! Val is back!&quot;<br>
&quot;Sorry for the delay everyone.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ok, lets rolL ouT!&quot;<br>
<br>
Neshikin sowed the lot of them and the crew started making thier way towards the turn in guy. It wasn't long before the band of edgers was winding, twisting, and turning thier way through the humid jungle.<br>
<br>
&quot;OMG! Where the hell are we going? I'm getting sea sick here&quot;<br>
&quot;Jusrt a bit farher now&quot;<br>
&quot;Gah, it figures... women drivers...&quot;<br>
&quot;Good one Val!&quot;<br>
&quot;What was that Eph?!&quot;<br>
&quot;Er.... Good fun Val!&quot; *groan*<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Nynnia glowers at you threateningly, what would you like your tombstone to say?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> *sigh*<br>
&quot;Aggro!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Everyone turned around to face the coming threats. It seemed that Caldorn was attracting quite a crowd with his summoned pet treats, &quot;Tasty Chews&quot; (TM). Since it's invention it's really kept everyone's pets in check, however it apparently gave off a very &quot;tastey&quot; smell which put the edgers in their current situation. Frogloks, trakanosaurs, and even elrosi plants ran, sprinted, and shambled thier way to get to the delicious smell. Nynnia was mezzing and tashing while Valetudo was busy keeping everyone alive from the growing onslaught.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heal mana low!&quot;<br>
&quot;We can't keep doing this. We have to move! Go to that wall&quot;<br>
<br>
Everyone ran as fast as they could towards the mountain wall. However as the mezzes faded, quite surprisingly only a few (extremely hungry) of the mob gave chase. The others darted back into the depths of the jungle.<br>
<br>
&quot;That was wierd. I wonder why... oh look! We're almost there&quot;<br>
<br>
Surveying the landscape ahead of them, Spectral Curates and Spectral Keepers could be seen hovering over thier graves. On closer inspection, the ghosts almost seemed to be systematically patrolling the area as guards to a lost city in ages long past.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, wereer almost there. Lets ITU and gret thoses keys.&quot;<br>
&quot;Come again?&quot;<br>
&quot;Just invis us to undead Val&quot;<br>
&quot;I knew that&quot;<br>
&quot;It's not taking on me for some reason&quot;<br>
&quot;Neither on myself as well&quot;<br>
&quot;I believe you have to be grouped for the spell to take effect&quot;<br>
&quot;Good point Ephexian, why don't you group with them&quot;<br>
&quot;Ok....wait, NOOOOOO!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ephexian cringed as he grouped up with Tarheall and Rosewolfe. He would just have to concentrate on the task at hand and things would be ok. <br>
<br>
&quot;ITU coming right up&quot;<br>
&quot;Happy Birthday Pooh bear!&quot;<br>
&quot;Not yet hunny bunny, still some hours yet&quot;<br>
*giggles* &quot;Awe... ok nookums, didn't want to miss it is all&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Serenity now...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Without to much of a hitch, Caldorn and Rosewolfe got thier trakanon idol. Tarheall took his sweetheart back to civiliation then returned to the group so that they could continue on thier adventure. Everyone received Invisibility to Undead, and Nynnia once again took the lead. Everyone stealthly made thier way past the guards, but Neshikin who was caught in mid-ranger-disco-dance. After Neshikin was expertly slaughtered by the patrolling undead, rezzed and patched back up, the crew finally started thier winding path to what they've been waiting for the entire evening: Old Sebilis.<br>

<br>
“Watch it bonehead!”<br>
“Yanno you wouldn’t get snow down your armor if you didn’t move around so much!”<br>
“OOF!! Grrr watch your foot!”<br>
The three giants shuffled around each other trying not to reveal their position in the snow.<br>
“Okay who peed in Adjutant ------‘s coffee that we got the crappy assignment???”<br>
“I don’t know but lying in wait for some stupid dorf isn’t my idea of a good time.”<br>
“OW! I said watch your foot!”<br>
“Dude it wasn’t me.”<br>
“Well if it wasn’t you, then who. . .”<br>
Aryon shouts, “Death Squad to Kael!”<br>
“Get him!”<br>
“Those little blue guys run fast don’t they?”<br>
<br>
A bit later. . .<br>
<br>
Nynnia shouts, “Who ordered a chanter with extra cheese?”<br>
Aryon shout, “YAY! HELP ME! Stupid death squads!”<br>
<br>
“Dude, did you hear him?”<br>
“He is sooooo dead.  I am gonna squash him! Forget the stupid dorf.  I am going after the blueberry in the funny armor.”<br>
<br>
Nynnia shouts, “Stupid pet is agroing half the zone! Grrr”<br>
Nynnia says, “I r here.”<br>
Aryon, “Thank god, cause I broke Sinfonian’s record on death squads.”<br>
Nynnia, “Good ol’ Fred will help us here.”<br>
<br>
“OMG, what did they do to Fred?”<br>
“Fred! What did that grape person do to you?”<br>
<br>
Fred stares ahead blankly and drools.<br>
<br>
“OOF! Fred why did you step on me?”<br>
“GET THEM!!!”<br>
Nynnia shouts, “Death Squad to Kael!”<br>
A little while later . . .<br>
Aryon shouts, “Death Squad to Kael!”<br>
Nynnia shouts, “sigh”<br>
A lithe form trots up beside them, “What are we running for?”<br>
“REENOWN!”<br>
“Um hun, run Death Squad right on our tails.”<br>
“Why do they look so ticked?”<br>
“I think we stepped on something we shouldn’t have, one is limping.”<br>
“Ack!”<br>
<br>
“Whohoo my pet is ubah! He has a rapier!”<br>
“Nynnia hun, should have charmed the other one, he was duel wielding.”<br>
”DOH!”<br>
“Charge!!!”<br>
“DOH!”<br>
“Death Squad to Kael!”<br>
“Revenge for Fred!!!”<br>
<br>
A little bit later. . .<br>
<br>
“Fred, Gah find Tanik already!”<br>
“Nynnia, I thought you said this pet trick helps?”<br>
“Well maybe if I charm a Wally. . .”<br>
“Well at least we are finding the death squads quicker.”<br>
“Wait no really I think he found Tanik this time.  He seems. . intense.”<br>
Fred thinks to himself: Just wait till I land them on my buddies this time.  Stupid chanters and clerics and fuzzy-whatever-that-guy-is and their stupid quests!  I’ll shove Coldains up their. . .<br>
<br>
You stumble in the snow and reveal an injured coldain!<br>
You have been ambushed by frost giants!<br>
<br>
Nynnia says, “WTF??”<br>
Reenownn says, “Run?”<br>
Aryon screams, “NOOOO THEY KILLED TANIK!!!”<br>
Aryon sobs.<br>
“Fred dude, why you hitting me?”<br>
“Cause that wench in red told me to.”<br>
Wally the frost giant immediately attacks the wench in red to save his good buddy Fred.<br>
Reenownn says, “Didn’t you say run if the death squad is spawned? What are you guys doing?”<br>
Aryon stands in the snow, sobbing, not wanting to live anymore.  He contemplated putting his account up for sale and wondering if he can get more than $5 for it.<br>
<br>
Nynnia in the meantime is making a nice round circle in the snow right around Reenownn and the crying cleric, pretending to be a druid and kiting a giant behind her, pretending he is snared and praying her charmed pet, Fred does not come after her.<br>
<br>
“ARYON TANIK IS NOT DEAD!!! TURN THE PIECE IN OWIEEEEEEEEESSSS!!!!”<br>
Aryon pokes the coldain lying in the snow.<br>
“Ow dude, why you poke me for?”<br>
&lt;sniffles&gt; “You are not dead?”<br>
“Gimmah gate potion! Ya I will bring reinforcements, sure I will.  Dude gimmah the lewts.”<br>
Reenownn starts to get dizzy watching  Nynnia play ring-around-the-rosy.<br>
<br>
Wally seeing the cleric helping the coldain they had been trying find becomes enraged and starts to pretend his fist is hammer and Aryon’s helmet is a nail.<br>
“ow.”<br>
“ow.”<br>
“um ow.”<br>
Wally says, “Silly enchantress, tash is for kids!” and promptly starts chasing her round and round the circle.<br>
<br>
Aryon proclaims, “WOOT I GOT IT!!”<br>
Nynnia shouts, “Death squad to Kael! Finally!”<br>
<br>
Reenownn and Nynnia break out of the circle and head to the end of the ramp and start heading down the ramp into Kael.  Aryon, still bent over the coldain, did not notice his brain had actually been beaten out of his head and was lying in the snow.  He stood up and last thing he had heard was to run to Kael, so that’s where he headed.  But since his brain was no longer in his head, he forgot he did not have levitation.  He also forgot about the ramp.  He also forgot he could not fly.<br>
<br>
Nynnia and Reenownn looked up as they heard “Aieeeeeeeeeeeeee!” and then a thud.  They saw the blueberry flying through the air and land in a crumpled heap and the bottom of the cliff.  Sighing they continued their run into Kael.  <br>
<br>
A little while later they returned and Reenownn stuffed Aryon’s brain back into his head.  Nynnia dragged the body to the top of the ramp to wait for Aryon to return life to his body.  “Look at the skinny blueberry! Nynnia cried.  Reenown, still looking at Aryon’s lifeless body asked, “So do you think they kick him out of C.P.R.G. because of this?  Since he didn’t prevent his own ranger gate?”<br>
<br>
The story continues with Aryon enlisting Reenownn on revenge for her making fun of his nekkid body. . . <br>
