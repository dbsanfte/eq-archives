-= Tabathia and Drifterr: Chapter 1 =-<br>
<br>
        A bitterly cold wind howled across the frigid tundra of Everfrost, just south of the town of Halas.<br>
The shaman, known to all as Drifterr, rummaged through his belt pouch and backpack, taking note of his supplies before journeying forth again through the lands of Norrath.<br>
        Unknown to him, motes of light were coalescing around a book-topped pedestal behind his crouched body, then all he knew was the feeling of being pressed face-first into the hard packed snow, and a heavy form pressed down upon his back.<br>
        &quot;Mmmrrf mmr me!&quot;, he shouted, voice muffled by the snow, as he rolled out from under his assailant, grabbing his staff and bringing to mind the few offensive spells he knew. As he looked up, he saw a female feline form standing over him, shaking with barely contained mirth.<br>
        &quot;Relax, Drifterr, my mother and father sent me to assist you in your training, although between you and me, I think they're more concerned that someone keeps an eye on me!&quot;, the young Vah Shir woman said, idly spinning a crystalline dagger in one hand.<br>
<br>
        &quot;And who might those parents be, cat?&quot;, he gruffly responded, whilst wiping the snow from his recently acquired leathers and kilt.<br>
        &quot;Sebathia Khati'Sha, and Tanj Dar'Khura, noble protectors of House Royal, and the City of Shar Vahl, and I am Tabathia, their daughter. Although you can call me Tabbie, everyone else does.&quot;, she said simply. &quot;This place is cold, damn cold, how do you furless barbarians keep warm up here?&quot;<br>
<br>
        &quot;Strong liquor, and warm women!&quot;, Drifterr chuckled. &quot;So, where exactly does our path take us, or are we expected to fend for ourselves and see the world with our eyes wide open?&quot;.<br>
The Vah Shir girl cocked her head to the side for a moment, and then grinned. &quot;I hear the bandits of the Karana's are troubling peasant farmers again. We should re-educate them.&quot;<br>
<br>
        It took them four long days to reach the westernmost edge of the Plains of Karana, fending off attacks from ice goblins, orcs, giant white spiders and even a mammoth calf. Tabathia led the pair through the gnoll 'city' of Blackburrow, scarcely avoiding a courier from another tribe of gnolls who almost blew their cover. Upon reaching the Hills surrounding Qeynos, the western human city of Antonica, they headed south-east until they found the Plains opening up before them like some vast verdant green canvas.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Look! A fire burns, and it is too early in the day for a cookfire!&quot;, Drifterr pointed out across the grassland at a small farmstead. &quot;I think we've found our bandits.&quot;, agreed Tabbie, suddenly serious.<br>
The pair ran as carefully as they could through the tall grass, anxious to help the local farmers, yet not willing to run headlong into an ambush.<br>
<br>
        &quot;Wait here, I'll get their attention&quot;, the young scout said to her companion, and leapt up into the roof of the barn. A sharp cry rang out, and a rough-shaven man ran out of the building, pulling a dart from his behind as he did so. At that point, Drifterr waved his staff around, and launched a small bolt of flame at the bandit, getting his full attention. The pair fought feverishly for a few short seconds, until Tabathia dropped back out of the barn and placed her crystal knife, firmly between the man's shoulderblades.<br>
<br>
        Between the pair's careful actions and planning, the bandits were slain within minutes. The farmers were thankful, except for one who proceeded to attack Drifterr, claiming he was the leader of the bandit group. After receiving several raps on the head from the shaman's staff however, he soon ceased his complaints.<br>
<br>
        Walking away from the grateful plainsfolk, Drifterr noticed his companion handing him a leg of chicken. &quot;I don't remember them giving us food for our journey.&quot;, he commented. &quot;They meant to, I just took it upon myself to save them the trouble of remembering to offer!&quot;, Tabbie laughed.<br>
