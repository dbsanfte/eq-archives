It was a long boat ride (they always seem to be) to the new continent. It was Ephexian's first time in Kunark. As the boat pulled up to the docks he marveled at the wonderous statue towering high above the small establishment known as Firiona Vie. The town bustled with energy as pilgrims from accross the lands came to make this thier new home. Already what he saw made him marvel at life's resilient ability to thrive in the face of darkness. <br>
<br>
Ephexian quickly found a caster to bind his essense at "THE BRIDGE (tm)" before setting out for what was know as the Dreadlands. After navigating through what seemed an endless tunnel, Ephexian arrived at his new hunting grounds.<br>
<br>
"Greetings Ephexian, nice to see 'new blood' here in the dreadlands"<br>
"Damnit Valetudo, don't jump up on me like that! You scared me to death!"<br>
"Death...what is death but a release into a greater ..."<br>
<br>
Ephexian nodded his head and pretended to listen as the vampire-cleric spoke on length about the virtures of proper undead hygene and the conflicts it pose in his daily clerical duties. Ephexian just thought it was a conflic of interest plain as day but didn't have the heart to tell the man...vampire.<br>
<br>
"...trick was to try and convince the couple of a night wedding... LO and behold, Neshikin approaches! Greetings brother!"<br>
<br>
Ephexian looked up to see the ranger emerge from behind some ruins. He smiled at Ephexian knowing all to well what was going on. <br>
<br>
"Hail brothers! Let us not sit around wasting away when there is game to hunt. Come, lets adventure forth and rid this land of it's vile oppressors!"<br>
"Before we go, do you want to see my missing head trick?"<br>
"Show us on the way..."<br>
"Well, not really a trick as one of those quirky undead side effects..."<br>
<br>
Valetudo lifted his hood to reveal the back side of what should have been his head. Ephexian gasped in horror when all he saw was emptiness.<br>
<br>
"Good thing for celestial healing, eh?..."<br>
"Stop goofing off back there guys, lets go!"<br>
<br>
Ephexian picked up his pace to catch up with the striding Neshikin. Vampire or not, Valetudo was a great cleric and wonderful guy. Ephexian was happy to see his friends once again. <br>
<br>
After a bit of searching, the three met up with some others and decided to begin hunting near some ruined buildings. Ephexian was quite perplexed at the ease at which they crushed thier foes. Monster after monster fell to either sword or spell of the skilled party. <br>
<br>
"Wow Neshikin, I can't believe how easy this is!"<br>
"Trust me, it aint always this easy. I remember one time..."<br>
<br>
Before Neshikin could finish his sentence, 30 drachnid warriors slew the ranger. Ephexian swore he heard one of the drachnids mutter something about 'not picking on the poor guy all the time', but then all the drachnids quickly ran off laughing thinking it a good joke.<br>
<br>
"Hi all, I was just passing through and...hey does he need help?"<br>
<br>
Ephexian turned around to see what was going on and before you know it, Neshiskin was back on his feet mumbling something about 'damn drachnids'.<br>
<br>
"Ok, good luck everyone!"<br>
<br>
In a matter of the drop of a feather, Neshikin was slain by a dracnid horde and then ressurected just as fast. When everyone went to thank the cleric she was gone.<br>
<br>
"That reminds me of the time a fellow cleric thought I was dead and tried to ressurect me..."<br>
<br>
Ephexian chuckled to himself softly as he thought of the crazy adventures that were sure to come in this new land. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~wombat/WombatX_sig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub46.ezboard.com/uaaldaridrachenfuer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aaldari Drachenfuer</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.enter.net/~betzenberger/Skeleton.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Wench</span><br>  Posts: 373<br> <font color=#FF0000>(10/31/01 4:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm15.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.enter.net/~betzenberger/aa.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_tongue.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Ephexian is stuck in...</span><hr size=1> I wanna go! *stamps her foot*<br>

<br>
[Thurgadin: City of the short people]<br>
"As you can see students, this is the first bridge that enters into Thurgadin City. Be careful of the ice Bobby, it's a long drop to the bottom."<br>
"Can I drop a copper to see how far it falls?"<br>
"ECHO....(echo...echo...echo).."<br>
"Are we there yet?"<br>
"Now behave children, this is our first field trip to Thurg and we don't want to upset the dwarves."<br>
<br>
As the small group of children carefully follow their teacher, Neshikin comes strolling across the brige to enter the city.<br>
<br>
"Hey bobby, check out that wood elf dude."<br>
"Wanna see something funny? My dad taught me this one!"<br>
<br>
As our unsuspecting Neshikins starts crossing the bridge, young bobby casts sow on Neshikin right as his foot touches the ice. Before you know it our brave ranger is at the bottom of the pit.<br>
<br>
"Wahahahahah"<br>
*snicker snicker*<br>
"Now class that is NOT funny at all. Lets hurry along before the dwarves wonder about all this commotion."<br>
<br>
[Pit bottom in Thurgadin]<br>
"owwe...what happened? Where am I?....what is this?"<br>
<br>
Neshikin finds himself at the bottom of bridge pit in Thurgadin with no way out. Seeing something scratched on the wall, Neshikin walks over to check it out.<br>

It was a lazy day in the Dreadlands. Everything was as it should be. Aaldari was sunbathing in her bathing suit, Neshikin was doing his Ranger Disco Dance, Teannin was stabbing a few Drolvargs, and even Jalyna was around watching her friends. Valetudo was not too far away at Karnor's Train Station rezzing all the passengers that got a little too close to the train tracks.<br>
<br>
Things were perfect... too perfect. The darkness looked down at all the happiness and joy and knew this could not be. It knew that it could not let all this fun-loving exp gathering to continue. It looked around for it's oportunity and saw a host they would not expect. Perfect...too perfect.<br>
<br>
&quot;Heya everyone!&quot;<br>
&quot;Look Epexian's here!&quot;<br>
*groan*<br>
&quot;What was that?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh...um, just my stomach..havn't eaten yet.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, ok. Mind if I help?&quot;<br>
<br>
The palladin hung around his friends healing and buffing as they would have expected. However during a couple of fights Neshikin noticed Ephexian attacking some of the monsters they were killing. The look in his eye just didn't seem right..<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you ok Ephexian? What are you doing?&quot;<br>
&quot;...killing...I mean helping out with the mobbies. Just to make things go faster&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, ok...&quot;<br>
<br>
Things were going smoothly, almost too smoothly. Aaldari was (a)luring in all the drolvargs and the killing was fast. Neshikin noticed Ephexian was helping out a lot more on the kills.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you sure you are ok Ephexian?&quot;<br>
&quot;...must KS...&quot;<br>
&quot;WHAT?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh I mean, I wonder how Valetudo is doing in KC&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh...&quot;<br>
<br>
No matter how hard the darkness tried, it couldn't get the desired results. Right when it was about to steal the kill, the host would sit down tired, or start practicing with a hammer. What a wuss! This host was completely incompentent so it moved on to another...yes...this will work perfectly. First it had to take care of a few loose ends.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Hey guys lets move to a better spot. This place has even BETTER experience&quot;<br>
&quot;Sure&quot;<br>
&quot;Sounds like a good idea&quot;<br>
<br>
Aaldari looked at Ephexian and noticed he was staring off into space.<br>
<br>
&quot;You coming Eph?&quot;<br>
&quot;Huh, where am I?&quot;<br>
&quot;Heh, typical...just follow us&quot;<br>
<br>
[Karnor's Castle - 5 minutes later]<br>

&quot;It'll be ok. The Dreadlands are great experience...&quot;<br>

The darkness laughed to itself. What an ingenious plan...almost flawless if not for the palladin.

I have snorted an entire perogie through my nose because I was not smart enough to stop eating on put it down before reading one of Ephexian's stories.<br>
<br>
Where do you come up with stuff?  OMG I could read this for days.  Well that is if I could learn to breathe instead dying from laughter.<br>
<br>
IN Neshikin's and I's defense, the cleric and warrior in our group decided that CHAIN-PULLING was not fast enough for them and moved us to another spot.  Might I add I was the group leader.  Half the group was over there before I could say something.  Also after last night I have come to realize something.<br>
<br>
Dreadlands is an evil cursed place!  I swear a spot looks totally innocent and empty of spawn.  Even if you run around.  But bring a group over to that little patch of pixels and start whapping on one thing...next thing you know, yer dead before you even know its a bad spot.<br>

<br>
JK of course.  Ask Brillig.  Two things that drive me nuts is using good instead of well and using left instead of let.  Example: I left the cat out.  Instead of: I let the cat out.<br>
<br>
People around here do it CONSTANTLY.  (The town I live in not the board)  The funniest part is they then also use let where left is apropriate.  LOL<br>

It's hard work as lord of the manor. It's bad enough that I have to be waited on by embecile dark elves, but those idiot undead always drop my hoe hoes. Life as a troll is tough.<br>
<br>
&quot;My glass is still empty!&quot;<br>

[Mistmoore Castle: The Edgers Raid]<br>
Ephexian stumbled into Mistmoore. He was late as all could be but hey, not like these things start on time anyways, right? It looked like things were about ready to go!<br>
<br>
&quot;Heya everyone!&quot;<br>
&quot;EPH!&quot;<br>

<br>
After a bit of fumbling around, The Edgers found the valley area. They needed a drop for Cyphan so that he could become uber. LOL, like anyone in faveo could be uber... Ephexian sat wondering what everyone else was thinking...<br>

Not to be turned around by the likes of death, our hearty Edgers sat determined to attain the much coveted hilt from Xicotl. Some still shivered where they sat, remembering the cold clutches of death they came back from just moments ago. Some thought of other things...<br>
<br>
&quot;So when are we going back to the hot tub? Those chics were hot!&quot;<br>
&quot;Umm, Neshikin they killed you&quot;<br>
&quot;Tuff love baby, tuff love&quot;<br>
&quot;Stay focused man!&quot;<br>
&quot;You guys ready yet? I'll pull!&quot;<br>
*Collective sigh*<br>
<br>
[Mistmoore Castle: The Bathroom]<br>
&quot;That was a close one. Good thing the master didn't hear all that commotion&quot;<br>
&quot;How could he? He's watching 'her'...&quot;<br>
&quot;What, are you jealous or something! hahahah!&quot;<br>
&quot;Shut up! Not like you would understand&quot;<br>
&quot;Yeah, I bet you like wearing that outfit. HE sure does!&quot;<br>
&quot;He's my ticket out of this place! He told me he'd make me a star&quot;<br>
&quot;Ooh loo voo kay say ah ve qua, se sha&quot; *Moulan Rouge music in the background*<br>
&quot;OMG! That's not even the right lyrics!&quot;<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I thought it sounded beautiful...oops</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
&quot;Who goes there!?&quot;<br>
<br>
Neshikin pops into view sitting in the hot bath 'Hough Heffner Style' with his arms around both dark elf women.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, how you ladies doing tonight?&quot;<br>
&quot;OMG, what are you doing!?&quot;<br>
&quot;C'mon loosen up a little. You call your friends, I call my friends, we can be friends...&quot;<br>
&quot;I'm sooo embarrassed!&quot;<br>
&quot;Kill him!&quot;<br>
&quot;No wait! Mikol made me do it!&quot;<br>
<br>
[Back in the Cemetary]<br>
&quot;Jeez, wonder what's taking Neshi so long?&quot;<br>
&quot;Who knows, maybe he got lost&quot;<br>
&quot;INC!!&quot;<br>
&quot;Here we go!&quot;<br>
<br>
The crew stood up to battle the incoming threat as Neshikin rushed back to the cemetary. The battle was fierce as the mob seemed determined to make Neshikin and his friends permanant residents on the ground on which they stood.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey Mikol, can I get a heal please?&quot;<br>
&quot;Sure thing Aaldari&quot;<br>
&quot;That's the guy, KILL HIM!&quot;<br>
<br>
Before anyone could do anything, all the enemies turned on Mikol and separated life from limb. The hearty crew doubled thier efforts and brought the battle to an end.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn, they REALLY didn't like Mikol. I wonder why?&quot;<br>
&quot;uhhh....no clue.....&quot;<br>
&quot;Sorry Mikol, I'll revive you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once the band of Edgers revived Mikol and got situated Neshikin went back to pull again.<br>
<br>
[Mistmoore Bathroom]<br>
&quot;So....any of you ladies need a scrub?&quot;<br>
&quot;Die!&quot;<br>
