<br>
<br>
One who is in difficulty and doesn’t make plans is impoverished; one who is impoverished and doesn’t fight is lost.<br>
                                                   Sun-tzu, The Art of War<br>
<br>
<br>
   “Stop thief!!!”  Yelled a voice in the night.<br>
 A silhouette of a man could be seen in the dim moonlight running across the rooftops. Then disappearing in the shadows.<br>
 Alarm bells rang out as the city of Neriak was put on high alert. The guards doubled at the gates and patrols of ghouls sent out in search of the thief. Their search was to no avail, and the thief had slipped through their defenses the prize stolen.<br>
 Angry Teir`Dal filled the council chambers. Loud angry voices shouting accusations and threats filled the air. Distrust was high. <br>
 Suddenly the high shrieking of the ghoul guards rang through the chamber. Then silence, a low voice began to speak. “ We shall hunt down this thief. Kill him and his entire family. Then return the Mystical orb to its rightful place.<br>
<br>
   The thief reached his home before the early morning light a small glowing orb placed carefully in a bag under his cloak. Slipping into his house unseen he hides the bag with the orb under a lose floorboard in a closet. Then quickly checks on his wife and child.<br>
 “Good their still asleep” He thinks to himself. “Now to set my plan in motion.” <br>
 Almost before he completes his last thought. The door to his home bursts open. A sickly stench fills the room. He draws his blades waiting for the first attack. Suddenly and with unnatural speed two ghoulish creatures move into the room hissing and chattering. They smell the air and quickly find the prey they have tracked through out the night. In a flurry of attacks they leap to the kill. The thief throws a dagger home. Hitting one of the ghouls between the eyes instantly killing it. The second ghoul slashes the thief with a ghoulish blade. The thief fends off the attack and thrusts his sword deep into the ghoul’s side. The ghoul’s body goes limp as he pulls his sword free.<br>
 A sudden scream comes from the upstairs room where his wife and child are. A thought of horror flashed through his head. He rushed up the stairs and into the room. Yet another of the ghoulish creatures is there leering over the body of a small child. Blood had been sprayed across the room. He rushed in the room slipping on the blood and tripping over his wife’s head lying on the floor. Screaming in horror and anguish of the sight of all the blood and knowing his wife was gone. “NOT MY CHILD!” Anger and hate swelled up in him. Knowing that he had one chance to save his child if it wasn’t already too late. He slashed out at the ghoul in an almost feeble attempt, but his blade struck true across the back of the foot severing the tendon. The ghoul let out a scream of pain and fell to the floor. The ghoul thrashed out in pain grabbing the thief, biting and clawing him. <br>
 The thief in pain and anger flailing for his sword, reaches it and in one motion pulls the sword through the back of the ghoul and into him self. The body of the ghoul stiffens and the goes limp pushing the blade deeper in the thief. The thief with his last bit of strength rolls on his side and pushes the ghoul off him and the sword out. The ghoulish blood mixing with his burned deep in his side.<br>
  When his thoughts cleared hi rises to see the fate of his son. Looking into the blood soaked crib. He pulls away the blanket, and lets out a sigh. His son is alive for the moment. <br>
“I must be quick if you are to live and finish this.” <br>
The thief picks up the child in the blood soaked blanket and takes him down stairs. Removes the orb from it’s hiding spot and places it in a chest and locks it. Takes out a letter from the desk. Gathers them all and mounts his horse and rides to the temple. <br>
 Pain is now shooting through his side and moving to his chest. His head starts to pound and sweat is pouring off him. Finally he reaches the temple and falls off the horse. Landing hard on the ground. Crawling to the door, as he reaches the door it swings open and a startled maid runs back in screaming for help. <br>
  Soon the thief and his child are rushed in the temple. The clerics attempt to heal the thief, but the blood from the ghoul is a poison that there is no cure for. <br>
  “He hasn’t much time my lord,” said the cleric.<br>
“Can you ease his pain?” Said the lord of the temple<br>
“ I’m sorry my lord, but there is no known cure for this poison and the pain does not ease with any spell we have tried.”<br>
“Leave us then. I must speak with him alone.”<br>
The clerics filed out of the room. Closing the door behind them.<br>
“Can you speak?” “Did you get it?”<br>
The thief retched in a spasm of pain. “Yes Priest I got the orb.” <br>
“I am terribly sorry for the pain you are in but nothing can be done for it. I wish I could ease you pain.”<br>
“There is something you can do” The thief coughing and spiting up blood reaches into his pocket and pulls out the letter. “These are my wishes for my son. I know I was not a good man. I did have good intensions…. most of the time.”  “Please do as the letter says. They must never find him, and I don’t wish him to know about me until it is time for him to complete what we have started this night.”<br>
 “ I shall do as you wish. You have done a great service for the church and it shall not be forgotten.”<br>
 “Be sure it is far from this wretched town. Freeport ahaha now that is a laugh. I…”<br>
The thief in a final spasm of pain takes in his last breath.<br>
The Priest closes the thief eyes for the last time. “It shall be done my friend, it shall be done.”<br>
<br>
<br>
     So clomb this first grade thief into GOD's fold....<br>
<br>
