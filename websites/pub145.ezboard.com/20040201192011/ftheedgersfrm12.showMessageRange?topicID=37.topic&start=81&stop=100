<br>
There were going to be three but one redemed himself so I will leave his name off.<br>
<br>
Ladine and Talibkeweli of Altrustic Valorians<br>
<br>
Which I hate to do this because the vast majority of AV are good people.  <br>
<br>
Gurmash and I were invited to a PLane of Nightmare group with these two, another AV and a necro from some uber guild.  I forget the necro's name and he went LD when I tried to writr it down.  Anyway, for those that do not know, Nightmare is a very unforgiving zone.  Unless you hunt right by the exit, you really need to have your crap together.<br>
<br>
So we start buffing up outside.  In the MIDDLE of buff they decide to zone in.  WE zone in they want to mvoe.  I and Ladine start yelling we need to finish buffs.  She finishes and meds.  I finsh, say three times I need to med.  They take off POOF!  Keep in mind I am the slower, debuffer and CC which even two mobs can easily wipe a group in there if you are not careful.  They ended up over halfway across the zone and tell us &quot;no mobs just run over&quot;  Well, repawn time is 6-8 min but whatever, Ladine and I find them without incident.  <br>
<br>
Repededly we start to set up camp then the tanks take off and tell us to move.  When it finally looked like we were going to sit I announce I need to med as haste would be dropping shortly.  Next thing I know someone is screaming at us.  Aperently a friend of theirs decided to claim ALL the werewolves in the zone.  FFA they claim so we have to move again thanks them.  Okay so what now? Oh lets jump off a cliff!<br>
<br>
There is this cliff and as far as I knew at that time no one had found a way back up.  See once you take a few steps away from the wall, there is an invisable one-way wall there at the base.  So you cannot climb abck up the wall.  After arguing for several minutes and asking Gurmash what he wanted as I could always gate, we jumped down.  Immediate agro.<br>
<br>
Which started the cycle.  The monk kept pulling without checking mana or even waiting, the cleric being OOM after each fight.  The cleric going AFK (yes every fight) and the monk pulling while cleric was AFK.  Now, the cleric WAS quick on heals.  I will give her that.  However she was not using her mana effeciently at all.<br>
<br>
Then started her insistance on getting KEI.  This is a slasp in the face when you have a c2 chanter.  She kept saying she was NEVER low on mana with KEI.  I said its only a few more mana points per tick.  She said she wanted it for its WISDOM component!  Sorry but if you are that reliant on a wis buff you should not be in the planes.  I pointed out I had given her wis and base mana buff.  She hadn't even noticed.  See her logic was all wrong.  What was killing us was:<br>
(1) she was 54.  Too low for the area we were in<br>
(2) Ranger was continually getting agro therefore spreading dmage out between two tanks<br>
(3) We were fighting casters.  druid/ranger casters.  Now we had the AC/HP we needed but not the resists.  Therefore the nukes and dots were KEELING us.  And no one was stunning but me and I had enough other things to do.<br>
(4) Puller would never let her med fully<br>
<br>
SO okay fine Gurmash and I are about ready to leave.  I told him if worst came to worst stay with them and I bring in Brillig to get him out.  They decide we are going to go back to entrance to get KEI. I claimed I was not leaving camp to get KEI.  Now they decided instead to go back to entrance cause now we were going to Innovation.  Gurmash and I were not included in this decision.<br>
<br>
So they decide right then and there we were going to roll on loot with everything popping around us.  Up to this point, three spell components for 60+ PoP spells dropped.  I did not receive any, no biggie.  So we have 5 drops.  Two really nice spears, BD and two diamonds.  Gurmash and I roll 31 each, low rolls. I gave the diamond up to Gurmash becasue I have tons and he needs it for resist gear. So we start to try to find a way out.<br>
<br>
FIght, med fight med,  Cna';t get up this wall!.  FINALLY we find the end of the invisable wall.  We get agro, two of them.  Gurmash was down to no health after being double dotted and nuked.  He starts screaming for heals, then threw up some spell that blocked heals somehow.  But the point is the cleric sat there SCREAMING it wasn't her fault.  Somhow she thought we were blaming her becasue he asked for ehals three times.  So instead of healing us and saving the group she sat defending herself.<br>
<br>
Ranger (who was going on list but redemed himself) pointed out that the second mob had s pear and announced it was going to me as I had not gotten a single piece of loot whereas three had gotten two.  I was like, hey he is decent after all.The monk, Taligkweli, starts FLIPPING out. He had gotten a diamond.  He said he would ahve chosen a spear over the diamond.  Ranger and I both point out it was the group that had decided to rol at that point and this was fair.  He shut up and ranger died.<br>
<br>
We are fighting the last mob just the four of us. The monk announces, he is not going to die today and if things get bad he will FD.  I screenshotted this statement. He also was using a very very slow shovel object.  So the mob eventually jumps me.  Its slowed and crippled but still beating the crap outta me.  I sat and watched the monk.  He did NOTHING to get this mob off me.  He did not switch to faster weapons.  He did no kicks or attacks. At this point he easily could have tanked and mended and been done with it. I tried to stun lock it.  But I only had two stuns up and do not normally stun lock mobs so I did not haveing the timing down and failed miserably.  However, I did get all its mana drained so all it was doing was mel;eeing me.  It was a long slow death.<br>
<br>
Monk THEN finished it off looted the spear.  Told cleric to gate.  He died on the way back, started cussing, then went LD and never came back.  This is when I fink out cleric is only 54.  90% rezz.  I am in 59.  Its a hell level no matter what Verant says. ANY other level I would not blink at a 6% difference, but the ranger does kindly get me a 96% rezz.  Once bodies poof back and Gurmash is rezzed and sees me rezzed he leaves.  Took me four tells to get cleric to tell me the monk looted the spear not here.<br>
<br>
All this time the necro never once twitched the cleric.  he went LD mysteriously two seconds after I died.  Then came back in, died and then went LD again premenently.  While recovering, cleirc gets attacked, dies again.  Start screaming at the ranger for not saving her. ranger picks this time to go LD. I zoned when she died.  She invites some other ranger.  we go back to protect her while she rezzes.  She rezzes, someone calls train of hobgoblins to exit.  Hobgoblins will be abig train.  So I had a enough and sat and camped out.<br>
<br>
I will never see that spear hope the prick enjoys it.  The LDs were just a bit too convenient timing for my taste.<br>

It becomes another matter entirely when a level 65 PC draggs one up to you and dropps it at your feet while you are trying to go AFK and then tells you that you are the one who pulled it. <br>
<br>
??? How any closer to the hopper cave and I would have been INSIDE!!!<br>
<br>
I sent Destinny back a tell stating as much and how disappointed I was that she felt the need to drop it on me when it would have taken her two seconds to kill it.<br>
<br>
It gets better......<br>
<br>
I am standing beside Travelin (sp) nice druid person. When Tonie from Triune a 61 Warlord brings 5 shrooms and some wolves to us and then GOES BACK FOR MORE! <br>
<br>
This sh!t was intentional! She brought a second group back and dropped it at my feet.<br>
<br>
What the hell is wrong with people? If you are that bored playing EQ that this is what you have to do I strongly suggest another hobby. It's sad. <br>
<br>
As much as I want to unleash all kinds of explatives about these people here. It would only serve to reudce my character closer to their level. <br>
<br>
I am okay with being superior to that kind of behavior so this is where it ends. Just beware, these are not the kind of people i would ever want to associate my self with. I can't imagine what kind of a night mare it would be grouping with them.<br>

I grouped with her in UP and she thinks she is a know it all.  The MA was AFK and I said I had 30m.  She pulled.  After my repeded screams not to, she pulled anyway and informed me &quot;30m is enough for slow&quot;<br>
<br>
She was like that thru the whole group.  KNew everything and everything was her way so I don't doubt this was intentional.<br>

  Okiee-dokiee then, thought I'd spread the word about a very evil Wizard. His name is Etlan. Not to sure of his guild, he's a 54 wizzie to be exact. So this one time at Rathe Mountains, I'm with a group and we're kicking a**. Great stuff going on. After an hour of everyone in the zone being happy (peeps were killing placeholders, and lots of HGs were popping). It was awesome, and hard. To many HGs. So anyway, this Etlan guy comes and I start here the ooc's and shout's start. I'm thinking to myself, whatever peeps are always complaing KSing in Rathe. No big deal. But THEN I see what Etlan is doing to everyone (my group included). We'd get the HG to nearly half health, and he NUKE IT! Thus, taking the experience and the loot. He did this for like 2hours. Very frustrating. I have loads of patience, so I dealt with it. But eventually I got into a fight with him. I won. I loved the attention and flurry of tells I got after that. I scared him away. MUHUHAHA. This is the short version, I'd get angry if I started going off on what was said. LOL He was mean, rude, and an awful EQ player. Do not help this guy- EVER. hehe Anyone else know him?<br>
<br>
Love, Mysti<br>

I just had a few more mobs, maybe three to ding 61.<br>
<br>
We had been hunting the necro skeeters, had a group wipe, were recovering and going back with five people to just get my last few mobs to ding me.<br>
<br>
In order to do the skeeter camp, there are two on the first island you need to take out before crossing to the second island.  You must stand between two camps to get these two.  Its a fairly safe area between the rats and flies.<br>
<br>
We we pull the first one and kill it.  Puller goes to pull the second one and I clearly see a wandering rat leave its path and agro on him.  So he pulls the skeeter and rat.  I go to mezz the rat, resisted, its starts hitting me, mezz again, it lands.  So its at my feet with Val standing right next to me.  The tanks are a few feet away smacking hte skeeter.<br>
<br>
I remezz, not 20 seconds later, mezz broken.  WTF? I didn't even look, figured I mezzed wrong or somthing...rat is beating on me I remezz.  Mezz broken. Rat beating on me again.<br>
<br>
I turn completely around and see this Iksar SK, Kebzeal beating on my rat.  I say, WTF is your problem? Knock it off!  Remezz rat, guy breaks it a third time and takes it away.<br>
<br>
Val ooced, so did I.  Group is in uproar becasue they ahve no clue what is going on, they were facing the other way and were good tanks and never turned even when my HPs were dropping over and over again,  They trusted Val and I.<br>
<br>
SO I sent the guy a tell asking him what his problem was, when no response I demanded an answer.  He told me to wait a sec.  I sarcastically apologized for interupting him wheil he was betaing our mob.  He then asked me if I was going to be a child or talk like an adult!<br>
<br>
TO make a long story short.  First he tried to claim we were ganking his mobs (rats are not technically a camp as they wander so they are considered FFA.  The camp I Spoke about is really just their spawn point.  FLies however are a stationary spawn and considered a camp)<br>
<br>
After I yelled that it was an obvious agro as we were doing skeeters and if he looked at our levels he would realize rats were way too low for us, he relaized it was accidental and switched to &quot;he was helping us&quot; as he saw it was an add.<br>
<br>
I offered to send himn the log of how many times I not only had it mezzed before he broke it but how many times I mezzed it afterwards.  He stoped responding and then came over and sat down right in the middle of our group.  We at that point left as I had dinged.<br>

<br>
It takes a lot for me to put someone on here but this guy/guild deserved it.<br>
<br>
Ok last night..I'm in Nightmare (we moved there after our group makeup changed a bit) pretty far into the zone. Group was kickASS and exp was flowing and Irky was pulling 3 or 4 mobs to Arti and we were handling them fine in Disease, hence why we went to Nightmare, for better exp - and so that's why I was so pissed about this guy. There was NO REASON for what happened to us.<br>
<br>
First of all, I'm like 2 mobs from my long awaited ding. Our cleric had just dinged which was awesome, and our rogue was hoping to.<br>
<br>
Our tank was Artious, so there's not much he can't handle. Rogue was Battousai, another kickass individual. Healers, we had THREE:<br>
Norezforyou, newly 53 Cleric<br>
me<br>
Irky Timbers , 62 Druid<br>
<br>
Chanter was Arachdeus, crowd control master supreme<br>
<br>
We notice a monk come running by and Arti says &quot;add&quot;. Monk does not FD or anything , just runs thru our group with it and the mob agros on us. <br>
<br>
I catch his name: Darkzeppelin &lt;Tycoon&gt;<br>
<br>
No sorry from him, nothing. He's low on health and stands there at the crest of the hill and watches as Artious and Battousai dispatch the add.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am in far camera view since we are on a hill and I'm on my horse. I see the monk come THRU us again. YES through us. As in he runs IN BETWEEN our tank and our f*cking chanter, WITH A MOB IN TOW.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cleric DOWN.<br>
<br>
Deus was down in a matter of seconds. The mob had torn through him before he could even hit /dismount. <br>
<br>
Anyone who's grouped with me knows: YOU DON'T INJURE MY CHANTERS, END OF STORY.<br>
<br>
A split second after that Irky's superduper fast evac went off and we arrived at zone in safely.<br>
<br>
This monk evac'd too with his wizzy guildmate after we did.<br>
<br>
Not one word.<br>
No Sorry.<br>
Nothing.<br>
<br>
<br>
He trained a mob through us and killed our f*cking cleric and chanter and not one word of apology. And STOOD and watched it all happen.<br>
<br>
And get this...they had another guildmate in zone. A 61 cleric. <br>
<br>
Offer of a rez? No.<br>
<br>
<br>
No... our cleric had to come into zone and rez HIMSELF and then rez Dues. A 90% rez for someone who had spent NINE HOURS in UP that day getting his insurance experience.<br>
<br>
A group member who is familiar with this guild says they are rife with multiboxers, and was not surprised at the tag when we saw the culprit.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It pretty much ruined the night since my ding happened then while we were killing Treants waiting for corpses to pop so no one was in a gratzing mood. <br>
<br>
<br>
Darkzeppelin or ANY Tycoon, if you see them in Nightmare, just leave the zone.  Trains happen, that's to be expected. But for fecks sake, at least accept responsibility for it. Or say &quot;sorry&quot;. Or something!<br>
<br>
Whew feel better now!<br>
