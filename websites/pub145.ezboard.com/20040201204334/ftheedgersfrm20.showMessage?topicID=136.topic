<br>
        Niema wakened to a horrid crushing noise <br>
and grunts of a tall plump one eyed monster she <br>
had only heard of once before in a tale she <br>
listened in on once in the old East common Tunnels. She <br>
thought the story to be untrue because it came <br>
from a drunken former Discordian gnome who also <br>
told her once of trying to steal an apple from “The <br>
Sleeper’s Lair”. Her eyes widened as the fist of <br>
this one eyed boat rocker went through the deck <br>
of the ship once more. She hid immediately not <br>
want to become his first meal of the day.<br>
        She observed him from the sinking bow of <br>
the ship knowing once she touched the water she <br>
would become to him visible and must think of a <br>
plan and in a hurry. The Sea furry Cyclops grunted <br>
again and uttered some word not audible enough <br>
for her to hear as her wing touched the water she <br>
froze and he did see her shivering on the sinking <br>
bow. She said quickly “shhhh que les lapins <br>
viennent” and disapered from sight.<br>
Not knowing the Sea furry Cyclops can speak <br>
French he yelled back to her “RABBITS ME WANT EAT <br>
RABBITS!”.<br>
        Niema could not help it she rolled in the <br>
sand and laughed so hard she could not breath. <br>
The monster ran in the direction of the laughter <br>
and grabbed her tightly in his fist crushing her <br>
delicate wings.<br>
“OUCH!” she poked his eye as she yelled at him <br>
“you crush my wing, why did you do this?”, the <br>
giant monster started to cry. “Angel Fairy poke my <br>
eye” her sobbed, Niema started to feel bad for him. <br>
He grunted to her again, “Me hungry me want eat <br>
rabbit”. OK! The wild dove now had a plan to <br>
escape this not so evil monster and have him help her.<br>
        “I can show you where the rabbits will <br>
come if you can show me to the Mountains of <br>
Butcherblock.” clear to the wild dove that the monster <br>
did not understand the way he was standing and his <br>
eye just going slowly back and forth his finger <br>
to his lip, very pensive. “I want to go to Dwarf <br>
city” she say to him authoritively this time. <br>
“They have rabbit, dwarves do?” he ask to her <br>
sincerely. She said to him no but they have Skunk! <br>
“Skunk is much better then rabbit, you can see them <br>
easy and can taste them for hours and hours after <br>
you eat one.” <br>
        “ME WANT SKUNK!” He grunted loud enough <br>
to knock her from the log she sat upon. “Sorry” he <br>
said quietly. Niema was surprise by his gentle <br>
nature, after all he was only hungry, if she can <br>
get him to take her to Kaladim maybe he would like <br>
eating Skunks! She felt herself to be rather <br>
smart, “now if only the plan will work“ she thought. <br>
“Take me to Dwarf City now please” Niema yelled <br>
up to him. He picked her up like a bug by her <br>
wing, it hurt her a little, until he sat her on his <br>
shoulder. The ride was bumpy she had to clench his <br>
ear several times so she would not fall to her <br>
death. His steps were broad shaking both the ground <br>
and the ocean floor but spanning miles so it did <br>
not take long to hear the guards yelling and <br>
scattering for their weapons. <br>
        Niema did not anticipate this part, well <br>
not exactly, she herself was afraid of him, but <br>
had grown fond of the not so monstrous monster and <br>
she did not want to get him killed. “WAIT!” the <br>
wild dove yelled in his ear “STOP!” he stopped and <br>
a huge title wave crashed over the guards leaving <br>
them coughing and gasping for air, thankfully the <br>
weapons far from reach. “Dwarves no like Sea <br>
furry, go back I will bring to you food” Niema <br>
pleaded to him. “ME WANT SKUNK!” He retorted. “I will <br>
bring to you a skunk I promise” so he picked up a <br>
little fishing boat and shook out its passengers <br>
into the water sat her on its deck and pushed it <br>
to shore. She waved to him hoping he would go <br>
back….he turned and stepped a few times…turned back <br>
to her in a loud roar “BRING ME SKUNK!”.<br>
        The wild dove sighed to herself turning <br>
to face a brigade of dwarven guards holding <br>
weapons up to her… <br>
