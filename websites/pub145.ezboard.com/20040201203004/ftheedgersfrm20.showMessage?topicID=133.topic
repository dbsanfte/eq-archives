<br>
Environment plays a considerable role in the evolution of a species. When the progenetors of a species come flopping out of the primordial muck looking like the fathers of all mudfish they naturally seek out a place of their own to inhabit. Once entrenched the species and the land go to work at each other until they reach a sort of balance. The glob of genetic material that settles with the first trees, for instance, has a tendency to grow pale skin, long faces, haughty demeanors, and the ability to complain that no one is willing to spend several hundred years properly aging a good wine these days.<br>
<br>
Trolls live in the swamp. Evolving in a swamp is the Darwinnian equivalent of being the last kid chosen for kickball.<br>
<br>
Of course this is the point where inevitably some dim-wit from the assemblage of mortals points out, &quot;But, didn't the gods create all life on Norrath?&quot; The late gnomish philosopher <br>
Nim-dim Whidlehosen put it best when explaining his theory of evolution by saying, &quot;I mean come on look, have you ever really SEEN the gods?&quot; Gods tend to, by matter of necessity, be pretty stupid. When you are a personification of a random humanoid virtue, vice, or emotion there isn't much room to find yourself asking, &quot;What is it all REALLY about when you come down to it?&quot; <br>
<br>
Trolls for instance are supposed to have been created by Cazic Thule. This is a god who not only is noted for never being able to give himself a face, but also who's idea of inspiring terror into the hearts of mortals is hiding behind the nearest tree, and jumping out and yelling, &quot;BOO!&quot; at anyone whom approaches. <br>
<br>
The elves spend so much time venerating Tunare they have never even noticed her greatest concern for the last five millenia has been whether or not the hairdresser got it right, and if she would look cute in a Bobby cut.<br>
<br>
No gods did not create life on Norrath, but still get pretty good press. This is largely due to the priests. The late gnomish philosopher Nim-dim Whidlehosen became the LATE gnomish philosopher Nim-dim Whidlehosen when a priest of Brell Serillis asked him to reconsider his theory of evolution while stimulating the philosopher with a vat of boiling oil.<br>
<br>
Nim-dim had devoloped his philosophy by playing around with some weeds in his garden, He had noticed that without fail no matter how he restricted the weeds crossbreeding that the nastiest ugliest species always seemed to grow better than his tomatoes. This, of course, brings us back to trolls.<br>
<br>
After several tens of thousands of years surviving in the swamp your basic garden variety troll has evolved several traits to ensure they are the ugliest weed in the Innothule garden. They have both the teeth and the temperment to outwrestle any alligator in the swamp, and have learned to survive on a diet that consists of anything that wriggles on the bottom of the riverbed. There is also, of course, the regeneration. Cut a troll's arm off and in two hours he will have a new one. This has led to the myth that a troll can be killed by cutting off its head. The problem with this theory is that what thinking a troll does is invariably with their stomach, and the head is largely a vestigial organ. <br>
<br>
Trolls are bad tempered, ugly, and stupid. While other races laugh at trolls for these very traits they miss a very key element to the troll's survival. Being bad tempered, ugly, and stupid can be virtues if you carry them REALLY far. Trolls in short are a race that would cut off their collective noses to spite their faces were it not for the facts that:<br>
<br>
A. It would improve their overall appearance<br>
and...<br>
B. The damned thing would just grow back an hour later anyways.<br>
<br>
This is the story of a troll....<br>
<br>
Picture a troll birthing tent. Or better yet, DO NOT picture a troll birthing tent. There are some things it is best not to think about.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless that is where we come in. We'll skip the whole nasty birthing process and come in as the babe is pulled out into what, for lack of a better word in this environment, we will call the light of the world. Troll babies do not come out cute, helpless, and mewling like most mammals. They are birthed, as it were, pre assembled and with batteries already included. The baby bites the nursemaids arm as she holds him up, and then toddles away to the corners of the tent gurgling and goobling at this strange new world.<br>
<br>
In the shadows of this tent are an old crone of a troll and an impressive warrior who stands wrapped in velvety darkness.<br>
<br>
&quot;What da spirits say old mutter?&quot;<br>
<br>
The old crone squints up at the warrior with a look that could turn three month old milk MORE sour.<br>
<br>
&quot;They say keep a civil tongue Mahglohnk DaGohnk.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
The old crone nodded in satisfaction and turned her attention to the cutting board in front of her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dem tell yous da future?&quot; asked Mahglonk pointing to the chicken entrails lying on the table.<br>
<br>
&quot;No they go in the soup, The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>future</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> tells me the future, now shut your mouth before I throw you into the stew as well you overgrown wall of blubber!&quot;<br>
<br>
In the background there was an abbreviatted &quot;SQUEAK!&quot; and a dull thud. The child had found a rat and was happily swinging it at a rock by the tail.<br>
<br>
Ooglah stared into the depths of her stew. She was senior among the shamans in Grobb, and had developed a sort of infamy. People who got on her bad side had a tendency to disappear. This alone was troubling, but what was more bothering was her habit of throwing community covered dish suppers after her enemies dissapeared.<br>
<br>
Ooglah was worried.<br>
<br>
There were certain conventions in soothsaying. A child is born under an occult moon, on a day holy to the dark gods, to the son of the clans greatest warrior, and has the mark of The god of Hate upon his thigh. Even the enormously slow mind of a troll population can guess where the story goes from there.<br>
However Ooglah had been brought in to do a foretelling and was not seeing what she had suspected.<br>
<br>
Ooglah was incredibly clever for a troll. She understood a basic concept of fortunetelling that was known to gypsies everywhere. It did not matter so much what future you told so long as you told it with conviction. With faith people would pick it up from there and see it to completion. But behind mucking about with destiny there was a general shape to the future. Ooglah's talent was real and she was not seeing what she expected to see.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grrrgoogrrbulguh?&quot;<br>
<br>
A small hand reached over the edge of the boiling pot and placed a rat on the ledge. Ooglah absent mindedly took the rat from the grubby fingers and dropped it into the stew.<br>
<br>
The problem was that she was seeing a clear vision of the child's future, and the general populace would not be pleased with what she foresaw. This is the general problem with the future. It is great to know what it is going to be so long as it is what you would like it to be.<br>
<br>
Against all probability for this child's future when she looked into her third eye she saw that the child was fated to be a great.....chef. It was an absurd notion, but well, there it was.<br>
<br>
Mahglohnk cleared his throat in what he hoped was a respectful fashion.<br>
<br>
Ooglah sighed and took one last glimpse into the pot. She knew her duty.<br>
<br>
&quot;This child will be the greatest of troll warriors.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mahglohnk nodded his head, he had expected as much.<br>
<br>
&quot;He will walk unhindered where he wills among the paths of mortals, and the gods themselves will quake where he passes.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What? All dat?&quot; asked Mahglonk who was genuinely impressed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Urgoozzhhrrgubbull!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You see that bit of froglok?&quot; asked Ooglah pointing into the pot. &quot;You want to argue with the spirits?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mahglohnk, who would not dare to presume to argue with the spirits hurriedly assured Ooglah that he was sure she was correct.<br>
<br>
Ooglah knew quite a few things about the future. She knew that whatever it intended you could muddle with a good bit of faith, but never fully change. She had set the child's feet on a path that would see him to be the greatest warrior to ever create a puff pastry in the history of Norrath.<br>
<br>
&quot;What will you name your son, warrior?&quot;<br>
<br>
Mahglohnk looked at the bag of green skin and teeth sitting in the center of the tent, and trying to eat the center post.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mes gonter name him Gurmash.&quot;..........<br>
