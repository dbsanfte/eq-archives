<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">Who:</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--> The following guilds are invited to participate: Stare Quia Unum (bonk me I know I spelled it wrong), Mystic Horizon and Rise of the Phoenix.  Anyone else must have a full member in Faveo to vouch for them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:yellow;font-size:large;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Things to know and remeber:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->[/font]<br>
-You must be level 50 or 45+ if youa re cleric, do not be two blue from 50 and ask if you can come.<br>
-Start time of non est is the start time.  Do not be in Cobalt Scar at 12:05 and expect a group.  If in doubt, park yourself there the night before.<br>
-You must and I repeat, you MUST be non-KOS to Claws of Veeshan faction.  Below are some pointers on the zone.  It discusses faction.  If you come to the raid and are KOS, you will be banned from raiding with this guild for a period of time determined by the raid leader and how many deaths she will get dragging your sorry corpse off the bridge.  IE one month banning per death.  Period.  if you are not KOS you will NOT lose faction from hunting where we are going.<br>
-At no time are you to move without being specifically told to.  If anyone, and I mean anyone opens ANY door without specifically asking and specifically receiving permission to from the RL herself, again you will be banned from raiding with this guild.  Again how long will be dertermined by how long it takes to revcover from the raid wipe you just caused by opening a door during a fight.  And since people have asked before, if soemone is told to open the door and raid gets a pop or accidental agro, (which it is unlikly to happen)no you will not be punished <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Seriously, these are problems that ahve come up in the past and do cause major major raid downtime.  Since it 100% preventable, it is harshly punished.<br>
-Casters are to bind right outside the entrance to ToV. No exceptions.  You will be ported or TLed out when you need to go.<br>
-Non-Faveo folks are reminded the first of any armor class breastplate drop is reserved for full Faveo members alone.  If a second BP drops within an armor class (IE plate, chain, leather, silk) it will be rolled upon NBG by all raid participants.  Any other drops, including all other armor drops, will be rolled upon NBG by all participants.<br>
-All raid participants are reminded to check www.allkhazam.com to determine if the armor quests drops will result in an item that is an upgrade to their current item.  If anyone is caught selling an item they claimed as a NBG roll they will not only be removed as a guild member (if Faveo) they will also recieve a lifetime ban on raiding with us and will be given over to Skinok, our dicipline officer and also ridiculed up and down on the MT boards.  In 3 years of doing NBG only one person ahs ever tested this policy.  Please think twice before becoming the 2nd one.  If no one needs the armor drop, it will be rolled upon as a greed roll.  Assuming someone somwhere will want to MQ it as an upgrade to an alt.  If no ine wnats it for ANY of their characters, then it will be looted for the armory to MQ.<br>
-There will be no pets.  Not even chanter pets.  BLs and Necros may register their complaints after the raid.  Do not summon a pet, do not ask if you can summon a pet, do not ask in the middle of the raid why you cannot summon a pet.  Do not explain how good youa re at controlling your pet or how much damage your pet can do.  From vast experience, they cause more harm than good in ToV.<br>
-Clerics are expected to have their temperence spell quest completed.  Pallies are expected to have their divine might and thunder of Karana spells (if apropriate level).  Chanters and bards are expected to have all of their mana drain spells that are apropriate for their level.  Yes, you may still come if you do not have these, but ample time is being given for you folks to complete or aquire those spells necessary for your class at your level to this zone.<br>
-Everyone except those who might expect to be MA, SA, or TA should trade out everything they can for resists.  If you are a SK/Pally/Warr 60+ try to max out both HP and resists as much as possible but err on the side of HPs as you may be one of the main tanks.  Everyone else should concentrate on resists only.  If you are a 55 SK/Pally/Warr bring your full range of weapons.  You never know when a fight might turn bad and you end up being the 7th tank and need to MA to save a cleric to camp.<br>
<br>
Please see below for some helpful tips on the raid.  Please understand ToV is an extremly hard, stressful raid.  We may sound harsh, but this is why we run, successful, smooth raids.  Come prepared, come with patience, and we will show you what raiding a nasty zone is like with good folks!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Temple of Veeshan – Information<br>
<br>
Temple of Veeshan (hereafter referred to as ToV) is a 50+ level zone that is still considered one of the hardest raids in the game. It is a raid only zone, not ment for single groups. There are many differences in this zone you should be aware of before attempting to enter and hunt this zone.<br>
<br>
How to get to the zone: ToV is dep in the heart of the Velious continent and is not easy to get to or home from. Typically, the best way is to grab a druid or wizard and port to Cobalt Scar. If you have never been to the zone before and do not know how your faction is, you may want to go under the cloak of invisibility. Get levitation and enduring breath and run, run, run! The zone in to Siren’s Grotto is actually underwater and also guarded by some pesky enchaters. Nothing in the zone sees through invis, with the exception of the named dragon which occasionally spawn in the zone. But since you will be dead before you even see him, he is the least of concerns during travel. After zoning into Siren’s Grotto, your porter should then cast lesser succor. This will take you to the zone out on the other side of this tiny zone. SG is a very small zone, however the mobs do not lack for stature. They are very tough and fast and see through invisibility. Therefore do not try to cross the zone on foot. Succor always. Be sure you are ready to run as soon as succor lands because there will be mobs who wander near where you are going to land. Once you zone out into Western Wastes, be sure to have inisibilty, yet onece again and levitation. At this point, run and do not stop until you reach the temple. There are some wolves and a few mobs who see through invisibility and whoa re KOS to everyone. These are few and far between, however. Your biggest fear in this zone will be falling off the cliff. ToV is located ina steep, deep pit in the middle of the zone. You can take an hour to run around the other side of the pit and slide down the slightly less steep side over there or you can just happily float down on an air of invulnarabilty due to levitation and save the cleric time from rezzing your arse which they have probably already rezzed twice from SG and CS. You will see probably anywhere between 0 to 20 named dragons guarding the entrance. They do not see thru invisibility. The temple is huge, easily marking the home of the enormous dragons. You will see two engulfing pillars at the end of the entrance hall. To enter, you must left click on one of the pillars which emit lightning at each other. Before entering the temple, be sure to bind outside the entrance in the hallway. Melees may not bind here, but it is impreartive all casters bind here. Once you enter TOV, you cannot leave unless you make it to the end of one of the halls or be ported out.<br>
<br>
Zone Make Up: ToV is split up into several sections. When you first enter the zone, youa re met with a sight much more subdued that the hall entrance you just came from. The entrance room is quite large and has only one doorway leading from it. The middle of the room is built pit-like with stairs forming a square around the pit. This room is perfectly safe. The only reason why you would not be safe is if someone trained trained the room. This is exceedingly unlikely as most people in the game could not survive the bridge you will soon see outside the room, long enough to train the safe room. Also if you train the safe room in ToV, it is grounds for lynching and being voted the most hated person on Morell Thule. Once leaving this room youa re confronted with a bridge, completely inundated with level 58+ mobs. They will not attack you if you have faction, which is discussed in more detail in the next section. After a series of doors you emerge into a central, circurlar area. Aslo are mobs here which are of no concern, unless doors are open at the wrong time. Which is explained in the strategy section later on.<br>
<br>
The zone itself is split into four sections. Fisrt section is the entrance area, which you find yourself now. To the East, is, apropriatly named, the East Wing, which is also called Halls of Training (henceforth will be known as HoT). To the West is the West Wing, also known as&lt;insert name here&gt;. To the North is the section that is so hard and ominous, it is simply known as “The North Wing.” The zone itself it not even mentioned as everyone knows what you are reffering too.<br>
<br>
Faction/Drops/Quests: ToV is part of the Velious armor quests campaign. Kael and Thurgadin complete this cycle. Faction plays a huge part in not only which halls to hunt in, but also which drops to look for and how to handle the zone.<br>
<br>
Velious Armor quests start in Thurgadin. They are simple quests which involve simply handing over gems, which drop randomly and are fairly easy to obtain from various zones in Velious, and a piece of no-stat armor, which you get from Kael or ToV, and of course you must have the proper faction. To obtain the Kael armor, you must be on Coldain faction, because the turn in mobs are in Thurgadin. You obtain the drops from either Kael Arena or the Kael Manor. <br>
<br>
Next step up would be Kael armor. The turn in mobs are in Kael Drakkel and the drops come from ToV. King Tormax (giant faction) is the specific faction you need for this.<br>
<br>
Next step would be the Skyshrine armor. Drops come from ToV and the specific faction is Lord Yelinek (dragon faction).<br>
<br>
Final is ToV armor. The North wing. There is no turn in mobs. The armor drops fully stated off the mobs in the North Wing.<br>
<br>
Officially this guild is on Coldain Faction semi-premenetly. This is due to the number of people doing the Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl Quest which requires high and sustained Coldain faction for a long period of time. Normally you are on Coldain/Dragon Faction OR giant faction. There are ways to be on all 3 factions at one time. This is extermly difficult and time consuming and frankly not worth it. There are ways to switch from one faction to another rathere quickly. Mainly the way to do that is to kill either Derakor the Vindicator (also known as Vindi) in Kael Drakkal or The Dain Frostweaver in Icewell Keep, depending on which faction you wish to obtain. Each one will instantly make you ally to the opposite faction and make you KOS of the faction of the mob you just helped kill. As for Claws of Veeshan or dragon faction, faction is very easy to raise and also very easy to lose, normally by killing named dragons.<br>
<br>
Specialties of the Zone: This is one of the first zones and individual will see “special zone rules.” In other words, rules that are bent, ingnored or changed relative to other “normal” hunting zones.<br>
-Faction again plays a huge part in where you can walk in the zone. If you drag a corpse, any corpse, you instantly become KOS to any mob in the zone. Even the ones you have faction with currently. Corpses must be summoned or mobs cleared, or all else failing, a person willing to incure several deaths to recover a corpse.<br>
-Summoning does not work in ToV as it does in other zones. You may summon corpses and CotH (Call of the Hero) people, but this must be done in specific spots and these spot do not always work. The summoner must stand in exactly the correct spot and still sometimes it does not work.<br>
-Certain areas are one way and there are zone outs at the end of the wings.<br>
-90% of the mobs are dragon encounters. In other words, it is normal to have a break after each and every mob. The dragons can and will AOE cold, fire, magic and poison. Very few do AOE disease. Some have inate inabilities. The abilities cannot be prevented but the AOE spells can be interrupted and the mobs can be mana drained. The cold based dragons are gaters and will gate and then bring back friends, lots of friends. Their mana MUST be drained in order to prevent them from gating. Dragons often take a chanter and a shammy continually casting slow to see who gets it to land first. Sometimes the chanter will be able to, sometimes the shammy will. Chanters and bards should be on the lookout for any dragon with mana to drain them.<br>
-AOEs can be blocked by pillars and walls.<br>
-No mob in the zone may be mezzed or charmed.<br>
-Pets……..are bad just don’t even ask if you can bring one up. Not even chanter pets.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
