I am no one.</span><hr size=1> Clawed feet treaded swifty through the thick underbrush of the Emerald Jungle, but this was no native creature to Kunark. A large frame standing just over seven feet tall wearing minimal leather armor wove in and out of the trees with ease, constantly on the move. The body structure was feline, a large cat running on two legs, the tail twitching every now and then to avoid a stray branch or clawed thorn. Tanj Dar'Khura continued to thread his way through the dense underbrush, hoping for a clearing up ahead... and solace. He sought to be alone, and alone he was. The spear in his hand had been freshly drenched in blood, and his shield still pulsed magically as he used it to gently clear his path ahead, brushing aside branches.<br>
<br>
He was being chased, though it always seemed that this was the case. And there were claw marks across his thigh, trickles of blood beginning to dry on the cuts in his leggings. The feral tiger he had fought had next to no chance of catching its cousin, a Vah Shir, for Tanj was blessed with the speed of wolves. He could feel the lupine spirit within him, pulsing struggling to be let out. It was this way with them all, they had their own thoughts and wills, but Tanj had to bend them to his own. The relationship with the spirits was an odd one, and one that was different for all shamans.<br>
<br>
He broke free of the trees, and a huge ruined city spread out before him. The newly ordained mystic could feel the spirits out there, ghosts still tied to Norrath, undead. Tanj's pace slowed, the tiger would never be able to find him now, the gap between the two was much too large. He paused to shield his spirit from prying eyes, making himself unseen to the eyes of the living, and moved towards one of the abandoned ruins. A huge set of pillars, cracked and ruined lay out infront of him. Reaching a great height before ending in a cracked top.<br>
<br>
The city must have been great once, home to an empire now destroyed and forgotten with the mists of time. Tanj's eye followed the pillar to its peak, and decided it would do. The cracks in the stone made easy access for climbing, though he was not experienced in such things. As a precaution he once more focused and cast a spell, and his feet slowly lifted off the ground. He levitated for a few moments, just inches of the ground, and then began to climb.<br>
<br>
It was a tough climb, he fell twice on the way to the top, though it might not be called falling. He lost his grip and seperated from the pillar, but his feet remained as if they were on solid ground. Hovering high above the swamp below him. Two steps forward on the unseen surface keeping him from falling and he was able to begin climbing once more. He reached the top, night now fully upon the ruined city.<br>
<br>
With a mere thought he ended the spells that empowered his person. The lupine spirit broke free and coalesced in front of him, into a mist like shape regarding him for an instant before dissapating into nothingness. His feet landed on the pillar top with a soft thud, his reflexes easily absorbing the small shock of standing on solid ground once more. Lastly his image snapped back into view, his form no longer hidden from prying eyes.<br>
<br>
Eyes of gold regarded the sky above, clear, and unclouded. Kunark was a land of no time, an ancient land, and the breathtaking view of the ruins of a once great empire far below were ignored for this instant of clarity. Luclin shown, in all her glory and brought to Tanj memories of home. How long had it been since he had seen his father? Or his mother? He knew they still lived, having had contact with some of his family though he hadn't spoken to his parents in person since his exile. In his mind he pictured his parents, the full moon lending its light to show their features. His father, Sekath, stood before him in mid air. Taller than Tanj and regal in his features, only a few scars marring his light brown coat. His face was showing its age, the fur most likely now giving way to dignified gray. But in his mind Tanj was sure that Sekath was still singing his songs of battle and history, teaching a younger race of bards and story tellers.<br>
<br>
And his mother, Tanj's mother was a shrewd woman, who loved her family fiercely enough to do what she believed best, no matter what the stakes. It was she who helped her son along his path, and it was she who eventually aided him on his last journey from home at a young age. She hid his secrets from his father, though Tanj felt that they both knew and shared all the secrets he had confided in them. At times as a child it felt as if they were acting out their own ballad, and Tanj was the center, it was eerie to see them argue, for his benefit, what was best for him, their only child. He understood their purposes now, he understood why they were the way they were. And despite his dislike of their choices for his upbringing he loved them all the same.<br>
<br>
Watching the stars, Tanj dropped his spear on the column top, and extended each arm, opening his palms and feeling his claws unsheathe themselves from their hiding place in his paws. A feral growl began in his throat slowly growing, he'd been holding it in for much to long and it quickly grew in volume until the roar echoed through the skies, a haunting feral roar of rage, confusion, power and memory. It slowly finished and his arms dropped back to his side, he slowly slumped into a sitting position. All the feelings he couldn't sort out now quiet for a short time, the roar frightening them back to their hiding places in his mind.<br>
<br>
He reached into his pack and removed a potion. A relic of a trial long since past. Another shaman had given it to him, an old mystic. Though Tanj now suspected perhaps it was a spirit. The more powerful he became the more Tanj realized that many of the beings that walked Norrath and Luclin weren't actually of natural origin. Many were just spirits, there for a purpose, or just trapped. But this was something that did not concern him for now.<br>
<br>
Less than a few days ago he was high up in the trees of the Faydark. Among the wood elves of Kelethin. Sitting by himself in an inn's common room he quietly ate regarding those around him. His goals were his own and as usual he never spoke unless spoken to. Tanj's race was imposing compared to the elves,  most of them did not pass his chest in height, and he had to stoop to get inside most doors. As was usually the case, he was simply passing through the area, having no intention on staying long. But something was amiss. He was being watched and he could feel it.<br>
<br>
It had been with him since he entered the city an odd feeling that he was being followed. And with the appearance of a barmaid serving him his food the feeling swelled. She was young for an elf, barely older than a child. Her smile didn't pierce Tanj's heart, he had loved no one besides his parents in his life. He had no room for love, he was a servant, and perhaps if he could find someone who understood his purpose, then he might find love. But for now, he was alone, and besides a few aquantinces he had no true friends. She seemed very intrigued with him, and as she finished serving him she simply said as if in greeting.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've been following you. Vah Shir aren't a common sight here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tanj's golden eyes blinked, the statement was a surprise to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then my feelings of being followed were not unfounded.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her smile faded a bit as she realized he had somehow known of her tracking of him.<br>
<br>
&quot;No they were not. I've never seen your race before, and I'd love a chance to talk to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Tanj blinked again, no one had ever expressed an interest in him before. People usually spoke to him for two reasons, to ask for his help, or to ask for the blessings from the spirits. Both of which he gave freely, but no one had asked to just speak to him before. He thought it over for a bit as the young elf maiden stood there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then sit and let us talk.&quot;<br>
<br>
She shook her head and smiled, and turned on her heel and walked over to the barkeep. She spoke for a few moments then returned and took a seat. Perhaps securing a break from work to speak with the strange traveler sitting alone at his table. Tanj's form towered over her, but she showed no sign of fear.<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you wish to know of me?&quot;<br>
<br>
Her green eyes sparkled. It was the first time Tanj had noticed them, they were emerald green. She seemed entirely intrigued with him, not at all romantically, and Tanj felt the same way, she was a puzzle to him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I wish to know who you are. Who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
The question was the third to catch him off guard tonight, he was beginning to dislike this new feeling of not knowing what was coming next. He hadn't been caught off his guard in some time, it made him feel vulnerable. He answered the question in some manner that satisfied her question and they spoke more through the night. Tanj left the next morning, and that was the end of that quick aquantince. But the question remained.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The only response he could find in his heart was this.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who am I? I am no one. I am a tool to be used by the spirits, a balancing force that will do what MUST be done. Whether it is good or evil is not for me to decide.&quot;<br>
<br>
The answer was not in fact a good one. It left him nothing, but it was the truth as far as he was concerned. And the truth ate at him, slowly devouring his thoughts until it was all he could think about. The soul searching had uncovered several things that Tanj felt needed to be dealt with. The small corked bottle in his hand should do just that. The mystic that had given it to him as a gift had also given the following statement.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is for when you seek answers, you will know when, and you will feel the need. Within this liquid are the answers you seek and the direction to guide you. When duty becomes to much to bear and serving your purpose with all your heart is no longer enough, that is the time. Keep it with you at all times, for it will overtake you at the most innapropriate time.&quot;<br>
<br>
The words had struck him as odd, as well as the way which they were formed. He made sense of some of it now, but the rest was still confusing. Well he sought answers, and the answers he sought were buried deep within him. He had been on a journey all his life, but through the phsyical world. Now it was time to see who he was, to find himself. Tanj uncorked the bottle, and sent off a prayer to the spirits for guidance. He downed the contents, and began to fall.<br>
<br>
It was the beginning of something new, and Tanj would find himself and never be the same again. For good or bad the journey he began would change him forever....<br>
<br>
To Be Continued<br>

<br>
He felt as if he was falling, wind pulling softly at his clothes as he fell into darkness. Echoes of the night all around him, but there was nothing out there. He couldn’t feel anything, not even the familiar touch of the spirits that were present to let him know he was alive. That was his gift, even as a child he was in tune with the spirits, creatures that were once of this world and no were not. Tanj blinked once, and the darkness drifted away, giving way to the flickering light of a torch in his hands. He was small, a kitten, a child. Two companions he played with as a youngling were at his side, ever ready to lead and follow into trouble. They were playful and troublesome children, the kind that made an elder spout off about how things were different in their time.<br>
<br>
Before the threesome was an old and cracked wall, a hole in it just large enough for them to squeeze through with a held breath. They were underneath one of the many uninhabited homes in Shar Vhal, long before Tanj had to learn about Norrath and worlds outside of the Vah Shir city. They slinked through the hole, the crumbling wall around them showing just how old the structure was. The darkness on the other side fled before the torch light, leaving an old and dusty room. Books were strewn about on the floor, “borrowed” from those who no longer read them or appreciated the stories within. This was their retreat, where they hid and read of heroes long dead.<br>
<br>
“Sekath still treats you like a kit Tanj, did you see how he snorted at the idea of you going hunting with me and dad?”<br>
<br>
Jaern giggled as he finished the statement, his father was a well respected hunter of the many species of Hoppers that lived just outside the skirts of town. He was two years senior to Tanj.<br>
<br>
“He treats me like a kit because I hang out with you and Daken. He thinks you are a bad influence on me.”<br>
<br>
“Are we?”<br>
<br>
Daken watched the two quietly, he didn’t like to talk much, and was more of the quiet type. He was thoughtful and noticed many things Tanj and Jaern missed at first glance. His question was a surprise. Tanj shrugged, wondering if Daken had taken offense.<br>
<br>
“I don’t think so besides what’s the worst trouble we’ve been into? Borrowing these books is probably the worst thing we’ve ever done.”<br>
<br>
Daken nodded, though it was in fact he that had done most of the borrowing. His fingers were quick and light, and he was well trained in such things as Thievery. He was an orphan, and a stable boy. One of the royal guards had taken him in and had noticed his aptitude for sneaking about, despite what many of the others thought he encouraged Daken to practice his roguish skills, knowing that they may prove useful to the boy some day. Tanj respected Daken the most out of all those his age, he tried to model himself after him. The young thief was level headed and calm, and did not let his emotions show easily.<br>
<br>
“What do we read about tonight?”<br>
<br>
This was the beginning of a small ritual. Something they had done for some time now. In their hiding place they would read and dream of their futures as heroes like those in the legends. Jaern’s question left silence in its wake for a few short moments. Tanj responded.<br>
<br>
“The birth of the Combine.”<br>
<br>
Daken nodded and mentioned quietly.<br>
<br>
“Never grow tired of history?”<br>
<br>
Tanj shook his head, it was true he never tired of the past, learning what had come before. The question was strange to him though, Daken’s meaning was not clear. His striped face showed that he wouldn’t elaborate on the question. Jaern began to dig amongst the books, brushing dust of a few that hadn’t been touched in a long while until he found what he was looking for. He sat down and Tanj placed the torch in a niche in the wall. Leaving the light to play out over the dirt walled room around them. Jaern cleared his throat and began.<br>
<br>
“The Beginnings.”<br>
<br>
For the next few hours they all read, taking turns, and breaks. They talked about life and history and the stories. Tanj talked about his father and mother, and his uncertainty about his future as a bard. Daken of his adopted father, and life as a stable hand at the castle. Jaern spoke mostly of his father, his hero. They finished another chapter of the book and closed it, done for now. It was far past their curfew, and they knew it. They were more than willing to risk the punishment of staying out late, but only to a certain extent.<br>
<br>
“Well my boys… until next time.”<br>
<br>
Jaern flashed a charismatic smile and exited, leaving Tanj and Daken alone. Daken was standing near the crack in the wall, the fire catching his intense slate grey eyes.<br>
<br>
“Tanj are you all right? The story look like it touched you more than usual.”<br>
<br>
Tanj had lifted the torch from the niche and shrugged at Daken.<br>
<br>
“Just the usual feelings, I don’t know my place… I don’t feel like I fit in.”<br>
<br>
Daken nodded, for some reason he seemed to have learned a lot from being an orphan and from spending time at the palace.<br>
<br>
“We all have a place Tanj. If there is any truth to the histories the ancestors will guide you to your place. Until next time.”<br>
<br>
With that simple farewell Daken slinked into the darkness with the silence of a shadow. Tanj stood in the room alone, looking at the pile of books in disarray. Then he left too. He slinked through the crack then up the stairs leading to the door of the abandoned building. The torch was blown out and laid on the floor next to the door and Tanj slowly opened it revealing the night. The door creaked open completely leaving a huge shadow and two glowing yellow orbs before Tanj. He yelped and jumped back, falling. The huge form stepped inside, the door swinging behind him without any force touching it. Tanj skittered back as the shadow loomed seemingly filling the room.<br>
<br>
“Get away!”<br>
<br>
A voice came soft.<br>
<br>
“Tanj be quiet. I bring a message.”<br>
<br>
The voice was familiar somehow. It sounded like Sekath, but it was distorted. Tanj’s mind frantically searched for an explanation.<br>
<br>
“Who are you?!”<br>
<br>
“You don’t recognize me?”<br>
<br>
Tanj shook his head still scared of who this stranger was. Even with the night vision inherent to his race he couldn’t make out more than the basic features of the large feline before him.<br>
<br>
“Well that doesn’t matter now. Get on your feet.”<br>
<br>
Tanj slowly stood.<br>
<br>
“Your father knows you are here, and he knows what you and your friends do every night. Tomorrow you are to come meet with me, here are your summons. You would do well to be on time.”<br>
<br>
A large calloused paw reached out bearing a small slab of acrylia, markings on it detailing it was a summons that would allow him into the castle on official business. Tanj took it with fumbling hands very scared now as to what was going on. Children were NEVER summoned to the castle, but for acceptance as citizens and to be punished.<br>
<br>
“Remember, tomorrow.”<br>
<br>
With that the huge image smiled, white teeth showing in a predatory grin. The door swung open once more and a farewell was offered that Tanj did not catch completely, just the end of it.<br>
<br>
“….. watch over you.”<br>
<br>
He returned home, feeling hot and uncomfortable. His father was not home, and even if he was Tanj wasn’t sure if he would confront him with what had happened. His mother was asleep, and Tanj was grateful. She would likely have just sighed at his late return and smile knowingly, perhaps she even approved, but it always brought a feeling of guilt. Dinner as a family was always important to Sekath, and lately Tanj had been skirting the affair. He did not sleep well that night, fears for what the new day would bring plagued his dreams.<br>
<br>
Tanj awoke to the smell of breakfast, and his mother waiting for him. He ate in silence, his father still no where to be found, dread still filling in his stomach. Tanj wished his mother good bye and left, heading to the castle with reluctance. He showed his summons to the guards and was lead to a room deep within the bowels of the castle. The large door swung open and the guard motioned for Tanj to enter. Taking a deep breath the young Vah Shir stepped inside with uncertainty.<br>
<br>
Fear overtook him in an instant. His father was there. Sekath regarded him without a single flicker of expression. The other Vah Shir, the looming shape that had revealed itself to him the night before was there now as well. An old wizened looking panther.<br>
<br>
“Hello son.”<br>
<br>
Tanj blinked and tried not to show his immense fear.<br>
<br>
“Hello father.”<br>
<br>
Sekath nodded and continued.<br>
<br>
“You don’t know why you were brought here do you?”<br>
<br>
Tanj shook his head.<br>
<br>
“Elder Sorent here has foreseen that you are not meant to be a bard.”<br>
<br>
The older Vah Shir smiled.<br>
<br>
“The spirits teach us much, and they point to you as a listener of their wisdom.”<br>
<br>
Sekath didn’t seem very happy about this, or perhaps something was worrying him as well.<br>
<br>
“That would explain your love of history and legend but not of song.”<br>
<br>
The Elder took over where Sekath left off.<br>
<br>
“The spirits of those legends are what teach us and our ancestors are what guide us. You can hear them in your heart Tanj.”<br>
<br>
Tanj was reeling from these words. None of it made sense. He was chosen for what? To listen to the whispers of those who stories were written of? To listen to the dead? It didn’t make any sense.<br>
<br>
“I don’t know what you mean, I’m going to be a bard, like my father.”<br>
<br>
Sekath chuckled in a mocking manner.<br>
<br>
“You and I both know you have no love of song my son. I am going to leave you in the care of Elder Sorent, he will train you. You are of an age where you may leave home now. So the Elder will be your new caretaker. Your mother and I will see you when your training is complete.”<br>
<br>
Sekath stood and walked over to his son, who was now trembling with confusion and fear. He looked down at his only child, and in a rare show of affection hugged him. Tanj gripped his father like he was the only thing that mattered in the world. Sekath let go and carefully removed his sons arms from around his waist.<br>
<br>
“I love you son. And we will see each other when your training is complete.”<br>
<br>
With that Sekath exited to the room. The door closing was an ominous thud that left Tanj alone with the Elder. What would happen next was the biggest question in his mind.<br>
<br>
“Your father expects me to train you. But I know you better than you may suspect. You don’t take kindly to people telling you what to do. That will come in time. I will give you a choice, but it shall be our little secret. You have two paths before you, one of certainty and dullness that I shall make for you to follow. Many have trod along this path, and many have failed and succeeded. If you wish the path to becoming a Dar’Khura through the traditional means is there for you to follow, and it would be my honor to guide you.”<br>
<br>
The pause was abrupt and it left silence hanging in the air. Tanj swallowed the bile he felt in his throat. The feeling of abandon that his father had left him with was no comfort and he felt very very much alone at this moment. The silence hung in the air for a few more moments before the elder continued.<br>
<br>
“The second option is a new path. One which has never been trod before by anyone, one that you will be forced make for your own. It is unknown and new, to be forged by your own choices and by your own paws. You will either stay here with me and learn what others have been taught, or you will journey to Norrath and learn what you may discover for yourself, by yourself.”<br>
<br>
“Norrath?!”<br>
<br>
The word escaped him before he could quiet it. Tanj felt like he might pass out. Any Vah Shir who left for the planet below Luclin before gaining his citizenship forsook all ties with the empire. It was exile, self imposed perhaps but exile none the less. The elder watched Tanj closely perhaps knowing the workings of his brain perhaps not.<br>
<br>
“It will mean exile for you, but your spirit is strong. I believe it is the path you should choose.”<br>
<br>
Tanj thought it out in his head, the decision was going to make or break him, and he knew it. But he also knew what his father would want. Sekath was proud of his son, though he didn’t always show it and Tanj knew that his father would rather he try to go where no one had gone before rather than follow the safe path that countless others had. As he tried to quell his feelings of fear and doubt he made his choice.<br>
<br>
“Then I will go to Norrath.”<br>
<br>
Darkness crept into the room and Tanj fell once more into the nothingness around him. His own voice echoed to him from the darkness.<br>
<br>
“Who am I? I am a brave soul.”<br>

<br>
The darkness swirled about Tanj once more and suddenly cold was biting at his bones. His heavy cloak provided some protection from the bite of the frost around him. Slowly Tanj blinked and when his eyes reopened they were greeted by a brilliant white, so stunningly pure and shiny that it dazzled his sight for a few short minutes. His sleeping roll was still encasing his body and making him feel claustrophobic. The large Vah Shir had spent another night in his acrylia studded armor, making it that much easier to move quickly if something should strike in the night. He was confused and couldn’t remember where he was. Something was odd… time had passed, he could feel it. A LOT of time had passed…. He was older. A soft rumble of a half made snore came from off to his side, past the remains of a fire and two spits with the remains of a few snow rabbits. Tanj wriggled his way out of his sleeping roll and stood, rolling it up and placing it back in his pack he hefted his spear and headed over to the other bedroll.<br>
<br>
Grindell was still sleeping, the monk was average size for a human, which meant he was just tall enough to reach Tanj’s shoulders. He nudged the monks bedroll with a booted foot and woke him up. Grindell blinked and let loose a soft chuckle.<br>
<br>
“Up early today eh Tanj?”<br>
<br>
“Lets get going Grindell, we came to hunt lets do it.”<br>
<br>
“Yes I know… I cam to hunt Tanj, you’re just along to provide me with the powers I need to show my superiority to the rest of the world.”<br>
<br>
Tanj held back a smile. Grindell was quite full of himself to the casual listener. The monk was an odd companion that Tanj had befriended a while ago. The two were a very odd pair, deadly in combat and constantly insulting each other. To anyone not used to hearing their banter it sounded as if they hated each other, in fact they had some sort of friendship however tenuous. Grindell was up as Tanj sat down to focus his mind on gathering the necessary spirits for the days hunt. The monk finished rolling up his sleeping pad and placed it in his pack. He traveled light, much lighter than Tanj, and the cold didn’t seem to bother him at all though Tanj could feel himself shivering occasionally under his fur.<br>
<br>
“Today the Frost Giants are going to get a taste of my fists.”<br>
<br>
Tanj couldn’t resist the insult he instantly thought up and replied quickly.<br>
<br>
“What are you going to do? Break their ankles? You are probably the size of their big toes.”<br>
<br>
Grindell smirked.<br>
<br>
“Laugh it up fuzz butt, all you do is sit in the snow and watch… like some sadistic voyeur who likes watching things die.”<br>
<br>
Tanj nodded, smiling.<br>
<br>
“Perhaps, perhaps not.”<br>
<br>
Grindell didn’t respond, so Tanj went back to his meditations. The monk and he had left the Coldain city of Thurgadin over a day ago and even with the blessing of the wolf the deep snows had forced them to take their time. They had been to the Eastern Wastes before, but that was over a month ago. Things had gone well, they had slain several giants. After a few months doing other things they had met back up in Thurg and decided to go hunting once more. The partnership felt a bit more meaningful than a full hunting party. And besides, the stories were much better, two adventurers fighting against the towering giants of the Kromzek. Tanj felt the final spirit he required agree to aid him, and he reflexively closed his open palms, feeling their power come into him for his use. He stood up and grabbed his spear, Grindell was finishing his daily exercises, warming up muscles for fighting the bright clear day would bring. His fists punched the air so fast they blurred, Tanj didn’t think the giants stood a chance.<br>
<br>
“Well then lets get started shall we, we should return with a few heads to give to the Coldain to strengthen them as allies.”<br>
<br>
“Yea lets get to it, can’t wait to kick some giant butt.”<br>
<br>
Tanj nodded and began to cast a multitude of spells, watching Grindell’s physique stretch slightly as his strength increased by a respectable amount. After a few minutes of binding the spirits to Grindell’s person he bound himself to a few spirits as well for protection. Grindell punched the air experimentally and seemed satisfied with the result as his hands moving in slicing motions with a wind loud enough to sound like he was actually cutting the crisp air. Tanj went back to meditating and gathered a few more spirits, offensive ones that would aid him in times of battle. The spirit of torment, and agony came to him quickly as always, eager to do their part by burning his enemies with swift poison or the slower acting disease. He stood once more this time ready for battle. He motioned to Grindell.<br>
<br>
“You’re the monk, it is your show.”<br>
<br>
“Right then lets get going.”<br>
<br>
Grindell took off with a speed possessed by no normal human, but Tanj kept up easily the wolf spirit in them both allowing them to move swifter than normal. The day passed quickly at first, hunting down and killing whatever crossed their pathes while slowly making their way to the ominous wall in the distance. A huge granite structure that marked the domain of Kael Drakkel, the wall was a marker that they were heading into Frost Giant territory. They crossed paths with a few scouts of the Frost Giant empire, all easily dispatched before they could call for help. Before midday struck they were at the single opening in the huge wall, the gate that lead to the giant courtyard that would eventually take them into the caves of Kael. Hovering his above the chasm that was guarded by the two giants they decided what to do next.<br>
<br>
“So how about it spiritcaller? We going to do this and take it to these guys? Or hang back and keep beating on the scouts?”<br>
<br>
“Lets bring back some new trophies… the scouts pose no threat anymore. Try to split them first, I’d rather not deal with two at a time especially not these guards.”<br>
<br>
Grindell nodded grinning like Tanj was explaining to a cleric how to pray to their god.<br>
<br>
“I know what I’m doing Tanj.”<br>
<br>
A quick decision of will and the hovering spell was removed, Grindell dropped, and right behind him came Tanj, they fell a good distance before landing into the snow. Grindell rolled easily to get back on his feet and quickly recover from the shock of landing, his training in such things helping his natural reflexes. Tanj’s reflexes were honed better but he had no training like the human, and his recover was a bit more awkward.<br>
<br>
“Here comes one now…”<br>
<br>
Grindell didn’t finish but ran off and proceeded to yell at the top of his lungs at the nearest giant. Insulting his mother most likely, it was his usual pulling strategy and it still made Tanj want to laugh.<br>
<br>
“Look out I got one on my butt.”<br>
<br>
Tanj blinked and shrugged.<br>
<br>
“What you want me to help you out? I thought Mr. Big Shot could take a little giant on his own.”<br>
<br>
“VERY funny guess you get to deal with him on your own!”<br>
<br>
Grindell laughed then gasped as if his heart had stopped, then fell face first into the snow not even flinching as he hit the freezing cold ground. Tanj gaped, then realized that the monk had probably intentionally stopped his heart…. Feigning death, the giant in the distance was approaching rapidly and he didn’t look happy. Tanj laughed not thinking Grindell would actually be serious. Several more huge steps by the large armored beast and Tanj was ready to take the monk seriously.<br>
<br>
“Ok ok I was kidding!”<br>
<br>
Grindell popped back up to his feet in a quick motion and grinned.<br>
<br>
“Thought so.”<br>
<br>
The giant approached and Tanj quickly sent off the spirits under his control to annoy and harm the giant so Grindell could dispatch it easily. The monks hands moved swiftly making quick work of the giant despite his smaller size. With a resounding *THUD!* the giant’s corpse settled into the snow.<br>
<br>
“Well that wasn’t so hard was it lets do it ag….”<br>
<br>
Grindell’s words were cut off by a horn. Something was coming… That horn meant something that tickled Tanj’s mind but he couldn’t remember what it was. Grindell looked up and behind Tanj towards the chasm and uttered a slurred sentence of expletives that would turn even an Ogre’s face red. Tanj knew that this wasn’t a joke but something serious. He turned to look…. His mind registered what he saw as fast as the quick tongued Grindell said it.<br>
<br>
“Hunting Party… coming our way NOW a GIANT hunting party!”<br>
<br>
Tanj started heading for Kael… he had been there before and knew more than a few hiding spots in the caverns, even the giants didn’t know all the passageways and hiding locations in their city, especially the ones that would fit a race less than half their size.<br>
<br>
“RUN NOW! Head for Kael lets MOVE Grindell!”<br>
<br>
Grindell nodded and started running with Tanj, they passed the gate, the second guard noticing them and running now behind them. It was a huge train of giants, and the hunting party behind them know knew something was amiss as they passed the corpse of their fallen companion. The next series of events happened faster than Tanj could react. Somehow the giants huge steps had caught up with him and Grindell despite the spirit blessing them with speed. Grindell stopped and turned.<br>
<br>
“Keep going!”<br>
<br>
Tanj stopped as well.<br>
<br>
“ARE YOU CRAZY?!”<br>
<br>
“MOVE DAMMIT I’m a monk remember?! I’ll keep them busy for a while and then fall. They’ll think they’ve slain me and it will buy you time to get away.”<br>
<br>
Those precious seconds for that exchange to occur made it worthless. The Giants could see them both clearly now, one bellowed.<br>
<br>
“DAR’KHURA YOU SHALL FINALLY PAY FOR YOUR TRESPASSING ON OUR HOMELANDS!”<br>
<br>
Tanj winced… he was hated more than a little by most of the Giants, and they would likely ignore Grindell to get after him… Tanj turned and continued running for Kael leaving Grindell behind knowing he could fend for himself. He began to hear the pounding of footsteps behind him and felt the sense of urgency rising, he sent out a call to a spirit he rarely used. That of the cheetah. The spirit came to him and he was thankful, but the steps behind him grew and before he could bless himself with the speed of the lanky plains hunter he felt a large book the size of his chest connect with his back. Tanj went flying with a loud grunt, the giant easily punting him quite far. He landed heavily and his teeth gnashed, cutting his cheek. His back ached but he struggled to his feet and cast a spell, the cheetah spirit swelled within him and he ran with a speed so fast even the giants couldn’t keep up. He didn’t stop till he reached the caves of Kael and hid inside. Those hunting him passed by certain they would find him somewhere within the caves. Tanj waited breathing heavily and slowly healing himself and mending his wounds while he waited. After a few minutes he felt it was safe to return and make sure Grindell had made it.<br>
<br>
Tanj ran back out into the huge expanse of snowy white that formed the huge courtyard between the wall and Kael. Grindell was easy to find… he had two large forms looming over him. Tanj approached and found the monk fighting for his life.<br>
<br>
“I told you to get the hell out of here Tanj, get moving now!”<br>
<br>
Grindell managed to shout this at Tanj’s approaching form as he was pummeled by huge fists, he dodged some of the strikes and struck back but it was clear he didn’t stand a chance.<br>
<br>
“Not a chance!”<br>
<br>
Grindell grunted as one huge fist caught him from a blindside it sent him sailing, Tanj had already begun casting a spell to heal his friend, but by the time Grindell’s beaten body had hit the soft snow it was too late. Tanj’s spell didn’t take hold, he could feel Grindell’s spirit leaving his body. The two giants breathed heavily for a few seconds regarding the new comer, Tanj stood there, feeling rage boil up inside of him. Grindell was a friend, one of few Tanj considered true friends. These creatures before him had killed his friend, and the rage that filled him was such that he wanted revenge at any cost. The spirits flew from him sharing his rage and struck the giants with dangerous accuracy.<br>
<br>
“Now its YOUR TURN TO MEET YOUR DOOM!”<br>
<br>
Tanj one of the giants fell swiftly clawing at his body trying to remove the burning sensation he felt in his very blood. The other shrugged off the spirits as if they were nothing, and closed the short distance between him and the shaman. Tanj was in the middle of casting as the fist approached him from directly ahead, but he couldn’t move or the spell would not be complete. The huge knuckles connected and he could feel his ribs creak has he staggered back coughing up blood. But the spell completed itself and his foe now found himself moving so slowly that it was nearly laughable. Tanj got to his feet and spit blood, then rooted the giant to the ground with another spell before backing off a safe distance he yelled at the giant before him.<br>
<br>
“NOT SO TOUGH NOW ARE YOU! Try fighting someone ONE ON ONE!”<br>
<br>
He sent spirit after vengeful spirit at the giant who had yet to respond to his anger, most of which bounced off the beast with little effect. A few held and slowly began to eat at the soul of the huge creature. Eventually his reserve was spent, the spirits had all left him. Tanj knew this was going to be a close match…. The giant was dying slowly but the spirits were fleeting now, and the giant would be free of his bonds any moment. Tanj cast one more spell hoping it took hold it did, but in doing so the bond broke free. The giant was coming, and all Tanj could do was run and hope the giant died before it reached him. He was tired and with no spirit to heal him he was close to unconsciousness, the giant behind him was flagging badly as well, but was not willing to give up the fight either. Then the turning point occurred… Tanj had circled back around without realizing it, and his foot caught something causing him to trip. Grindell’s corpse lay just behind him as he struggled back to his feet. The monks body had slowly began to sink into the deep snow. Tanj had time to get fully to his feet and take another step when the final blow struck him from behind blackening his vision, he was unconscious and near death before he hit the ground.<br>
<br>
Hours later his vision slowly cleared to the sight of a cleric standing over him. Grindell stood next to the High Elf woman, wrapped in many thick bandages. Tanj stuttered.<br>
<br>
“How…?”<br>
<br>
Grindell smiled.<br>
<br>
“You know me, I’m just a big faker… but that time wasn’t so much on purpose. I didn’t manage to regain consciousness till you were out cold but I beat that bastard down for you. Yer tough furbutt I’ll give you that.”<br>
<br>
Grindell motioned to a large pile of armor behind him, looted from the giant Tanj had fought. The vah shir tried to laugh but the pain it brought him simply knocked him out once more, this time the blackness remained.<br>
<br>
He began to fall for a third time, this time Grindell’s voice echoed at him from the darkness.<br>
<br>
“Who are you? You are a vengeful spirit.” <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/art2/tanj/sigpic3.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub145.ezboard.com/btheedgers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grindell187>Grindell187</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Monk Pervert</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#FF0000>(1/31/03 5:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> sad thing about this is that a freakin n()()b trained heck outta us...otherwise we wouldnt have ever fallen to anything. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->___________________<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=366509">Grindell Stonefistz</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->49 Monk of Doom<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;You looka lika you need azz kick&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://wolf.cyberstreet.net/index.php?ref=277656">Eastcoast_Pimp</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub145.ezboard.com/btheedgers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tuthmes@theedgers>Tuthmes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Power comes from the mind.</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/03 4:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Chapter 2</span><hr size=1> Still Hellof a Story perhaps i have misjudged you grindell /bow my sences are not what they use to be as i have been so long away from Everquest............ longer and longer ( we shall see) <br>

<br>
Chapter 3: A Meeting with The Hunter<br>
<br>
A warm hot wind whipped at the short fur that covered Tanj’s face, his eyes were shut, but if they had been open his view would have been the same. Blackness was all about, he wouldn’t even be able to see his own nose should he try, but there was something odd about this part of the journey, the falling continued for what seemed like ages. Tanj slowly opened his eyes to see if he had missed something, he was still in free fall and every direction felt like up. It was disconcerting to his reflexes which constantly tried to position him in the optimal position for landing. The end of a fall would never come though, and as the darkness stretched out for eternity Tanj’s thinking began to clear. The fog of the potion was fading, or so it seemed. Each of his memories had seemed crisp and clear, as if they were the first time he had experienced them, now he had time to think about them and to realize that they had all occurred already. Tanj wondered if his journey was over, if something was wrong with the potion. He stretched his mind out in search of spirits, something familiar he could use to escape the falling. Tanj could find nothing, perhaps something was wrong, and this was the end, or perhaps there was more Tanj could only wait. He blinked and suddenly the darkness gave way.<br>
<br>
Images flew past him, blurry and with ripped edges, as if he were looking at paintings ruined by immersion in water. He recognized himself in some of the images. But he was no longer taking part as he once was. Tanj was now very worried that something was wrong. The shaman tried to call forth a spell to return him to the point where his soul was bound, and it seemed to actually work. A shimmering gate appeared above him and over his shoulder. Without the sound of it opening he would have never known it was there, the images around him now bathing him in various colors of light. He twisted his body and it responded easily in the absence of gravity. The gate stood before him, wind whistling through it violently. Tanj had only one problem, he had no way to pass through it. He flailed his arms but to no use, and his feet had nothing to push on. The gate wouldn’t move towards him either. Tanj growled under his breath angry at his current situation and tried to seek a solution.<br>
<br>
The images continued to swirl about and the gate glowed before him but Tanj could think of no way out of this puzzle. So he tried to cast another spell, this one requiring the call of a spirit. Perhaps with the levitation granted by the hummingbird Tanj could walk across the very air and through the gate. He could feel the spirit out there behind the blurred movie of his life, and he pulled it to him. The spirit flew towards him with great speed, not delaying or arguing with Tanj’s request to aid him, but something was amiss. The spirit slammed into Tanj with a force so powerful he grunted in pain, his ribs shifted with the blow and he was sent flying through the shimmering portal, which closed swiftly behind him.<br>
<br>
Tanj’s eyes were blurred, and it was very difficult to make anything out. Something was certain though, this was most definitely NOT the Plane of Knowledge. His vision slowly cleared and his breathing came back under his control as he began to ignore the pain that was still pulsing in his side. The embers of a large bonfire lay before him, giving the surrounding soft grass an eerie yellow-red glow. Tanj could see short forms stretching out around him, small bumps in the soft grass he now lay on. They were stones, unmarked and smooth. The large Vah Shir rose to his feet and moved a little closer to the fire, wondering what was going on in his mind his thoughts swirled.<br>
<br>
‘What is this nonsense?! I summoned a hummingbird and was greeted with a blow fit for a bull. Where am I now, and why hasn’t the journey ended?!’<br>
<br>
‘Because your Journey has yet to truly begin.’<br>
<br>
Tanj took two steps back in surprise, which placed one foot directly into the hot embers of the now dead bonfire. He yelped as the bottom of his naked foot was seared and hopped back from the fire.<br>
<br>
“Who is that? Who are you spirit?”<br>
<br>
There was no response as Tanj slowly lowered himself into a sitting position to examine the pads of his feet. He thought to himself.<br>
<br>
‘Something is definitely wrong….. There are spirits out there but I don’t recognize any of them.’<br>
<br>
‘Yes Dar’Khura something is VERY wrong. You are not supposed to be here.’<br>
<br>
Tanj growled, and shouted at the silence.<br>
<br>
“THEN WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO BE?!”<br>
<br>
The sound of wind brushing past the smooth stones embedded in the grass was all the greeted his ears. He was becoming frustrated and angry, his two injuries simply adding to the emotions.<br>
<br>
‘Where AM I supposed to be? I’ve been searching for that answer for sometime… this journey was supposed to help.’<br>
<br>
The voice came once more from all around, and the embers suddenly crackled and rose back into full flame, the sudden infusion of bright light sufficiently blinded Tanj’s low light vision and made him throw up a hand to guard shield his face from the blast of hot air.<br>
<br>
‘You are to be on the path. You’ve lost your way little one!’<br>
<br>
Tanj blinked and slowly lowered his hand, someone was standing in the huge bonfire, a short figure encased in flames. It strode out from the fire, the flames peeling off the silhouette leaving the face and body of a nude male Dark Elf. He grinned showing bright white teeth, which were sharp and pointed like fangs rather than normal teeth. As he continued to walk towards Tanj his body became clothed, or rather encased in darkness. The darkness and shadows that had retreated with the explosion of flame slowly crawled back in as streams of darkness, the climbed up the body of the blue skinned elf as he walked, wrapping about him until he was wearing hoodless robe. He came up to Tanj’s lying form and squatted, regarding Tanj with sharp eyes that were entirely white without pupils. Tanj growled softly at the Dark Elf and backed up a bit shifting himself into a sitting position.<br>
<br>
“Grettings to you my prey, the Dar’Khura, welcome to the Yard. What brings you to my home?”<br>
<br>
‘My PREY?!’<br>
<br>
Tanj’s thoughts were not greeted with a response this time, whoever was hearing them was no longer responding. He tried to form a response, and simply stuttered.<br>
<br>
“I’m… lost.”<br>
<br>
The dark elf nodded.<br>
<br>
“I can see that, it is rare to see my prey here unless I have caught them. Yet you have journeyed here on your own. Do you seek me out for some purpose?”<br>
<br>
Tanj shook his head not wanting anything to do with this frightening image before him. This seemed to amuse the shadow encased Tier’Dal who grinned once more showing a mouth full of fangs.<br>
<br>
“I seek a way back to myself.”<br>
<br>
“I can see that as well, your soul is far from its home Vah Shir. You know not who I am do you?”<br>
<br>
Tanj pondered the question in his head, he had an inkling but he would rather not be right. His eyes wandered to the smooth stones all around, Tanj quietly hoped that this being was not what he appeared to be.<br>
<br>
“You do know don’t you? Or you have some idea? Well you are on the correct path. I am the hunter who has existed as long as the souls have found their homes inside mortal flesh. I am the destroyer of the mortal coils that trap the immortal souls of all, and it is my purpose to hunt. You may call me Death. It is a pleasure to meet you Dar’Khura. I rarely find my prey before I claim their bodies for my trophy. As you may have figured out already the Yard is the eternal trophy room of my hunts, the graves of all those mortal forms I have taken.”<br>
<br>
Death extended its hand towards Tanj, and the shadows peeled back the same way the flames had to reveal a hand. It hung there in the air less than two feet from Tanj’s face. Fear was boiling up in his stomach, but it seemed that Death had no thirst for the “hunt”, as he called it, at this time. Tanj slowly raised a large palm to shake the hand of the Death. They shook and then Death hauled Tanj quickly to his feet. The Vah Shir towered easily over the short elf, and as he peered down Death was surveying the gravestones all about.<br>
<br>
“And you know not why you are here you say. I have not had a visitor in some time, and your hunt has yet to be called, I am not an evil being, so your spirit and body shall survive until the horn is sounded. When that time comes… there are no promises once the hunt is called there is only one conclusion. Lets see if we can get to the bottom of this shall we?”<br>
<br>
Death laughed softly and the wind blew once more making the large bonfire dance in the warm air. Tanj nodded, still very much full of fear but keeping it under control, he responded.<br>
<br>
“I was searching to find myself, and was ripped from that search to this place.”<br>
<br>
Tanj slowly contained his fear and shoved it down as Death seemed to nod, lost in thought still staring at all the stones.<br>
<br>
“You are a shaman, to be truthful your kind visit me the most. Those that understand how to use the spirits, as well as their own can travel places that many know nothing of. I’ve been sought out for the sake of help. I’ve been sought for the sake of power. I’ve even been sought out for the cause of love. But it has never been on accident, those that travel here all do so for some reason. You are the first to not know why he is here.”<br>
<br>
Tanj couldn’t think of a proper response to Death’s ponderings. So he simply described the situation that brought him here.<br>
<br>
“I was experiencing my life as if it was the first time, and then it stopped, I was falling in darkness and sought a way out. I attempted to summon a spirit and instead was forced into this place.”<br>
<br>
Death turned and peered up at Tanj, it seemed like he hadn’t listened to Tanj’s word’s pre-occupied with something else. His eyes slowly crawled down Tanj’s face to his chest, making the Vah Shir’s skin crawl under the fur.<br>
<br>
“No that’s not it at all….. Ah yes, here is the problem.”<br>
<br>
Death reached out a hand and swiftly touched it to Tanj’s chest, a light bright enough to burn away the shadows that made up Death’s clothing emanated from between Tanj’s chest and Death’s palm, the pure white light swirled, then Tanj was shoved back a few feet. He almost stumbled as his feet struggled to keep his body upright. Death held a large white ball in his hand. He peered at it for a few moments, Tanj as well, wondering what that sphere represented. He knew it was not his soul for his soul was what was making up his physical form for the time being, it was something else. Death’s clothing reformed as he peered at the bright white sphere of light, then he plunged two fingers into it. When he removed his other hand there was a long trail of sickly green trailing behind it. It looked like phlegm, a disgusting strand of thick sticky mucus. Death shook his hand to clear it of the start of the thread and continued to pull out more, and more and more. Until it appeared that there was no possible way the sphere could hold so much filth. When death finished there was a small pile of yellowish puss on the ground. He peered at the white sphere which somehow appeared to be more pure now than before.<br>
<br>
“That should do it.”<br>
<br>
“What did - ”<br>
<br>
Tanj began to ask but before he could finish death tossed the sphere at Tanj. He stopped mid sentence and reached out to grab it, he caught it in his hands and it immediately dissipated, becoming absorbed into his body. Death nodded approvingly, and Tanj asked once more.<br>
<br>
“What did you do? What was that ball of light?”<br>
<br>
“That light was the embodiment of your emotions and of your ideas, and faith, essentially it is what makes you, you. But there was something wrong with it. There was too much of this in there.”<br>
<br>
Death motioned to the yellowish goo that lay on the ground… it seemed to quiver as it was pointed to, and it made Tanj’s skin crawl.<br>
<br>
“And what is that?”<br>
<br>
“That? It’s your fear….. You have much more than you know Tanj Dar’Khura, more than I have seen in a single being in a long time. You’ve done a very good job at hiding it, and bottling it and storing it in a safe place where it cannot eat at you. But it’s too much for you to bear and it would have escaped and eaten you alive eventually.”<br>
<br>
“Then I thank you for your help Death –”<br>
<br>
Death cut him off before he could finish his statement.<br>
<br>
“I have not helped you much my Prey. I have simply shown you the root of your biggest problem. The only way to keep your soul free of this menace to your mind is to face it. I suggest you prepare yourself.”<br>
<br>
Even as they conversed the puddle of sickly colored mucus was moving, it slowly stretched upwards into a huge looming form, and Tanj gulped...... <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/art2/tanj/sigpic3.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub145.ezboard.com/btheedgers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=grindell187>Grindell187</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Monk Pervert</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#FF0000>(2/7/03 9:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Chapter 3</span><hr size=1> holy moses tanj....this is gonna take sometime to read. good god man. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->___________________<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=366509">Grindell Stonefistz</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->50 Monk of Doom<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;You looka lika you need azz kick&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://wolf.cyberstreet.net/index.php?ref=277656">Eastcoast_Pimp</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub145.ezboard.com/btheedgers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tanjewian>Tanj Ewian</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.angelfire.com/art2/tanj/finalcut.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mr. Fuzzy<BR>The Edger with a life.</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/2/03 11:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=121.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Chapter 4</span><hr size=1> Chapter 4: “To Be Fearless…..”<br>
<br>
The form loomed up oozing and graying, its form began to harden as it stretched upward, the ooze giving way to a broken and scaled surface. Twin holes of sick yellow opened up in the darkness above, two eyes staring down regarding the tall Vah Shir below. A mouth stretched, pulled from the form by unseen hands, a long jaw spiked with sharp fangs. The skin of the beast crackled as it hardened into something deadly. Death crossed his hands and watched, a look of curiosity on his face, perhaps this was new to him as well.<br>
<br>
Tanj quelled the trembling in his hands by clenching them into fists. He felt no presence he could call to his aid as he stared at the eyes above. The head of the beast lowered slowly from its great height, the mouth opening, cracking through the hardened skin stretching as the maw extended open in a rumble of terror. Tanj was frozen, unable to move his instincts telling him to remain still and this beast would pass over him. His armor was his only protection, his spear and shield no where to be found, and it suddenly felt hot, his quick breathing making it harder to inhale with each breath.<br>
<br>
Death blinked as the crackling continued with a loud snap large shafts of new black and grey puss erupted from the carapace of the body and maw, they hardened as well, as Tanj took a few steps back still having no idea how he would get out of this situation. The shafts split into claws, and hardened, four evil looking blades dripping softly onto the grass. Death spoke up as Tanj continued to remain inactive.<br>
<br>
“You will perish unless you fight, CONFRONT IT Tanj!”<br>
<br>
Tanj gulped again, his hands still clenched tightly into his palms, he tried to summon his courage, and found a few shreds still remained. He took a deep breath and as the monstrous form before him reared back to swing at him Tanj roared, a huge rumbling blast of anger, courage, and even a little fear. It echoed out into the silence of the Yard, bouncing off the stones, and magnifying until it was deafening.<br>
<br>
The creature paused for a split second then swung at Tanj, claws outstretched seeking blood. Tanj’s face twisted into a snarl as he leaped clear of the claws, jumping towards the beast one arm flung out in front of him bent at the elbow to shove the beast back his other hand outstretched behind him open palmed claws extended. His right arm made contact with the shell of the creature’s chest, shoving it back, he could feel it crack slightly underneath his weight and power. He brought his left hand forward to strike, and something formed within it, a spear, his open palm reflexively grasped it and thrust forward with all the power he could muster.<br>
<br>
The spear’s head smashed through the shell of Tanj’s Fear with the sound of shattering glass it pierced the ooze underneath, the creature roared and began took a step back. Tanj pressed forward both feet skidding back in the grass tearing it up as he struggled to push forward, the haft of the spear flexed, bending as the tip met resistance underneath the ooze. His muscles relaxed for a second and then he flexed again redoubling his efforts. The haft of the spear sunk in another few inches and the screeching howl of the beast echoed now through the silence, forcing Tanj to close his eyes at the pain it caused him. He could feel the spear bending in his hands, then snapping as it couldn’t drive any deeper in. The howl ended as the spear broke, the creature recovered from the pain and swung again at Tanj.<br>
<br>
His feet took over, reflexes suddenly honed by adrenaline, his feet began to shove him back, to push him out of danger, but it wasn’t fast enough. One large clawed arm wrapped around his body lifting him off the ground. Tanj struggled as the creature squeezed, cracking his ribs. Its eyes glowed now with a menacing purpose as it’s maw opened again, a tongue of mucus behind the rows of blade like teeth. Tanj lifted the broken spear haft his left hand, and yelled through the pain that was blurring his vision.<br>
<br>
“GO TO HELL!”<br>
<br>
The spear flew from his hand and smashed into the beasts forehead, it flinched, then grinned. Something intelligent behind those eyes laughed softly as its mouth began to drool, in anticipation of its meal. Tanj looked down at death as the clawed fingers moved him towards the abyss of Fear’s stomach.<br>
<br>
“Help me!”<br>
<br>
Death shook his head seeming truly sad.<br>
<br>
“I cannot, this is your fight, you must survive it or die by it. If you fail your soul will wander for I will have not laid it to rest….”<br>
<br>
Death continued speaking but Tanj didn’t hear it, the fist opened and he fell down Fear’s gullet. He looked up and through his blurry vision the last bit of light from the bonfire disappeared as the maw closed above him. Tanj began to pant harder, and winced at his pain. He tried to calm himself, to get his breathing under control. He took a deep breath and lost it just as quickly as his fear filled him.<br>
<br>
He felt the ooze surrounding him flowing into him, through his ears, mouth, eyes, and even his very skin. The form around him flexed and shuddered, shrinking as it seeped back into him filling him to the brim. It was more than he could bear, it was all the fear he had stored, ignored, and shoved down for years. Tanj couldn’t handle it and screamed in pain as he curled up tightly clutching his head. He felt himself lower to the ground as the entire creature was absorbed by him, leaving him coated in a vile substance. He rolled on the ground consumed by his fear, murmuring words that meant nothing. Eventually even the coating on his skin was absorbed leaving him back the way he was. The last thing he saw was Death standing over him a sad expression on his face. He reached out and with two fingers closed Tanj’s eyelids.<br>
Tanj felt himself letting go, losing his wish to live, everything was beginning to get fuzzy around the edges.<br>
<br>
‘NO! You are STRONGER than this DAR’KHURA!’<br>
<br>
The voice came from all around once more, Tanj felt something roll him over, and two sharp objects pierce the flesh on his neck. Something coursed through his veins, and the fuzziness was replaced with pain, burning in all his veins. He sat up still blind and coughed violently, his chest heaving with the force. Tanj’s muscles convulsed unbidden, and heavily, so hard he vomited, the very substance his body absorbed earlier once more being rejected. The sickness continued for what seemed like an eternity, until he was dry heaving. His chest burned from the convulsions and he coughed a few more times, raising a hand to wipe his mouth. His eyes opened slowly to an Erudite woman before him, bald with several tattoos around her head, tattoos of eyes.<br>
<br>
Tanj spat once more clearing his mouth, the sickly puddle of ooze next to him not moving, and looking truly dead. He looked up at the woman before him as he remained in the sitting position, he tried to shake his head clear, while acknowledging her presence.<br>
<br>
“Hello Milady…..”<br>
<br>
Her voice was soft as always.<br>
<br>
“Greetings Tanj, it seems I’ve found you when you needed me most.”<br>
<br>
Death looked disappointed for some reason, he stood a ways away across the bonfire from Tanj and the woman. Tanj breathed a sigh of relief, he was in safe hands, or so he hoped. The shaman knew who this apparition was, she was his chosen spirit, that of the Spider, the tattoos were the hint at her true form.<br>
<br>
“Thank you for saving me…”<br>
<br>
She nodded not smiling.<br>
<br>
“This was the first time you have truly needed my aid, you are strong Tanj, stronger than I had thought when I chose you for my own.”<br>
<br>
Tanj nodded still trying to clear his head of the pain. The choosing ceremony had been a taxing one, he had eventually chosen the quiet observant path of the spider. A silent observer overlooked often, but knowing of many things, and possessing of the venom to defend itself and to harm its foes, that was likely the very thing he felt in his veins that had cleansed him of his fear.<br>
<br>
“You’ve learned much on this journey…. It’s time for the final lesson before you return to your physical self. Mathorin wishes to speak with you. Remember, I am watching Tanj, your deeds are my own, and your failings are my own. Be strong and remember the path you follow is your own, but do not be afraid to ask for help along the way.”<br>
<br>
Tanj bowed his head in thanks as the form of the Erudite woman burst into a pile of a thousand large spiders, falling to the ground skittering in all directions across the grass and into the distant darkness of the yard. A voice whispered.<br>
<br>
‘Keep your Soul strong Tanj, I will be watching.’<br>
<br>
She was gone before Tanj could even form the question: “Who is Mathorin?”<br>
<br>
The bonfire crackled loudly throwing sharp shadows as it flared once more. Death turned and stepped into one of the shadows and disappeared from view, the fire burned down and a new form loomed over him. It was a wrinkled barbarian with a face that bore with it the creases of age and wisdom. Tanj recognized the face, but couldn’t remember from where. In a strong deep voice that carried with it power that belied the age of the body it came from the new presence asked.<br>
<br>
“How does this night find you Tanj?”<br>
<br>
Tanj grunted and pulled himself to a more upright position.<br>
<br>
“This night…. It finds me battered.”<br>
<br>
The craggy face split into a toothy grin, the old barbarian laughed, deep and throaty, Tanj was able to get a clearer view of the barbarian now and that familiarity was still there.<br>
<br>
“Did the potion give you the answers you sought?”<br>
<br>
Revelation hit Tanj, this was the shaman that gave him the very potion that had induced these visions. He didn’t respond at first.<br>
<br>
“Or did it leave you with more questions than you started with?”<br>
<br>
Tanj shook his head.<br>
<br>
“I found some answers, but not all of them…”<br>
<br>
The barbarian shrugged.<br>
<br>
“Then it was some use, that was it’s purpose. I’m here to give you the final lesson before the journey is finished.”<br>
<br>
Tanj nodded the final feelings of the sickness seeping from his body. He moved over a foot or two, distancing himself from the pool of sickness that was once his fear embodied. The old oracle nodded approvingly and began.<br>
<br>
<br>
“Do you know what three things make up all sentient beings Tanj? The body, which all know of, and understand how to use, it is the most basic of all possessions of living things. Your body protects you, it has reflexes to defend itself, it feels pain to tell you when something is wrong, and it reacts on its own if need be. But pain, that is the weakness of the body. You can train yourself to overcome this weakness, and power through, but it comes at a cost.”<br>
<br>
He paused for a moment regarding Tanj as if to make sure he was paying attention before continuing.<br>
<br>
“Next is the mind, it is more complex, you think because of your mind, you feel emotions through it and it helps make up who you are. It can change the type of person you are. The mind has its own weakness, sadness. Sadness fills you Tanj, you know it, and you can’t deny it. It keeps you silent when you should speak, it keeps you hidden in the darkness when you should be seeking the light. Sadness magnifies fear, and fear is the ultimate ailment, for fear is the ailment of the soul.”<br>
<br>
Tanj opened his mouth to ask a question but the old barbarian lifted a hand to stay his words.<br>
<br>
“Finally the soul, it is the most powerful of your possessions, and it suffers from the most powerful ailment. Fear plagues the soul, like pain can plague sore muscles or sadness can wreak havoc with the mind. Your fear has consumed you, and if not for the blessing of the Spider Spirit you would have succumbed to it. You know how to defeat pain, that is with pure force of will, you can ignore it and shove it down. Sadness is different you can ignore it but it will eat at you slowly, never enough to cause any serious problems, but enough for it to affect how you act, though you may not notice it. Sadness can be defeated by finding happiness. You can find happiness many ways. You in particular have found it in companionship, in your few friends. But you still possess sadness, so you must find other sources of happiness. Lastly there is your fear, the sickness of your soul that will break you if you do not cure it. Do you know how to defeat fear Tanj?”<br>
<br>
Tanj answered without blinking, giving the obvious answer.<br>
<br>
“With courage.”<br>
<br>
“Yes… with courage, but where does one find courage? If you are consumed by fear can you find courage? How do you become fearless if you have fear? It is a paradox. There is one true cure to fear, one thing that will clear any being of any fear they may face. The one thing that will make you invincible to anything, whether it be fear, pain or sadness is love. Not the love of the flesh, not the love of brotherhood and companionship, the love of the soul. That is to say true love. Again though you are faced with another paradox, a riddle that faces all creatures, to find true love you must not fear, you must lose your fear to find it. In finding it you will be cleansed of your fear. Do you understand?”<br>
<br>
Tanj shook his head it didn’t make much sense to him. Some of the lesson he understood clearly this riddle was nothing more than a jumble of confusion for him, he thought he understood parts but most of it didn’t make sense. The wrinkled oracle smiled broadly and stretched out a powerful hand, laying it on Tanj’s shoulder. He stared deeply into Tanj’s golden eyes.<br>
<br>
“It will come my son, in time. Until then, go forth and strive to be fearless.”<br>
<br>
Tanj nodded and the image around him suddenly went blurry. The colors faded into one another, the yellow and orange of the fire melting into everything else until there was nothing but a warm orange before him. His eyes opened and he was greeted by a rising sun over the ruins of the ancient city deep within Kunark. He pulled up into a sitting position from where he had laid and dreamed. Along the soft wind a voice whispered.<br>
<br>
“You are Tanj Dar’Khura, you are a strong spirit with much to learn.”<br>
<br>
<br>
