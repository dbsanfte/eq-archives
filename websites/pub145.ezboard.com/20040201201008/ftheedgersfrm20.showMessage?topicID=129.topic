<br>
A tavern. How she loved a good tavern. The bustling people, the smell of alcohol, unwashed people, and excitement. Most her life had revolved around taverns one way or another, it was her earliest recollection and the place where she felt most at home. Anything could happen, and usually did.<br>
<br>
Aaldari deposited some coins on the bar and collected her drink from the bartender. Making her way through the crowd, she spotted her companion, a well-dressed paladin who looked very uncomfortable sitting in the middle of the room. He fidgeted and had not touched his drink even though he had been waiting for her for a short while.<br>
<br>
Aaldari beamed a smile at him and plopped herself down at the table, putting her feet up on the chair between them. “Kaldahar! So good to see ya again me old friend!” <br>
<br>
Kaldahar grinned. “Oh you knew I was coming. Don’t pretend. But I am afraid I do not bring news that you find favorable.”<br>
<br>
The smile quickly disappeared from Aaldari’s face. “The council won't vote on me?”<br>
<br>
Kaldahar sighed wearily. “The council will vote on you. As a matter of fact, they already have.” She immediately sat up, foot making a loud sound as they crashed to the floor. Her mouth hung open for a moment before she spoke.<br>
<br>
“They voted? Without me being there? But…..” Her voice trailed off as her thoughts were in a whirlwind of confusion. “but…how am I supposed to present meself if they voted already?” She then realized he had not said what the vote was. Her glare turned to him as he sat, inspecting his drink, which he still had not touched. “Kal, what did they vote?”<br>
<br>
Kaldahar spoke quietly, “I am very sorry Aal, but you will not be a member of the Paladin Council.” He said his words with such finality; she did not speak for a long time. She finally blurted, “ I don’t understand. Perspectives are supposed to be there to answer…..”<br>
<br>
“They felt there was no need. The facts were there. Based on those facts they voted. Nothing you could have said would have changed their minds.”<br>
<br>
Kaldahar shifted as he watched the torrent of emotions run through her face. She gulped down her drink and quickly returned with a new one.<br>
<br>
“YOU are in consideration for the council, Lenara is and she is a moron. Untiki has collaborated with Tier’ Dal and yet he sits on the damned council!”<br>
<br>
“Aaldari do not talk like that. I have worked hard for my consideration. You know the others reasons for those two being on the council.”<br>
<br>
“Oh ya. Family for Lenara. Untiki…well this is just…wrong. I think I will go there and say something. I can’t believe this.”<br>
<br>
“Aaldari, don’t. Let it be. Maybe in time. But more work needs to be done on your part to prove your loyalty and qualifications.”<br>
<br>
“My qualifications?” A small laugh escaped from her. “And I am sure ye didn’t damage yer own standing by speaking for me!”<br>
<br>
Instantly she knew she had gone too far. His face became enraged. “Yes as a matter of fact, I did. And my vote has been postponed. More than likely the spot will be filled before my vote comes up. We have been friends a long time, but I warned you before that this was not a good idea! But you would not heed my word!”<br>
<br>
Even though she knew she had already pushed him, her anger was also building. Deep down she knew they would not accept her but she never let herself admit it. “Just because I do not have the family connection or the money to BUY me way into the council it’s NOT FAIR!” Several patrons looked her way as her voice rose. “What EXACTLY were the reasons for saying no?”<br>
<br>
“Aal, you do not want to get into this. I am warning you.”<br>
<br>
“Aye, that I do.”<br>
<br>
“Fine. You will find out from one person or another. You were right about one thing. You do not have the family connections. As a matter of fact, you have no family period. Hell, you CHOSE a last name. You did not endear yourself to one of the known families and adopted their name out of respect.”<br>
<br>
“Just as I thought!”<br>
<br>
“Aal, it’s not like you come from prestigious upbringing. Others have not as well but have gone bout things differently. The accepted way. Not gone all about it alone like you have. The are ways to do things.”<br>
<br>
“That can’t be the only reason.”<br>
<br>
“No. It wasn’t. How do you expect to sit on the council when you have had no formal schooling of any kind?”<br>
<br>
Aaldari gasped. “So me skills aren’t acceptable?”<br>
<br>
“No, they are not. All you can barely read and write for Marr’s sake! How are you supposed to teach and do the parchment work involved? You are not literate. The clerics in the temples do not know you! And then the biggest reason probably….”<br>
<br>
“And pray tell what that be?”<br>
<br>
“You have a drinking problem.” He said simply.<br>
<br>
Aaldari immediately began to defend herself. Kaldahar put up his hand to silence her. “Any one of these is reason enough not to be admitted on the council. But these were the reasons given. But they can be corrected with time.”<br>
<br>
“I will NOT change me name!”<br>
<br>
“No one is asking you to. But this is what you have to work on if you want to be on the council in Felwithe. And I am sorry old friend but I am expected elsewhere and must go. I am sorry I had to bring you such news.”<br>
<br>
He stood up and waited a moment. When she sat looking at the floor, he finally turned and left the tavern.<br>
<br>
She sat nursing her drink and collecting her thoughts. The one thing she had wanted for a long time, recognition, respect, was now closed to her. Working on the points he had stated did not occur to her. She was who she was. She did not change so easily. But what to do now? The new guildhall should be finishing completion within a day or two. The little band she had gathered together was her family now. She had no other. Family is not in name only but in actions. <br>
<br>
The afternoon passed slowly as she sat, alone with her thoughts. Patrons came and went. A female sitting alone in a tavern always attracted attention. A few started to approach, saw her sword and thought better. Her family needed her now she came to the conclusion. Abandon her old dream and see a new future. A new future with a new family. She smiled a little to herself already lighter having shed even the desire to ever be seated on the council. Downing her last drink she got up and left Qeynos for the long road home to West Commons.<br>
<br>
The plains in summer are always lovely, even with the plague. The birds are signing; the grass is soft and fragrant. If you stop you can pick out the different flower’s fragrances. Many animals pass by. So many, one cannot walk two feet without seeing one. The plains teem with life and she was seeing them with new, open eyes. With no set goal, no immediate place to go, she was seeing things she normally overlooked. Strolling rather than walking briskly, she savored the sights before her.<br>
<br>
Darkness encroached on her eyesight. When her view became more and more limited, she realized how far yet she had to go to reach Highpass and a safe resting spot. The plains may be beautiful, but they still hold dangers. She picked up her pace and headed toward Highkeep. But even as she raced the setting sun, she knew she would probably be walking half the night. <br>
<br>
Night fell quickly. She was still far from the cliffs. Her sight was hindered by the darkness. She cursed herself for not keeping a lantern with her. The human eyes are not made for nighttime travel and she was being reminded of her carelessness now. Suddenly, she heard a crack behind her. Any one of a hundred nocturnal creatures could have made the sound, but this one made her freeze. She slowly drew her sword and look around, but could not see anyone or anything. She began walking slowly, cautiously. She felt something was near and was not of a friendly nature. Walking faster, her heart racing, she broke into a run. Suddenly a sharp, piercing pain erupted in her neck. She dropped her sword to grasp the dart that was now embedded there. The darkness overwhelmed her as she slumped the ground unconscious.<br>

<br>
Pain pounded in her head as she fought the darkness.  Waves of pain washed over her and the darkness clouded her sight, weighing her down like a heavy blanket.  Slowly, the weight seemed to lift as she concentrated on calming her mind and healing herself.  The power of magic always took all of her concentration, a task she could never seem to grasp properly.  Warm waves of healing finally replaced the sharp cold contrast of pain to bring her back to Norrath.  <br>
<br>
Slowly, she opened her eyes to view what she inevitably knew would be new surroundings.  All she saw was inky blackness surrounding her.  A trembling hand reached up to touch the open eyelid, as if the touch could erase what she could not bring herself to admit.  Her eyes were indeed open, yet she could not see anything at all.  Just a void.  A hollow pit formed in her stomach.  All her aches and pains were now forgotten.  She did not notice the cold steel band around her ankle attached to a heavy chain.  The fact that her possessions had been stripped from her and then she only wore a shift and pants did not penetrate her thoughts.  She struggled with the fact the entire world was now shut out to her, suddenly, without recourse.<br>
<br>
A low chuckle brought her attention back to her surroundings.  Heard, but unseen, one of her captors entered the tent in which she lay.  She froze, instantly thinking on the defensive.  “Who are you and what is going on here?” she demanded, never one to approach things lightly or unwearyingly.<br>
<br>
The air before her seemed to thicken signifying he had stepped closer.  She resisted the urge to reach out and test the air in front of her.  He must be very close yet she had heard no movement or breathing.  Something about the person’s laugh chilled her to the very bone.  As if evil itself had a voice.<br>
<br>
“That is for others to tell you of your fate.”<br>
<br>
The words silenced her.  The voice was icy cold, and he spoke barley above a whisper, yet his voice was very clear and loud.  But had he actually spoken out loud? It seemed to her that he had not.  That she had heard his voice inside her head.  Aaldari was positive it was a male voice but had never heard such a voice before.  At last she threw aside her reservations and threw out her hand to reach for the voice in front of her.<br>
<br>
There was nothing but empty air to meet her hand.<br>
<br>
Wincing from the bruises, she sat up and felt the area around her, trying to decipher where she was and why.  She felt loose, cool dirt covering hard rock.  Her hand soon found the food left by the mysterious person.  The food eaten, she returned to her search.  The chain that bound her was too strong and nothing in her search reveled any way out.  There was no apparent end to the chain and she could not move much without rattling it which was sure to bring her captor’s attention.  There seemed to be no furniture near here except a rolled up hide which she assumed was meant for her to lie on.  <br>
<br>
Every so often she touched her face as if to remind herself that there really was no blindfold invading her vision.  She could not, in her own mind come to terms with that just yet, there was too much else to think about.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I am in the mountains of the Karanas somewhere.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  She thought to herself.  I am sure of that.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>That is, unless I was unconscious for a very long time.  So if that is true then…..</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
A cold chill ran thru her, stilling her blood.  There could be only one reason why the bandits would want her, she thought.  She thought back to the days when she was going thru her paladin trials.  In order to be recognized in Qeynos, she had to prove her worth and honor.   How many bandits had she killed to prove to the priests in Qeynos her worth?  How many sashes had she presented them?  She could no longer remember it was so long ago.  Yet the memories of the battles remained fresh in her mind and the blood on her hands would never be washed away.  The blood spilled in the name of honor.<br>

<br>
Aaldari grunted as the man’s foot met her ribs.  She slowly rose to her feet to face where she assumed he was standing.  She marveled at how even a simple thing such as standing without weaving was much harder when you cannot see.<br>
<br>
“Who are you and what be ye doing?”  A hand reached out of the darkness, knocking her back and down the ground again.  She cursed her own helplessness.<br>
<br>
“Methinks ye shall keep your mouth shut, wench.  We need you alive but not necessarily whole.”<br>
<br>
Her mind began to whirl with thoughts.   Obviously this was not revenge as she had thought.  Unless of course they merely needed her alive until they decided the proper torture.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
“Aye, yer people won’t pay if ye be dead I am sure.  Well, maybe they will but not near as much I reckon.”  She blinked at his offhanded comment and laughed.  The men who had entered the tent murmured amongst themselves, not liking she was laughing rather than frightened.  <br>
<br>
She was to be ransomed! It all made sense now and the relief washed over her in a wave.    “And the blindness, I assume, be temporary?” She asked quietly so as not to arouse more anger.<br>
<br>
“Aye.  It be temporary.  Can be easily cured once we receive payment and make delivery.”  She shuddered slightly, realizing they meant delivery of her.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
<br>
“I hope yer people have plenty money saved up.  Now who should we send a message to?”<br>
<br>
She sighed, hating to give any information to help them but the more information they had, the quicker this would go.  “Who?” the bandit demanded.<br>
<br>
“A fair elven paladin by the name of Ephexian.  Son of Laraellian.  He resides in West Commons and was there last I know.  He would be the one to contact.”<br>
<br>
“So be it.  Ye shall wait here until we get our money.  Ye better hope yer people come through for ye.”<br>
<br>
The men left the tent, however one remained behind.  She felt the cold emanating from him as he approached.  The man studied her as if sizing her up.   She felt his eyes crawl over her as if she stood there naked, even though she was fully clothed.  Yet strangely she felt calm, much calmer than she had since she woke.  Ever more so in fact than she had ever felt possibly her entire life.<br>
<br>
“So you lead that group who call themselves the Edgers?”<br>
<br>
She nodded, “Aye that I do.  But do not presume I will tell you anything other than you need, for I will not.”<br>
<br>
“Oh you will tell me anything I need or want to know, woman.” She shrank from his voice, the icy coldness of it.  Yet she also felt drawn to him.  His voice was unlike the other bandits.  It did not have the wilderness harshness to it.  Without the distraction of sight, all she could tell about the people around her were by their voices.  And she could tell his was different no matter how much he tried to hide it.  There was something hypnotizing about him.  About his voice.  His very presence.  Something within her mind departed and her mind stood open with no barriers.  She would tell him anything as if he had a right or privilege.  She could hold no secrets from him.  She had no will to.<br>

Even though there is much disparage among the races as to the content and purpose of heaven and hell, most agree they exist.  Almost all the races in some form or another agree heaven is warm and fluffy but hell is fire and brimstone.  They are all very wrong.<br>
<br>
Hell is cold.  Vast expanses of ice and cold and total absence of color.  Nothing but whiteness making the chill even worse, deep inside, where no amount of warmth can ever each.  Hell is the pain of that coldness, the coldness that no fire, no blanket will erase.<br>
<br>
Aaldari firmly believed she was being led through hell herself that very moment.  Even though still blind, she could feel the vast emptiness around her.  The ground was pure ice underneath her feet, scoured clean by harsh winds and the snow packed so hard it was now solid.  She winced as the bitter wind drove bits of snow to cut her like sand during a sandstorm.  The wind and snow scoured her skin raw and quickly snatched away any heat her body tried to produce.  She was beyond being cold, beyond numbness; into a realm of feeling she could no longer express with words.  With no patience for the paladin who was unfit for travel, underclothed and no exercise the past few weeks, they pushed her to move as quickly as they could towards their destination known only to them.  The bandits had changed their plans and were now quickening their pace to a new destination, with a much bigger treasure in mind.<br>
<br>
She stumbled along the hard ground in her tattered shoes, threatening to fall apart at any second, best she could, all fight now gone from her.  Her supposed lover walked in front of her.  His walk was well known to her by now but all love was lost between them.  She now knew him for what he was.  The toying and games were finished; he no longer put up the front of the concerned lover who would help her escape.   She had felt it when he hit her, her head clearing, her sight becoming remarkably clear, as if she had just woke from a dream.  It was the only time he had touched her that she could remember with clarity, ungentle, but in that one touch, too much was communicated.  More than words can ever say.  Many days had passed, how many, she did not know.  They all seemed to flow one into the other.  She could have only marked the passage of time by the meals served, but after a few days with this unseen Bandit, she had not cared.  All she had cared about was him, his words, his touch.  After awhile, thought of escape no longer came to her.  She no longer cared about anything but him. The love she had once had for this man was completely gone in the realization his promises were so many empty words meant to induce her to submission with words she had so longed to hear from any man.   In that one touch she had not recoiled from the pain but from the pure evil and hatred she had felt emanating from his hand.  It disgusted her and she recoiled from it.  In one instant she realized what a fool she had been.  She had betrayed herself with her own weakness.  She vowed if she lived through this ordeal she would never let herself fail to her own weakness again.  <br>
<br>
He shoved her forward, harshly, trying to get her to hurry.  The small band trudged on wearily, for they could not take the main roads, but stayed hidden in the short hillsides.  Aaldari struggled to keep up, her worry growing with each painful step.  She was not clothed for this weather and they had not provided much.  She imagined her feet made of wood, as were her hands, that is until they touched the ice when she stumbled.  Then they burned with a pain she couldn’t have imagined before.  They were not taking her to her guild for ransom anymore.  She did not know exactly when the plans were changed, but this was clearly not the way to any meeting place her guild would have agreed to.    So where were they going? Did someone offer a higher ransom? She had no idea how these things worked but surely they did not just put up a for-sale sign in the local towns.<br>
<br>
The trek took days and the bandits wondered if their package would last the trip.  She walked slower and slower and her feet were bleeding.  She didn’t seem to realize it though and they did not tell her nor treat her injuries.  They grumbled to each other over their troubles, yet the one she knew the best was clearly calmer than the others.  He cared little about ransoms and money.  <br>
<br>
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, her feet struck stone.  But not any stone.  She knew instantly where they had taken her and she froze in place refusing to move.  Her feet, even though frozen, remembered quite clearly the stone which they had tread upon for many a long day and it was the only place that made sense.<br>
<br>
“No.  Just kill me here.  Now.” She said with conviction, knowing what fate lay ahead of her anyway.<br>
<br>
“And deprive the Lady of her pleasure and us of our money? Not a chance.  Move!”<br>
<br>
They shoved her forward into the lair.  She had neither the strength nor ability to resist.  Deeper into the lair they wandered, soon met by the guards of the lair who guided them deeper into the depths of the caverns.  The cavern walls glittered brightly from unseen light source.  Some passages were tricky to negotiate.  The ice in some parts was so clear it formed an invisible wall.  There were many unseen pit traps and creatures along the way who watched them pass with their escort but left them unmolested.  <br>
<br>
Eventually, Aaldari realized they walked into an open chamber.  The air around her was much larger and the group was not so tightly packed.  The bandits conversed with the unknown creatures that guided them in a language she did not understand and then she heard their footsteps turn to leave and soon there was silence.  Not even a whisper.  She began to shiver and not just from the cold.<br>

<br>
“There is no longer need for the binders.  Be cured and look upon me.”<br>
<br>
Aaldari felt warmth fringed with coldness emanate from her eyes.  Within a few seconds her sight started to return.  She kept her head lowered; while she struggled with the light she had wanted back for so long which was now a painful torture to her so long in the dark eyes.  The rope tying her hands together split, seemingly of its own accord and fell to the ground, freeing her completely.<br>
<br>
“Can you not look upon me, paladin?”<br>
<br>
She could not raise her head.  She knew exactly who that voice came from.  The booming intonation, yet barely above a whisper.  The creature who had come here to make a home and carved the vast caverns herself.  The one who lorded over the many creatures that dwelled in the caves but also many more powerful creatures in many distant lands.<br>
<br>
“Greetings milady Vox.”<br>
<br>
“So you do know me.”<br>
<br>
“Aye.”<br>
<br>
The ground shook as the giant dragon slowly walked towards her.  Aaldari forced herself to look up as the Lady approached, not willing to die with her eyes on the ground.  She unfurled her wings and stretched them out behind.  She was a spectacular sight indeed.  Her coat gleamed pure white.  A white unlike anything that could ever be seen by mortal eyes.  She was of the noble dragons, renowned for her powers and intelligence even amongst her own kind.  Her long neck stretched out till her head was very near Aaldari.<br>
<br>
Aaldari was startled to have a dragon so close to her and still be alive.  Goblin guards stood by but well out of the way.  Lady Vox’s was so close but yet made sure not to breathe directly on the paladin.  Yet she still felt her breath.  She could not even describe it in words to herself.  It seemed to freeze her very soul.<br>
<br>
“What gave you the right to kill my guards?  To kill my captain?  You entered my home, uninvited, unwarranted and stole from me.”<br>
<br>
“I be not a thief…….” Before she could finish her sentence she was knocked backwards flat on her back with Vox’s paw pressing precariously down on her.  She felt a trickle of blood run down her leg from a slash across her thigh.  Slowly the pain came through the numbness in her body.  Vox could easily have killed her but had just reminded her of the fact by slicing her leg.  Lady Vox was a cleric and was known for healing her victims so she could prolong their torture when they displeased her.<br>
<br>
“But you are, mortal.  You stole not only bounty from here but lives as well.  If it was possible to teach one of your kind anything, I would keep you here.  But since it is not, I have not yet decided to kill you myself or give you to my goblins to play with.  They do not have short memories.”<br>
<br>
Her thigh was beginning to sting.  Yet another pain to add to her many others, but it was somehow distracting her.  “Milady.  I have no excuses except that I was young when I was here last and I was wrong.  I came to prove my valor to Paladin guild for the trials.  I know now I was wrong, but I do not know how to make amends.  I am sorry.”<br>
<br>
“Interesting.  But more than likely you are telling me what I want to hear to save your own sorry skin.”  Suddenly she lifted her paw up off Aaldari.  Aaldari cringed afraid it would come down much harder this time.  She made no attempt to get to her feet.  But the dragon was not even looking at her.  She was looking intently at the underside of her own paw.  Suddenly, without warning and swifter than Aaldari could even breathe, Vox swiped her paw across Aaldari’s legs.  So precise was her pass she sliced open the pants on her injured leg without harming the skin or muscles any farther.<br>
<br>
“The mark!” the dragon cried.<br>
