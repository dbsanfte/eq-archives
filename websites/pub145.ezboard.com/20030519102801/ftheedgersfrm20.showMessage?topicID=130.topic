1: The first piece of the puzzle<br>
<br>
Neriak is an ancient city, one that has been home to the Tier’Dal since their beginnings as a creation of Innoruuk’s own hate. It has seen many changes, ancient buildings still stand, but the city has destroyed and remade itself countless times. As such, there are parts that have been forgotten. Many do not have a slightest inkling of how far into Norrath the tunnels of the ancient city reach. Indeed, beyond the Foreigner’s City and even past the Third Gate, the Tier’Dal empire burrows deep into the stone and dirt. Some of these places had uses once, as tunnels for escape, that have caved in, or places for solitude when a noble sought the safety of home without the intrusions of city life. A few caverns still maintain a cause, the hiding places for those who practice arts forbidden by Tier’Dal society, as well as execution grounds for Heretics among the Dark Elves. Huge spiders once climbed these caves, watching over those being punished for their crimes against Neriak, a mass of bodies, hanging encased in webbing over a darkened lake of water. Though the spiders have long since moved on to new feeding grounds (for there are now executions nearly every week) the remains of their meals still hang in the forgotten caverns.<br>
<br>
It was in one of these caverns Guronk found something. He was a simple troll, quite lost and very aggravated at his current situation. Neriak was new for him, the Dark elves had taken his race into the Foreign Quarter when they were overthrown by an army of frogloks. As Guronk would say they were <br>
<br>
‘A buncha weak lil toadies who onlee beatz us cuz dey so small we didna see em till it wuz to late.’<br>
<br>
Guronk’s new home was comfortable though, despite not being near a swamp. It did allow him all the joys of home, drinking, feasting, and of course, inflicting pain. However with his new home came new responsibilities, he was required to run errands for one of the Noble Houses of Tier’Dal society. It was his most recent errand that had sent him into the water’s of a well in the Foreign city, and had led him here.<br>
<br>
“Troll! Hey you! Big oaf!”<br>
<br>
Guronk blinked looking up at the Dark Elf addressing him, as he was busy cleaning dried blood from under his fingernails, a look of confusion crossing his large features.<br>
<br>
“Come here greenskin. Help me with something.”<br>
<br>
Guronk nodded, and finished removing a bit of meat from underneath a long yellowed fingernail, then stood and came over to where the Elf was standing, staring into a well. Another dark elf was standing nearby with a huge grin on his face apparently very amused at something.<br>
<br>
“Waz can I do fer ya sur?”<br>
<br>
The dark elf pointed into the well, and Guronk bent over to try and see what the elf was pointing at.<br>
<br>
“I dropped a wand in there, I need it back. Can you get it for me troll?”<br>
<br>
Guronk couldn’t see anything in the depths of the water, just darkness. He stood back up (as straight as a troll can stand, his posture left him always slouching) and reached up to scratch the back of his large head.<br>
<br>
“Iz don see nuttin in there.”<br>
<br>
The Dark Elf who was smiling burst into laughter, causing the first to swing a hand at him in a slap. The second elf danced back easily dodging, his laughter slowly subsiding.<br>
<br>
“But it’s in there all the same. Get it for me will you? I’ve got some dwarf meat you can have when you find it.”<br>
<br>
Guronk shrugged and bent back over the well, it was small for a creature of his size, it would be a tight fit getting in, but he supposed he could do it if he had too. Dwarf meat was a treat he hadn’t had in ages. He stood up once more, towering over the dark elves and shrugged.<br>
<br>
“OK Guronk gon’ try an help ya find da thing.”<br>
<br>
The short Tier’Dal nodded suddenly smiling.<br>
<br>
“Thank you Guronk. We’ll be waiting in the castle courtyard, I have other business to attend to.”<br>
<br>
Guronk reached up and pulled off his heavy leather shirt and took off his steel toed boots. It had been some time since he had gone for a swim, he figured now would be as good a time as any. He had enjoyed swimming in the swamp of Innothule, hunting wildlife for the fun of the kill. Maybe there were things in the well he could hunt as well. After he found the whatever it was for the darkie, that is. Guronk stepped into the well, and slowly lowered himself in until only his head was out of the water. The well was just wide enough for him to stretch from one end to the other, which made it a little confining but really nothing more than an inconvenience.<br>
<br>
“Ok Iz gon look fer it now.”<br>
<br>
The two dark elves nodded in unison as Guronk took a deep breath and ducked into the water, swimming down as far as he could. Meanwhile, the two dark elves began to place bets on how long it would take the troll to realize he had been sent on an errand that couldn’t be completed, laughing at their triumph over such a trusting creature.<br>
<br>
For a few minutes Guronk explored the well up and down, searching for the wand that wasn’t there, eventually he began to think the errand was pointless. However when he next dived, he found something. A hole in the wall of the well, that fed it water from the underwater stream Neriak sat over. Perhaps the wand had been sucked through the hole Guronk thought. He returned to the surface to take a huge breath of air, then dived down into the depths, his good vision aiding him well even in the darkness of the waters. Guronk swam through the hole and was plunged into darkness, he slowly began to panic as he swam, not being able to find his way back to the well. He followed the tunnel for a ways, slowly running out of breath before finally finding air. The large troll head broke the surface of the water in a spray of droplets as he sucked fresh air into his lungs. Guronk blinked a few times. He was lost, and in a huge cave that stretched into the distance. Above him white bundles of webbing hung, some were low enough for him to reach. He treaded water for a few moments trying to figure out what to do next, dive again and try to find his way back? Or follow the tunnel and hope it led back to Neriak?<br>
<br>
Guronk decided he would rather not risk drowning and so he began to swim following the tunnel. The huge lake in which he had found himself slowly became shallower as he followed the tunnel to its destination. Eventually he was walking on the bottom, and after an hour or so the lake gave way to stone. Still the white bundles hung from the ceiling, motionless in the windless air of the cave. The cave had no end in sight, and with nothing better to do Guronk simply continued to follow it. As he wandered he occasionally looked up, those bundles of webbing were people once he guessed. He could recognize skulls, and other bones inside those bundles, many things had died here, including trolls, ogres and dark elves. It didn’t concern him much. Whatever had killed them seemed long gone.<br>
<br>
Time passed and the tunnel slowly became brighter as he traveled, he had now been lost for over four hours, simply following the tunnel thinking to himself about things of no great importance. In the far distance he could see what looked like the back of a huge building bearing the winged eye of the Dark Elves, Neriak at last! Home was perhaps ten minutes away if he ran, but having found his way back Guronk decided to take his time. He continued to stare upward at the skeletons hanging from the ceiling, in doing so his feet stepped down with a loud crunch on something. Guronk’s reflexes were slow, rather than flinch or hope back at the sound and feeling of something breaking under foot he simply took another step before pausing to see what he had found.<br>
<br>
There were the remains of a corpse on the floor of the tunnel, a dark elf skeleton. Guronk had stepped on one of the decaying leg bones, and snapped it in two. The skeleton was old, but something glimmered in its ribcage. Guronk squatted and peered into the bones, extending one arm and a finger to poke at the object that gleamed within. It was a knife, a well made one at that. There was a ruby in the hilt and gold thread melded into the hilt. The blade was a dark black, and pock marked with blood red flecks, and was fused with one of the ribs. Whoever had died here the ceremonial dagger denoted that this victim was executed for crimes against a noble house. Guronk didn’t know this, to him the blade looked like it would fetch a nice price, or at the very least look good on his wall. With a strong hand he snapped off the rib bone that the blade was fused to and examined it closer. Yes, it would do just fine as either something to sell or a relic he could claim as coming from a foe he had defeated.<br>
<br>
With his newfound treasure Guronk finished walking the rest of the way to the huge building and forced open the musty door who’s hinges were nearly gone from rust and age. It led him into another dark room, which lead to a trapdoor, which in turn opened into the royal palace. Guronk spent another hour or so wandering the hug compound that was the home of the Tier’Dal royal family, now not so worried about being lost. Eventually he was thrown out by some guards who had found him skulking about. Thankfully the guards knew where the exit was better than Guronk, and the simple minded troll made his way home with the treasure he had found in the caverns.<br>
<br>
The next day Guronk went into the city to sell his prize, and it was bought (more or less) for a pretty sum of four hundred platinum. The Dark Elf that had bought it had seen it in Guronk’s hands as he wandered about looking for a place to sell the oddity.<br>
<br>
“Hey troll, may I enquire as to what is that in your hand?”<br>
<br>
Guronk smiled broadly glad to show off his discovery.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I found diz in sum caves, iza pretty dagger stuck inna rib bone.”<br>
<br>
The dark elf extended a hand reaching for the bone.<br>
<br>
“May I see it please?”<br>
<br>
Guronk nodded and handed it to the dark elf who examined it closely and with an appraising eye, he muttered some arcane words and Guronk could feel a spell being cast as the elf’s eyes went wide. The rib bone in his hands began to glow a dull yellow. The dark elf pulled it closer to him shielding it from view. He whispered to Guronk.<br>
<br>
“I’ll give you four hundred platinum for the bone.”<br>
<br>
Guronk grinned so broadly it seemed that his skin was peeling off of his face, he nodded hungrily.<br>
<br>
“Four hundred iz gud!”<br>
<br>
The Tier’Dal pulled out a purse counted the money and gave it to Guronk. Who pocketed it with one hand while wiping his mouth dry with the other (the thought of all the fresh meat, and alcohol he could buy as well as the parties he could throw with the money was causing him to drool just a little). He turned to leave when the dark elf stopped him. Guronk stopped looking confused as the dark elf extended the bone to him.<br>
<br>
“Grab the hilt.”<br>
<br>
Guronk furrowed his eye brows, still confused but did as he was told, he grasped the hilt of the blade that had fused to the rib bone, and as he did so the dark elf wrenched it hard. The hilt snapped from the blade, which remained with the bone, and the dark elf turned and disappeared into the crowd saying over his shoulder.<br>
<br>
“Keep the blade.”<br>
<br>
The dark elf that bought the bone was a necromancer by the name of Dairun, in it he had found a powerful corpse that would serve him well as an undead minion. What he didn’t know was he had also found the first part of a twisted and complicated puzzle.<br>

<br>
Tanj was broke. It was as simple as that, he had not a silver piece left in his purse when he traveled to the Plane of Knowledge by way of the many mystical books that had been recently placed around Norrath. The fresh air inside the Plane felt good, he had been spending a lot of time in the dank sewers and caverns underneath the once great Iksar city of Sebilis. Fighting frogloks and the undead was a dangerous task, but one which he had committed himself to for the past few weeks. He had journeyed to the ruined city several times, with several different groups of adventurers. Some he had known before and some who had just met in passing. Each time he performed his duties as a shaman well, and was rewarded. Though there wasn’t a coin in his purse, his pack was stuffed full of various treasures taken from the stuffy dungeon. Tanj first set off towards the bank, at a leisurely pace, eager to trade in his itchy plate armor and heavy bag for something a bit more comfortable to wear in the safety of the Plane of Knowledge.<br>
<br>
The bank was crowded, but that was to be expected. Many travelers passed through the planes, and many stopped by to do exactly what Tanj was about to, drop of the spoils of the latest battle or quest. Tanj’s tall Vah Shir form loomed over most of those present, and he had to tilt his head to make it under the low doorway, after a few moments he found a chest with his name on it and opened it. The wonders of magic never ceased to amaze him, inside were all his belongings, even though he had made various deposits of items all over Norrath, they were all here as well. Tanj had long since quit wondering about how it worked, it confused him too much to worry about such a simple matter. He reached in and pulled out several bags, and set his own on the ground. He rummaged around separating the good he received from Sebilis into two piles. Items he wished to keep for himself or give as gifts, and those things he would pawn for money. It took him some time but he finally finished. The pile of items to sell was much larger than that of the items he was keeping. Tanj’s equipment had served him well and he had little use for the treasures the frogloks hid in their swamp like home. He began to refill his chest with all the items he was keeping, even removing some of his plate armor in favor of Leather for the time being (it didn’t bother his fur so much) when something caught his eye.<br>
<br>
It was a simple medicine bag, one of several Tanj owned. They were used in Alchemy, for the brewing of potions that would have various effects. This one didn’t bear the usual markings however. Instead of a paw print of Tanj’s own hand there was another symbol, a Scythe, embroidered into the bag. Tanj picked up the small bag in his palm and stared at it for a moment trying to remember what it was, when a voice came into his head, soft and dark.<br>
<br>
‘Forgot about me? No matter, time washes away all memories.’<br>
<br>
Tanj smirked, he remembered now. This pouch held a lost soul, one of many hundreds if not thousands of spirits of those who had died and left something undone. Their spirits wandered the face of Norrath in constant torment. When he was much younger and still learning the ways of the spirits he had been appointed a task, to find a lost soul, and to attempt to set it free. Tanj had completed the first part of the quest, he had found this soul, wandering among the trees in the huge forests of the Karana’s, murmuring about death and power and the future. To some it would seem like he had trapped the soul, but this was not the case, Tanj had offered to do what he could to free the poor spirit at the time. The spirit (who for some reason never named itself) had laughed at Tanj, but agreed to come with him. For a year or two Tanj wore the satchel on his belt, doing other quests, and hunting with many people. The spirit within seemed content with its new existence, and it helped Tanj in some ways. It was knowledgeable about many things, including Tier’Dal society, Necromancy, and philosophy. Tanj had learned much from the spirit, but still had learned of no way to release it from the realm of the living. Tanj murmured a quiet response as he finished filling the chest, and donned his leather shirt.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I suppose I had.”<br>
<br>
‘It is no matter Dar’Khura, my time is coming, I have a request.’<br>
<br>
Tanj stood, and picked up the medicine bag and tied it to his belt, then hefted his bag filled with items to sell and headed out from the bank towards one of the many buildings packed with merchants who would buy and sell just about anything. He murmured as he walked outside.<br>
<br>
“A request? This is new.”<br>
<br>
The spirit had never asked anything of Tanj, it was always Tanj who asked questions of it. Where it had lived as a mortal, what caused its demise, the spirit danced around all those questions, but never asked one of its own. But now it was, something was amiss.<br>
<br>
‘Yes perhaps it is, I will be leaving your company shortly. I ask that you deliver a message.’<br>
<br>
Tanj’s steps stuttered for an instant before resuming at their usual speed. The spirit was leaving his company? Had it found its own way out? What was going on? In another whisper aimed at the ground he asked.<br>
<br>
“Give me the message and I shall deliver it. I hope to aid you in any way I can wise one.”<br>
<br>
There was silence for a few moments as Tanj approached one of the shops. He stopped and waited but received no response. After a few minutes he headed into the shop and haggled for about an hour or so, selling almost all of his loot for a decent amount of coin. When he emerged the spirit spoke to him again.<br>
<br>
‘Go to the druid tree, and deliver this message to the Hierophant that is there, studying her spell book. “Silveran will soon be free, he sends you his love, and wishes you the best.” Deliver this message Dar’Khura it is the only request I have ever made of you.’<br>
<br>
Tanj nodded and muttered.<br>
<br>
“I will do this one task for you, in the hopes it will help lay you to rest.”<br>
<br>
The medicine bag at his side opened slightly, leaving a tiny opening, being a Shaman Tanj could feel the spirit seeping out of the bag, it hovered in front of him, invisible to the Vah Shir, though he could feel its presence and said two words.<br>
<br>
‘My thanks.’<br>
<br>
Then the feeling was gone, the spirit had either left, or finally been let free of the living realm. Tanj nodded to himself, wondering what exactly had happened, but headed towards the huge and twisted tree that stood as a symbol of the druids. At its foot he found many studying various things. Reading scrolls, discussing recent journeys and even just relaxing and eating under the shadows. A few seemed to be studying spell books. Confused on which one he was supposed to speak to Tanj approached a human who was poring over a tome of some sort, in a strange language that appeared to be draconic.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me sir?”<br>
<br>
The human waved Tanj away, and he shrugged, attempting to speak to a young female gnome next who was munching on some fruit while staring up into the branches of the tree.<br>
<br>
“Excuse me Miss. do you know where I may find a Hierophant?”<br>
<br>
The gnome finished munching and looked at Tanj quizzically.<br>
<br>
“Hierophant? I don’t know that name. Sounds like a druid name though. There is one over there.”<br>
<br>
She motioned towards the trunk of the tree. Where, among the huge roots that were stretching into the soil, sat a woman. A wood elf, who was studying a book bound in bark. Beside her was a scimitar in a sheath with gilded leaves. Tanj approached her, and cleared his throat she didn’t look up from her book.<br>
<br>
“Miss?”<br>
<br>
The druidess remained poring over her book in heavy concentration apparently. She spoke to Tanj without looking up.<br>
<br>
“Yes Shaman? What can I do for you?”<br>
<br>
“I bear a message for a Hierophant, are you one?”<br>
<br>
The wood elf looked up, from her studies, with a piercing gaze she locked eyes with Tanj. Tanj was no druid, but he could feel that she was powerful. After a few moments of uncomfortable silence, and now with her complete attention the druidess answered.<br>
<br>
“Yes I am. What can I do for you Vah Shir?”<br>
<br>
Tanj nodded.<br>
<br>
“I bear a message for you. ‘Silveran will be free soon, he wishes you the best and sends his love.’ Does this mean anything to you.”<br>
<br>
The druidess blinked, confusion and surprise crossed her face.<br>
<br>
“Yes it does Shaman. How did you come about this message?”<br>
<br>
Tanj shook his head.<br>
<br>
“A spirit spoke it to me, before disappearing on its own.”<br>
<br>
The Hierophant nodded murmuring something to herself.<br>
<br>
“I thank you for this message….”<br>
<br>
She paused obviously waiting for Tanj to introduce himself. He stammered.<br>
<br>
“Tanj Dar’Khura, Hierophant. Mystic of the fifty-fourth spirit.”<br>
<br>
She nodded.<br>
<br>
“Thank you for the message Tanj, should you encounter the spirit again tell him Zaira received his words.”<br>
<br>
Tanj nodded as the wood elf stood and gathered her things, heading off somewhere. He was tempted to follow and pursue the matter further, but knew it was not his place. With coin in his pocket he instead went to get himself a meal, the feeling of platinum in his purse once more a pleasing comfort.<br>
<br>
Thus the second part of the puzzle was put into play. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eqfaces.com/photos2/sigpic3.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub145.ezboard.com/btheedgers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tanjewian>Tanj Ewian</A> at: 3/20/03 12:45:55 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub145.ezboard.com/btheedgers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zairavhalkerie>ZairaVhalkerie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keep Posting, I'll Think of Something</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#FF0000>(3/19/03 3:12:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.princess-mononoke.com/q5-mononoke_hime.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_blush.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: A Ressurection of Sorts</span><hr size=1> awe very interesting!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
