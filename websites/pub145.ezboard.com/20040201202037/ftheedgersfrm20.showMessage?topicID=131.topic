 Andora woke up in neriak at the feet of her trainer, who was kicking her. Apparently she had lost consciousness durning the ceremony and ritual blood wash when she was hit in the head by a clumsy troll bringing in the Candle of Rites and a rather uncorroperative halfling ranger. Her trainer was embarrassed and drug her down three flights of steps to teach her a lesson of how now to be weak when being beaten or bruised. She staggered to her feet and kneeled in humility to her trainer, who was confusing himself with Innoruuk. He took her by the arm, tossed her out of the guild and had the goblins drag her to the Maidens Fancy where she was to earn her keep. <br>
The trainer was not only her master but her father, he never wanted a daughter and made sure Andorra would pay for not carrying on his name. Little did the trainer realize women were the true lifeblood of Nerriak and had fought their way to the top, not one would be willing to give that up, nor would they show weakness by helping or caudling another. Andorra's mother, the mistress of the Warriors of Innoruuk would be no conciliation and often watched Andorra in the tavern, observing her weakness. Seasons went by without the light on her face and her color darkening by the anger she held for the trainer and her mother.<br>
One night when the warriors came in for their drinks one grabbed Andorra up by her throat and stood her on the stage, he tossed coins at her yelling at her to dance for them, when she stood there in mortification he yanked her from the stage and grabbed a local whore. Andorra's furry grew and grew she would not become like theese worthless whores she had to prove she was worthy of Innoruuk. Later that night the bartender and keeper of the bedmates in the tavern cornered her telling her it was his turn, he ripped her clothes off and pulled out a dagger so sharp it traced a line around Andorra's neck just cutting down to the very last layer of skin, &quot;a necklace of sorts for a coward&quot; he told her. <br>
Andorra's eyes turned red as her blood boiled and the hate finally surfaced. She took the keepers dagger and crammed it through his right eye, yelling at him and everyone to come look at how weak she is. The warriors and whores made their way out to the bar where Andorra stood holding the keeper's head in her right hand and his member in the other. She threw the member at the whore who insulted her earlier and the head at the warrior who put her on stage. They looked and started after her as she stood firm with the ambiance of hate flooding her aura upon the stage she yelled at them &quot;you come dance for me&quot;. <br>
 Innoruuk was wakened by her power and impressed so much her had to take a seat in the rear of the show, he tranced one whore to please him while the other served him dwarven blood. Andorra felt him there but was not overcome by fear but love, love of this hatred and power. <br>
Innoruuk was pleased, and Andorra vowed to make herself as powerful as her god. He told her to go and bring her father to him. To reward her he let the whores eat him alive. Andorra was pleased. <br>
 Hatred would be her guide and her true love for life. ...many seasons had passed Andorra had served her Lord and Master well she was permitted to leave Nektulos and venture to kill the Orcs who had apparently not understood their place in Innoruuks great plan.<br>
 Over zelious and somewhat distracted by a group of humans fighting one another and a pet to the left of the orc camp, she rushed the camp figuring her hatred would somehow spawn and army behind her first real battle. The humans dropped their jaws as it seemed they were planning on doing the same after they were finished proving themselves of who is greater then the pet. The Orcs rushed the humans and killed them all, then turned and also injured Andorra gravely. <br>
She was so wounded she could not make it to Neriak and it angered her so she vowed to bandage herself and return shortly. Just then a gentle voice of a human man touched her and  carried her lifeless body then dropped it at the edge of the forest so she could collect herself, then he disappeared.   <br>
 She pondered him for a moment, then returned to the mission at hand. A few short weeks later she ventured into the west commons to slay a camp of derivish cut throats that were skimming off sacrifices made to her Lord and Master.<br>
Again faced with the decide how to go about assassinating them she said the hell with it and charged in, there were a few more hiding behind tents that she had not seen, but none the less if she could take down four of them perhaps Innoruuk would still find her in his favor and revive her for more terror. An enormous explosion of power and light rushed the camp and knocked Andorra on her ass. <br>
She looked up and it was that human again, a wizard, she was immediately turned on by his power, no man in Nerriak ever possed such a gift and if they did they could not use it like this... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=397671" target="top"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eqfaces.com/photos2/zsig_copy.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub145.ezboard.com/btheedgers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zairavhalkerie>ZairaVhalkerie</A> at: 3/22/03 12:55:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#336699><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub145.ezboard.com/btheedgers.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andorrafiera>AndorraFiera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Keep Posting, I'll Think of Something</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#FF0000>(5/7/03 7:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub145.ezboard.com/ftheedgersfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=131.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Taught to Hate, Story of ShadowKnight (*parental warning</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
