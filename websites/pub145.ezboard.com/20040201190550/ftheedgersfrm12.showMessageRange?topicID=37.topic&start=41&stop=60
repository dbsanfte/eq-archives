<br>
First off swears constantly.  We are short one person.  So I shout for another.  Right after I shout, he shouts.  I said, Drack, please don't shout for another when you are not group leader (I was at the time).  We will end up inviting two people at the same time.  He replies, whoa Aal I was just trying to fill the spot.  I said, what whoa, I was just saying we will end up inviting two people is all (puller is pulling this entire time)  He rplies, Well I alway whoa when is ounds like I am being ordered around (sorry I guess please=ordering around) I said well if thats the way you want to look at it you are then.<br>
<br>
He then disbands as we are fighting a ravishing drolvarg.  I am LOM and we have the only other healer had just gone LD about two minutes before.  Druid was NOT healing.<br>
<br>
Emmilina - 40 somthing druid<br>
Never gave a single buff except group wolf.  Almost never snared even though we were chasing things all over the zone claiming they kept resisting.  (No other druids had problems with this and I hardly ever saw her cast) She melleed the entire time.<br>
<br>
When Drackore left she up and left becasue he is her guildmate.  (WTF does that have to do with anything?)  Again left in the middle of a bad fight with me OOM and no ther healer.<br>
<br>
She is one of the worst druids I have ever grouped with and the cleric.....who knows&gt;  He didn't have a single problem before that and the rest of the groupw as ready to hunt the two of them down and kill them.<br>

wait is it Emmilina or Emmalina cuz i think they are 2 different ppl.  I know an Emmalina She is a half-elf Dr00d, but she definetely knows what she's doing, and she is in Fire Knights, and we have no 40 something cleric <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
So i guess it is Emmilina? anyway i think i have grouped with one like that before, i prolly dont remember, becuz unless they are REALLY good or REALLY bad i usually dont remember, but i guess i should, its the little people that count right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Again back on subject, i have a SH*T person too. <br>
Here goes:<br>
Name is Cuso, dont know class or level, but i know he doesnt have a guild either, but i was running thru from Qeynos to Freepot carrying 50 pp on me, i am now tailoring so i buy all teh HQ cat pelts or Bear pelts i can. So he sends me a tell.  <br>
&quot;I have a stack of HQ cat pelts.&quot;<br>
i reply &quot;THat's great, i will pay you 3 pp per pelt or 50 pp for the stack.&quot;<br>
&quot;He replies, no thanks i can get 20 pp for each pelt in EC&quot;<br>
then i, not necessarily trying to haggle the price, just informing him that only the Grizzly Bear Skins and HQ BEAR pelts go for 20 pp.<br>
He then replies<br>
&quot;Haha, what a moron, how long have you been playing?&quot;<br>
so i reply<br>
&quot;Well i have been playing since a few days from release, and i would appreciate not being called a moron, thanks.&quot;<br>
Then i figure that is that and he might shut up without me getting angry, becuz like most i try not to get upset quickly.<br>
then i get a reply<br>
&quot;You 12 year old loser who lives with his parents, i have been playing this for 3 years and they have always gone for that!&quot;<br>
So i tell him, but the game is just over 2 years old, and there is NO way that ANYTHING especially pelts, would stay THAT high for so long.  I told him that i remembered when FBSS was 12 k, and he again called me an &quot;IDIOT&quot; and a &quot;moron&quot; and told me that i was the stupidest person he'd ever met and that sometimes he wanted to quit the game becuz of people like me.<br>
Then i zoned thru into Highpass, and shouted again.(he was apparently ahead of me in the pass thru EK)<br>
So i send out my Macro/ooc again and he shouts to the zone<br>
&quot;HEY EVERYONE, Gamyn is a 12 year old a##h0l3!&quot; (No dude speak)  And then a friend of mine who was in the zone goes &quot;Gamyn is 18 in RL man, and why do you shout to the zone he is a moron?&quot;<br>
To which the guy goes<br>
&quot;He tried to tell me that HQ Cat Pelts go for 3 pp each and that he thought FBSS once went for 12 k&quot;<br>
Then someone i have no idea who was at the time, now i hunt alot with her, (Kaldaari is the name) says in OOC<br>
&quot;I buy and sell mine for 2 pp each, he was giving you a deal, and even I remember when FBSS went for 12 k and i bought the game a year and half ago&quot;<br>
Then that is all i have ever heard of him.  Of course he is on my IGNORE list, and i wouldn't see a thing he said anyway.  But i haven't seen him hunting anywhere, and nobody i know has ever seen him, well those 2 people haven't at least.<br>
<br>
So that is my Hideously long rant for tonight, now its time for some EQ.<br>

Brillig can testify to this, as he was there helping someone at my request. All you people in your teens keep an eye out for Jowe, he is a Dark Elf cleric, and has a very large stick up his arse. He randomly goes off on &quot;RP&quot; rants in which case he refuses to heal any non evil races, and starts to try and cause trouble, then claims it is RP, though I have yet to hear a Dark Elf use the F word so many times. Even when he isn't using RP as an excuse to be a butthead he is a very bad cleric, he heals at odd times (Like after a battle is over rather than when it is going on) and instead of focusing on heals and buffs he melees and does mostly offensive spell casting. All in all he likes to talk sh*t and enjoys causing problems among group members.<br>

And he had to have planed in advance to do it as he claimed he had 28 for sale so he had to have clean out invintory ro make room. Which also means he had to have been at it for at least 3 hours to get that many.<br>
<br>
Maube thats not all that bad but to me it is. when I play some of my lower lvl Alts nothing ticks me off more then seeing some twinked out Idiot. Hogging a camp that he is obviously not getting XP from.   and by twinking I don't mean giveing  a low lvl  a few nice items for thier lvl,  but full blown &quot;ha my main has pp to spare&quot; Twinking. Lvl 6 warriors in Full Crafted  with Wurmslayers is just not right. <p><B><P> <a href=mailto:Avyriel@aol.com>Avyriel Lighthawk</a>

But, I was always more than glad to move along when asked... normally I'd even offer to give it up when someone lvl 16 or below would approach (because any higher than that and they were probably there for the same reason as me).<br>

I one time had a guy try tot ake over the entire camp from OUR FULL group because he &quot;had logged his charcater there to farm DF belts and had planned this&quot;  Now granted, he was doing this for faction and it was not peak time but hey! it was camped!  I also pointed out that had he been nice and asked we might have just GIVEN him the belts as none of us needed them.  Needless to say someone had a high level frind who helped us hold the camp until we were done and were willing to turn it over to him.<br>

Never forget the time a level 3 was screaming he needed to find his corpse before it rotted since it was wearing full Rygoor on it.<br>

I think he was a bard but he had anon up and I didnt get a good look at him. <br>
<br>
As some of you may know I was camping Hadden tonight for Fishbone Earring and was wary of KSers right from the start. I noticed early on that this guy had had anon up and was the only one besides me in zone the whole time I was on so I kind of figured he was lurking somewhere. I was actually about to get a ranger to track him for me just to see where he was but thought better of it because I tend to trust people and figured he was hunting something else. Well at one point he /ooc something like &quot;Dang get some sleep!&quot; Not sure who that was directed at but oh well. <br>
<br>
So Hadden pops and I jump him immediately and guess who shows up? Yeah thats right Prek, seems more like prick to me. But I already had Hadden down to less than half health so there wasnt any point in him doing anything so he ran away.<br>
<br>
I sent him a tell thanking him for coming to my assistance and blatantly ask him if he was there to gank him. He said he just wanted to see Hadden and was messing around on track when he came up. Why he would wait 5 hours just to see him is beyond me and he knew the servers were coming down shortly so why would he wait around for the turn after me?<br>
<br>
Well Im now the owner if a Fishbone Earring, WOOT!<br>
And thank you to Fanbus/Citnik gnome lover, for keeping me a bit of company.<br>
And Tarheall for showing up and what guild strength is all about!<br>
