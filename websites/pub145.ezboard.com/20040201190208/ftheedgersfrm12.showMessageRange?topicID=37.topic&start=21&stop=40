<br>
Moronic SH*T head #1 ) Tiet... Human Cleric....<br>
Okay, there I am in Overthere in my group. Me, two Beastlords, a rogue, a druid and a cleric ( Tiet ). One would imagine that this would be a pretty safe position for a tank to be in.  After all, you have 1 pure melee ( me ) 2 hybrids and their pets. That's a total of 5 tanks right?  Moving right along.  I am doing my best to chain pull and keep everybody happy, because if you don't pull fast enough you lose, and if you pull too fast you lose.  It's a delicate balance. Having finally FOUND said balance, I pull a cock(atrice). No problems.. kickin much butt Vizzan-Style.. we get an add.  Again, no big deal.   First one runs, move to the second mob and let pets finish off the runner.  We get another add and the group wants to bug out but I said &quot;No, we can handle this&quot;. <br>
&lt;sigh&gt;<br>
So SOMEWHERE in the battle spam comes the tiny and to my eyes unnoticeable line <br>
Tiet tells the party , &quot;oom&quot;<br>
That's it.. didn't hit it more than once. Didn't do it in big letters like most people do in a bigger battle like that. Nothing. <br>
So, I die.   Lose level 31, and I'm 2 blues down into Hell.  <br>
One would think that at this point the Cleric in the group would offer to rez me.  Nuh-uh.. didn't happen. So, I run back to my group to get my body. On the way there, I ask Tiet if next time he is OOM to please do it so we can notice it in the middle of battle spam. I suggested  &lt;&lt;&lt; CLERIC IS OOM!!  &gt;&gt;&gt;   *shrug* I get back and we start to pull again and Oh look!!   <br>
&quot;Tiet has left the group&quot;<br>
/tell Tiet &quot;Where are you going?&quot;<br>
.........<br>
/tell Tiet &quot;Hello?&quot;<br>
.........<br>
No response. Then my group leader asks if *I* said anything to Tiet!  I told em the only thing I said was what was in group chat.  30 seconds later <br>
Tiet shouts &quot; lev 30 clr lfg &quot;<br>
&lt;growls&gt;<br>
<br>
You may be asking yourselves, &quot;Wait Vizzan. Didn't you say there was a Druid in your group?&quot;   Why yes young one, I did! And that leads us to....<br>
<br>
Moronic SH*T head #2 ) Bimma  -- something dr00d.<br>
<br>
Bimma and I go waaaay back. Maybe so far as 2 days prior.  My group in OT needs a healer and we are getting no response to our LFG OOC's, so I go to Frontier Mountains to see about a healer.   Zone into FM and shout that a group in OT needs a healer, Cleric preferred but Druids and Shaman more than welcome.  <br>
Bimma shouts &quot; me ill do it &quot; <br>
Okay Great! So I tell Bimma to meet me at the OT zone.<br>
&quot; i dont know were that is&quot;<br>
No problem I figure. I have a tough time in Frontier Mountains too,so I send the loc<br>
&quot; wat is that &quot;<br>
That's the loc.. use it to get to me<br>
&quot; i dont kno how to do that&quot;<br>
/ all Bimma     (30 druid)<br>
Ummmmm... okay.. a level 30 that doesn't know how to do locs.. that really should've tipped me off.  But no. I like to give everybody the benefit of the doubt so I tell them how to get to the OT zone from the giant fort.<br>
&lt;&lt;minutes start to stretch into more minutes&gt;&gt;<br>
Hello Bimma? Are you on the way?   I mean, there my group was, waiting for a healer that I had already said was on the way. It sorta puts you in a spot with a bit of pressure as I'm sure you all know.<br>
&quot; im lost &quot;<br>
&lt;sigh&gt; So I tell Bimma to &quot; go as far NORTH as you can. When you hit the wall tell me &quot; <br>
&lt;&lt;minutes pass&gt;&gt;<br>
Hello?  Norrath to Bimma?<br>
&quot; im ther &quot; <br>
*bangs his head on the desk*<br>
&quot; Bimma, go to the west and you will come to the OT zone &quot;<br>
I go out just a bit to watch for a wolf to come runnin by so I can grab it... Nothin happens.. Group starts askin me WTF I'm gonna get the healer so we can start grinding...<br>
&quot; im lost &quot; <br>
<br>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
&lt;deep breath&gt; <br>
(This is a good time to mention that every 30 seconds or so, Bimma would shout if anybody could lead them to the OT zone.)<br>
I decide to try a different tactic.<br>
&quot;Bimma&quot;, says I, &quot; can you track me?&quot;<br>
..............    &quot; no &quot;<br>
WTH?  Am I not in range? Do you not know how to track? Do you have a small child throwing soup on your keyboard? WTF IS YOUR PROBLEM?!?!   <br>
Finally the group tells me they got a response and that they have a cleric now.  <br>
/tell Bimma Hey, sorry to take up so much time but they went ahead and filled the slot. You can go back to soloing weasels or whatever it is you were doing at the Giant Fort.<br>
 <br>
and I thought THAT would indeed, be THAT.<br>
<br>
Negative.<br>
<br>
Next day I'm in a group, and lo and behold! Tis Bimma the Wonderwolf!  Hurray! We're screw...I mean, We're Saved!<br>
I don't know what Bimma did the whole time they were in the group. Maybe some SoW's when we asked a couple times for them. Maybe they just sat there with their thumb in their hindquarters  &lt;shrug&gt;<br>
This is about the time that the GM event was in WC.<br>
Oh look! Bimma wants to go lookit the werewolves.<br>
&quot;No Bimma. We need you here in our group.&quot;<br>
What's that Bimma? You'll be right back you just want to see?<br>
&quot;No Bimma. We need you here in our group.&quot;<br>
Oh? You will take us with you but we will have to make our own way back?  <br>
&quot;Thanks but no thanks. If you leave we will fill your spot&quot;<br>
&quot;No we won't hold your spot. No we do not want to go with you to see werewolves in West Commonlands. If you leave we will fill your spot with a person that is actually IN this zone.&quot;<br>
Oh look!! Bimma ported!! /disband Bimma<br>
Then 45 minutes later, <br>
Bimma says, &quot; Hail, Vizzan &quot;<br>
.......<br>
Bimma says, &quot; Hail, Vizzan &quot;<br>
What Bimma? <br>
Bimma says, &quot; Hail, Vizzan &quot;<br>
ARRGH!! Use your words!!<br>
Bimma says, &quot; Hail, Vizzan &quot;<br>
&lt;bangs his head on the desk&gt;<br>
Bimma says, &quot; Hail, Vizzan &quot;<br>
By this time, my group is laughing their fool heads off at me. <br>
&quot;Bimma! We have no room for you.&quot;<br>
Bimma says, &quot; Hail, Vizzan &quot;<br>
/ignore Bimma<br>
<br>
Oh.. Did I mention that in the above battle where Tiet was cleric that Bimma mysteriously went LD when we got the two adds that killed me?  Imagine that... <br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
I'm gonna go read some happy posts or something.. my fingers hurt.<br>

See?  I am not the only one who attracts these people.  Cleric is dork.  Bimma obviously was PLed or bought the account.  <br>
<br>
Next time I shout it will be:<br>

you shout, &quot;great grooup with competant players seeks healer that has actually not been PLed for more than two levels and will swear on the bible that their charcater was not bought off of Ebay&quot;<br>

THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR NOT GROUPING WITH ME.<br>
<br>
Seriously, though.  Was this the same night that I tried to group with you?  I must have logged before it all went so terribly bad, but I remember you mentioning that your cleric was a little slow.  Either way, sorry it happened.<br>

Yeah, that's right, 33.  One more level till I get a pet.  At this pace it's only a matter of time until I get to join the party in DL...but by the time I get there you guys will probably be on raids...and by the time I get to those raids you guys will probably be on better raids....and by the time I get to those raids........*sigh*<br>

<br>
Iaedaila and I grouped together in Oassis.  I had put together a group consisting of him, another wizzy, Drigg, a monk , and I.  <br>
<br>
The monk was pulling faster and faster (I really don't think he knew what NEED TO MED ment) pretty soon I was OOM and ast down.  We had an add.  Iaedaila was almost OOM.  His last blast agros the orc.  Monk jumps on add.  Mage announces he is OOM.  Other wizzy is blasting away for all he is worth.<br>
<br>
I cannot get the orc to turn and hit me so I can tank it just a bit so I sit down to frantically med enough for mem blur, charm, fear, anything at that point because Iaedaila is almost dead.  I assumed mage was doing same thing.  No he had been watching and then wlaked over and LOOTED WHILE IAEDAILA WAS DYING!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Needless to say death embraced mocha man yet again.  The monk and the rest of us all tried our best but we just couldn't get that orc off Iaedaila.<br>
<br>
(Just a note....with the one patch most of you know that Mob goes after person with lowest HP and you can't seem to get it off that person who 99% time ends up dead right?  Have chanter hit it with mem blur.  Works like a charm.  Mob will attack next thing to hit it.  So far the only way I can see to get them off a caster of someone who is about to be dead)<br>
<br>
So I yelled no looting while fighting.  I didn't even say the mage's name or anything.  He replied &quot;well f**k I was oom and my pet was fighting&quot; He did not use astericks.  So I informed him that he had just been reported.  I had to explain to him he had been reported for language by me.  (really it was his attitude and the fact he let mocha die) He started laughing at me that they wouldn't ban a paying customer for a little swear word (I didn't point out the MESSAGE OF THE DAY which stated about foul language) He them called me a &quot;naive child&quot;.  I promptly disbanded from the group.  So in other words he cares about no one and is an arsehole.<br>
<br>
Mocha man follwed me and we hooked up with an AWESOME pally.  If anyone sees Donovath.....say hi he is a really great guy and a budding roleplayer.<br>

Now.. About that Drigg fellow.<br>
<br>
Before I met you wonderful guys..<br>
He had helped me quite a bit, thought he was nice but now I wonder if he was nice just to get next to me (that is another story). Anyway, 2 days ago, I am at first bridge in CB and I here a shout about 'Something or another about needing a healer in Throne Room' So I head off over there. I die. Ok.. So I am on my way but Orcs guarding the entrance to Zone where killing me.. So I die again, mind you I am down to one blue to deleveling. ANYWAY.. I send Drigg a tell (he was the one needing the healer) that I needed a) For him to get rid of the Guards or b) escort me back to Zone for my corpse. A few mintues past and no response. I send another, he replies 'I am at Zone with corpse can't drag it across'. No DOH! I say once again, please escort me to the Zone so I won'd DIE again and delevel.. Waiting on response gets longer.. I send a tell informing him that I need to get to work soon and need to know if he will help. He returns that he is at zone with corpse.. So I find someone to help me and log off.<br>
<br>
Day -2<br>
<br>
I am at first bridge with a group.. We decide to go into Throne Room.. We all get killed after several successful pulls.. Because Drigg pulled Warlord on us. Can we say 'Vengeful'  anyone?<br>
<br>
