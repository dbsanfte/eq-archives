<br>
It was a FFA mob.  We raced and we lost.  I will suke it up and move on.  No one sent me tells or was rude.  I know Noreya was shaking (anger) when the AV RL asked in OOC for our RL to send him a tell.  Nothing was rude or nasty....he just informed me that they would be triggering as soon as they were ready.  I informed him we would be doing the same.  That was it.<br>
<br>
I cannot thank Aelister enough for what he did.  Which I will post seperatly becasue that he deserves that.<br>
<br>
I thank the guild for trying to race for a silly triggered spawn and their loyalty to me and the guild.  I don;t ever claim much from raids...okay nothing really..the one piece I ever claimed I will be MQing.....(see post in allaince forum) I just think the game gods hate me sometimes LOL the one time I hold a raid for myself, AV shows up.<br>
<br>
And even more ironis...NO ONE does this stupid quest.  At the time I started (there were only 7 shawls to do then) maybe 15 people ont he server had completed the 8th shawl.  Witht he ease of the camps and mobs (new armor and quicker levling) and the added bonuses to the shawl recently, there has been a large new interest in it.  I have also been working about 8 months on this quest with untold help from my freinds and I finally get all done but final war and its kinda ironic:<br>
<br>
I log in and go to do final turn in before the war.  To get the piece to trigger the war.  You get ONE SHOT to summon Dain Frostweaver.  I was panicking that I was going to get lost after summoning him and some uber guild would race in and kill him LOL.  Got my turn in piece and ran all the way over to deep in IC to get to start spot.  Had to find by loc...hey turn in guy is up!  Even joked to the guild we should do it then.  I bound myself, then started walking the route, marking landmarks and making hotkeys for key points on the route.  Finish so I gate back and low and behold PoKS is there about to trigger war.  LMFAO so we would ahve had two races had we tried the night before.<br>
<br>
Just kinda ironic and funny in a way.<br>

<br>
Though it is a FFA mob there is courtesy which was not used toward the edgers.  AV many times has stepped aside and let others get a first shot at things and if they failed we would do it.  If they succeeded, we would congratulate and then move on.  Unfortunately, this was not an official AV sponsored raid so the practices we have didnt get observed because the individual that was behind it was and is an arse.  <br>
<br>
I also feel like the person behind it took the viewpoint of &quot;They are a smaller guild, what are they gonna do about it?&quot; based on the conversation I had with him.  I took offense to this because I come from a small RP family guild (war criminals) and was even an edger once myself as this body.  I didnt appreciate some of the things said to me.  I have went off on the guild leader for allowing it to happen as well as a few officers.  The way the conversations went between me and him were in NO way altruistic nor valiant....<br>
<br>
IMO-what the AV members did there that night was rude.  I apologize whole heartedly and hope that any hard feelings held by Edgers arent aimed at me because (for now) I wear the AV tag.  I did everything I could to at least slow down AV so that you could start first.  <br>
<br>
Now--I wont give away guild techniques or secrets but I know how to beat AV if you ever have to race them again....<br>

Now I understand why you were upset and now....well now that was not the right attitude to take.  If he had just said, she and I both did the work, showed up at the same time, I am gonna race, I would not have had a problem with that.  But taking the &quot;uber&quot; attitude does not fly with me.  Now the fact that two people were there for AV raid there were in Faveo not even a week ago.  THAT ticked me off even more.  And two other people that were Faveo awhile ago as well.  <br>
<br>
Anyway I know you tried to help and I sure do apreciate it.  Also we ALMOST beat them.  We had two groups to aego/KEI, all the other buffs were done and then med up.  Since cleric was being twitched.....we lost by maybe 2-3 minutes.  So we came close and it was good practice at least.<br>

The aftermath of this was....not pretty...Many a harsh (but true) word was said between many, and the alliance became null and void. (Much of it due to Atha and her RL hubby Brutuz IMO, or at least they were not innocents in the problems at hand.) <br>
ANYWAY, since then they have both left PoKS and joined Ancient Saga. Now as some of you know, Noreya and I are RL friends with Hurtius, also from AS. (Bard type, been on some of the raids, and in some of the groups etc.) Not too long ago we (the alliance) were in the Hole for Whaerf to obtain something for his epic. Groups of AS wiped, and Noreya and I let by gones be by gones and rezed Atha and her party, while Noreya KEI'd them all. Last week, AS was killing Vindi and Shadora (the GL) and Hurtius invited us along. Last night, they were in PoG and invited us along...this is where the problem begins....Nor and I went up to PoG, COMPLETELY aware we were killing our Tunare faction, killed about....10 or so mobs, totally bottomed out the faction when Nor tells me Hurtius has sent him a tell saying that Atha and Brutuz wont come up to PoG as long as we're there.....now....Im thinkin...ummm WHAT? So I send a tell to Hurtius...who is COMPLETELY embarassed and feels like crap. So, we're like, no biggie and we leave. 2 HOURS LATER, Atha and Brutuz went up...2 HOURS later. Im like...??????, what was the all fire hurry then that we be gone??! AND, oddly enough when they were in a pinch (in the Hole) our rez, kei and buffs were plenty and great for them, but all of a sudden Nor and I are the worst things on MT. Now Im sorry, but you can't have it both ways.....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Anyway long and the sort of it is this, IMO those two (not AS because they're pretty cool bunch on the whole) can just....get bent, they BOTH need to grow the hell up.<br>

<br>
I'll be honest about what I felt when this whole situation arose. I felt that Atha basically threw a tempertantrum on our boards over a misunderstanding that should have been handled through guildleaders/officers at that time. It was highly inapproprate and showed a level of maturity that I found severly lacking. <br>
<br>
Needless to say it degenerated from there. I also had issues with Danadur's statement &quot;I'll not have anyone bashing my cleric.&quot; When said cleric came over to our boards and bashed our Noreya. My general feeling being, if it's fair one way it's damn well fair the other way. I don't like double standards. <br>
<br>
The fact that Atha and Brutuz are still holding on to an incident that occoured over 9 months ago speaks for its self. Children are children regardless of their chronological age. <br>
<br>
You said they could get bent. I am not as nice as you. They can kiss my chubby pally arse. <br>
