Befallen is a unique among all of the dungeons in Norrath. This is because it is the only dungeon to offer one of the standard aspects of classic dungeoneering: Locked Doors. Primarily an undead dungeon,
Clerics and Paladin's will do well here, Rogues are also valued as they are skeleton keys to all the doors with their lockpicking ability.
<br><br>
Large races are highly encouraged to have a shaman cast "Shrink" on them when they zone in, as there are areas which are tight fits for Elves, let alone a full sized ogre! Xp wise this dungeon is well tuned for groups level 8 to 18, and is moderately crowded due to the drop of armor which is desired by the chainmail classes and one of the first Magical 2h's a warrior or paladin is likely to get the BBC.
<br><br>
<i>Special note on the locked doors</i>
<br>
Most people who go to Befallen will find that a large chunk of their existence will flow around finding keys. The simplest way to deal with this is to simply group with a Rogue. A rogue with a pick locks skill of 60 or higher can go through every door in this dungeon like a hot knife through butter. As a side note, rogues wishing to Train in Pick locks can raise their skill to 150 on the 3rd door. If you disconnect and find yourself stuck, shout out, there is usually at least one rogue practicing pick locks or someone on the third floor with a key for you. Because of the door situation make sure at least 2 people in your party can open all the doors all the way up, otherwise your just asking fate to have a train take out your doorman.
<br><br>
That said Befallen is grouped into 3 distinct Areas:
<br>
<i>First Floor</i>
<br>
- Everything outside the First floor door.
<br>
<i>Second Floor</i>
<br>
- Everything Inside the First floor door and before the Third floor Door.
<br>
<i>Third Floor</i>
<br>
- Everything behind the third door.
<br><br>
<b>First Floor</b>
<br>
The first floor is populated by many low level skeletons, and the odd Low level Necromancer. <i>Beware the necromancers above all others in this dungeon, as they
will quickly stack Poison and Disease on you, Theurgists (the highest level of necromancer) will additionally cast Heat Blood and the Life Tap line of spells.</i>
<br><br>
The two NPC's of interest on the first floor are the Dark Elven Shadow Knight, who will drop the key to the First Door, and it is highly recomended your aquire this. You CAN rely on others, however it never hurts to take care of yourself. The other NPC of note is Skeleton Llrodd. Llrodd was apparently the student of Gizdean Gix outside in the west commons, and dark elves can talk to Gix to do a quest with Llrodd by handing him a note. Doing so will cause Commander Windstream on the third level to immiediately spawn (level 23ish undead). Windstream is part of the Thex Mallet quest and holds the box needed to combine the mallet pieces.
<br><br>
In the same area of Llrodd is the well.  The well leads directly to the third floor and will have 2 NPC's (most likely Ghouls or Theurgists) flanking it at the bottom. For groups which have rogues and do not need keys, "Hot Drops" into the third floor are much easier than slugging it out to get to the bottom.
<br><br>
<b>Second Floor</b>
<br>
Second Floor is where this dungeon becomes interesting. Magic to affect monsters will start appearing, mummies, wisps, dread bones, and more powerful necromancers are found here. Towards the rear of the second floor you can find two rooms. One of these rooms will occaisonally spawn a human female Shadow Knight. All of the shadowknights here will open up with a Harm Touch, create pets if given time, and cast DoT's. Beware her room, as directly inside the door is a strange patch of floor which will drop you into the 3rd floor. While there is nothing in this room fortunatley, the SK will run out, through the dungeon, enter the third floor and bring anything she passes with her to finish you off.
<br><br>
In the Other direction you will find a series of rooms which will lead to the Ogre Shadow Knight. The Ogre SK is desirable not only for his key to the Third floor door, but he will also drop the Barbed Arm Plates.
<br><br>
<b>Third Floor</b>
<br>
The Third floor literally leaps out at you when you open the door, the Elf Skeleton, arguablly the strongest NPC in the dungeon, spawns just inside the third floor door, and if you want to come in this way, you will have to fight through him. The Elf skeleton drops parts of the Thex Mallet.
<br><br>
Once past the elf skeleton you will have two options. There is the "Hidden Area" behind the False wall. If you used the well to come down, you will land in the back of this area. On your left is the alcove of the Thaumaturgist and the Priest, both of whom are chased by monks to complete Sash quests, and casters for the Thaumaturgists Gossamer robes.
<br><br>
On the right is another Alcove where (rarely) a Troll shadowknight will spawn with (even more rarely) the prized BBC. Ice Bones, Theurgists, Ghouls and Wisps populate this level. Be sure to kill wisps quickly, unlike their West Commons counterparts, wisps are highly agressive and will run, pulling trains back in on you. They are also highly resistant to magic so snare and root will have a few resists, start casting early in the fight, not just when it runs.
<br>
The other, and largely ignored, area of Befallen is Third floor Rear. This is a wonderful spot as it is almost NEVER camped, and has a plentiful supply of the same NPC's as the hidden area to XP on. Also, the female Dark Elf Shadow Knight will spawn here. She is a good loot for most parties as she drops a full set of keys for all the doors in the dungeon but also will occaisonally drop the Barbed Legplates. These
are an uncommon drop, showing up 2 out every 5 DE SK's you will kill.
<br><br>
At the end of the hallway of the third floor is the so called "Rest Room". Nothing spawns in this room, however if the Human Female SK
should spawn above you (infrequent enough that it is worth it to take a breather in here), expect a quick Harm Touch and a Shadow Knight running in to meet you a few moments later.
<br><br>
Generally the main danger from trains is being stuck behind a locked door, if you take proper precautions this dungeon is not as dangerous as most, and will see good xp through 18th level.

to answer Jorian's question, the entrance is in the sand wall(northern zone edge of west common lands).

Befallen tip: if you are high level and you just want to go into the third level and grab a BBC or Goss robe etc etc, jump down the well near skeleton Lrodd, and if you want to get out, you can either 1.) kill the TSK and get all the keys or 2.) attack something that'll run, dont kill it, but it run, it'll open all the doors for you =P.<br><br>

Ok, to clear up the key story a bit...
The splintered wooden key for the door between lvl 1 and 2 you get from the male dark elf shadow knight at point A.
From the female human shadow knight at point C you get the splintered wooden key for the first door and the charred bone key for the locked door which leads to the ogre shadowknight at point D.
The male ogre shadowknight at point D drops the charred bone key and the smoked glass key (and sometimes the barbed armplates). The smoked glass key opens the door to lvl 3. Like mentioned in an earlier post the smoked glass key vanishes when you camp - even when in a bag in the bank.
A little hint for people who want to get to lvl 3 and forgot their keys on the bank (like me). Don't camp the sk at point A for the key to lvl 2. If he isn't there just whack a giant rat until it runs and opens the door to lvl 2 for you. Then get down and kill the female sk, she will give you a key for the door to get out again.<br><br>

Sounds like Rox is talking about another dungeon.  Miss post?  Anyway first key is at location "A".  Second is upon the Ogre at Location "D".<br><br>

If case anyone needs to know, if you wanna open the first door to get your corpse or something, you can just hurt a giant rat on the first level enough to make it run and it'll go through the door, opening it.<br><br>

Agree with Quinda here, a fairly good map this, third key disappears on logging, or disconnect.  Trains are fairly mad, if you don't have a key and need to escape level 3 train a ghoul to 3rd door and knock it about, it should run openning the door for you.<br><br>
