<b>March 30, 2004</b><br>
---------------------------<br><br>
We have improved collision checking.<br>
System perfomance should be improved.
<br><br>
<b>Rogue Combat Abilities</b><br>
---------------------------
<br><br>
We have made the following changes to the rogue Sneak Attack line:
<br><br>
Sneak Attack will now make your next backstab attempt always hit and do extra damage.  You may only use a Sneak Attack ability after being hidden for a few seconds.  Once you become visible, you must attack quickly or the advantage will be lost.
<br><br>
This change affects the following abilities:
<ul>
<li> Sneak Attack
<li> Thief's Vengeance
<li> Assassin's Strike
<li> Kyv Strike
<li> Ancient: Chaos Strike
</ul><br>

<b>Headlines</b><br>
--------------------------
<br><br>
-Refining some DX9 functionality.<br>
-Some adjustments have been made to pets.<br>
-Some general bug fixes.<br>
-Added a new rogue discipline line, Assassins Strike.  The tomes can be found in the East Commonlands and the Plane of Knowledge.
<br><br>
<b>DirectX 9</b><br>
--------------------------
<br><br>
-The center of collision for all players & NPCs has been set higher.  This resolves issues with climbing, running up hills and some other collision issues.<br>
-We have made improvements to position processing which should alleviate some of the problems related to getting stuck in geometry. <br>
-Improved collision and movement when near overhangs. <br>
-The auto-duck mechanism is now an user-enabled option. It can be set in the General tab of the options window.  This feature forces your character to duck automatically to get into small places.  If set to off, you will need to manually duck to enter those places. It is "on" by default.<br>
-Warping of very small NPCs (e.g., giant rats in Qeynos) has been resolved.<br>
-Rain now has visible weather. 
<br><br>
<b>Pets</b><br>
--------------------------
<br><br>
60+ player pets have been improved in a number of ways.  Most notably, the effects of pet foci will be more dramatic as a player progresses with more powerful equipment.  There have also been a number of inconsistencies between different tiers of pet foci that have been fixed.  All of the existing foci should never show a power decrease in any aspect when upgrading from a lower tier foci to a higher tier foci.  The most dramatic changes in pet stats are in the following aspects:
<ul>
<li> Level - Most tiers of Foci will add one level to the pet.
<li> Max HP - Most tiers of foci will add max hit points to the pet, some tiers are more dramatic than others and follow a similar rate of progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet focus items.
<li> Mitigation (AC, Agility) -- Most tiers of foci will add mitigation to the pet.  Some tiers are more dramatic than others and follow a similar rate of progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet focus items.
<li> Damage Output - Generally the pets did not receive a significant change in their damage output, although there are certain pets that have had their max hit and offense increased.
</ul>
Overall, the player pets have received a significant boost. There are instances where you will see no change in a specific aspect of a specific pet.  For example, the Rathe's Son pet summoned with Minion of Eternity has not received an improvement in max hit points, but it has received a significant mitigation improvement.
<br><br>
These changes affect the pets summoned by the following spells:
<ul>
<li> Ward of Xegony
<li> Child of Ro
<li> Servant of Marr
<li> Rathe's Son
<li> Legacy of Zek
<li> Saryrn's Companion
<li> Child of Bertoxxulous
<li> Spirit of Sorsha
<li> Spirit of Arag
</ul>
The most profound changes were made to the magician pets as they were most in need of improvement to maintain class balance.  Beastlord and necromancer pets also received upgrades, but not of the same magnitude.

<b>Headlines</b><br>
------------------------
<br><br>
Combines work again!<br>
Melee Part II!<br>
A new story has been added to your storybook!
<br><br>
The grammar police have invaded EQ and they have made many minor spell, item and quest text fixes that are too numerous to list here.  
<br><br>
We'd like to thank all of the players that took time to provide feedback regarding the melee changes.  We'd also like to send a special thanks to all of the players that helped us test the additions on the Test and Beta servers. All of the input we received helped to shape the improvements you've seen in the melee classes.
<br><br>
Please continue to give your feedback on the melee system or anything else that you feel requires attention. It does make a difference.
<br><br>
Over the last several months there have been several new additions to EverQuest aimed at increasing the desirability and relative power of pure melee classes.
<ul>
<li> Discipline timers were revamped, allowing greater freedom and frequency of use.
<li> Endurance bar was added as a limited resource to power melee abilities and disciplines.
<li> Warriors received an innate 5 percent increase in their ability to absorb damage.
<li> Warriors received the Incite line of abilities, giving them a new tool for aggro management. 
<li> Monks received the Phantom Call line of abilities, giving them a new tool for pulling.
<li> Several new disciplines were introduced for all three classes.
</ul>
The endurance system and the separation of the discipline timers have provided us with new tools to add interesting and powerful abilities in the future for melee classes.  You can count on seeing new disciplines and abilities as the game progresses and as situations arise that require new abilities to effectively balance class power.  We will continue to evaluate the melee system for both balance and enjoyment.
<br><br>
We will also continue to review and make changes to each individual class as needed.  Class balance is an important part of any multiplayer game and requires constant attention.
<br><br>
Thanks for helping make EverQuest a great game.
<br><br>
<b>Items</b><br>
------------------------
<br><br>
We have replaced the spell-like effects on items which produced the following effects: Attack, HP Regen, Mana Regen, Haste and Damage Shield with actual statistics.  The effects on the item have not changed they are just set up in a new way that we hope will allow for more item functionality in the future.
<br><br>
- Several Gates smithed weapons have had their damage and delay adjusted to be more in line with the difficulty in crafting them.<br>
- The Copper Hammer of Striking will no longer proc for wielders below level 50.<br>
- The Wailing Coral Staff is now two handed blunt.<br>
- Bolas are now one-handed projectile rather than ammo.<br>
- Bola ranges have been adjusted slightly.<br>
- All bolas that can proc will now do so.<br>
- All items that had the "Cleave" series of effects removed, have had them returned.
<br><br>
The drop rate for the following Epic Quest items has been increased slightly:
<ul>
<li> Essence of a Vampire
<li> Decrepit Hide
<li> Staff of Elemental Mastery (Earth)
</ul>

<b>Expedition zones</b><br>
-------------------------
<br><br>
You will now have to wait 5 minutes before you are able to accept another expedition zone.
<br><br>

<b>Tradeskills</b><br>
-------------------------
<br><br>
In order to correct many of the issues with the new tradeskill interface it was necessary to remove all learned and favorite recipes.  However the system should now work better overall.<br>
- The sell prices for Saltwater Tuna and Saltwater crab, as well as the price for any item made from them, have been reduced.<br>
- Rainbow Trout should now be tradeable.<br>
- If you are not a gnome, you should no longer be able to tinker with a deluxe toolkit kit.  If you are a gnome, please tinker away.<br>
- You should now be able to properly search for recipes.<br>
- The trivial level for brewing Fish Wine has been adjusted.
<br><br>

- Berserkers should no longer be told that they can bash at level 6.  <br>

<br><br>

<b>Spells</b><br>
-------------------------
<br><br>
-Some Gates of Discord spells should now drop a little more often.<br>
- Several heal spells for Gates of Discord have been modified slightly.<br>
- The shadow knight Ancient Spell: Bite of Chaos should now work as intended.
<br><br>

<b>NPC's</b><br>
-------------------------
<br><br>
- Hierophant Granix should now give the correct text in Cabilis.<br>
- Trimdet Trueheart in Abysmal Sea is less of a snob and should now speak with you correctly.  <br>
- If you tell Brevik Kalaner in Abysmal what items you [need back], he will return to you any items you've just given him.
<br><br>

<b>Tribute</b><br>
-------------------------
<br><br>
- A few items have had their tribute value adjusted.<br>
- Gift of the Enchanters should now work correctly.<br>
- You should no longer be able to donate containers with items inside for favor.<br>
- Persistent Boon should now give the proper effect.
<br><br>

<b>Alternate Advancement</b><br>
-------------------------
<br><br>
- Dire Charm will no longer reset after being resisted as the ability was successfully initiated.<br>
- Dire Charm should now reset when used on an NPC that is too high in level.
<br><br>

<b>Miscellaneous</b><br>
-------------------------
<br><br>
- Corrected a faction issue with the wizard epic.<br>
- The monk "Phantom" line of abilities should no longer be resisted in the level 65 "hard" LDoN Adventures.<br>

If you find that you have no practical use for the 2-handed augmentation, please petition and a suitable 1-handed replacement will be made available to you.<br>

<b>February 18, 2003 Part 2</b>
<br><br>
We found a bit of code that was, occasionally, causing random zone crashes and corrected it.  We are still working on the second part of the 1017 problem and hope that many of you found some relief in the changes we made last night.  Thanks again for your patience.  We're working hard to solve the problem.
<br><br>
Monks once again irresistible. (Phantom abilities should no longer be resisted.)
<br><br>
Small change to berserker epic text.
<br><br>
<b>Tribute System</b><br>
------------------------
<br><br>
You may see a change to your accrued favor points as we implement the second change to the Tribute System.  As you know, many items were overvalued and have since been reduced.  Now we will be adjusting the accrued favor pool to reflect the amount you should have received for items turned in prior to the changes.  We know that this may take away some of your accrued points and for that we apologize, however this change will bring the system more in-line with our intentions.  We hope that you agree that it was a reasonable and necessary change.
<br><br>
<b>Server Stability</b><br>
------------------------
<br><br>
We have made some coding changes to the front end to improve connectivity and stability and reduce the number of 1017 errors.
<br><br>
The EQ team apologizes for the server instability in the past week. This instability occurs at peak times, and is seen to our users as "1017" errors.  Normally within a few minutes these users are able to log back in, but on some servers this problem has occurred more than once in a single evening. 
<br><br>
We're working to address the problem, and expect that in the next couple of days we'll have everything resolved. In the meantime, there's a chance you'll run into this problem if you're on a crowded server during peak times - if you do, you can normally get back onto the servers within 15 or 20 minutes.
<br><br>
Gates of Discord has been immensely popular - many of our old customers have been coming back to try it out, and many new customers have arrived to give EQ a try.  Our simultaneous usage numbers are quite high, but in addition the people who are online are also playing more and for longer than usual.  Gates of Discord introduced many new instanced zones, high level content, and re-introduced the casino - this type of content is particularly taxing on our servers, and coupled with the unusually high usage, we're seeing a resulting instability during our peak times.
<br><br>
Our first effort was to remove the casino, which improved our server stability.  Since then, we've been working on two different fixes, the first of which will go live at the 3am patch Wednesday morning (Tuesday night).  The second will be later this week.  Both of them are meant to improve performance during peak times and address the 1017 errors that you may be experiencing.  Each of them we expect to be an improvement on connectivity, and we expect our second fix to resolve the problems.
<br><br>
We apologize for our service instability in the past week; we're working hard on this problem - it's cutting into our play time too.  :)  
<br><br>
We'll give you another update in the next day or two as we make progress, and let you know how things are coming. 
<br><br>
<b>NPC's</b><br>
------------------------
<br><br>
- Taminoa Bialu Should now properly return quest items that he does not want.
<br>
- The boat from Abysmal should align properly with the new dock in Natimbi. 
<br>
- You should notice improved travel time on the boat to and from Natimbi.
<br><br>
<b>Items</b><br>
------------------------
<br><br>
The following items had their "Cleave" effect removed due to stacking issues;
<ul>    
<li> Bracer of the Heartstriker     
<li> Bracer of Exploration     
<li> Bracer of the Stoutheart     
<li> Vadd's Chestplate of Elite Combat     
<li> Rayin's Chestplate of Abhorrence     
<li> Pressl's Tunic of Balance     
<li> Kizash's Tunic of Savage Heart     
<li> Luvwen's Chestplate of Melody     
<li> Nadien's Chainmail of the Archer     
<li> Nodnol's Chainmail of the Scoundrel     
<li> Harlad's Chainmail of Fury     
<li> Trimdet's Chestplate of Chivalry     
<li> Gem-Studded Band of Struggle     
<li> Glowing Spiritstone Necklace
</ul><br>

<b>Return of the Casino</b><br>
------------------------ 
<br><br>
** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! ** 
<br><br>
Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven again houses a game of chance. To play you will need to buy a King's Court Token. You then take this token and turn it in to any of the dealers. Based on what your hand turns out to be, you will be awarded a prize. The highest hands will return a gold ticket as the prize. This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as a Guise of the Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder Beads. Good luck to all that play! 
<br><br>
<b>Tradeskill UI now live</b><br>
---------------------------
<br><br>
Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface. In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are currently available to you. This includes recipes that are at your skill level as well as some above it. Clicking on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion. Clicking the "combine" button will extract those required items from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine, placing the results on the player's cursor. The new system is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you want to try a combine that is way out of your league, which uses the old style of combination. 
<br><br>
<b>Item Changes</b><br>
---------------------
<ul>
<li> The name of Berserker armor has been changed to Bladesmans armor. 
<li> The beastlord epic weapon will no longer "proc" for wielders below the 46th level. 
<li> Many text changes in item descriptions. 
</ul>
<b>General Bug Fixes</b><br>
-------------------------
<ul>
<li> A Tormentors hoof is now flagged as a tradeskill item. 
<li> Chaotic Stab, a rogue AA, will no longer cause full damage on frontal attacks. 
<li> Altered some NPC factions in the Plane of Tactics arena to prevent a problem with charm. 
</ul>
<b>Combat Abilities</b><br>
-----------------------
<ul>
<li> Fixed some text on the Focus Will Discipline. 
<li> Assassins Strike should now work correctly. 
<li> Sneak Attack should now work correctly. 
<li> Thief's Vengeance is now working correctly. 
<li> Indirection should now work as intended. 
</ul>
<b>Spells</b><br>
---------- 
<ul>
<li> Corrected a few spell descriptions. 
<li> Corrected some spell sound effects. 
<li> Arachnae Venom and Fellspine should now stack with the warriors provoke abilities.
</ul><br>

Tonight we have a small update to fix some general bugs.  We are again changing charm (in exactly the way we thought we had last week)  No this is not deja vu.  You should also look for changes in that evolving zone of Nedaria's Landing.  I wonder what is going on there?
<ul>
<li> An update to the zone, Nedaria's Landing.  Make sure you check it out.
<li> Charm spell change: If an NPC is in the middle of casting a spell when charm is broken, it will interrupt the spell.
<li> Some general bug fixes.
</ul>
Make sure you log onto the Test server to see what other changes we are cooking up.  Our next Scheduled update is planned for February 10th.<br>

The latest expansion to EverQuest - <a href="http://www.gatesofdiscord.com 
" target="new">Gates of Discord</a> - is available for pre-order and incremental download!  Be the first in your guild to pre-order Gates and begin the incremental download now! This new expansion boasts: 
<ul>
<li> 100 new Alternate Advancement abilities. 
<li> Leadership experience to unlock many group- and raid-enhancing tools. 
<li> 20 new zones -- 10 new instanced zones and 10 new traditional zones, including a huge ship city zone to gather your party and launch expeditions. The new combat zones are for characters level 50 and over. 
<li> New Berserker class -- ravage your enemies with two-handed axes or by hurling large objects.

<li> 20 all-new NPC models make for hundreds of challenging encounters unlike anything seen before in EverQuest.

<li> Dozens of new and exciting story-driven quests and content for the hardy adventurer. 
<li> New tradeskill recipes to produce hundreds of new items.

</ul>
Pre-order yours today by pressing Pre-order at the server select screen, or at <a href="https://store.station.sony.com" target="new">https://store.station.sony.com</a>! 
<br><br>
<b>** Incremental Download for Gates of Discord **</b><br>
We have begun introducing the Gates files in small bits. This is the most convenient way for you to get the files you'll need for the new expansion. It is a lot easier to download these files in smaller chunks than to download them all on the day of release. 
You can get the files incrementally from the EverQuest updater. The obvious way to begin downloading the files is to click "yes" when the dialogue box pops up asking you if you'd like to incrementally download Gates. If you've already told that dialogue never to appear again, you can get the files in a few easy steps: 
<ul>
<li> Run the EverQuest Updater 
<li> Click the Advanced button 
<li> Click the checkbox next to Gates of Discord 
<li> Click Save 
<li> Click Download. 
</ul>
This will catch you up on the downloads you have missed and will update you as we add files to the updater. This will make your download much smaller the day Gates launches, or the day you purchase the digital version of the expansion. 
<br><br>
The anticipated release date -- February 10th, 2004 -- is subject to change. If the anticipated release date changes, we will announce a revised release date via a patch message.  Enjoy!<br>

We have made a few changes to remove some exploits in our continuing effort to remove any loopholes in EverQuest. In this update we have removed the charm exploit in Plane of Tactics by changing the way that charm works. This change should not affect those who use charm in the manner for which it was intended. We have also changed the profit margin of many tradeskill items when sold to NPC vendors. It is our hope that these changes and your continued community efforts will help to put a stop to those who do not wish to play fairly. 
<ul>
<li>Changed Charm spells so that NPCs spell use will now be interrupted once the charm has expired.</li>
<li>We have modified the sell back value on many tradeskill items to prevent excessive profit.</li>
<li>Please note that many items will now show as being usable by berserkers. This does not necessarily mean the items will be equippable by berserkers when Gates of Discord launches.</li>
