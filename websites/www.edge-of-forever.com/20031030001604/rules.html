1. Have fun

2. No anonymous, though roleplay is fine.  Anon hides guild tag and wont show
 up on a /who all edge<br><br>
3. Dont be a nimrod.  If you have to ask what a nimrod is...  then you are problably already one.  Quit it.
<br><br>
4. Try and not recruit nimrods. 
<br><br>
5. Try and not associate with nimrods.
<br><br>
6. Epics.  They are nice.  Lets get as many as we can.
<br><br>
7. Guild dues - Everyone will pay Avner 100k pp per week, or 1cp per Dragon we kill as a guild.  Whichever is less.
<br><br>
8. Level limit - Dont know if this is neccessary.  Lets use a case by case basis. 
<br><br>
9. If any questions... see rule #1
