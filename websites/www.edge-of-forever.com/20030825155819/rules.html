1. No Begging Lying Stealing or Cheating the guild or its members
<br><br>
2. No anonymous, though roleplay is fine.  Anon hides guild tag and wont show
 up on a /who all edge<br><br>
3. Be nice to everyone.  There is no favoritism.  If you can be helpful in some
 way with a problem please do so,  but dont over do it to the point where it
 stresses you out.  Come to Feylon if there is a problem.
<br><br>
4. We are looking for people who are going to STAY with this guild.  Not people
 who will leave once they hit the 50's or so because we cant do our own major
raids yet. We want people who will support EoF in everything they do and
everywhere they go. Tell good stories about us and most of all be loyal to
EoF as if we were your real family and stick it out. Through good times and bad. 
<br><br>
5. As you all know we have a sisterhood with Arbiters and Resurrected. Please if
 you see someone shout in the zone for a group and you see they are Arb or Resu
 and you have room in your group, invite that person. They do the same for us,
 and they invite us on their raids.  we all should be doing the same =) Arb and 
 Resu have grouping and raid priority over any one else.
<br><br>
6. Raids - Only people allowed on our raids are those in EoF, Arb and Resu ONLY.
 UNLESS they have have a character in our guild but would like to bring someone
 else not in EoF to the raid due to the level requirement of that raid. These 
 kind of things still must be cleared with me ahead of time. It's only fair so
 I can make groups accordingly and not have any surprises.
<br><br>
7. Guild dues - Anyone over 30 is required to donate pp according to their 
highest level characters level, not all characters just the highest, OR an item
worth that amount or more monthly. This is to provide new people with items they
need or that high level you know who is missing that FBSS and cant afford it. 
Or that SMR for their epic. This benefits EVERYONE not just certain people.
 Please do your part as best as you can. See me if you have questions or post here.
<br><br>
8. Level limit to enter the guild has been raised to 30, no longer is 15. Unless
you already have a character in the guild regardless of level.
<br><br>
NOTE: You can not recieve something or pp from the guild bank unless you have 
donated something yourself. This does not apply to lower levels who are in need
and dont ask however. Guild bank items are given freely to those who deserve it,
but if we give we ask that you in turn donate something when your level requires it.
