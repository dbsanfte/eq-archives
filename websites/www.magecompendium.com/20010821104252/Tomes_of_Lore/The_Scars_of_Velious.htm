Before recorded time, Veeshan the great Crystalline Dragon marked Norrath by
striking the continent of Velious with her foreclaw, and deposited her brood
there to dwell. The legends of that time also tell that Veeshan blasted Velious
with her breath, encasing it in eternal ice and creating a barrier of deadly ice
flows and stormy weather. This marked the beginning of the Age of Scale.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Age of Scale lasted untold millennia. From
the tidbits of information passed down, it is known that a group of dragons
mastered magic and spell casting during this era. Additionally, dragons of power
and influence among their kind gathered together and formed a hereditary ruling
council known as the Claws of Veeshan, who rule the dragons of Velious to this
day. Few of Norrath’s inhabitants know more of this Age, and none that do
would dare to speak.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The end of the Age of Scale was marked by the
Gods creation of the other races of Norrath. Many of Veeshan’s vainglorious
brood perceived that they might rule over these lesser beings and left Velious.
This splinter group became known as the Ring of Scale. Those dragons that
remained upon Velious had little interest in temporal power, and were content to
pass the millennia in homage to their goddess, and in quiet contemplation and
the study of magics.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the Elder Age, the Ogres, Giants and Goblins
conquered much of Norrath and began an assault on the Plane of Earth,
precipitating retribution from The Rathe in the form of a great curse against
all of Rallos Zek’s creations. The fertile homelands of the Giants (now known
as Everfrost) were frozen, and those giants caught in the epicenter of the curse
were transformed wholly into immortal creatures of living ice. Those nearby were
struck to the core of their beings, becoming lesser creatures in mind and body
than they had been. Those few who escaped the effects fled Tunaria for other
lands, coming to the attention of Prexus the Oceanlord, who sent a great storm
to destroy them. The storm drove many ships back to Tunaria and to Kunark, where
the curse of The Rathe took hold to a lesser degree than in Everfrost. Many of
the most powerful giants managed to escape the storm thanks to their great
powers, and passed through the Frigid Barrier to land upon the Icy Fingers in
Velious. The Kromrif established themselves in the Eastern Wastes and lived as
nomads, eventually coming into conflict with the Coldain. The Kromzek were the
most powerful of all Rallos Zek’s creations. Not content with a nomadic
lifestyle, they established a mighty fortress city named Kael Drakkal in the
Great Scar of Veeshan. The Claws of Veeshan took exception to the intrusion of
the Kromzek upon their sacred lands, and thus began the long conflict between
the two mightiest races on Norrath, in this most inhospitable of all places.
Ages passed, leaving the eastern regions of Velious largely in the control of
the Giants. It was during this time that the ships of the Coldain, or Ice
Dwarves, were wrecked upon the ice of the Frigid Barrier. Those few who survived
to reach the shore escaped the notice of the Claws of Veeshan, but were
devastated in a conflict with the fearsome Kromrif. Fleeing the giants, the
Coldain established Thurgadin, a hidden underground fortress in the mountains.
Since these times, none of the other races of Norrath have dared to approach the
Frigid Barrier, and thus Velious remained undiscovered.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the present day, the Gnomes of Ak’anon
have revealed an ocean vessel with the capability of navigating the roughest
seas and breaking through ice flows. Upon it’s maiden voyage, the Gnomish
Icebreaker successfully penetrated the Frigid Barrier and discovered the islands
known as the Icy Fingers. Upon the largest of the islands, the crew discovered
an ancient and massive bridge, which arced away into the mists and revealed the
tip of a massive glacial continent – Velious! For a price, these Gnomes and
their allies will offer the brave adventurers of Norrath passage to these
frozen, uncharted lands.</font></p>
