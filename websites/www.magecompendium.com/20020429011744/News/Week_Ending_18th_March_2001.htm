The Fan Faire comes home!<br>
<br>
The next EverQuest Fan Faire will be held April 6 - April 7, 2001 at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We expect this one to sell out quicker than Baltimore not only because the weather will be warmer, but also because it's a safe bet to say you'll get to meet even more Verant personalities since our offices are local. Don't delay with registration because you may get left out!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The registration deadline is March 28th.  Go to <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/fanfaire/" target="_blank"><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">http://www.station.sony.com/fanfaire/</span></font></b></a> for details.<br>

 Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One on Antonica and two others on Kunark.  NPCs at these locations can fill you in on the details.  Good hunting.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the "Celestial Healing" effect has been increased to one minute.  We understand that this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch.  We did, however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and kept on the group tank.  When we've decided on the new affect, it will be applied to those items retroactively.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>

EverQuest Turns Two<br>
<br>
Two years ago this Friday, EverQuest was launched, forever changing the course of online gaming.  Today EverQuest boasts nearly 360,000 active subscribers, and a two-year retention rate of 65%.  Peak usage tops 89,000 simultaneous users with average peak usage at roughly 87,000.  The EverQuest community continues to grow daily.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We've put up a page on the EverQuest website to help celebrate EverQuest's achievement and to thank our loyal fans.  Over the next couple of days we will be posting interesting content from EverQuest's humble beginnings, as well as a few surprises.  Check it out!</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp" target="_blank"><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000"><b>http://everquest.station.sony.com/2ndanniversary/index.jsp</b></span></font></a><br>
<br>
Ever Changing, Evolving, Expanding<br>
<br>
The Warrens:<br>
<br>
As part of our two-year celebration, we're pleased to announce the release of "The Warrens", a free expansion zone located on Odus. "The Warrens" is a low-to-mid level dungeon and the home of the Kobolds on Odus.  You can patch the Warrens by running the "Optional Patch".&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In addition to filling-out the continent of Odus, "the Warrens" will also serve as a platform to try out some of the new ideas brought forth by members of the team and the public aimed at addressing some common gameplay issues.  We would like to see what options might be open to and enjoyed by the players in the future.<br>
<br>
The first issue addressed in the Warrens is the problem of higher level characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower level creatures.  To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that "outclasses" a particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP.  All other loot will drop.  "Outclassing" a foe is defined as having a group makeup such that no one in your group receives experience from the kill.  This can happen if, for instance, the foe is "green" to all group members, or if the group makeup is of such a wide level range that the system determines the fight was unbalanced using regular experience rules.<br>
<br>
Any time that an NPC would have dropped special loot and does not due to it being outclassed, a message indicating that the combat was "trivial" will be displayed to the group.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As time goes on, we will be implementing new gameplay subsets and adjustements in the Warrens.  Please be sure to let us know what you think!<br>
<br>
The Planes:<br>
<br>
The Planes of Fear and Hate have been updated as part of our two-year celebration.  Adventurers in the Plane of Fear will notice that some high-level foes are now available.  Rewards for former "boss npcs" have been moved down to underlings that are roughly as powerful as the old bosses were.<br>
<br>
The Plane of Hate has also received a large update, but this one also includes the opening of a previously undiscovered part of the zone, now full high-level expansion-oriented content.  Much as with Fear, rewards from bosses have been moved.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Epic Quests:<br>
<br>
As part of the Plane updates, we've made several adjustments to Epic quests for a number of classes.  Previously, questers of many classes were put in direct competition with regular non-questing adventurers for a few coveted spawns.  In these cases, a new step has been added to separate the "Epic Encounter" NPCs from the "Epic Quest" NPCs.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For those who are mid-quest, all quest requirements have remained the same.  In other words, if you turn the same items into the same NPC, the same reward applies.  What has changed is that some components may be in a different location from where you expect them.  It is recommended that you check with the last NPC in line or other adventurers to find where you need to go next.<br>
<br>
Patch Day<br>
<br>
Along with the big announcements above, today was a patch day as well:<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that allowed exploitation of the period of time between character control being established and loading of character faction tables.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Fixed the Dagger of Frost.  Its special item flags were improperly removed in the last patch.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The spell, Mark of Karn, has been enhanced to heal more per hit.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The effect on the Celestial Elixir Breastplates has been changed to the enhanced Mark of Karn.  The casting time on these items has also been changed to 9 seconds.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- NPCs in Thurgadin will no longer stop traveling when you /hail them.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Fixed a problem present in Nagafen's Lair and the Plane of Hate that caused framerate to drop over time.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Shift-clicking on a stack of items will cause you to pick up the whole stack.  This is in addition to CTRL-clicking on a stack, which will cause you to pick up one.  These both also work for coins now as well as items.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- In addition to the above, holding down the shift key while clicking the "Sell" button in the vendor screen will cause you to sell the entire stack of items if a stack is selected.  For example, you can sell 20 peridots by selecting the stack, and shift-clicking "Sell".  I'd recommend though that you give them to your neighborhood cleric first though :)  The ability to buy stacks is on the list for implementation in the near future.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- There are a ton of new recipies for trade skill users out there.  Check your books.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- There are a bunch of new quests as well.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- It appears that we fixed a bug with the Mend skill that caused it to be unavailable for a few seconds after it was supposed to be ready for use.  Let us know if there are any further problems.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Foraging items will now yield a message giving you some idea of what you've foraged.<br>
<br>
Please remember that the /movelog for the Rathe and E'ci is scheduled for this weekend.  Please read the message below for details on the
/movelog.<br>
<br>
A Message From Customer Service<br>
<br>
We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters moved from one server to another, or from one account to another.  Unfortunately, due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that we receive, the desire to maintain stable server communities and economies, and other problems associated with character moves, we can not move characters across servers or accounts.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a server remain on that server.  We also feel that it is important that characters that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live with the consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to retreat from that reputation by changing servers.<br>
<br>
The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving a large number of characters to new servers.  At no other time will we move a character in such a fashion.<br>
<br>
- The EverQuest Team<br>
<br>
March 9th, 12:00am<br>
<br>
E'ci and The Rathe Movelog<br>
<br>
We will be opening a new server and moving characters from the E'ci and The Rather severs to this new server upon the request of the customer.  If you choose to move your characters to the new server, please be aware that all of your characters on the old server will be moved to the new server.<br>
<br>
To request to have your characters moved to the new server, all you need to do is type "/movelog yes" into the chat window while playing a character on that server during the time that the move log is open.<br>
<br>
We will be opening the move log for these two servers on Friday, March 16th, 2001 at 6:00 pm. PST  (which is Saturday morning at 2:00 am GMT).  We will be closing the move log on Sunday, March 18th, 2001 at 11:59 pm PST  (7:59 am on Monday the 19th GMT).  The new, yet unnamed, server should be opened some time during the week of March 19th.  We'll announce the exact date as soon as we can.<br>
<br>
There are a few things to keep in mind when choosing to move your characters to the new server.  The most important thing to keep in mind is that character corpses will not be moved with the characters.  So it is important to make certain that you have looted all of the corpses that you want to loot before the characters are moved.<br>
<br>
Also, characters names are unique on the new server.  Because characters will be moving from two separate servers onto the new one, there may be cases where two characters with the same name are created on the new server.  Because character names must be unique, one of the two characters will be chosen at random and have an 'x' added to the end of their name.  If you find that one of your characters has had an 'x' tacked onto their name after the move and you would rather have a new name, please contact your GM by using the /petition function.  The GM will help you to change the name of your character.<br>
<br>
Guild structures do not follow the characters to the new server.  We will be unable to reestablish guilds until at least a week has passed after the split.  On any day after the new server has been up for eight days, the guild leader can /petition for a GM to help them reestablish the guild.  Please do not petition for this before seven days have passed, we will not be able to set up your guild before then.<br>
<br>
We will not be moving characters back to the old server, so make certain that you want to move your characters before you type "/movelog yes".  And we will not be moving characters for those that fail to execute the movelog command during the stated window of opportunity.&nbsp;<br>

message boards.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I'm curious about
this. I don't remember reading about what this &quot;vision&quot; really is,
just that they have a vision.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a nutshell, our vision and hope
is that they would all be relatively balanced. And when I say balanced, I mean
useful in the game, such that a player chooses which class he wants to play from
a subjective standpoint (i.e. Paladins are cool!), rather than feeling compelled
to choose a particular class because that class is measurably more powerful in
most in-game situations.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The vision also includes a desire
for interdependence and situational aptitudes. In other words, in most cases,
classes should need other classes (and, therefore, other people) to be
successful in the game. Also, some classes should be more successful in some
situations and less so in others.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, this is the 'vision' -- our
idealistic desire. We've fallen short, of course, but we continue to strive to
do better. But, all in all, given our personal experiences, the feedback we
receive, and looking at the data (how many people play which classes, etc.), I
think we've done a pretty good job.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Aradune, I’m
really not sure how to bring this up. Why are Clerics and warriors required in
all difficult situations? Haven’t you noticed this? There really aren’t any
other classes that even have relatively close abilities on a per level basis.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To answer your question, the
'vision' is that in most high level situations a tank, a caster, and a healer
should be present. In other words, core class functionality. So, ideally, just
about any tank, or caster, or healer should be useful. Beyond that, depending on
the more specific situation, some classes might be better than others at this
core functionality.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, that's the ideal. And some
of the changes -- 'nerfs' and enhancements -- as of late are an attempt to get
us closer to that ideal.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Brad</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I would have
chosen a Paladin, but I just couldnt play a character without Gate and
Bind.&quot;<br>
That is a rather frequent comment from a lot of people when choosing classes.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Kinda, yes. But that's just as
valid as saying &quot;I would have played an Enchanter, but I just couldn't play
a character that can't use a sword or wear great armor.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some things have to be core to
each class archetype. Sure, you could argue that one archetype is better than
the other. Or that some things should or should not be core to that type. And,
especially with the whole bind thing, I've heard a lot of arguments that do just
that. But none of them has appeared to be more valid than the current structure,
and the current structure also supports class interdependency.</font>
