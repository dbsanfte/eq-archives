<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In the case of
  the abuse of safe zones, it is well known that using such locations is against
  our rules. It can't be reasonably argued that any player with a character over
  50th level doesn't understand that.</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Since I'm
approaching my 50th level, and obviously want to know something that /everyone
else/ knows, what exactly is a safe zone?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Is this simply a
zone that a MOB cannot path to? Or is there some other, darker meaning behind
the term, 'Safe Zone.'</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Please let us
know.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's pretty much it. Sitting in
a place that an NPC can't get to in order to kill it (or rest up while that NPC
is trying to reach you) is exploiting a safe spot.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I believe you
misunderstood what YoodenVranx was trying to say, again. You are still in
&quot;defend our kael bug actions&quot; and the question he asked didnt pertain
to the Kael incident directly. He was asking why is there no fix to a bug, until
someone exploits it?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">You started
explaining how the exploited ones are the most difficult to find, and never get
reported.. That was not the question. You again said how Kael was a bug, and in
fact did need to be fixed. We understand that too. That was not the question
either.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It is not like you
just dont hear about any smaller, unexploitable bugs at all. (That is what was
implied when you said that the exploited ones are the hardest to find.) Saying
that they are the hardest ones to find, means that you are just ignoring the
easier ones to find, the ones that DO get reported, and DONT get
fixed.(--Because they cannot be exploited so they therefore are no emergency
patch, like he was saying--) Which was, in fact, the question that you scooted
around both times.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">To see you jump
around the question like that, twice, is quite disturbing. I hope I have
re-worded it in a way so you can understand what i am trying to say, if that was
the problem.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Perhaps I didn't explain that well
enough.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's not always the ease with
which a bug is found that determines when it gets fixed. Yes, a 'smaller' bug
will often wait to be fixed behind a larger one, regardless of the effect of the
bug. A bug that is causing barbarian kilts to turn pink will probably wait
behind a bug that causes barbarians to take 50% more (or less) damage in combat.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But it also has to do with how
easy it is to fix something. This aggro bug has, obviously, been pretty darn
hard to pin down. Its importance has been high the whole time, but as you can
tell by the fact that we already thought we had it fixed, fixing it hasn't been
an easy thing.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The perception that we prioritize
bugs based on some desire to be mean to our customers is a wrong. I can only
guess as to its cause, but it appears to be that people take far more notice of
the bug fixes that we make that they don't like than the ones that they do.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm certainly not scooting around.
We fix bugs as fast as we can, prioritized by their affect on the game. There
may be cases, and the aggro code is one, where the bug was introduced by a
recent code change and fixing that might take priority over some older bug of
similar import. But that happens as a matter of practicality. Someone was just
looking at that code and it's ultimately easier to fix something that was just
recently broken than something that will require research to reproduce and
examine.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">To be brief, I
think the heart of the frustration you're seeing is from the fact that the pet
aggro was a bug before this &quot;abuse&quot; was discovered. And what the
general feeling is, is that there was no rush to fix this bug before, when it
negativley impacted players, but now that there's a way that it can positivly
impact them, it becomes a higher priority.. even though it's the same bug. Now I
think that leads to the feeling some people get that &quot;They don't care if
their changes hurt me, but they'll 'nerf' anything that helps&quot;.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I understand that this is the
issue.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The problem is timing. We have
been working to fix the aggro bug since the last patch. We would have patched a
fix for it next week in any case. The things going on in Kael haven't changed
that at all. But because we also had to place a stopgap measure to prevent
people from using this bug during the next week before we can get it patched,
people have assumed that we are only fixing it because people were gaining easy
experience and loot from it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I can't help the timing. It just
happens that way.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">And we don't
  expect players to know everything that is and is not a bug.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Two questions in
response to this.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1. Why is then
that a player gets a warning for abusing a bug they don't know about? If you
don't have an in game method of informing the player base of new bugs that get
warnings then I can't see how you honestly feel justified in warning/banning for
any &quot;bug.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2. Why is it that
a warning never falls off the account?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I am not sure how
it all works exactly, but if you had a warning 1 year ago, and a new bug comes
out and you mistakenly &quot;exploit&quot; it then you get suspended since you
had a previous warning.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I fight often in
Kael, and the change in charm is a very annoying consequence, but by no means is
it the end all for fighting in that area. Was the see invis in this zone changed
when this code went in? The reason I ask is because the see invis guards near
the arena no longer see invis.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">When the real fix
goes in will we be able to charm the giants just like before?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Please respond via
email if you don't via the board. I really hate sending comments and never
getting any answers to my questions.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Players get those warnings so
they will know that they are doing something wrong. That's what the warnings are
for. If we assumed that the player knew he was breaking the rules, then we
wouldn't issue warnings at all, we'd just ban them.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Because warnings establish
patterns. If someone is prone to cursing in public channels, then we want to
know about it the next time that person is reported for cursing in public
channels. If someone is warned once about abusing a safe spot, we want to know
that when he does it again.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That sounds harsh, but it's not
really. Most people that play will never get a warning. And most that are warned
and told that fighting from a safe spot is wrong never do it again and don't
have any problems. But if we don't issue warnings then players might not know
that they are breaking a rule and we won't be able to get rid of people that
cheat.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Remember, no warnings were issued
over any of these aggro bug issues.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Those guards not seeing invisible
is also a bug, expect that to be fixed next patch too.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, we'll be reverting most of
the giants to their old status with the patch. Some will remain uncharmable, but
not very many and mostly merchants.</font>

message boards.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In your last post
a player made a comment about how it takes player exploit before you fix a bug.
I found it unreasonable that you dodged the underlying question. I believe the
intent of that player was to complain about the fact that existing bugs are
almost entirly ignored until people find a way to use it to their advantage.
There exist many bugs that have no exploitable factors (because they are broken
beyond use) that have been around since the creation of the game. If we found a
way to exploit the ability to agro Pain and Suffering in certain zones it would
be fixed next patch. If penalty levels caused people to /petition hundreds of
times a day you would pay attention. If the bug that makes your hat dissappear
when an illusion wears off caused you to become invincible there would be an
emergency patch. However, instead of fixing these things we get updates to the
manual and silly games like gems.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The accusations of
you of acting like an out of control gm is because most exploitable bugs are
discovered when rare encounters are pulled off more easily then you intended and
you take action. If this problem was only being exploited in West Commonlands
then it would never be discovered and if it was there would most likly be no
action because its low on the radar.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Why not give us
some legitimate bug fixes instead of new buggy code that nobody asked for.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's a hard appearance to avoid
or to dispel.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You are right, most notable
exploitable bugs are discovered when rare encounters are pulled off more easily
than intended. That is because most bugs are caught in-house and never make it
to a live server. The ones that do tend to be the ones that can only be
discovered by the intense scrutiny of a few thousand dedicated players. And when
we fix those bugs the fix is usually accompanied by a reaction similar to the
one we're seeing now about Kael.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The reality is a little different
than the appearance.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've known about and have been
working on the pet aggro thing for a while, long before our change to Kael. Our
schedule for fixing it hasn't really changed because of anything done in Kael.
It's a bug, and it's being fixed.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are just as likely to take a
similar action for a bug that is causing problems for the player. But nobody
talks about those. If charming things in Kael was causing the charmer to
suddenly explode, we could do something similar to what we did here and make it
so that charm can't be cast in the city. But players would stop charming things
in Kael even if we didn't change the code in that case. And if we turned off
charm in the zone to keep player characters from exploding there wouldn't be a
big ruckus about it. Most players wouldn't hear a word about it (except from
those that had exploded – they'd have a right to complain…).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If a bug like this was being
abused in West Commons and we heard about it, we'd take the same action. But you
are right, if we don't hear about it, we can't fix it. There is a tendency for
folks to not tell us about things that are broken in their favor. I guess that's
human nature. And maybe that's where the sense of conflict comes from. We want
to fix all the bugs. But people are more inclined to tell us about the ones that
affect them negatively and not the ones that make things easier for them.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I understand that it's probably
easier to see a bug that affects you negatively than one that helps you. And
most certainly in this case there was plenty of poor communication on our part
to make things worse. Again, I'm sorry about that.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But that doesn't mean that this
isn't a bug. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't fix it. And that doesn't mean
that we should allow people to use a bug to their benefit. Though maybe it's
really the last part that some players disagree with us about, and maybe that's
where the accusations of pettiness come in.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we feel that it's important
that bugs don't affect the game one way or the other. We're always going to be
upset when we let a bug into the game. But we're not going to be upset when
someone accomplishes something in game. I can't stress this enough, but we build
these encounters to be used, not to be impossible. And we want people to do the
hard things in game. But at the same time we want those things to be
accomplished without the use of bugs.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don't know that I can explain it
any better than that.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And, well, Auric and I put a lot
of work into that manual…</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Speaking of pet
agro, when will it be fixed? i'm still going trough about 10 times more
malachite than i once was. honestly my pet got me DT'd in PoA yesterday because
of pet agro. I was /assisting the Keeper of Souls to DS whoever he happened to
be hitting, and out of about 15-20 tanks almost all of which were 50+ the KoS
was beating on my poor little air pet Jabober. As much of a help as this is
becuase pets are easier to replace than tanks are, i'd like it to be fixed so in
a seb group i'm not using the 15+ malachite per day that i'm using now.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hopefully we'll get it with the
patch next week.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;There are
  times when we aren't aware of a bug until a few hundred thousand people start
  looking for them.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Not to be hyper
critical, but I think this statement in a nutshell gets to the heart of why
people are frustrated with Verant. We're not looking for bugs, we're just trying
to play the game. Everytime something doesn't work out like you thought it
would, doesn't mean someone was trying to thwart your efforts.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's absolutely true, when
something doesn't work like we though it would that doesn’t immediately imply
that someone is trying to thwart out efforts. And we're not saying they are.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are, however, people that
would rather use a bug than report it. Those people are trying to thwart our
efforts. Our 'efforts' in this case are to eliminate bugs.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But there are also plenty of
people that are just playing and when something works well they have no way of
knowing that it is a bug that makes it work so well. And we don't expect players
to know everything that is and is not a bug.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your message seems to imply that
we've taken some sort of action against players that were using this bug. We
have not. We've prevented it from being used in one zone until we can get it
fixed, that's all.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Though it may not
pertain to many of us, we sometimes want to know what the heck you are talking
about. Can you explain what the exploit and bug were? Since its gone now anyway.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don't really want to detail any
bug that still exists in game. It's not gone yet, and Kael isn't the only place
it could be used, it's just the place where it can be used most effectively.</font>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Most of
  you are aware that there is still a bit of a bug with the way pets work in the
  aggro code.&quot;</font>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Until this moment,
no one I know was aware the pet problems were actual bugs, and not intended by
Verant. The current pet aggro code is the result of a re-patch to repair a
problem introduced several patches ago. There have been a couple patches since
then, and the aggro code has not changed. How are we to know that Verant
considers these bugs?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Since Verant has
not announced that the pet aggro code was bugged, I do not feel that anyone
using the current aggro can be considered to be exploiting.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The dictionary
definition of exploit is &quot;To make use of selfishly or unethically.&quot; It
is arguable that any tactic that kills any MOB is inherently selfish since
killing a MOB denies it to everyone else, so the only relevant aspect of this
definition is the &quot;unethically&quot; part. The only way someone can do
something unethical is with prior knowledge of a standard. Since Verant has
never announced that pet aggro was bugged, then no one could know that using pet
aggro features was abuse.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">We don't have the
benefit of a &quot;list of bugs&quot; that you in Verant do. Unless you tell us,
we can never know if one thing is a bug, or working as planned. Please don't
assume that we know things are bugs unless you have alerted us to the fact.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You are correct.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And that is exactly why we chose
to turn off the ability to 'exploit' this bug and have taken no action against
those that were using it. Because it's easy to see how a player might not have
known there was still a bug, we are assuming that nobody did, and therefore we
aren't accusing anyone of any wrongdoing. If I somehow implied that, I'm sorry.
That wasn't my intent. I certainly didn't use the word 'exploit' in my post, for
exactly that reason.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Why is it that on
a continous basis players have to use a change VI makes to their advantage
before it is considered a bug? While necromancers and mages has been complaining
since the agro change patch (June?) that pets over agro. Something that has been
fixed in several patches since then with little to no change. Yet, now a guild
managed to use this change (not a bug as you said, but an INTENTIONAL, and
announced, change on your part how pets work), it is instantly changed so the
tactic can not be used.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">May I suggest
using some sort of version control software and revert the changes back to how
it was before the pet agro change? Seems to me that would change the problem in
Kael.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is where a lot of the
confusion seems to occur.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've been aware of and working on
the pet aggro bug since the last patch where we thought we had it fixed (which,
as others have pointed out, was July 10th). We haven't increased our work on
fixing the bug because of anything going on in Kael. Sometimes it just takes a
while to nail down and fix something like this, especially when so much else is
going on.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for players having to 'use a
change' we make to their advantage before we'll consider it a bug, that is
indeed sometimes the case. There are times when we aren't aware of a bug until a
few hundred thousand people start looking for them. Yes, when we find players
doing something using a function of the game engine that we hadn't anticipated,
we have to evaluate it and see what we think.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us imagine that there was a
weapon that proc'ed a new spell effect that turned the enemy purple. Internally
we test that weapon and find that it does indeed turn the enemy purple. We also
test it in combats here and there and nothing odd happens. After all, it only
turns someone purple, how much trouble could it cause. So it goes in game.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then players find it. At first
only a few have it and they use it rarely. After all, it only turns enemies
purple. But when more of them come into the game, someone uses it against a snow
orc. He's already purple. So maybe the spell code decides that if something is
already purple, it will become invisible when affected by this new spell.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ok, not likely, but this is just
an example.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We hear about it. Now, this is
obviously a bug, the intent was not that the weapon would make snow orcs
invisible. But we could decide that it is indeed a feature and leave it in.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But until we know that this weapon
makes snow orcs invisible, we can't make that decision.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So there are certainly times when
we declare something a bug only after players discover something. If the sword
instantly killed any purple enemy every time it proc'ed, then calling it a bug
might appear to be taking some 'clever' trick away from the players. In reality,
it's still a bug.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The pet aggro thing is a bug. The
fact that players have found a way to use it to their advantage doesn't make it
less of a bug. And it still needs fixing.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My only request is
that you overcommunicate major changes like this, particularly if they are done
in a hurry. It is critical that the player base have a sense that things are
done for a reason and not whimsically.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, we most certainly should
have mentioned the change. But you and I could probably debate the notion of
'major changes'. This is one zone among more than 100. The change is only going
to affect a small number of players, and only for a short time. I don't
disagree, we should have mentioned it. But this isn't any sort of major change.</font>

won't give away why it isn't) after all, you need 80+ people to kill him,
expecting to loose an excrutiating amount of experience due to the 7 or 8
deaths.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2) Wouldn't it be
far easier to buff up the Avatar of war in the interim, Which won't annoy some
of the smaller folks who charming is not a luxury but a neccessity in kael. I'm
sure if you gave it the ability to complete heal, or gave it an AoE less people
would be able to undertake it. Because after all, even though these people
&quot;may&quot; have been exploiting with regards to the avatar of war 99.99% of
the people who are in kael are there to kill it.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">3) If my statement
above is correct as i think it is about the firepower and number of corpses, and
lets assume you wanted it to be harder, I'd hate to think of exactly how hard it
would be to take down....</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Anyways, i'm not
personally bothered by this at all it's just i personally think this change will
adversly affect the vast majority when only trying to stop the vast minority if
you see what i'm getting at )</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If we wanted something to be
unkillable, it would be unkillable. I've read a lot of accusations on the
Internet and comments to the Developer's Corner that we are like a bunch of
pre-teen D&amp;D Dungeon Masters that take the death of some NPC or another
personally and feel the need to strike back.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is, frankly, a load of …</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've certainly made some NPCs
very hard. That was intentional. But we're not going to take anything personally
about the death of that NPC. Not only is that just silly, but it's not a very
reasonable assumption.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Keep in mind that we aren't a team
of one person. There are a bunch of us here. Things like the change to Kael
aren't up to one person to do. A designer and a coder, minimally, would be
needed to make the changes we made to Kael. If this mythical juvenile game
designer were actually working here, he'd have no chance to affect his petty
changes.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, we put a lot of effort and
thought into creating the zones, NPCs and quests for players to experience. And,
yes, there is a sense of pride when something is done well. But we build this
stuff to be interacted with, not just be looked at. We want players to
experience the content that the team slaved so hard to build.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And the assumption that this
change is only about the Avatar of War is misguided. The problem in Kael extends
to any NPC in that zone, not just the big ones.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Regardless, we don't want the
Avatar of War to be harder than he was intended to be. We just want him to be as
hard as he was intended to be. There's no real reason for the challenge level of
any given content to be changed by a bug.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nobody is forcing anyone to try to
kill him. There's nothing wrong with an NPC being exceptionally hard to kill. We
build the encounters. It's up to you to decide if you want to tackle them. And,
well, heck – he is the Avatar of War. He's the essence of combat. He's
supposed to be extremely powerful.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Two small notes:
It sounds like you are misusing the word 'bug'. A 'bug' is different from a
design problem. The charm code works normally. The pet code works normally.
Everything works like it's supposed to, but you think it's unbalancing, so that
would be a design problem, not a bug, right?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">And secondly, it
seems to most of us non-ubers that you are focusing 85% of resources and
planning on 10% of the population. Time and time again, the most powerful groups
in the game do something which you think abuses the game design somehow, and
your reaction is to make that tactic impossible in order to protect the game.
I'm all for protecting the game, but the high-level game is already too hard for
everyone who isn't in an uberguild.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Maybe you should
just start putting in situations and NPCs to DIRECTLY counter large groups of
uber folk. Spawn a GM controlled (or normal) ubermob to specifically frustrate
ubergroups doing things you want to prevent. Heck, just pop unmezzable,
uncharmable high HP mobs randomly in the zone anytime an adventure zone gets
more than 10 lvl 56+s.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You're right. Charm works as
intended. Pets do what they are supposed to do. But the aggro code is not
working as intended. This is, indeed, a bug.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As to your second point, we're
not. In the same period that we made the change to Kael we've also done a few
dozen other things. This apparent focus on the higher level stuff isn't coming
from us. We make similar changes to things that come about from issues with
lower level characters. But it's the players with the higher level characters
that are also the more vocal.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The interesting thing here is that
this &quot;tactic&quot; was only made possible by a bug in the code that we
managed to add while trying to adjust something. This is a new thing, something
that just didn't exist a few months ago. And yet, somehow, our attempts to
return the code to something more like normal, like it was a few months ago, is
now being called a 'nerf'…</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even more unfortunately, is that
everyone seems to be ignoring the fact that the bug fix will be beneficial to
pet classes all over the place. And, though I'm still receiving comments about
that, the focus is suddenly all on the assumption that we're ruining a tactic
used on a very few high level raid situations.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end, this is a bug fix. The
&quot;tactic&quot; that we will be removing has only been possible because of
this bug. The one does not exist without the other.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Any chance there
will some explanation of why giants in Kael can no longer be charmed ? Seems odd
that the zone would come down out of the blue and giants no longer charmable.
Crowd control ? I personally think it was a bad move since giants cannot be
charmed... and I have an idea it was due to Avatar of War being killed, but I'm
sure if a comment was made it would clear things up.. Thanks!</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'll do my best to explain the
situation.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Most of you are aware that there
is still a bit of a bug with the way pets work in the aggro code. In Kael there
are a lot of NPCs that can be charmed that are significantly more powerful than
any pet. Some folks were using this combination of bug and situation to make
encounters much more trivial than they were intended to be.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fixing the bug will require a full
patch, and a largish one at that. We weren't willing to make a large emergency
patch, taking down all the servers and requiring all that downtime for our
customers to fix a bug being abused in one zone.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This left us with pretty much
three options.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">1) Allow folks to continue to use
the bug to their advantage.<br>
2) Begin punishing people for using the bug until it could be patched.<br>
3) Remove the ability to use the bug in the situation where it was most abusable,
Kael, and then fix the bug with the next patch and remove the temporary fix.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We chose the third option.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We don't want people using bugs to
their advantage. We feel that it harms the game integrity and the gameplay of
those that don't use bugs to their advantage. We couldn't take option one.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We could choose option two, but
policing such things requires resources, and banning people isn't something we
like to do. This is a new bug, and perhaps people were unsure that it is indeed
a bug. And in most circumstances this bug only changes the play style of some
people. Only in a few circumstances does this bug become abusable. So fixing the
specific circumstance is better than giving warnings to players.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know the next question, and let
me answer it right now. This is a new bug, and it could be argued with some
conviction that players using it to their advantage were unaware that it wasn't
purposeful code change. In the case of the abuse of safe zones, it is well known
that using such locations is against our rules. It can't be reasonably argued
that any player with a character over 50th level doesn't understand that.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In any case, we plan to fix the
bug with the next patch. Until then, the NPCs in Kael will probably remain
uncharmable. We understand that this adversely affects single and double group
raids in that zone, and for that we are sorry. But things should be back to
normal soon. Assuming anyone knows what normal is anyway…</font>
