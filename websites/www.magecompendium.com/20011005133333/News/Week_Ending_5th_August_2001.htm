<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, don't worry - I'm still here <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'll probably be doing them every 1-2 weeks or
so.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Currently, yes, we do
plan on turning the Trivial Loot Code on for all Luclin zones on all servers.
Keep in mind that Luclin will have zones for levels 1-60, and we hope the
Trivial Code will allow us to put some pretty enticing and powerful items in the
lower and mid level zones without fear that some higher level players will
bottom feed there.&quot;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">What you are saying here is
that for those of us with high-level characters, much of Luclin will be wasted
space.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, yes and no. You're still welcome to go
there, but if you're too high level for a given area, you won't be able to loot
most treasure from the NPCs there. I'm sorry you feel this makes the space
'wasted' for you, but often lower and mid level players feel zones that were
designed for them are somewhat wasted when higher level players are there
monopolizing the area at no risk to themselves.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Content with trivial combat
code might as well not exist for us, because we have no reason to go there.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is the point, yes <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">And no, we're not going to
start new characters to go there. We didn't fight our way into the 50s just so
we could go back to looking at our spellbooks for another 35 levels.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">What's the point of making an
expansion with a huge KEEP OUT sign on it?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">- Venture, Outrider, E'ci</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While you and I'm sure some others might not
want to make another character, we do know a few things:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. There are still a LOT of players who are in
the low to mid levels with their first characters.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. There are a LOT of players who have multiple
characters they play concurrently, often at all different levels, from low to
mid to high.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. There are a LOT of players who want to start
a new Vah Shir Beastlord (or any other class, for that matter) and enjoy the
content designed for them without fear of high-level players interfering with
that enjoyment.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm sorry if this is frustrating or unappealing
to you, but in the end, we think implementing the Trivial Loot Code in Luclin
will make EverQuest a better game overall.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Hey Brad, just a quick question
that has me a little bit concerned with the Character Transfer services.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I realize that spells are being
transferred, but not items (when changing servers). My question involves epics.
I would assume that Warriors, Clerics, Wizards, etc. do not get to keep their
epics. What about magicians? Their epic is a summoned item, and therefore a
spell that would normally be transferred. This hardly seems fair.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">If I had been the only person
on my server with the Mage epic, then another mage transferred over with his, I
would be, to say the least, upset.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">That's about it, glad you are
doing this for all of us <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Daabu Zugzugg <TRIAD Continuum>
<br>
55 Troll Myrmidon<br>
Luclin</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a very good point, and honestly, it's
not entirely fair. Because the Mage Epic Item is tied to a spell, they'll still
have access to it after a character transfer. We debated this for a bit and
decided that, overall, it would be best not to go into characters' spellbooks
and change the data there. We're sorry it's not totally fair but the alternative
could have been very messy and we decided in the best interests of everyone to
keep the transfers simple: spells transfer, but items don't.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have two questions...</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">If all the zones in the new SoL
expansion contain the new trivial loot codes how will this effect higher levels
try to do quests for faction or for an item? I know on the proposed RP sever you
are thinking of making all items tradable since the trivial codes will be server
wide but what about the SoL zones on the regular servers ?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Trivial Loot Code isn't complete and we're
continuing to improve it. By the time SoL launches we should be able to mark or
flag items such that we can override the Loot Code if we desire. In other words,
given that the new looting rules are known by the game designers from the
beginning, they are populating the new zones with that code and functionality in
mind. And they will have the flexibility to set up quest components and/or other
items to use all, part, or none of the new Loot Code.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Ok. My important question for
you is when the SoL expansion comes out will ANY of the faces that we can choose
be smiling?!? I am a bard and I hate traveling the world looking like my dog
just died! Please let there be joy across the land I beg you!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Zedia</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don't know if they'll be smiling by default,
but one of the cool features of the new character models is that we can animate
the faces such that many /emotes will be visible and not just text. In other
words, /smile should make your character visibly smile <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">G'Day Brad!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Just wondering if SoL will made
available world-wide at the same time or made available for downloading via the
web from an E-Store?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Sometimes, living Downunder, we
don't get access to new releases at the same time as the States and it can be
months before we can buy retail copies.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Cerrin</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">P.S. I would also like to
enquire on SW:G - will it be released world-wide at the same time ?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think with each release we're getting better
and better with the international launches. We have some great partners who help
us with international distribution, and we definitely want the international
street dates on SoL to be as close to the domestic release dates as possible.
And I will continue to work with our VP of Sales to that end.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for SW:G, LucasArts will be handling
distribution and marketing, not us, but they are certainly every bit as capable
as we are (if not moreso <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">
) of releasing product internationally.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Brad,</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I found it interesting that you
originally envisioned multiple-mob fights as opposed to single-pulling. Is this
what area effect spells were meant for as well? It seems that these spells are
only used for quadkiting (and I'd be amazed if anyone ever uses the Al'Kabor
spells at all).</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I agree that multi-mob fights
would be a lot more fun and I hope that you find a good way to implement them.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">BJ from Torvonnilous</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thanks for the feedback on multi-mob fights,
and you're right, that was the original intent behind the AoE spells. They've
not been as viable as we've wanted them for a variety of reasons (mob pulling,
framerate, and other balance issues), but we did originally want them to be an
integral part of high level combat.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Hey Brad, what's your Fav novel
of all time ?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don't think I can choose just one, but my
favorite series of novels is definitely the Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Also, with the coming expansion
do you foresee any option being added to turn off environmental effects. By
environmental effects I mean the swaying trees and bushes in Kunark + Velious.
The only way I can run through Dreadlands and Warslik Wood is by cranking clip
ALL the way down. My machine handles EQ fine except when in large outdoor zone
with these effects and I, along with many others, don't have the cash to buy a
$400 card. Thx</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Folok SOlot<br>

Drinal</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Actually, it's really somewhat of a myth that
the animated trees in Kunark and Velious cause a significant framerate hit. It's
really just the density of trees and other objects as well as how many polygons
were used to create the objects (both of which were significantly higher in
Kunark and Velious than they were in the old world). Animation really isn't very
costly because most if not all of the scene in a 3D renderer has to be
re-rendered every frame anyway.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The best solution is to, as you mentioned,
crank down the clip plane, which will give the graphics engine less polygons to
draw. Also, with Luclin, we'll be introducing some new technology (Umbra) which
more efficiently decides what to draw and what not to draw based on what the
player can see from his vantage point. The great news is that Umbra will also
work with all of the other zones in the game (old world, Kunark, and Velious),
giving players both better framerates and also the ability to push their
clipping plane further away.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Hi Brad,</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Column is great. It's nice to
see you're so forward and honest in your posts =)</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Now for my question, or rather,
a suggestion. I'd really like to see more use of the in-game (at-login) polling
system. While I respect you in-house testers, I feel the players should have
more of a voice in what really is &quot;our world&quot; since we all help pay
for it =P</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Bye =)</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">- Az</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There was a time a few months back when we were
conducting a lot of polls and gathering quite a bit of data, but it's really
tapered off (mostly because we ran out of ideas for questions and mined the data
we were looking for). If you all would like to send me some questions you'd like
to see the entire player base polled on, send them to me, and I'll try to get a
few up. And then later I'll post the results.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I was wondering if crafted
items could be stamped with the name of their creators. Something simple that
can be seen on the stats page when you right click the item, &quot;This bow was
crafted by Surefoot&quot;, for example.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It would be interesting to
track crafted items as they circulate by crafters names. It could also add value
(or depreciation) to items based on the crafters reputation.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">If this is too late to
implement in the current EQ, I can understand. I'm hoping this can be considered
for future games.</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's a great idea and certainly something very
popular in other MMORPGs. Unfortunately, the way our items work in EQ make
coding such customization pretty involved and difficult so I don't think you'll
see similar features any time soon. But, I also wouldn't rule it out for all
time either.</font>

able to journey, in some form, to Takish Hiz of the past ?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">That's something I'd really
like to be able to do.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In some of the comments I've
seen about SoL, they say that there are remnants of the Combine Empire up there.
If anyone could have figured out a mode of time travel it would have been them.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Either portals from Combine
held parts of Luclin to a few zones like Takish Hiz, or as a new expansion to
redesign or repopulate some zones to an earlier time. Redesigned and repopulated
zones would be accessed from Luclin also. I'm sure that Al-Kabor would
eventually figure out how to use the power of the spires to travel in time(port
spells).</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The content level for these
zones would be of a very high nature. The Combine Empire, in it's prime, and the
non-cursed versions of Orcs, Antonican Giants, and Goblins would make for some
truly deadly foes or powerful allies.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While I doubt you'll be able to travel through
time in the EverQuest we know today, as we transition EverQuest into a franchise
in the future, you never know what historical periods might be explored. It's
definitely an interesting idea - fantasy novels have certainly been set in the
same universe before but at very different time periods.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">As a side note :</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">An area of the wall in Oasis
near the Orc Highway looks like a zone line. Will we ever see a zone added here?<br>
<br>
Could it possibly be the ruins of Takish Hiz?</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Perhaps the Elven magics that
have kept people from entering is wearing thin.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I don't know if you are or may
be considering something like this, but please (/em begs profusely) no frogs or
dogs <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif">.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are definitely adding new zones to the game,
filling in lots of areas in the Old World that hadn't been accessible in the
past (for example, the Stonebrunt Mountains will be Live soon). Will one of
those one day be Takish Hiz ? It's certainly possible.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">- Asklepios_DD</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Currently, yes, we do

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This does not prevent high
levels from getting items at all. People that play 2 accounts have an easy time
of getting the items if they want them. So unless you have a trival code that
checks to see if so-and-so has armor/weapons designed for lvl50+ on or as lvl49
buffs on this code only hurts the normal gamer.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">- Engelica</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As I mentioned earlier, we do plan on making
the Trivial Loot Code better and better. Several of our ideas do indeed include
scaling buffs and other enchantments as well as better refining our soft level
limits such that twinking out a low level character and then escorting him with
a high level character won't be nearly as advantageous.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I've been playing EQ for a long
time now, and I think its an amazing game. I've been extremely impressed with
the high amount of detail and animation in the game, the size and number of
animated items in a zone - and yet my 56.6 modem doesn't cause me any lag
issues. This game is a smoother ride than any online game I've played!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">So my question (yep there was
one there, not just to compliment ye) is this: Have you ever given a thought to
making a non-online EQ game? Something that uses the game engine and world, but
is a play at home game? It's something that I would love to see - while I do get
online sometimes to play I like to just play a one player game. I would love to
buy a single player EQ game, and wander the realms. Just pump in some more NPCs,
add in allies to join you in your quest (like in other computer RPGs), and you'd
be good to go.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">What do you think ?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">- Nexhus</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've definitely given it some thought, and we
like the idea. It would also be a great way to explore and establish a lot of
the backstory and history of Norrath. Beyond agreeing that's it's a great idea,
however, there's nothing I can really announce.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Hi Brad.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have a question regarding the
evolution of EQ, and an idea which has been implemented by other MMORPGs
recently. One of the newest (and I think greatest) ideas being implemented in
the MMORPGs of your competitors is the use of dynamically generated zones. When
a character or group of characters receive a quest from an NPC and enter the
appropriate zone to complete that quest, upon entering, the zone becomes
exclusive to the group. Other groups can enter the same zone, but it will then
co-exist and the OTHER groups zone will be exclusive to them.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I'm sure there is no need for
this long winded explanation, as I'm sure you follow the design decisions of
your competitors very closely. My question is: do you plan to implement this
system in EQ in the future? Would it even be possible to retrofit such a system
into the present EQ code?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It certainly seems to be the
answer to the camping problem. It would allow much more freedom to tailor
certain dungeons and quests. It would seem to combine the best of both worlds,
so to speak, between the massively multiplayer games such as EQ and the smaller
scale Multiplayer games such as the upcoming NeverWinter Nights. Honestly, I
fail to see a downside of such a system. What are your thoughts?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Thanks for your time, and Best
Regards</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">- Camenwolf</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are many ways to approach implementing
content in massively multiplayer games, but I will try to explain why I don't
like random content in general and why it's really not compatible with EQ's
Vision.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To me, dynamically generating
content/zones/adventure areas would risk losing a lot of the hand-crafted and
immersive feel you find in the world of Norrath. We are very proud that each and
every zone was put together by hand and that, hopefully, they each have a
personality. The more random or automated the process is, the less compelling
and creative it is, in my opinion. And while our priority is to make a great
game, it's also a goal of ours to create a real virtual world, like those you've
read of in the great fantasy novels out there. Certainly, for example, I don't
think the Mines of Moria in the Lord of the Rings would have been nearly as
interesting were they the product of 'randomized dwarf passages' strewn
together. Instead, Tolkien made us believe such a place could be real, and
intricately described the setting to us in both a fantastic AND believable way.
My dream and vision is to eventually make virtual worlds as detailed as those
Tolkien and others have described, and quite frankly, I don't see how we can get
there by succumbing to the allure of random and dynamically generated content
(even if it does make it easier and faster to develop).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for making zones exclusive to the player or
group of players assigned to a quest, I also feel that's incompatible with EQ's
vision. Despite some problems with camping and criticisms that EQ 'forces'
interdependence upon players, I think a shared world has really helped build
community and relationships within the game. Having to deal with annoying or
disruptive players can certainly be a problem, but then how many times have you
met somebody new because they helped you (or you helped them) out of a bad
situation in the depths of a dungeon? Again, I believe it makes the virtual
world more immersive and better suspends disbelief if the adventure area you're
in is actually attached and part of the world, accessible by all. I really think
that taking the 'massively multiplayer' out of the MMOG because having other
players around can be problematic does less to fix the game then it does to
change the game into another genre of game altogether.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These are just my opinions, however, and why
they're not compatible with what we want EverQuest to be. It's one of our strict
policies not to comment negatively about our competition and there's plenty of
room in this emerging genre for all sorts of approaches. Ultimately it's the
game players' opinions that count, and one should choose a game with the style,
features, and game mechanics that work best for them personally. Heck, play them
all and make your decision accordingly <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Hi Brad,</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I've been playing EverQuest for
a limited amount of time now, and there's one thing which boggled my mind pretty
much from the first time my poor necro managed to summon a pet, and then loose
it cos he walked across a zone boundary.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Why DO pets vanish at the
boundary ? Is it a balance issue, or are/were there technical reasons.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both technical and balance issues, really. It
is more difficult to pass an NPC (which pets are) from one zone to another, but
it is possible (for example, boats are really NPCs, and they move zone to zone).
But we also wanted character classes with pets to have to summon pets every once
in a while instead of them being persistent - it allows for different types of
pets to be summoned and with some variation of their attributes, etc. So in that
it was difficult to have them zone in the first place, it sort of made sense to
use that as one of the mechanisms by which the player would need to summon
another pet.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">All that said, it looks like we might have
'familiars' in Luclin, which are really persistent pets that would indeed stay
with you when you zone.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This, of course, leads to a
second question: Why do mobs stop at a zone boundary. Again, is it for technical
reasons, or was it intended for the players to be able to run to safety by
moving into a neighboring zone ?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, both. By making zones more
self-contained it was and is easier to balance them. Knowing that NPCs stop at
zones allows us to put the world together with a more modular approach. And, as
I said earlier, it is more difficult to have NPCs zone, although they can (for
example, I heard recently that after a very powerful dragon was unleashed it
traveled to several zones, slaying its enemies all over the face of Norrath).</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Lastly, are either
characteristics likely to change with upcoming patches? I mean, the idea of
having a char being chased through a larger area by a group of angry Orcs has a
certain appeal to me. (Ok, I know *my* poor necro would die a lot more often if
that would happen)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Probably not, except for very special
encounters. Making a significant change to how NPCs stay or don't stay within
zones would change the game so radically that it probably wouldn't be a very
good idea this late into release.</font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Brad,</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A lot of us remember the
nightmare that resulted when Kunark was shipped last year. How is shipping and
distribution of the new expansion SoL going to be handled? Will we all need to
pre order it again or will we be able to go pick it up at our local computer
store?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Turvok Trueheart<br>
Veeshan</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think most would agree that Velious was
handled a lot better, and it's our plan to sell and distribute Luclin primarily
the same way. It should be in stores in December and there should be plenty of
boxes for everyone who's interested in purchasing it.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Got a bunch of stuff jumbled
all together here, please bear with me.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">First off, design questions
about the basic game. When you chose a &quot;Class-Based&quot; character
development/creation schema over one that was &quot;Skill-Based&quot;, what
factored into that decision?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Primarily the desire to foster interdependence.
Relying on others in order to do things not only builds community it also allows
us to make mid and high level combat and adventure very tactical in nature. We
really wanted to avoid the 'tank-mage syndrome', where one player could be the
'jack of all trades'. That, and it's easier to balance a class-based system than
it is a skill-based system because of its inherent restrictions.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">What methods/tactics/theories
of (valid) game play have developed that you predicted? That surprised you? I'm
not talking about cheating, but &quot;legal&quot; methods of dealing with MoB's
and encounters.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, we definitely set out to create a game
that was easy to get into but became very involved later on. And watching
several groups work together to slay a high level mob and all the strategies and
tactics involved, I'd say we pulled it off pretty well. But as I've mentioned in
past Ask Brads and elsewhere, tactics such as pulling, camping, and kiting were
not part of the original plan. So we've definitely been surprised on many
occasions by the player base and their resourcefulness (which, all things
considered, is a good thing).</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Did you anticipate the
&quot;Big Three&quot; scenario of Kunark ? (The prevalent theory that you must
have a Warrior, Cleric and Enchanter to deal with high-level game play in Kunark)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Honestly, no. We thought that there would be a
place for both 'generalists' and 'specialists'. But it turns out that some
groups and guilds are so concerned with being as efficient as possible that they
sometimes exclude the 'generalists' in the high end of the game. This is indeed
unfortunate, and were we starting over we'd probably make more core roles and
then have the classes share those roles more equally. That said, I also don't
think it's a problem of apocalyptic proportions. Hybrids and other
non-specialist classes still get groups at high levels, are very productive
guild members, and have a blast playing EQ from 1-60. It's just that sometimes
in some situations they can be more frustrated than the core classes when
dealing with extreme min/max'ers.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">What are some of the more &quot;crazy&quot; ideas that
fell by the wayside during the early stages of EQ's development? Kunark ?
Velious ?</font></font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Heh, well, one would be getting Kunark and
Velious done by the first release with as much detail and content as we wanted.
Other 'crazy' ideas included Guild Houses and Horses. Honestly, though, there
aren't that many - all in all we pretty much made the game we set out to. And
with Kunark and Velious there were even less ideas that didn't make it in
because we knew so much more about the game, the tools we had, and how long it
took to implement features and build content.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Ok, I'm going to preface this
next section with a &quot;This is not a complaint&quot; clause. Actually, this
is to answer complaints.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">When a quest or tradeskill
formula is deemed to be &quot;broken&quot;, why does it take the amount of time
that it does to &quot;fix&quot; it?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">For example, Fleeting Quivers.
The recipe was left out of the game for a long time, and suddenly it worked.
Elven cultural armor, the Greenmist Saga Quest for Iksar SK's, etc. These are
all things players have believed to be broken for some time now.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Is it that :</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">a) They've been fixed and
nobody knows it?<br>
b) They haven't been fixed because there simply hasn't been time to make the
changes in the database.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">(I'm theorizing here, but I
imagine tradeskills and quests work the same way. A+B+C=Result. I'm guessing
that when you hand in items, or press the combine button, the program goes to
the database and says &quot;I've got This, and This, and This. Does this produce
anything?&quot; and if it does, you get the result. Just guessing, for all I
know it could be hardcoded into the server software.)</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">c) the decision has been made
not to &quot;fix&quot; them at this point because certain game balance/item
balance issues haven't been worked out.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I'm sure most of us would be
just interested in the process, as much as you can divulge without giving away
&quot;trade secrets&quot;, so to speak.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, they're in a database and it works
similarly to how you describe it. The answer to your question is probably mostly
'b' and some 'c'. We're always juggling limited resources (those being both
people and time), and decisions have to be made in terms of where to devote
those resources. Sometimes problems and bugs are missed, and some other times
they're known but pretty low on the priority list of things to accomplish. We
also have to balance fixing and enhancing existing content with the demand for
fresh and new content. And we try very hard to work on both.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Are we going to see some
&quot;official&quot; screenies from SoL anytime soon? The images of photos taken
of screens at E3 are kinda bad and boring. Please, whet our appetite a bit. And,
if you're brave enough, let the playerbase help you out with design questions.
I.e. If you're not sure whether or not Armor A looks better than Armor B, post a
poll. Let the readers vote.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Absolutely. You should see them pop up on news
sites as well as in magazines over the next few months, and we certainly have
some surprises up our sleeves. And we definitely listen to the feedback we get
(for example, we've made some changes to the new Gnome based on feedback we've
received).</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Just a top-of-my head idea.
Last question, I promise. If it's not giving too much away...With the improved
graphics engine, will, banded by way of example, look much the same on every
race? Granted, the &quot;structure&quot; of the armor will be different, because
Trolls have a different body type from Iksar, but will the textures be
consistent? Well, thanks for listening.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, the current plan is to have them look
different across the races. There are, of course, arguments for and against. Our
feelings are that while it might be more consistent to have them look the same,
we also feel characters have more opportunity to look different than other
players if there are more texture sets than less.</font>
