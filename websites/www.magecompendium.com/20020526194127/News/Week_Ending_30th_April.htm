<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've discussed the issue of NPCs binding
recently. It's been a bit of a recurring topic, and we've firmly decided against
allowing it. There are a number of reasons, only one of which is the economy of
lower level casters. For example, we want to encourage people to meet each
other, and giving everyone a reason to come to the cities is a good way to do
that.</font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I'm going to take a
moment here to eat some crow and commend Verant on Kunark.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Kunark is split into two
apects: Levels past 50, and the Kunark zones. Both have been extremely well
done, and both exhibit an intellegence and creativity that your past work didn't
even hint at. The new kunark zones and the amazing capabilities of characters
past level 50 make the rest of the game pale in comparison.<br>
<br>
Now we've gotten to the subject of my post : What about the rest of the game ?
Kunark is stunning but there are still zones in the &quot;old game&quot; that
aren't even near fully utilized.<br>
<br>
Will work on the &quot;old game&quot; be abandoned in favor of doting on the new
and expensive-to-create Kunark ?<br>
<br>
Will we ever see graphical enhancements to the &quot;old game&quot; to bring it
at least a little more in-line with the current majesty of Kunark ? Will
&quot;The Hole&quot; ever open ? Will Odus ever be worth going to? Will NPC's
which previously just stood around (and there are a lot of them - the majority
in fact) saying nothing when you hailed them ever start saying things ?<br>
<br>
Will the &quot;Old Game&quot; ever be more polished than it is now, or will you
neglect it in favor of your pretty, new Kunark ?<br>
<br>
- Faxor<br>
</font><br>
First, thanks for the compliments -- Kunark was an opportunity to learn from our
mistakes and do better. And in the future, we'll top Kunark<br>
<br>
Now, to your questions.<br>
<br>
1. No, we will not be updating the graphics on the old zones. This is primarily
for two reasons: a. Resources are limited and I really think most of our
customers would rather see new content as opposed to re-doing older content, and
b., as was mentioned in this thread, it's not really appropriate to change the
system requirements on the existing lands, which upgrading the graphics
significantly would. That said, we have at least one minor way we're going to be
upgrading the original world soon.<br>
<br>
2. The 'old game' will definitely NOT be abandoned. The EQ Live team will
continue to address crowding issues by revamping the lesser used dungeons and
other zones. In addition, many of the zone mechanics that are being tried in
Kunark, should they prove successful, will be used in the older zones when they
are revamped as well.<br>
<br>
3. The Hole is still on target for May, probably late May. After the Hole comes
the Warrens, which is also on Odus. And we will continue to add free zones after
that.<br>
<br>
4. Yes, I think slowly but surely existing NPCs will be made more interesting,
possibly involved in quests and storylines.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps,<br>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hello All,<br>
<br>
Many of you have been wondering why the EverQuest Store isn't up right now, so
I'd like to take a moment to address this issue.<br>
<br>
Obviously things didn't go smoothly in regards to the shipping to many people
who bought Kunark. We're very sorry for the problems we have had.<br>
<br>
We felt that until we have completely straightened out the problems with this
process that it isn't fair to put it back up. We don't want to throw gasoline
onto a fire.<br>
<br>
We're taking the time to correct the back-end problems that caused this in the
first place. Until we're satisfied that this process is completely smooth we
won't be putting it back up.<br>
<br>
As of now we don't have an ETA, but once we feel confident that we can deliver
orders in a timely and efficent manner we will put it up. We will make sure to
keep you all informed as to our progress towards this goal.<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello
all,<br>
<br>
On behalf of the entire EverQuest Team, it is with great pride that I announce
the launch of the first EverQuest expansion – The Ruins of Kunark. This
project was a labor of love for us, and I would like to say a few things about
it for those of you who may be curious as to what it has to offer.<br>
<br>
A little more than one year in creation, The Ruins of Kunark expansion adds
breathtaking new zones, graphics, and enhanced abilities for high-level
characters. The expansion is designed to take advantage of today’s higher
performance computers, and offers an amazing and immersive visual experience,
which we hope will captivate and delight Norrath’s inhabitants. In addition to
offering amazing new vistas, The Ruins of Kunark will allow players to interact
with many new creatures and monsters, including the new player race, the darkly
enigmatic Iksar, the reptilian rulers of this forgotten continent.<br>
<br>
The team responsible for The Ruins of Kunark includes the experienced
development staff of the original EverQuest game, as well as the new EverQuest
Live Team, who will be responsible for the ongoing development and maintenance
of the game after the expansion. The Ruins of Kunark represents the fruits of
years of experience of the original staff, integrated with the fresh new ideas
of the EQ Live Team. As a team we have learned much, and grown with the help of
our players, and we feel that it shows in this product. As a result, the lands
of Kunark offer great adventure and excitement for everyone in Norrath, from
lower level players, all the way up to the 60th level characters now possible
with the purchase of the expansion.<br>
<br>
We encourage you to take ship and explore this fascinating and dangerous new
continent with us. We feel that the expansion will offer players both new and
old a truly remarkable and rewarding experience. If you are one of the many
thousands who have already opted to explore these uncharted lands, then we
eagerly look forward to seeing you there. We have made every effort with the
Ruins of Kunark expansion to provide the most compelling and complete content
possible, and we hope that you will find this addition to the continually
evolving world of Norrath to your liking.<br>
<br>
Though we expect that the launch of the expansion will proceed smoothly, we will
maintain the staff here at Verant Interactive around the clock to insure that
everything will be performing as expected. As we anticipate customers in record
number over the next few days, we ask for your understanding should any problems
arise. We will do our utmost to resolve any issues quickly, and with a minimum
of downtime or inconvenience.<br>
<br>
In closing I would like to thank our loyal players, without whom this expansion
would not be possible. We sincerely hope that you enjoy the new continent of
Kunark as much as we enjoyed creating it, and we look forward to the future of
EverQuest and hope to see you there as it unfolds.<br>
<br>
Welcome to EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark! You’re in our world now!<br>

I'd like to remind everything that corpses will not follow the account, so
everyone will want to make sure that there corpses are looted, or they will be

  Kunark Shipping News<br>
  <br>
  Due to the unfortunate problems we have had with our order processing system,
  we've implemented a refund and cancellation policy.<br>
  <br>
  For anyone who ordered Ruins of Kunark on or before Wednesday, April 19th and
  does not receive their orders by April 24th, we will be refunding their
  shipping &amp; handling costs, as well as crediting their accounts for one
  month of gameplay.<br>
  <br>
  Additionally, ANY customers that prefer may cancel their order and be issued a
  refund for the upgrade and shipping &amp; handling costs.<br>
  <br>
  We'll be taking care of these refunds or cancellations via email at <a href="mailto:kunarkrefund@verant.com" target="Main"><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000"><b>kunarkrefund@verant.com</b></span></font></a>. It will be necessary for anyone that wants to take
  advantage of either of these options to specify their choice and to send us
  your Station Name, billing name and address on the account, and the date you
  placed the order. Also, please include &quot;Kunark Refund&quot; or &quot;Kunark
  Cancellation&quot; in the subject line.<br>
  <br>
  We apologize again for the problems that have come up.<br>

  <br>
  *Patch Today*<br>
  <br>
  Today's patch (eqmain.dll) was to correct some Kunark registration problems
  for overseas customers using the new retail box. In addition, text was updated
  on the &quot;Kunark Registration&quot; page for those who upgrade using an
  account key from the retail box.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  *Iksar Factions Changing Tomorrow*<br>
  <br>
  The faction information on the live servers in reference to Iksar and how they
  interact with other factions outside Kunark is incorrect. Corrections will be
  going in tomorrow, making the Iksar KOS (Kill on Sight) to pretty much
  everything on the other continents. We normally wouldn't announce something
  like this, however we want to give Iksar who may have bound next to or near
  something that is liable to become KOS to them tomorrow a chance to get away.<br>
  <br>
  This announcement is not meant to be a free license to go exploring the
  mainland with your Iksar tonight, and our plans to pre-announce issues such as
  this in the future hinge on players not taking advantage of the information.
  We appreciate everyone's cooperation&nbsp;</font>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">Just for a bit of clarification, back when the
planes were brought online, John Smedley commented that people just don't die in
planes, they die hard. Veeshan's Peak makes the planes look easy. There exists a
non-negligible chance that not only will you die there, but you might not be
able to raise the necessary forces to allow recovery of your corpse. It is
*very* dangerous.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to avoid any appearance of impropriety
in the zone, as sometimes follows when we've assisted in corpse recoveries in
other zones due to claimed bug-deaths, we're not going to risk that for
Veeshan's Peak. Veeshan's Peak is incredibly dangerous, and in order to
guarantee that everyone is operating under the same set of conditions, we've
elected to make the zone &quot;enter at your own risk&quot;.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That said, there are no known bugs in the zone
that would cause the death of a character, and it was tested extensively in the
Ruins of Kunark beta. We will certainly investigate and eliminate any bugs that
are reported, but we won't be reimbursing items or experience, nor will we be
moving corpses or people within the zone.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Should you not put this in a
patch message ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Probably not. There are people that purposely
avoid the message boards and news sites due to their desire to discover
everything on their own. I don't want to put up a patch message that
&quot;forces&quot; them to view the info. Also, we usually don't put up patch
messages for info that only affects a very small number of players, in this case
the top 10% or so.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I expect that the info will spread to those
concerned anecdotally prior to anyone entering the zone. There is also
sufficient in-character warning in-game about this as well.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I’ll give it some more thought though.</font>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">Just to clear up this rumor :</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The trees swaying have NOTHING to do with
framerate.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Two things affect framerate: number of polygons
drawn, and fill rate (the number of objects in front of other objects in front
of other objects, all of which have to be drawn).</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Framerate goes down in a forest because of the
additional polygons needed to represent all the trees, as well as the trees
behind the trees behind the trees having to be drawn.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, there are three general ways to
increase your framerate (starting from easiest to hardest):</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1. Adjust your clipping plane down under the
display options section.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2. Buy a faster 3D card.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">3. Upgrade your CPU/Computer</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The level of 3D sound can also affect overall
framerate, depending on your system's configuration (which sound card, etc.) so
you might want to experiment with those settings as well.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bottom line, Kunark pushes the EQ engine a lot
harder, hence the better visuals. Even though this was perhaps a non-issue for
you with the rest of Norrath, when you're on Kunark you might now need to adjust
your display settings.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">- Brad McQuaid</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">PS. just to be very clear, the animating trees
do not measurably affect your framerate.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">PPS. framerate is how fast your screen is
updated and has little to do with 'lag', which is generally another word for
'latency' which has to do with internet performance (timing issues, sending data
between your client and our servers).<br>
hope that helps.</font></p>

We'll be making this spell group-only (e.g. must be grouped with target)
shortly. This should alleviate people's concerns about it being used offensively
to harm other players.<br>
<br>
Backstabbing Pets :<br>
<br>
Up until the level 50+ pet spells, all pets were based off of warriors. We now
have the ability to base pets off of other classes, and that's what's been done
here. There are now rogue pets, wizard pets, and monk pets, which represent
additional abilities for the pet-users above 50th level.<br>
<br>
Rogues need not worry that a backstabbing pet somehow reduces the desirability
of their class. First, the pet does not have the backstab skill that a rogue of
that level would have, so they won't hit as often nor will they do as much
damage. Furthermore, they don't have all of the stat bonuses that increase the
rogues effectiveness. Certainly they can be buffed up, but they'll never come
close to having a real rogue. Finally, rogue pets will never have the ability to
double-backstab as rogues do.<br>
<br>
Rogue pets won't be picking locks either, and there are quite a few places to do
that in Kunark.<br>

  <font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2">
  As a Wizard, I am professionally interested in all things having to do with ethereal transport. As such, I was drawn to rumors concerning
  firepots throughout the lands of Norrath. These rumors spoke of an ancient transport system &quot;for those of evil race&quot;, which could be
  accessed through having the appropriate &quot;key&quot;, and inserting it (or using it) with the appropriate &quot;firepot&quot; in a Norrathian city, to be
  instantly transported to another city of Norrath, without the need of spell, Wizard or Druid (shudder!).<br>
  <br>
  Knowing that most ancient magic was not related to the evils that plague Norrath, I have long discounted the likelihood that such devices, if
  they existed, were for evil races' exclusive use. Evil races are prone to destruction, rarely creativity of any sort! However, it has come to
  my attention, that such teleportation devices do, in fact exist, and can be utilized by all races.
  However, their utility is, at this stage of my investigation, limited to travel from one hub point to twelve (12) of
  the cities of Norrath.</font>
<p>
  <font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2">This hub point is deep under the Timorous Deep, located at -12260,
  +4365, -277. It came to my attention, that the top of a classic Combine Era Wizard Spire, with its familiar four tines, was observable above the
  waves in this depth of Ocean. If you swim down directly between the four tines, you will find a square opening on the ocean floor.
  Descending, you will find yourself suddenly in air, in a square room, with three firepots along each wall. In the center burns a magic fire
  of blue, such as can be seen at certain ancient Elvish and Combine towers (e.g. Oasis). Note that the descent from the surface is one way,
  and I was unable to find any way to leave the room by normal means. No monster nor person disturbed my researches that followed.<br>
  <br>
  Binding myself to the locale, I commenced to mediate on the twelve firepots. It was immediately apparent that the style of each was
  different, and each was familiar to a particular culture of Norrath. I proceeded to test my hypothesis, and touching the rust-colored low
  firepot, similar to many in the city of my youth, found myself, being dusted off by a very surprised guard (my second cousin, twice removed),
  in Northern Felwithe. Without answering my startled cousin's queries (he knows I tend to gate around hastily...), I immediately gated back.
  I tested all twelve pots, and here is the key of their wisdom :<br>
  <br>
  North Left : (fire on floor) Grobb (entrance)<br>
  North Center : (6 side gray) Ogguk (entrance)<br>
  North Right : (6 side tall) Erudin (near dock)<br>
  <br>
  East Left : (6 side gray) Neriak Commons (entrance)<br>
  East Center : (4 side wood) Greater Faydark (under Kelethin)<br>
  East Right : (6 side rust) Northern Felwithe (entrance)<br>
  <br>
  South Left : (brown box) Halas(near dock)<br>
  South Center : (dark with blue) East Freeport (on dock)<br>
  South Right : (tall gold vase) Cabilis West (entrance)<br>
  <br>
  West Left : (white marble) South Kaladim (entrance)<br>
  West Center : (lava Lamp) Akannon (entrance)<br>
  West Right : (torch stand) Rivervale (entrance)<br>
  <br>
  It is to be noted that &quot;the Black Hole&quot;, Qeynos, and Highpass, are
  not represented here.<br>
  <br>
  An intriguing question, beyond the origin of these firepots and their creator's identity, is: &quot;Are there other pots out there that bring you
  to The Timorous Deep ?&quot;</font>
