<td width="100%"><font size="2">The ground rumbles beneath the feet of many soldiers. From the west rises a massive army of fierce warriors, both corporeal and demons wrenched from Hate. Twisted faces filled with hatred march with heated anticipation of victory. Leading them through the icy hills is none other than the dark lady Lanys T`Vyl, her blood-red armor gleaming in the cool morning light.<br><br>Across the lands to the east, the great wizard Al`Kabor spearheads an army of light. Elven warriors and archers move forward with grim determination to keep safe the fair city of Firiona Vie. Resolve is etched upon every face; every elegant sword gleams with purity and truth. Meanwhile, back in Firiona Vie itself, the princess lays ill in bed. With her father Galeth Veredeth at her side, Firiona rests upon silken sheets, slowly gaining back the life that has been siphoned from her.<br><br>The air swells with silence as the colossal forces are drawn inexorably towards each other. An age has passed since a battle of such magnitude has been waged upon Norrath. An era has ended, one of peace and prosperity. The time of war is upon us. <br><br>*** Update Message - 01/31/05 ***<br>---------------------------------<br>The primary reason for this update was to improve server stability and correct some network problems. <br>Most of the changes to code were server side and should not directly impact the players.<br><br>Client Changes:<br>- Networking problems related to routers should be resolved.

<td width="100%"><font size="2">*** Update Headlines ***<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>* Backflagging<br>* Gates AA point refunding<br>* New Hot Spots<br>* Mistmoore & Splitpaw revamps going to Stormhammer<br><br>Backflagging *<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>As you know, when a guild gains or loses members, they often find themselves dedicating a large amount of time re-playing content that they have long since completed in order to gain access to zones for newer members. During our Community Summit this last summer, and in many subsequent discussions, we have heard the recurring desire to find a way to ease the frustrations associated with this backflagging.<br><br>While the issue is not as simple as removing flags altogether (we feel flags are necessary for the zones they are currently attached to), we have looked into ways that we can reduce the frustrations of backflagging and feel that we have arrived at a fair and equitable solution, which is detailed below.<br><br>- A new implementation of the 85/15 rule has been introduced into Planes of Power zones including the Plane of Time. This should resolve the outstanding problems that occur from time to time with the current 85/15 implementation.<br><br>- The new 85/15 has also been introduced for the locked zones in Gates of Discord.<br><br>- An alternate means of flagging guild mates for locked content in Planes of Power and Gates of Discord has been implemented that will allow you to flag raid members for the zone you are in by completing raid content within that zone.<br><br>The implementation varies slightly from zone to zone to fit the story and nature of the zone, but in general will involve killing a raid target within that zone, looting an item, and completing a single group quest to change that item into a zone flag. This only applies to zones that don&#39;t already have a single group task or system to gain access.<br><br>AA Changes<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>- Reduced the cost of many Gates AAs. Players will receive a refund equal to the difference on AAs that now have a lower cost. *<br><br>- Changed the monk AA Crippling Strike to an activated ability that does an eagle strike attack as well as a snare.<br><br>- Changed the monk AA Stunning Kick to an activated ability that does a round kick attack as well as a stun.<br><br>- Changed the monk AA Eye Gouge to an activated ability that does a tiger claw attack as well as reduces the targets offensive ability.<br><br>- Due to major changes in how these work, AA points for Crippling Strike, Stunning Kick, and Eye Gouge have been refunded.<br><br>- Reduced the reuse time of the Ranger AAs Frost Arrow and Flame Arrow to 3 minutes. *<br><br>- Hobble of Spirits will now stack with the Beastlord&#39;s proc buffs. *<br><br>- Fixed problem with the Beastlord AA Bestial Alignment where if you had maxed buffs this AA would not reset if it did not take.<br><br>- Duration enhancement focuses and AAs should now increase the duration of pet buffs.<br><br>- If your stored AA&#39;s go above 30, they will no longer be set to 30 when you zone. However, you should still not be able to gain more than 30 unless you get a refund, get the AA from a GM, or get an AA from a script. * - Fixed an issue with Half Elf Paladins of Tunare and the Origin AA. * - If your character was created before EQ started storing starting location data, when you log into the game you will now be prompted to choose your home city from a list of valid starting locations for your character. You will only need to do this once and once this has been set, it cannot be changed. This will correct the problems with the Origin AA not returning some characters to their expected home city.<br><br>Zone and NPC Changes<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>- Hot Spots have been moved (level ranges are approximate): *<br>Shadeweaver&#39;s Thicket 1-30<br>Kurn&#39;s Tower 10-25<br>Unrest 15-30<br>Crystal Caverns 25-35<br>Solusek&#39;s Eye 25-45<br>Katta Castellum 30-60<br>Lower Guk 35-55<br>Nagafen&#39;s Lair 40-55<br>Umbral Plains 50-60<br><br>- Respawn time for the bosses in Tacvi has been increased from 3 to 5 days.<br><br>- Some Tacvi loot has been upgraded. Bosses now drop more items per kill and some all new items have been added to the zone. *<br><br>- An alternate entrance into Tacvi has been added in Txevu that will allow guilds to bypass the Zun&#39;Muram after they have defeated him at least once. Guilds that have previously defeated the Zun&#39;Muram will need to do so at least once more before they can use the new entrance. *<br><br>- Gilipus of Ak`Anon has joined the Beta Neutral Faction. You will now be able to complete his quest without having to raise Gem Choppers Faction.<br><br>- The 3 Tormentors in the Jelvan event now share hatelist when idle or aggro. Anyone that is on one Tormentor&#39;s hatelist, but not on the other 2 Tormentor&#39;s hatelist will be added. This should make it difficult (if not impossible) to avoid AOEs.<br><br>- Modified the Warden Hanvar event, all guards should appear in their appointed places.<br><br>- Fixed a bug in Anguish that could make Warden Hanvar unkillable.<br><br>- Clicking on the door to Anguish while having the Seal: Mastery of All on your person will now prompt red text indicating your flag has been granted.<br><br>- The respawn of Globes of Discordant Energy are now tracked on the event timer for Anguish. The method for obtaining the Globes has not changed.<br><br>- The pile of stones that was used as a secondary zone between Dranik and Bloodfields has been removed. There is now an actual zoneline there.<br><br>- Plane of Justice - previously, you could not click the red teleports to leave the Seventh Hammer&#39;s room unless the Seventh Hammer was dead (or not up). This has been changed so you can leave the room as long as it is not aggro. If you click on a portal while he is aggro, you should get a message and remain in the room.<br><br>- Grennet Stormhand in North Qeynos is no longer a task master since he is part of a quest. His task master job has been taken over by Jorren Boxmover.<br><br>- Increased the maximum duration for all Labyrinth Trials from 1 hour to 2 hours. When an event is successfully completed, the instance will shut down in 30 minutes. If it is failed, the instance will shut down in 5 minutes.<br><br>- Changed the reclusive Girplan event in Bloodfields so that each NPC in the sequence stays up for 15 minutes instead of 3 minutes before depopping.<br><br>- Elemental NPCs are once again Charmable in Bastion of Thunder.<br><br>Epic Alterations<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>- Updated some text to clarify what is needed for the bard epic 2.0. *<br><br>- Part of the rogue epic that could be skipped has been repaired as this was not intended to be possible.<br><br>- The zonewide shout that occurs when killing base pop NPCs in the special instance of Vxed for the paladin epic has now been removed.<br><br>- Added another check to the monk epic to make sure that the monk looting the item also has the Mark of Justice needed to access the 7th Hammer&#39;s area.<br><br>- More details regarding the combine for the Beastlord Epic 2.0 have been added to the text. *<br><br>- Fixed the hand in to Uisima for the Ranger Epic 1.5.<br><br>- Added a hint to the Druid Epic 2. *<br><br>- In the Hider Event in Frontier Mountains for the Druid Epic 1.5, the goblins should teleport a bit less frequently. *<br><br>- Additional lore has been added to the rogue epic 2.0. *<br><br>- Moved the Dark Huntress from Mistmoore to the Tower of Frozen Shadow.<br><br>- Changed a few of Lirprin&#39;s dialogues to hint at where the last few steps are that players are missing. *<br><br>- Arly Golyeck in Paludal caverns will now accept bribes from half-elves, or those that are in half-elven illusion while also wearing a Burnoose of the Halfbreed.<br><br>Tradeskill Changes<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>- The Tradeskill window will now allow up to 500 favorites (up from 100). *<br><br>- The drop rate of spiderling silk has been increased, as there are many new combines that require this item as a component. *<br><br>- The Rune of Zephyr should now drop off of the appropriate level of NPC&#39;s. *<br><br>- Several Tradeskill recipes have had their missing ingredients added to the game. These items will now drop off of appropriate NPC&#39;s. *<br><br>- Increased the drop rate of Tae Ew Scales. *<br><br>- Increased the drop rate of Putrescent Blood. *<br><br>- Made several quest-related combines "Learnable". *<br><br>- Fixed a few grammatical issues with the "Forge of Icewell Arms" book.<br><br>- Fixed an issue with one of the Abysmal Sea tradeskill books (The Beauty of a Simple Stone). It should now be able to be read.<br><br>- Fixed the recipe for the Imbued Northman Kite Shield (Rallos).<br><br>- Fixed the research recipe for Malosini, it should now combine properly.<br><br>- Fixed the recipe for Tuna Rice Surprise, it will now return the Wok on success.<br><br>- Fixed the Large Sandblasted Steel Girth, it is now usable by the appropriate races.<br><br>- Fixed the Sandblasted Ringmail Bracelet, it is now usable by the appropriate races.<br><br>- Fixed the multiple-recipes for Vegetable Oil, they will now return the correct yields.<br><br>- Fixed the disparity in between the cast-times on the various "Greater Elixir of Concentration" potions.<br><br>- Added the Blood Treated Kaniz Hide to the game.<br><br>- Added a recipe for players to create a package of vegetables. *<br><br>- Added a "Fully Charged Gnomish Vanishing Device" to the game. *<br><br>- Added LDoN Foraged items to the Interactive Objects in all LDoN zones (this includes the foraged alchemy components). *<br><br>- Removed the lore tag from the Smithing Chisel. *<br><br>- Taught Barbarians how to make Large Leather Gorgets and Pants. *<br><br>- Evaluated the PoP Smithing disparity between plate and chain. *<br>1. One block of ore will now yield two sheets of metal. *<br>2. Removed the Chain Jointing requirement from the combine. It now requires one Superb Leather Padding instead. *<br><br>Item, Spell, Discipline and Skill Changes<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>- Auto range attack implemented, no longer will it be necessary to range attack manually - /autofire is a toggle command that will fire your ranged weapon until you run out of ammunition, turn on autoattack to switch to melee combat, or use the /autofire command again. *<br><br>- /melody ability implemented for bards - To use /melody, type /melody . The numbers are the same numbers you would use for the /cast command. The melody will repeat the songs in the specified order until a note is missed due to an interruption. *<br><br>- Modified Mirrored Mask, so it is no longer no rent and poof on death, however the click effect only works inside Anguish. - Increased the chance on the Cleave effects to affect DPS as they were originally intended.<br><br>- Fixed a bug with the Frenzy of Conquest benefit.<br><br>- No-rent containers no longer poof on login if they contain items. They instead change into an unenchanted container with the same number of slots, and a chat message notifies the player. *<br><br>- Changed the Mark of Justice to take the player&#39;s group instead of just the player when attempting to engage The 7th Hammer. *<br><br>- Cryston, Staff of the Riftnow has the focus of Quickening of the Ikaav.<br><br>- Dragorn Head Statue Piece and Dragorn Torso Statue Piece are now very large and can fit in bags.<br><br>- Clear Rock and A Large Rock are now very large and can fit in bags.<br><br>- Polished Stone of Renewal can now be used by berserkers. *<br><br>- Berserker: Hastened War Cry has been fixed.<br><br>- Bards will stop playing songs when feign death effects hit them (some NPC encounters do this).<br><br>- Players are no longer able to have Form of the Great Bear and a mount on at the same time.<br><br>- Holyforge will now increase your chance to slay undead, and if you have the Slay Undead AA you will have an even greater chance of a slay with Holyforge. *<br><br>- The spell Nature&#39;s Blight was not increasing the damage as stated and should be working as intended now. *<br><br>- Fixed a bug with haste items and haste augments. Their effects were stacking when they shouldn&#39;t have. It will now only take the greatest haste effect from the item including augments.<br><br>- When combining the aegis of chaotic worship with the soul temper and a flask of water, you will receive the temper and the aegis of chaotic worship back if you don&#39;t have the correct flags instead of just the aegis back.<br><br>- The Monk&#39;s feign death success rate has been improved. It was previously capped at 95% at 100 skill and now it ramps up the success rate for higher skill levels. *<br><br>- Fixed several inconsistencies with pets affected by focus items.<br><br>- Increased the mana regen gained by Elemental Simulacrum.<br><br>- Touch of the Devourer was changed to allow partial damage when it is resisted. This is an increase in the overall damage of the spell.<br><br>- New items are available on the PvP point merchants. *<br><br>- Might of the Wild Spirits and Savage Wildcaller&#39;s Blessing should now stack better.<br><br>- The effect on the Wristband of Secrets no longer works on other players.<br><br>- Increased the focus % of the following effects:<br>Hastening of the Ikaav<br>Quickening of the Ikaav<br>Alacrity of the Ikaav<br><br>- Increased the potency of Pure Spirit.<br><br>- Nature&#39;s Balance should now only remove beneficial spells from the target.<br><br>- Removed the scaling focus mods from the following spells:<br>Force of Ikkibi<br>Order of Trushar<br>Sylvan Anger<br>Taelosian Geomancy<br>Burning Night<br>Anger of Taelosia<br>Sylvan Kindle<br>Clear Fire<br><br>- The the class-specific quest chest armors from Omens of War now have a .8 second cast time.<br><br>- The pre-nerf LDoN armor sets can now be sold back to the merchants, like other LDoN items. They are the versions with two type 2 slots and one type 3 slot (instead of one each of types 1, 2, and 3). These items are those with the following in the item name:<br>Royal Attendant * of Sand<br>Incorporeal * of the Specter<br>Mucus-Drenched *<br>Immortal&#39;s Bloodied *<br><br>Miscellaneous<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>- Multiple procs on a pet are now working properly. *<br><br>- A resource leak in the graphics engine was corrected and we have seen a measurable improvement in client stability as a result.<br><br>- The sky system now influences the ambient lighting.<br><br>- Animated traps such as the ones in soldunga/b are now detected by the collision system and will cause a small amount of damage.<br><br>- You can once again target things on the other side of a water surface and other passable surfaces.<br><br>- Added code to check and validate specialization skills. If the values are not legal, the player will be informed why they are not legal and they are reset. - Added popup confirmation dialog when you attempt to give an augmented item to an NPC. *<br><br>- Added optional parameters to /book command -- /book open, /book close. *<br><br>- Fixed bug where a player who had more than 2 million plat in his inventory was unable to purchase anything from a vendor or trader.<br><br>- /yell messages are no longer displayed if the yelling player is in your ignore list. *<br><br>- Some models that were scaled dramatically could cause the collision system to fail, resulting in warps to ceiling and other strange side effects. For example the vases in dranikcatacombsa at 1000,-1011, 0 would always cause players to be pinned to the ceiling due to this bug.<br><br>- Players standing on the lip of an edge should now slide down off them more smoothly.<br><br>- There have been some optimizations to the collision system. You should see improved performance in zones with very large stationary objects (potimea, bloodfields, etc).<br><br>- Fixed a number of small bugs in the zoom camera behavior. These fixes include removing the possibility of having the first mousewheel click causing the camera to bounce back into first person, a bug that could cause the camera to get stuck "one click" out of first person, as well as smoothing out the camera motion a bit.<br><br>- Scrolling to third person and tabbing to another window should no longer cause the screen to bounce back and forth.<br><br>- Summoning mounts in certain places should no longer cause players to fall through geometry.<br><br>- Getting out of water should be much easier to do. *<br><br>- Mounts are no longer dismissed when zoning. *<br><br>- Spell scribe timers (putting a new spell into the spell book) now take only 1 second.<br><br>- Players should no longer experience 20k falls when standing on cliff edges while suffering from low frame rate.<br><br>- The bounding radius for small races was too tall, preventing them from accessing some areas. For example, gnomes couldn&#39;t enter the small huts in Steamfont. This was a global problem that is now fixed; that is just one example.<br><br>- Weather effects are now working properly when the Wake of Karana spell is used. Additionally, sounds related to starting & stopping of various weather types due to zoning and Wake of Karana should be working correctly.<br><br>- /who commands now display both class title and base class name for players over level 50, e.g. "Bedazzler (Enchanter)" *<br><br>- Fixed a bug that caused a lot of writing to the dbg.txt file during a raid.<br><br>Zone Revamps - Mistmoore (Legends)<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>In Mistmoore&#39;s Catacombs, the servants of the Trueborn, a sect of vampires with Mayong Mistmoore&#39;s blood flowing through their veins, grew tired of their masters throwing them into the fray against the Norrathian intruders. They came to desire more power for themselves.<br><br>It was not long before the first words of dissension crept through the catacombs on the will of whispers. The Trueborn servants congregated in dark, musty halls away from the eyes of their masters and over time their numbers grew along with their ambitions. Their time had come and soon they would rise up to claim their rightful place in Mistmoore Castle, gaining accolades from Lord Mayong Mistmoore himself for their brilliance and bravery -- or so they supposed.<br><br>Over several months, the Trueborn traitors recruited an army to their cause. On a black night as the moon was swallowed by a thick veil over Faydwer, they struck, killing their masters and leading their army toward Mistmoore Castle. They slaughtered all in their path and many masters of the Scions sect, the Trueborn&#39;s rival blood-children of Mayong, were destroyed that night.<br><br>The fierce wave of the lesser Trueborn rushed into the cellars of Mistmoore Castle without detection. Unbeknownst to all but the servants, Norrath&#39;s adventurers had uncovered winding caves beneath the surface that bypassed the castle&#39;s defenses. In a matter of hours, the castle was overrun and the servants of the Trueborn declared themselves the true Children of Mistmoore.<br><br>Since taking control of the castle, many Children have busied themselves repairing the damage from the battle while others continue to seek the magical ore that was uncovered in the catacombs.<br><br>They all prepare, waiting for the day their master returns to grant them glory.<br><br>Zone Revamps - Splitpaw (Legends)<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>Farsoth Mal, son of the Ishva Mal, leader of the Verishe Mal tribe, sat by his father&#39;s side watching him rule his minions in Splitpaw Lair. His father may have conquered this lair some years ago, but Farsoth believed they should rule far more than just one underground kingdom. He grew to despise his father for his lack of ambition and many hours were spent in bitter arguments between the two. The Ishva Mal grew tired and angry at the ceaseless challenges to his authority, gaining as much contempt for his son as his son had for him.<br><br>During a particularly heated argument of growls and grisly barks, the Ishva Mal reminded his willful son that his power was absolute and that he shared his throne with no one. With one quick motion, the Ishva Mal brandished his spear and sliced off his son&#39;s paw, determined that he would finally win the respect he deserved from his son. But the Ishva Mal&#39;s cruel methods would prove to be his downfall.<br><br>The Ishva Mal grew to be a greater tyrant each day, so much so that the Verishe Mal mages and warriors secretly formed the Council of Nine to challenge his rule. Farsoth saw the plans the Verishe Mal had in store for his father, but did nothing to stop them and instead chose to use them to his advantage.<br><br>Farsoth learned much from the council&#39;s mages and became obsessed with the summoning arts they practiced. His fascination eventually led to a plan that would secure the throne . . . for him.<br><br>Through all he&#39;d learned from the Verishe Mal mages, he believed he could summon a powerful entity from the Plane of Fire itself. Farsoth thought with such power at his side, nothing could stop him from ruling the Splitpaw Lair and any lands he desired.<br><br>He prepared for weeks, researching and gathering the reagents he required and finally he set to work to summon a terrible beast to bring an end to his father&#39;s rule.<br><br>Farsoth was distracted by his own anger, forgetting vital components as he wove the spell and the unthinkable happened. Flames shot out of the portal that Farsoth opened and, at the same time, rocks rained down upon the inhabitants of the lair. Then, the portal shifted its focus and water flooded into the corridors, extinguishing the flames and washing away the rocks. The portal shimmered once more and waves of all types of elementals poured into Splitpaw.<br><br>Farsoth certainly attained part of his goal. His father was killed, but so to were most of the gnolls he wished to lead to greatness.<br><br>Now he is a prisoner to the swarms of enraged elementals that have made Splitpaw Lair their new home.<br><br>* Denotes a change requested by the community.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font><br><br></td>

<td width="100%"><font size="2">Headlines <br>------------------- <br>Omens of War is live&#33; <br>New Teleportation Spells to Barindu. <br>Just me and my shadooooow&#33; <br>Reflective Water? <br>Register now for the New Orleans Fan Faire. <br><br><br>Omens of War <br>-------------------- <br>- Explore the war torn lands of Kuua and reap the benefits of new AAs, spells and items including the new, powerful, Epic 2.0. Lush new areas, filled with beautiful creatures and vibrant, living landscapes await you at every turn. We hope you enjoy all that EverQuest: Omens of War brings to the game. <br><br>Level 70 <br>-------------------- <br>Earn your way from level 65 to 70 and learn new spells and abilities along the way. <br><br>Travel to the Omens Zones <br>------------------- <br>The Priests of Discord in Norrath believe they have been granted a gift. A unique knowledge has been bestowed upon them which they believe was granted as a reward for preaching the way of Discord. That gift, they claim, is the knowledge of a way to a world that is enveloped by Discord itself -- an ethereal poison that wreaks havoc and strife upon all it touches. <br><br>Speak to a Priest of Discord to learn how to enter the World of Kuua. <br><br>The Task System <br>------------------- <br>Only have a short time to play or are you waiting for a group or raid? Immerse yourself in a Task. You can find Task Masters all over Norrath. They can be found in most home cities as well as in places like the East Commonlands, the Butcherblock Mountains, Toxxulia Forest and the Swamp of No Hope. For the more daring individuals, the most challenging tasks can be found by speaking with Task Masters in the Dreadlands and the Overthere. <br><br>You can open the task window by hitting Alt+Q and start enjoying this new game-play style and enhancement to the EverQuest experience. <br><br>Be mindful of turning in task items in stacks, as with all quests in EQ, please separate the items before turning them in for a reward. <br><br>Epic Weapons 2.0 <br>------------------- <br>Will you be the first of your class to earn these powerful new items? <br><br>Guild Tribute <br>------------------- <br>Omens of War expansion brings a new Guild Tribute system. This system will allow guild members to donate items/cash for Tribute points, and allow officers to select benefits that the entire guild will receive, deducting the cost from the guild’’s tribute pool. <br><br>Guild Tribute is an extension of the tribute system introduced in Gates of Discord and purchasers of either expansion, will be able to reap the new benefits. <br><br>Retail Claim Item <br>------------------- <br>Those of you who purchased the retail version of EverQuest: Omens of War will need to use the /claim command in-game to receive your in-game items. Enjoy&#33; <br><br>Select your title <br>------------------- <br>You can hit Shift+T to bring up the new Title selection UI which will allow you to choose from the titles you have earned, through AAs, levels or accomplishments, to be shown with your character name in-game. <br><br>Voice Macros <br>------------------- <br>Using Ctrl+V will bring up the new Voice Macro UI. There you will see a list of available voice macros as well as the options of Play, Tell, Group and Raid. Selecting a macro and play will play the macro for you only. Selecting a macro and using one of the other options will send the voice macro to either a tell (using the person you have targeted as the recipient), group or raid. <br><br>To create your own voice macros, make a sound file using the same name as one of the existing voice macros, which can be found in your EverQuest>Voice>Default directory and place it in your EverQuest>Voice>User directory. <br><br>You can create hot keys of your favorite Voice Macros by selecting the macro you would like and clicking and holding on the Tell, Raid or Group button until the icon appears on your cursor. <br><br>We hope you enjoy this new way to immerse yourself into the EverQuest experience. <br><br>New Spell Slot <br>------------------- <br>For the first time in EQ, you can open up a new spell slot by learning the Mnemonic Retention AA ability. 9 Spell slots&#33; Wow, Why I remember in the early days of EQ, we only had 8 spell slots and we liked it. We cast spells all day, going uphill both ways. You whippersnappers have it easy =) <br><br>More Buff Slots <br>------------------- <br>If you find that you need more room for beneficial buffs on your character, activate the Mystical Attuning AA and open up more room in your buff slot window. <br><br>Live Changes <br>------------------- <br><br>Improved Customization for Graphics <br>------------------- <br>-There are now 3 sets of options (Spell, Environment, and Actor). All 3 sets have similar options that affect each type of particle. These options allow for more customization when setting up your display and filters. <br><br>-An "advanced" button has been added under the display tab in the options window. This will allow you to toggle some of the new settings, for our new customizable graphics and effects. You will most likely need to expand the options window to see the new Advanced button. <br><br>- Shadows; Toggles the new dynamic shadows. <br>- Water Swap*: Switches between old style water, and new reflective water the next time you zone. <br>- 2.X Pixel Shaders: Toggles the use of pixel shaders 2.0. <br>- 1.X Pixel Shaders: Toggles the use of pixel shaders 1.0. <br>- Vertex Shaders: Toggles the use of vertex shaders. <br>- Dynamic Update Interval: Control the CPU costs of the dynamic reflection by adjusting how often to update the reflection texture <br>- Dynamic Sky Reflection Size*: Allows you to control how large the reflection texture is. <br>(The * indicates a setting that will take effect next time you zone). <br><br>- You can now see real time shadows within the world of Norrath. Use the shadows option in options>Display>advanced to turn them off and on. Now, even when soloing, you will never be alone. Those of you with older video cards may have some performance issues when attempting to use shadows. If your machine does not meet the recommended system specifications, we suggest that you play with shadows off. <br><br>- Enjoy sunsets and moonrises viewed above EverQuest&#39;s new reflective water which is available for everyone, wherever there is static water, e.g. Oceans, seas and lakes. You can toggle the new water shaders on and off using the Water Swap button, under options>display>advanced. <br><br>Zoning Screen <br>------------------- <br>When zoning, you will now see the loading splash screen. You have not crashed, do not be alarmed. <br><br>New Improved Particles <br>------------------- <br>-You will now be affected by the environment around you, be sure to check out these effects especially under water, in frigid weather, dry climates and upon death. <br><br>Spells <br>------------------- <br>- Symbol and Aegolism spell lines no longer require reagents. Clerics and Paladins rejoice. <br>- Necromancer pets will no longer require peridots. <br>- The beastlord spell, Tureptan Spirit, now has a healing component. <br>- New transportation spells are available in the Abysmal Sea. Check with your transportation spell contact for more information. <br>- Bard PBAoE spells will no longer damage targets that are moving, however any other spell effects from the PBAoE spell will still be applied to the targets as usual. <br>- Beneficial spells can now be used in the EverQuest tutorial. <br><br>Skill Cap Changes <br>------------------- <br>- Piercing now caps at 250 at level 60 for warriors, rangers and beastlords. <br>- 1h Blunt and 2h Blunt now cap at 250 at level 60 for beastlords <br>- Druids and Bards that exceeded their tracking skill limits, have had their tracking skill reset to the appropriate value. <br><br>Items <br>------------------- <br>- The Timespinner pet will no longer cast spells. <br>- The Dagger of Death has had its AC value reduced. <br>- Some of the new Omens of War items will now display an "Attunable" attribute, which means that they can be traded freely until they become are equipped or augmented. Attunable augments will become no-drop flagged when added to an augment slot, attunable items will become no-drop when equipped. You will not be able to auto-equip an attunable item that has not been attuned to your character. Please be mindful of the new Attunable flag before equipping or augmenting new items. <br>- Some rogue items have had their backstab modifier changed. We found that the items with a 12% modifier correctly took backstab to the limit of the skill, while the 15% merely reached that same limit. The extra 3% was found to have no affect on the skill, so all of the items have been standardized at a 12% backstab modifier. <br><br>Alternate Advancement Abilities <br>------------------- <br>- Berserkers have received some new AAs. This should bring their AA selection up to par with comparable melee classes. <br>- Added the ability for shadow knights to train the Gates of Discord ability Improved Theft of Life and the Planes of Power ability Suspended Minion. <br>- The healing wards that priests can summon using their Gates of Discord AAs are now immune to most spells. <br>- Lowered the reuse time on the Magician ability Host of the Elements to 15 minutes. <br>- Added the ability to train Quick Damage to Magicians as a Luclin Class ability. <br>- Increased the critical hit chance for the Wizard Gates of Discord AA Frenzied Devastation. <br><br>Fan Faire <br>------------------- <br>We are proud to announce the Halloween, New Orleans Fan Faire&#33; The event dates are October 28-30, 2004, and space is going fast&#33; The last day to guarantee your spot by pre-registering is October 11th.
