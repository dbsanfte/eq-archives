<td width="100%"><font size="2">Headlines<br>--------------------------<br><br>-Refining some DX9 functionality.<br><br>-Some adjustments have been made to pets.<br><br>-Some general bug fixes.<br><br>-Added a new rogue discipline line, Assassins Strike.  The tomes can be found in the East Commonlands and the Plane of Knowledge.<br><br>DirectX 9<br>--------------------------<br>-The center of collision for all players & NPCs has been set higher.  This resolves issues with climbing, running up hills and some other collision issues.<br>-We have made improvements to position processing which should alleviate some of the problems related to getting stuck in geometry. <br>-Improved collision and movement when near overhangs. <br>-The auto-duck mechanism is now an user-enabled option. It can be set in the General tab of the options window.  This feature forces your character to duck automatically to get into small places.  If set to off, you will need to manually duck to enter those places. It is "on" by default.<br>-Warping of very small NPCs (e.g., giant rats in Qeynos) has been resolved.<br>-Rain now has visible weather. <br><br>Pets<br>--------------------------<br>60+ player pets have been improved in a number of ways.  Most notably, the effects of pet foci will be more dramatic as a player progresses with more powerful equipment.  There have also been a number of inconsistencies between different tiers of pet foci that have been fixed.  All of the existing foci should never show a power decrease in any aspect when upgrading from a lower tier foci to a higher tier foci.  The most dramatic changes in pet stats are in the following aspects:<br><br>Level - Most tiers of Foci will add one level to the pet.<br>Max HP - Most tiers of foci will add max hit points to the pet, some tiers are more dramatic than others and follow a similar rate of progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet focus items.<br>Mitigation (AC, Agility) -- Most tiers of foci will add mitigation to the pet.  Some tiers are more dramatic than others and follow a similar rate of progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet focus items.<br>Damage Output - Generally the pets did not receive a significant change in their damage output, although there are certain pets that have had their max hit and offense increased.<br><br>Overall, the player pets have received a significant boost. There are instances where you will see no change in a specific aspect of a specific pet.  For example, the Rathe&#39;s Son pet summoned with Minion of Eternity has not received an improvement in max hit points, but it has received a significant mitigation improvement.<br><br>These changes affect the pets summoned by the following spells:<br><br>Ward of Xegony<br>Child of Ro<br>Servant of Marr<br>Rathe&#39;s Son<br>Legacy of Zek<br>Saryrn&#39;s Companion<br>Child of Bertoxxulous<br>Spirit of Sorsha<br>Spirit of Arag<br><br>The most profound changes were made to the magician pets as they were most in need of improvement to maintain class balance.  Beastlord and necromancer pets also received upgrades, but not of the same magnitude.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font><br><br></td>

<td width="100%"><font size="2">March 10th, 2004 <br>------------------------ <br><br><br>Headlines <br>------------------------ <br>Combines work again&#33; <br>Melee Part II&#33; <br>A new story has been added to your storybook&#33; <br><br><br>The grammar police have invaded EQ and they have made many minor spell, item and quest text fixes that are too numerous to list here. <br><br>We&#39;d like to thank all of the players that took time to provide feedback regarding the melee changes. We&#39;d also like to send a special thanks to all of the players that helped us test the additions on the Test and Beta servers. All of the input we received helped to shape the improvements you&#39;ve seen in the melee classes. <br><br>Please continue to give your feedback on the melee system or anything else that you feel requires attention. It does make a difference. <br><br>Over the last several months there have been several new additions to EverQuest aimed at increasing the desirability and relative power of pure melee classes. <br><br>- Discipline timers were revamped, allowing greater freedom and frequency of use. <br>- Endurance bar was added as a limited resource to power melee abilities and disciplines. <br>- Warriors received an innate 5 percent increase in their ability to absorb damage. <br>- Warriors received the Incite line of abilities, giving them a new tool for aggro management. <br>- Monks received the Phantom Call line of abilities, giving them a new tool for pulling. <br>- Several new disciplines were introduced for all three classes. <br><br>The endurance system and the separation of the discipline timers have provided us with new tools to add interesting and powerful abilities in the future for melee classes. You can count on seeing new disciplines and abilities as the game progresses and as situations arise that require new abilities to effectively balance class power. We will continue to evaluate the melee system for both balance and enjoyment. <br><br>We will also continue to review and make changes to each individual class as needed. Class balance is an important part of any multiplayer game and requires constant attention. <br><br>Thanks for helping make EverQuest a great game. <br><br><br>Items <br>------------------------ <br>We have replaced the spell-like effects on items which produced the following effects: Attack, HP Regen, Mana Regen, Haste and Damage Shield with actual statistics. The effects on the item have not changed they are just set up in a new way that we hope will allow for more item functionality in the future. <br>Several Gates smithed weapons have had their damage and delay adjusted to be more in line with the difficulty in crafting them. <br>The Copper Hammer of Striking will no longer proc for wielders below level 50. <br>The Wailing Coral Staff is now two handed blunt. <br>Bolas are now one-handed projectile rather than ammo. <br>Bola ranges have been adjusted slightly. <br>All bolas that can proc will now do so. <br>All items that had the "Cleave" series of effects removed, have had them returned. <br><br>The drop rate for the following Epic Quest items has been increased slightly: <br><br>- Essence of a Vampire <br>- Decrepit Hide <br>- Staff of Elemental Mastery (earth) <br><br><br>Expedition zones <br>------------------------- <br>You will now have to wait 5 minutes before you are able to accept another expedition zone. <br><br><br>Tradeskills <br>------------------------- <br>In order to correct many of the issues with the new tradeskill interface it was necessary to remove all learned and favorite recipes. However the system should now work better overall. <br>The sell prices for Saltwater Tuna and Saltwater crab, as well as the price for any item made from them, have been reduced. <br>Rainbow Trout should now be tradeable. <br>If you are not a gnome, you should no longer be able to tinker with a deluxe toolkit kit. If you are a gnome, please tinker away. <br>You should now be able to properly search for recipes. <br>The trivial level for brewing Fish Wine has been adjusted. <br><br><br>Berserkers <br>------------------------- <br>Some berserker abilities have had their endurance cost changed. <br>The duration of Confusing Strike has been reduced. <br>Berserkers should no longer be told that they can bash at level 6. <br>The berserker guildmaster in the Plane of Knowledge has been taught throwing and parry and is ready to train berserkers in their use. <br><br><br>Spells <br>------------------------- <br>Some Gates of Discord spells should now drop a little more often. <br>Several heal spells for Gates of Discord have been modified slightly. <br>The shadow knight Ancient Spell: Bite of Chaos should now work as intended. <br><br><br>NPC&#39;s <br>------------------------- <br>Hierophant Granix should now give the correct text in Cabilis. <br>Trimdet Trueheart in Abysmal Sea is less of a snob and should now speak with you correctly. <br>If you tell Brevik Kalaner in Abysmal what items you [need back], he will return to you any items you&#39;ve just given him. <br><br><br>Tribute <br>------------------------- <br>A few items have had their tribute value adjusted. <br>Gift of the Enchanters should now work correctly. <br>You should no longer be able to donate containers with items inside for favor. <br>Persistent Boon should now give the proper effect. <br><br><br>Alternate Advancement <br>------------------------- <br>Dire Charm will no longer reset after being resisted as the ability was successfully initiated. <br>Dire Charm should now reset when used on an NPC that is too high in level. <br><br><br>Miscellaneous <br>------------------------- <br>Corrected a faction issue with the wizard epic. <br>The monk "Phantom" line of abilities should no longer be resisted in the level 65 "hard" LDoN Adventures. <br>The rogue&#39;s "Assassin&#39;s Strike" skill line ability will be re-introduced with the next update. <br>The Shining Bloodstone will now be restricted to 2-handed weapons. Any who have placed this augmentation in a 1-handed weapon will find the augmentation on their cursor when they log in. If you find that you have no practical use for the 2-handed augmentation, please petition and a suitable 1-handed replacement will be made available to you. <br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</font><br><br></td>
