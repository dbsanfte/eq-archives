<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is known as the Age of the Snake. The
snake race known as Shissar, slithered upon Kunark. The Iksar had yet to unite.
Our people had yet to learn the Black Arts and the ways of Fist and Tail.
Divided, the Iksar were enslaved by the snakes. In the centuries before the
Green, the Iksar were slaves of the Shissar. They ruled from the ancient city of
Chelsith which rest deep within the land now known as The Overthere. From here
would sprout much evil. The Iksar were tortured like Frogs and suffered at the
hands of the Shissar. The Iksar who showed genius were to help the snakes in
their dark rites. These few were the seeds of rebellion. The Iksar began to plot
a revolt, but a greater force would strike first.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Shissar were an arrogant race. The power
bestowed by the gods was not enough. They made pacts with other gods and
demigods. They found the rifts of time and space and used them to gather magic
items once held by the guardians of the planes. The Shissar's disloyalty and
blasphemous pride would bring the wrath of the gods upon them. No power could
stop the force to come. A green cloud formed in the skies above Kunark. The
could began to descend upon the land. From it's green core, the face of death
began to form. It was of no god they knew of. It opened it's giant maw and spoke
in tongues unknown. From the mouth of death rushed forth a green mist. The
Shissar shaman began to cast spells in hopes of shielding their city and the
necromancers began to assault the mist with great weapons. All were futile. The
mist rushed forth. The first snakes to be swallowed by the mist had their scales
and flesh rot and fall from their bones. Horrid screams of suffering could be
heard from within the mist. A river of flesh and blood flowed. The Iksar stood
and gazed upon the gristle that was once the Shissar. With the Green Death came
the liberation of the Iksar.</font>
