Message</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Announcements*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Plane of Sky is now open!!! As a reminder
to our customers, the alternate planes of reality do not necessarily follow the
same physical or ethereal rules as Norrath proper. Enjoy!</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today is patch day! The EverQuest servers have
been patched with the following changes:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*General Changes / Fixes*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Some changes have been made to the exit of
Nagafen's Lair into the Lavastorm Mountains. This will hopefully reduce if not
solve the bug that causes people to fall into lava when exiting Nagafen's Lair.
Please let us know how this goes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Due to feedback received from the customers
concerning the density of fog during rainstorms, visibility has been increased.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- All drops of steel weapons have been replaced
with higher quality fine-steel weapons of the same type. This change was made to
reduce the amount of new currency coming into the world at the mid-to-upper
levels. The fine-steel weapons are in all cases superior to the steel weapons
that were dropping, they just sell to vendors for less money.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Casting times have been implemented on
several activatable items. This was done to correct issues that could arise from
people chain-casting these items.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- The safe-point (the point which you return if
you fall below the world) in Kithicor has been moved near the entrance to
Rivervale, a safer part of the zone.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Corrected a bug that caused AC to be
improperly displayed for higher level characters. Your AC should now reflect all
of your items.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Additional Bug Fixes:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Corrected a bug in the client that could
cause a crash if you were spammed with emotes by someone on your /ignore list.<br>
- Corrected a bug that allowed ships to move faster when disarmed<br>
- Corrected a bug that caused the Aqualung to lose its charges if dropped on the
ground.<br>
- Fire Giants in Nagafen's Lair should now recover properly when stuck in lava.
Consider yourself warned.<br>
- The Instill Doubt skill has been disabled on the PvP servers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Spell Changes*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Shadow Vortex is now a &quot;drain&quot;
spell.<br>
- Siphon Strength will now stack with strength buffs and debuffs<br>
- Panic the Dead cast and recast delays have been reduced. In addition, the
spell is less resistable.<br>
- Angstlich's Appalling Screech had its radius increased slightly.<br>
- All Wizard AoE damage and stun spells have had their radius slightly increased<br>
- Yonder will now interact better with levitate.<br>
- Form of the Great Wolf had its speed component increased.<br>
- Terrorize Animal had its casting time reduced and is less resistable.<br>
- New magician's spells have been added. Check your spell vendors.<br>
- Reoccurring Amnesia has been made more effective.<br>
- NPCs will now treat the &quot;Cancel Magic&quot; series of spells as hostile.
Previously, NPCs did not mind if players dispelled all of their buffs before
attacking. Now they will.<br>
- The Fear and Charm series of spells now properly notify the caster when they
break. No, seriously, we're certain this time.<br>
- Harmtouch now does more damage beginning at level 41.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Levitation Changed*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Due to the implementation of casting times on
activatable items, the code that disallowed refreshing of the Levitation spell
while it was active is no longer necessary and has been backed out. The Levitate
spell may now be refreshed while the spell is in use.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Quests and Items*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- The Armor of Ro should be more obtainable. We
will continue to evaluate and adjust the rarity of other class-specific armor
components to make the pieces obtainable in a reasonable amount of time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- We have changed the reward of a newbie quest
in the Qeynos area from a level 49 scroll to a level 1 scroll. The issuance of a
level 49 scroll was a typo in the quest data, allowing new characters to amass
an abnormally large amount of currency.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- The stats on the reward for the Rogue
Redemption quest have been increased to make it better than the favorite
dropped-weapon for the level range.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Ravenscale boots will now drop as frequently
as other Ravenscale items.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- The Mask of Deception may now be equipped by
the appropriate races.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Fletching Update*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">All arrows created with the new Silver-Tipped
Arrowhead (formerly the Bladed Arrowhead) are now magical in nature, and may be
used versus magical creatures. All existing items in your possession will
automatically morph into the new magical items. Additionally, each successful
attempt to create magical arrows will yield 10 arrows instead of the previous 5.
As such, the vendor buy-back value has been decreased accordingly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Paw*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The difficulty of Paw has been decreased. We
found that many of the gnolls in the new Paw had too many hitpoints, making the
dungeon more difficult than it should have been for the desired level target.
Please let us know how this change affects the viability of the dungeon.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*The Plane of Fear*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The item-drop percentages in the Plane of Fear
have been increased. This change was supposed to have occurred in the last
patch, however the data was not exported. It has been tested and equipment drops
are now occurring at a much higher rate.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*The Plane of Hate*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The item-drop percentages on roaming and
fast-spawning NPCs in the Plane of Hate have been decreased. Previously, these
NPCs used the same drop-percentages as the slow-spawning NPCs, causing overall
drop percentages to be extremely high.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Also, the inhabitants of the Plane of Hate no
longer fall for illusions, and tend to &quot;Hate&quot; everyone.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Monk Enhancement*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A monk's speed in hand-to-hand combat will now
improve with level, beginning in the high 20s. This will result in higher level
monks doing substantially more damage in a given time-frame.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though this change does increase the power of
the average monk, it should be stressed that the monk is now even more in need
of true tank classes who have the ability to taunt upset creatures off them. We
want to stress that the &quot;taunt factor&quot; of a monks fist has NOT been
increased, though it may appear so due to your increased damage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Paladin/Shadowknight Enhancement*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Paladins and Shadowknights now have a higher
hitpoints and higher skill caps on Bash and Taunt.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The additional hitpoints will be noticeable for
Paladins and SKs over level 25. This was done because the Paladins, SKs, and
Rangers had the same HP base, which upon further consideration is not compatible
with our vision of those classes' roles. This change will basically put Paladin
and SK HPs midway (in terms of Hit Points) between rangers and warriors of the
same race.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The taunt skill was increased because SKs, and
in particular, Paladins had difficulty taunting opponents off of Rangers, Monks,
Rogues, and Warriors due to their lower damage output. Though the Paladin and SK
will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt, this change in addition
to some of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bash was increased because Paladins typically
aren't switching to two-handed weapons, choosing instead to continue using the
bash skill. Most warriors, being ogres, trolls, or barbarians for the most part,
do not worry about bash and instead opt for slam, which uses the same skill.
Paladins are typically the only characters who use a shield throughout their
lives.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Rogue Enhancement*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whenever a rogue is invisible, whether by
spell, potion, or skill, they are now also invisible to undead.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This change was made to add a definite
class-advantage to the rogue, allowing them to do something that no other class
could do. It is the first step in a multi-step process to improve the rogue
class.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Wizard Enhancement*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Level 35 or above wizards will find that their
spells (Magic, Cold, or Fire) much less likely to be resisted. This effect
stacks with the Staff of Temperate Flux and enchanter, shaman, and magician
resistance debuffs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This change was made to increase the
effectiveness of wizards at about the level that all spell-casting classes start
seeing their resistance rates go up. Wizards specialize in direct magical
damage. It makes sense that they should be better at causing that damage than
the other classes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Bard Enhancement*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bards will now receive the Meditate skill at
10th level. This skill will be granted automatically the first time a bard zones
after reaching 10th level, and cannot be trained further. It will have the
effect of decreasing the amount of time that it takes a Bard to memorize their
songs. Previously, it would take 50th level bards upwards of 2 minutes to
memorize a song. Now it is much faster.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Druid Enhancement*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The skill cap on a Druid's tracking skill has
been increased. This change was implemented based upon general public opinion
that the former cap was far too low for the skill to be even marginally viable.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Feign Death and Pets*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After a serious discussion regarding the
Necromancer's Feign Death tactic, as well as reviewing public opinion on the
matter, we have implemented a change. As we would like everyone to understand
why we feel this change was necessary, here is a summary of the issue:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
Feign death allows you to become an invalid target in all circumstances,
providing offensive tactics that are abusive. For this ability to remain
balanced, the pet should follow the same rules as invisibility. Offensive
tactics used by other classes involve the creature getting a saving throw verses
the effect. Since creatures do NOT get a direct save verses feign death (as you
cast it on yourself), and since you can retry the combat once you have feigned
death, there is very little risk to necromancer himself. As this tactic involves
charming an NPC and turning it against another NPC, which could be part of the
same spawn, it allows for Necromancers to solo MUCH bigger rooms than any other
class could. This situation is well beyond what would preserve game balance for
any other class (soloing the Bloodthirsty Ghoul room and Ghoul Lord room, for
example).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Example:<br>
While there are many examples of how the Necromancer Feign Death tactic is
abusive, one of the most egregious occurs in the Ghoul Lord room of Lower Guk.
The room consists of 2 Bok Ghoul Guards and the Ghoul Lord himself. Using the
current system, a level 50 Necro can easily solo the room at virtually no risk
to himself. The Necro can get into the room quite easily with Invis To Undead.
To clear the room he uses Screaming Terror on one Bok and Charms the other. When
the Ghoul Lord rushes him, he feigns. The Lord then turns on the charmed Bok and
kills it, taking considerable damage during the fight. The Necromancer waits
until the Ghoul Lord returns to its spawn point. When the necromancer gets back
up, he is in no danger of being attacked due to the way Feign Death works now.
He then charms the 2nd Bok and Feigns again. The fight goes on and the 2nd Bok
is killed. When the Necromancer gets back up he has a VERY wounded Ghoul Lord
AND nearly full mana. The Lord is now an easy kill, and the Necro collects his
special items.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Solution:<br>
Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets suicide
and the charmed ones break Charm. We do not want, however, to adversely affect
lower level Necromancers to such a large degree. What we do recognize is the
need to prevent higher level Necro's from exploiting key spawn points. Hence,
when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately break Charm. However,
summoned NPCs (pets) will NOT be affected. While this still allows the use of
the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet, it does not imbalance the game
and many dungeon spawns to the degree that charming an NPC does.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">*Manastone Changed*</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The players have raised many concerns about the
power of the Manastone, which no longer drops. They cite that people without a
Manastone are not as welcome in expeditions to the outer planes and other areas
as people with them. Since dropping additional Manastones via quest or removing
them from the existing populace is not desirable, we've decided to make it so
that the Manastone will no longer function in the alternate planes. Furthermore,
it will not function in any of the zones included with the Kunark Expansion.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We apologize to those adversely affected by
this change. Our general goal is to avoid making changes to items in peoples'
possession, however we felt this change was, all things considered, warranted
and for the benefit of the game as a whole.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2">If
all classes received a minute amount of xp for all kills, including greens, then
soloing would be more viable. Let's say that it takes 500 blue kills to make
your next level, then it might take a thousand green kills to do the same. This
would help the people who don't have hours and hours to sit there and play in a
group. Obviously, if they don't group they aren't going to get the good loot,
but at least this gives them something to do when they log on for an hour to
play before bed. This way even though you would hardly gain any xp, you would at
least gain something, and you would feel that your time was spent doing
something useful for your character. What do you think ?<br>
<br>
We wanted to provide an incentive for people to leave an area behind and go
somewhere else when they out-class it. It also makes sense somewhat that once
you are so much more skilled than something, how can you learn from it ? Of
course, then there's the argument that green things can still kill you, so
everything still has its shortcomings I guess.<br>

long awaited on-line interpretation of Tolkein's trilogy is set to arrive at the
same time as the first of the new movies. Ultima Online was ambitious enough,
but Middle Earth intends to support 10,000 players in the game world at once,
with all the action depicted using a 3D engine, and continuous world maps. The
role-playing depth is also astonishing, with the option to place furniture in a
character's house, tame a wild beast, or just get on with plying a trade or
adventuring. Major book characters as NPC s are also set to appear.</font></p>

    do recognize the problem on Fennin Ro (it hit 2600+ people tonight) and we
    are actively putting into place a plan to fix it.</font>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
    plan involves allowing people on Fennin Ro at their option to move to a new
    server that would go up very soon (no ETA yet). Please re-read that last
    part.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yes,
    they would get to keep their items, but beyond that we don't have enough
    details to give out yet. We do think it would be necessary to limit it to X
    number of people (still working out how many) so people that would move
    would have to be 100% sure they were willing to go. It would also involve
    completely moving EVERY character a person has on that server, not
    selectively moving 1-2 characters, otherwise there wouldn't be much of a
    point.</font></li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Give us
a few days and we will announce all the details, but this isn't something that
we plan on waiting very long on.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Also -
and this is very important - we do see other servers getting more people on them
as well. We're going to be putting up 1-2 servers very soon here and we hope
this will really help. Please keep in mind we want to see how things go on
Fennin Ro before we make any other plans.</font>

  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Following EverQuest's release in March,
  the whole gaming industry effectively ground to a halt. At least one prominent
  game developer blamed EverQuest for product delays, and for several weeks
  GameSpot's editors were spending more time exploring Norrath than they were
  doing their jobs. That's because exploring the world Verant created is an
  incredible experience, especially when you can do so with friends. And knowing
  that Norrath will continue to grow, both through Verant's continual addition
  of new zones and the forthcoming expansion, only adds to the impact of the
  game.&quot;</font></p>
