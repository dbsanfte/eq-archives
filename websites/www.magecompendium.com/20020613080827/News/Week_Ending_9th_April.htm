others.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">As people level up, they get
stronger. However NPCs get stronger on a steeper scale. For this reason, the

representative of group abilities. The rate at which this happens varies for all
of the classes.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">NPCs of a higher level MUST be
stronger than a solo player, or groups will tear through them with no problems
and no risk. For this reason, the /con system is not broken. At lower levels it
fairly well represents the abilities of a solo player. At upper levels, it very
closely represents the risk to a full balanced group.</font>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">In working with the people doing the strategy
guide for Kunark we decided to provide them with general information as to what
the stats do.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'm going to post them here.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is a change in the sense that we were not
going to discuss them or release more info. We changed our minds.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That said, we're not posting any formulas, and
it's absolutely true that some stats have considerably more direct impact on
gameplay than others.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We're posting this for clarification, and
because previous explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not,
however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect game play
is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking. Are there better
attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something as
fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a
year.</font>

</font>determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage;
influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">STA </font>: affects how
many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">INT </font>: directly

bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">WIS </font>: affects the
amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers; also affects how quickly
you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT.</font>

you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Why is it that when you are inside
a cottage, house or building creatures can attack you through the wall even
though you cant see them. This basically means in places like Eastern Plaines
of&nbsp; Karana you cant take refuge almost anywhere. Why shouldn't you be able
to get in a house and hide w/o a lion invisibly attacking you through the wall?
this applies to griffins and other creatures as well. Other buildings in other
zones too !</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not really a bug. In order to reduce the amount
of &quot;lag&quot; that can happen due to internet latency, then engine handles
object collisions client-side. Most houses and such are objects (rather than
world geometry) and are subject to this.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It also has the benefit of eliminating a good
number of issues that would have to be dealt with in order to limit possible
exploitation. For instance, if this wasn't the case, someone could sit inside a
house and cast upon a creature that couldn't fit through the open door.</font>

<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1) Thanks for looking into phantom
armor. Would it be possible to change the name to &quot;summoned
leather/chain/plate&quot; for role playing sake when you rework it ? (it would
be wonderful if it was made conj as well, but I know it won't happen)</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We still like the 'Phantom' name. The regenerate
component that we are adding to the spells might not fit 'Phantom' too well, but
at least it sounds cool.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2) Voice graft, please? It's a
RP spell plain and simple and wouldn't affect balance at all.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'll mention it to GZ</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">3) The spear of warding / sword
of runes lost there procs sometime in Jan. Was this intentional ? Any plans to
be fixed/replaced ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Talking to one of the item guys about it now.
Does it just &quot;not proc&quot;, or does it say something like &quot;Item is
out of charges&quot; ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">4) At some point there was a
silent change in that damage shields cast on pets do not last 3x as long as on
people anymore (which hurts your mana efficiency a bit when soloing). I had
always thought that the effect was a bug (as damage shields last forever on most
mobs), but a silent nerf like this is still a bit disheartening. Was that the
case ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">NPCs were treating buff spells differently than
PCs. The point was to keep NPCs in cities from constantly casting buffs on
everyone and everything. Though this part of the code was maintained, special
code was put in so that buffs would wear off of pets at the proper time. We
probably should have announced this.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">5) GZ once said that summoned
items are no-rent because you don't want them to have unlimited effect with a 1
time mana investment, and that if there was some limit on how much say a sword
of runes could be used it would be rentable. Then could all consumable summoned
items loose the no-rent flag ? Waterstones, ammo, food/water &amp; the ring of
flight, come to mind. Pockets, weapons coldstones etc are all fine as no-rent.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We don't have a way to put a time-limit on
items, beyond either making them NORENT for the term of a login session, or
until you zone, so changing this really isn't an option at this point. It does
have the added benefit of requiring that people seek out someone to summon their
items every time they log in. Take the dimensional pouch as an example.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">6) Could invis to undead be
added to the air elementals invisibility spell ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'm sorry, but the ability to be invisible to
both the living and the dead is and will remain a rogue only ability.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Best solution : &quot;Voice of
Zomm&quot; - Allows a mage to directly order his elementals moves for a period
of 30 seconds, just like the eye, only works *only* with an elemental. (Yes,
that's a long rant about one insignificant spell. Give a mage 3 ways to cast a
spell and they start to think it should be useful/fun)</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good point, I'll mention it to GZ. I'm not sure
if this would be possible with limited coding however.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">8) At what level do focus items
begin to affect your elementals ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We leave things like this to the players to
figure out.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">9) Was making all the pets
delay uniform (after the duel wield patch) intentional or a bug ? Will this be
changed ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When we finally allowed them to start dual
wielding, we had to re-evaluate the differing attack speeds. We found them to be
too powerful overall. Rest assured that your pets are more powerful than they
were before since they dual-wield now.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">10) Known bug - Burning out or
fire shielding an invisible elemental often results in it becoming *permanently*
invis.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This must be a real pain for PvP. I'll send
this one to the test team to be sure that it is in the database.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Follow up :</font>&nbsp;
We found the problem with the Sword of Runes, and it should be fixed the next
time we do data. As for the spear of warding, it doesn't have a proc and never
has according to our records.</font></p>

programs is not that big of a deal and if it gets rid of the hackers anyway, I
say go for it. IMO it is not an invasion of privacy to do this. I give out more
information, personal information, every time I use my credit card at the store.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Unfortunately it is a case
where paranoia ended up winning out. I think that we could definitely have done
a better job explaining what it was we were doing, and that would have lead to a
bit more buy-in. Instead, some people decided to make up reports that we were
scanning directory trees (false), internet files (false), internet history
(false), cookies (false), and email (false), and unfortunately many people
believed them.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The general paranoia resulted
from the assumption that we (meaning: our servers) were actively collecting
information from your system. This simply wasn't the case. The client simply
would examine a small subset of information on your system, none of it
containing information personally identifiable to a third party, and only send
it to our server in the event that you were &quot;running&quot; an illegal
program at the same time you ran EQ. We had absolutely no interest in what was
installed on your system, only what you were running when you connected to ours.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">I think privacy is important as
well, but I don't really care about what a piece of client software is doing on
my system. I only care when that piece of client software is transmitting
information from my system to an outside source. In this case, the only time any
data transmission was to take place was when something bad was found by the
client. There was to be no server-side analysis of raw data. I'm sure that most
people would agree that we do have a right to insure that our software license
is being complied with.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">In any case, I guess it's water

information that I don't mind distributing. The benefit of +mana items is scaled
to reduce the impact of twinking in certain circumstances. I can't give you the
formula, but I can say that if you load up your level 1 guy with +300 in mana
items, he doesn't have 300 more mana.</font>

<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I've noticed that many people
complain about how powerful caster pets are compared to the melee classes, and
how a group will sometimes pick a caster with a pet over a melee class so they
can have a caster + tank in one. The casters then complain about how their pets
have been &quot;nerfed&quot;, cutting down on their solo ability. I think I have
an idea how to solve the problem:</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1) Return the pets to full
power (within reason).<br>
2) Make the pets take up Exp at the same rate as a PC of their level during solo
fighting.<br>
3) Make the pets take up Exp at the same rate as a PC of their level during
group fighting.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now, when soloing, the casters
can have the full power pet, but at the cost of giving up the same exp as if
they were teamed with a fighter instead of a pet. They can now solo more, but
are somewhat more likely to look for a partner.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Groups will be less willing to
have a pet in the group, as it is less useful than a tank of the same level, but
costs them the same amount of Exp. Instead, they will want to call upon real
tanks, and wizards. However, a short handed group can still have a pet or 2 with
them if they feel the need.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well? Good idea? Bad idea ?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't necessarily believe that this happens
to any great extent, at least not for dungeon runs. There's certainly a lot to
be said for the brains of a real person even in the few cases that they might be
beaten by a pet.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;casters then complain
  about how their pets have been &quot;nerfed&quot;, cutting down on their solo
  ability.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But I will agree that people do complain about
this.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1) Return the pets to full

  2) Make the pets take up Exp at the same rate as a PC of their level during

  3) Make the pets take up Exp at the same rate as a PC of their level during
  group fighting.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well I can say that returning pets to the way
they were way back when isn't going to happen. Pets were overpowered, and people
really aren't willing to accept an XP penalty in exchange for power.</font>

The only possible thing that could happen is if we adjust the experience

for level 50, we fully expect many people to hit level 51 within minutes of

melusina: maybe you should bring the servers down =)<br>
Aradune: ROFL<br>
Aradune: oh, that would go over well<br>
zer031: you should've been here 30min ago, there was a heated discussion about
the eula then<br>
SonyEsq: Going to be a problem tomorrow night, too, Brad, cause you are bringing
down the servers in the AM, which means I have a dragon to kill in the PM<br>

Aradune peers at lum.<br>
melusina: apparently there was a change<br>
zer031: melusina: I read about in on the EQVault news<br>
Druppy: Aradune, any ideas on the player smithable steel plate? like if its

Aradune: he was laughing too<br>
LumTheMad: Regarding the new EULA<br>
Aradune: we can all laugh at ourselves -- we don't take all this that seriously<br>
DaScott: Hidaglio: that's CT<br>
Ivern: woot<br>
Druppy: mel:?<br>
Hidaglio: DaS: ahh :)<br>
Druppy: melusina: ?<br>
Ivern: just nailed ct<br>
Ivern: df, bf, 2 crooks =D<br>
Ivern: er staves<br>
melusina: Durppy?<br>
melusina: er<br>
Hidaglio: wow that really is aradune :)<br>
melusina: Druppy<br>
LumTheMad: what protections do users have against Verant unilaterally declaring<br>
what is &quot;appropriate&quot; for monitoring?<br>
melusina: yes it really is Hid<br>
melusina: I have my client set to recognize him now =p<br>
SonyEsq: Well, let me try that.<br>
SonyEsq: The limitations are twofold.<br>
SonyEsq: First, the information that is examined is strictly limited to that
which is game related.<br>
zer031: if I understand it correctly the eula will change so that Verant will be
able to do something about the 3rd party softwares amongst other things... or
rather as a legal protection so they can counter these 3rd party programs<br>
SonyEsq: For instance, no one would insist that Verant not examine the EQ
directories during its patch routine<br>
wyrd blinks<br>
SonyEsq: Permit me to finish, please...then I'll get to the next question<br>
SonyEsq: Because, if Verant did not peek, then it would have to patch the entire
game every time it patches.<br>
Hidaglio: Aradune: 1 Q before I go to work, would it be too hard to make fear
repop all at once after a specified time such as 16 hours or something? This
fear farming thing is one of the main reasons I disliked EQ at high levels, a
few guilds work their ass of and die for the equip while a few others just reap
the rewards with no risk<br>
SonyEsq: So, it looks to see what needs updating, and updates.<br>
Aradune: not going to answer anything while SonyEsq speaks, sorry<br>
SonyEsq: Now, secondly, there is a reasonableness standard.<br>
SonyEsq: The standard of reasonableness is not a subjective one, it is an
objective one.<br>
SonyEsq: That means, (this is gonna sound like a pile of legalese, but I didn't
write 200 years of common law)<br>
JeffD: who is sony esq?<br>
Aradune: director of legal and business affairs, scea<br>
JeffD: oh..<br>
Aradune: and a real nice guy too :)<br>
SonyEsq: That means that it is what a &quot;reasonable person, acting with
knowledge of professionals in the industry, would adjudge as fair.<br>
SonyEsq: (close quote).<br>
SonyEsq: So it is Versant's intention, in taking any of these steps, to only do
what is necessary and reasonable to protect the integrity of its game.
Certainly, no more.<br>
SonyEsq: Scrolling up, to make sure that I really answered, instead of saying
what I wanted to say<br>
Aradune: which we feel, btw, is in the interest of the players (that the game
have less cheating)<br>
SonyEsq: Ok...I think I fairly answered that one.<br>
melusina: and, if you have a problem with that, please go play UO =)<br>
LumTheMad: Follow up question, if you don't mind then I'll be quiet<br>
Mystryxx nods in agreement<br>
SonyEsq: Sure, Lum...go for it.<br>
Aradune nods at lum<br>
TheRaver: wow<br>
TheRaver: this fake Q&amp;A session is pretty good<br>
JeffD: hehe<br>
LumTheMad: Given that the monitoring is put into place, what is to prevent an
employee of Verant to use that for his/her own purposes, outside of what is
specified by your agreement? Basically, what protections if any are in place for
misuse.<br>
SonyEsq: Asking for some clarification...k?<br>
LumTheMad: k<br>
LumTheMad: I'm thinking specifically of a repeat of the &quot;GM Darwin&quot;
scenario - someone rogue at Verant, acting without authorization<br>
SonyEsq: Are you asking what practical steps are in place at Verant? Or are you
asking whether Verant is not prohibiting, in the EULA, its employees from using
private information?<br>
LumTheMad: The former... I assume the latter already exists<br>
SonyEsq: Ok...let's think about that for a minute.<br>
JeffD: in other words... my task list is sent to eq.. is it saved in a database?
and who has access to that database.. and what are you doing to ensure the
database cannot be abused by any employees or even accessed<br>
JeffD: wee.. fun with irc on a pda..<br>
SonyEsq: Well, all employees of Verant are under several legal duties.<br>
Aradune: that's like saying that why can't anyone go into the server code and
have it format your drives?<br>
Aradune: only certain programmers have access to server code<br>
Aradune: and its the server code that queries the task list<br>
Aradune: only a programmer could query additional information<br>
Aradune: and only the programmers with access to the server code<br>
Aradune: and the information gathered is written to secure logs<br>
JeffD: aradune, yea, but I some how doubt thats where out stuff is saved... in
fact id guess player task list data collected goes out of the hands of your
admins and into who ever you deemed in charge of tracking down cheaters<br>
Aradune: just as your credit card info is, etc.<br>
Aradune: same principles<br>
Hidaglio: anyone that could take my Q before I go to work :)<br>
Aradune: we already have very sensitive information about you<br>
Aradune: and we protect it<br>
Aradune: the same would be true of task list information<br>
melusina: shush Hid<br>
Hidaglio: bah<br>
JeffD: haha<br>
JeffD: ask it.. I see no rush of questions.. its early<br>
Hidaglio: Aradune: 1 Q before I go to work, would it be too hard to make fear
repop all at once after a specified time such as 16 hours or something? This
fear farming thing is one of the main reasons I disliked EQ at high levels, a
few guilds work their ass of and die for the equip while a few others just reap
the rewards with no risk<br>
Aradune: not going to answer hid, sorry. am here to discuss eula info<br>
JeffD: it repops in 6 hours though<br>
LumTheMad: No fear for you!<br>
Hidaglio: ohh ok ara<br>
melusina: Hid you are playing Quake these days anyway =p<br>
LumTheMad: Can you folks see how such a general EULA clause is raising this
level of concern?<br>
LumTheMad: I mean, it basically says &quot;we can decide what we are looking
for, then go look for it&quot;<br>
Hidaglio: yeah got bored of EQ at high levels its a big soap opera with 1 big
megaguild if you aren't in the big guild EQ is 10% as fun as it could be<br>
Aradune: agreed to a point, lum, which is why we're still contemplating the
language<br>
SonyEsq: Lum, with respect, we disagree as to its generality<br>
LumTheMad: Now, I understand what SonyEQ meant by reasonable standard of
expectation<br>
LumTheMad: &quot;data relating to any program that we, in our reasonable
discretion, determine interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest&quot;<br>
LumTheMad: the key phrase here in my mind is &quot;we determine&quot;<br>
Aradune: lost sonyesq<br>
melusina: its all your fault Aradune<br>
Mystryxx: eek<br>
JeffD: yea bit some may argue in eq.. you going to a virtual dance club using
realplayer on your computer.. but Verant requires they search your computer
looking for DoS pingers and packet sniffers<br>
Aradune: explaining why he hadn't said anything for a while :)<br>
melusina: you made the server split =)<br>
Aradune: I did?<br>
LumTheMad: I got booted too<br>
melusina: --- kidding<br>
Aradune: oh, heh :)<br>
zer031: I think the discussion here really is an old one, there have always been
people arguing for personal privacy... so it's hard to discuss a single case
when the privacy discussion is so much broader<br>
Twiggy-2: gah<br>
JeffD: wow I killed that didn't I...<br>
melusina: =p<br>
Twiggy-2: uo is weak as hell<br>
Twiggy-2: off topic I know<br>
Aradune: hopefully sonyesq returns<br>
DaScott: you may have to sell the fact that people using such programs actually
harm other users<br>
Aradune: twiggy: 150,000 people disagree :)<br>
melusina: he should prolly switch to another server<br>
Twiggy-2: but I need to rant :(<br>
LumTheMad: oh come on Aradune, you're a lawyer, right?<br>
JeffD: nothing like a foot and a half wide key bored to murder a sentence<br>
Twiggy-2: Aradune, I restarted my account like a week ago cause I wanted to pvp
a bit<br>
Twiggy-2: and as it turns out<br>
Aradune: dascott: agreed. if most people don't think its worth it, then there's
an issue<br>
Aradune: lum: hell no :)<br>
Twiggy-2: everybody and his mother is a npk now<br>
SCEA: Man, that stunk<br>
Aradune: glad you're back :)<br>
melusina: there he is<br>
JeffD: I like to think of myself as a lawyer but my reasoning is logic based so
I always become a shitty lawyer ;)<br>
zer031 agrees with DaScott<br>
SCEA: Got bounced, and then it told me that my nickname was in use<br>
Hidaglio: one last thing, I'm not sure but I do believe blizzard lost a law suit
over scanning peoples registries with some of their products if it holds true
don't see why Verant can do it and not blizzard<br>
Aradune: several people got bounced, but most are back<br>
LumTheMad: IRC is evil<br>
SCEA: Then tried about 2348729348 servers.<br>
melusina: Hidaglio is evil, he should be at work already =p<br>
Aradune: did everyone here my club analogy?<br>
LumTheMad: anyway I was saying the issue is really the general nature of the
EULA... I got where you said we differ on that then got booted<br>
Hidaglio: got to be there in 13 mins :)<br>
SCEA: Anyway, what'd I miss while I was in the ether?<br>
melusina: Aradune made a good analogy<br>
Hidaglio: I read the club analogy but thats peoples free will not everyone is
willing to let you look at their registry<br>
HiroHiro: core.com lets just bout anyone on<br>
Aradune: hid, nah, its the same<br>
JeffD: hid... I don't think they lost or won a lawsuit... but that was over
stepping there authority.. afaik eq is only looking at your task list. you cant
get any personal info from a task list<br>
**SCEA is now known as SonyEsq<br>
Aradune: you don't have to go to the club, you don't have to play EQ<br>
Aradune: same thing<br>
LumTheMad: Using that logic you can do almost any privacy violation tho<br>
melusina: you can make the choice to play or not...if you don't want them doing
this, don't play, thats pretty simple<br>
Aradune: on a voluntary basis, yes<br>
DaScott: problem about analogies is you wind up arguing the ifs and butts of the
analogy and not the reality, heh<br>
Aradune: people give up 'right's all the time<br>
DaScott: holy hell I butchered that<br>
SonyEsq: Well, that's why we take great care in tailoring the language to what
is necessary.<br>
Aradune: to do certain things<br>
Twiggy-2: but I have to play :(<br>
Twiggy-2: if you don't want a bloody nose, don't sniff crack<br>
Hidaglio consoles DaScott<br>
Aradune: I go race my car on a race trace, I sign away certain rights to sue the
track<br>
LumTheMad: Using the nightclub analogy tho<br>
Twiggy-2 twitches<br>
Mystryxx_: oww :(<br>
JeffD: heck, if you want to get pissy, countless programs when installed will
pilfer your registry and send your name and email to the commands site, usually
when you register. thats why I never have my full name or a laid email in my
registry (IE is the main program where everyone's name and email is stored)<br>
LumTheMad: wouldn't it be closer to &quot;OK, you've gone to this nightclub for
a year, you kind of like the place&quot;<br>
Sunniegal: OMG.... I can't believe there actually is such a channel<br>
Aradune: and they change their policy, and start padding you down?<br>
LumTheMad: &quot;and now you have to allow us to search your trunk and car for
drugs before we let you in&quot;<br>
Vap1d: erm anybody know if I can run eq on win2k with a tnt2 card?<br>
Aradune: yes, exactly<br>
Aradune: agreed lum<br>
SonyEsq: Lum, let's remember something<br>
Aradune: I'm sure it happens<br>
SonyEsq: When you first entered that nightclub, there was a sign on the door.<br>
Hidaglio: EQ and Win2k currently don't like each other very much<br>
wyrd just wants info on new servers. *sniff*<br>
Aradune: there is an incident at the club, and so they made a new policy, and
they start searching backpacks<br>
Hidaglio: I'm really gone to work now I'm gonna be late<br>
Aradune: even tho they didn't before<br>
SonyEsq: It said &quot;We reserve the right to change our rules at any
time&quot;..<br>
DaScott: Sunniegal: an eq channel? 55k people playing a time and there's a
channel about it on irc? who would have thought<br>
Sunniegal: :)...<br>
Sunniegal: I dunno... I haven't played everquest in like .... forever<br>
SonyEsq: Now, let's remember that we're all reasonable people. And we don't go
putting in unreasonable rules.<br>
JeffD: there other imitation channels on loser networks but this is the best...
efnet forever.. yo<br>
Mystryxx_: its like DUH people!!! remember!?! You're in OUR world now :D :D<br>
Sunniegal: ahhaha<br>
SonyEsq: But just like the EULA said from day 1 that we could change it, so the
nightclub would have a sign saying the same thing...<br>
melusina: well I think ultimately its not going to be a problem for anyone
unless they are breaking the rules<br>
LumTheMad: DoubleClick said they were reasonable folks too, remember.<br>
Twiggy-2: aaggh<br>
Aradune: I'm actually not familiar with doubleclick<br>
Aradune: are you sonyesq?<br>
DaScott: It's legal to change the rules, it's just not generally popular<br>
LumTheMad: DoubleClick is the largest ad banner network<br>
SonyEsq: Well...can we agree that taking steps to prevent cheating, hacking and
taking down the servers is reasonable?<br>
melusina: rules have to change and evolve...otherwise what's the point?<br>
LumTheMad: they decided to start matching names to ad banner cookies<br>
DaScott: last I checked you guys weren't afraid to make unpopular decisions<br>
Aradune grins at DaScott<br>
LumTheMad: &quot;so your ad banner experience could be better tailored to your
buying preferences&quot;<br>
Twiggy-2: as long as Verant doesn't turn into osi or fuck with my mp3s they can
do whatever they want with my hard drive<br>
SonyEsq: Ahh...but Lum, that's a &quot;commercial exploitation&quot; purpose.
Can we agree that this is different?<br>
LumTheMad: Sure<br>
Aradune: this is to create a better playing environment for our playerbase<br>
JeffD: hehe.. I read today's news post on eqvault and had a moment of happiness
when I heard a new eq front-end would be downloaded.. thinking &quot;yes!
finally eq will actually have a speedier logon and not the load times of an old
floppy disk based game of 1992&quot;.. then it just said a new online store
button was going to&nbsp; be put in... boy did that happiness fade..<br>
LumTheMad: bear in mind I'm not a lawyer either mind you<br>
SonyEsq: Jeff, that's to save you from having to go to the store and pay $40 for
a $17 expansion (plus S&amp;H, the lawyer says)<br>
LumTheMad: I just think it sets a really bad precedent that could go beyond the
gaming industry<br>
melusina: JeffD, I think there really has to come a time when you have to
examine your life when your happiness or unhappiness is measured by what's
happening with a game<br>
Mystryxx_: hahahaha mel<br>
SonyEsq: Lum, I understand your concern.<br>
DaScott: Well considering that I've been a fan of two multiplayer games that
were trashed by cheating (being called a quake bot in every game I ever played,
and the starcraft map hack) I'm generally for any anti cheating measure anyhow.<br>
SonyEsq: That's why we're taking great pains to explain that any actions will be
very carefully circumscribed.<br>
Twiggy-2: eek<br>
LumTheMad: Maybe an additional paragraph in the EULA - even if not legally
required - stating what would be searched for and to what use it was taken -
would satisfy some of that concern<br>
Twiggy-2: oh I misread that<br>
Aradune: dascott: thats the issue, really. do most players agree with you that
giving up some privacy is worth having a game with less cheating?<br>
LumTheMad: well<br>
LumTheMad: it's more a question of &quot;is the game worth the loss of privacy
you suffer&quot;<br>
melusina: I agree, but I never had my playing experience ruined by cheaters
before, and I would prefer to keep it that way<br>
DaScott: Aradune: yeah but those are the same people who think you are
collecting data to assimilate them into Microsoft<br>
Aradune: agreed lum, same thing, I think<br>
LumTheMad: I mean, if a game started downloading a list of progs I had installed
&quot;for marketing purposes&quot; I'd uninstall it in a heartbeat<br>
melusina: but what &quot;real&quot; privacy are you losing?<br>
SonyEsq: Lum, darn right.<br>
Aradune: lum, so would I<br>
Toretzu: Aradune- I really just question how much cheaters can do with
Everquest's design. And is it worth these resources and hassle<br>
Ivern: personally I'd trade any privacy you want if you let me ctrl-esc from the
game<br>
Twiggy-2: heh<br>
Ivern: I'd really really like to be able to go afk, task switch and read my mail
etc<br>
DaScott: Toretzu: enough to get an advantage over other players, basically<br>
Aradune: toretzu: thats the question, which is why we're here debating it. if
most players don't think its worth giving up the privacy then we're not
interested in doing it<br>
Twiggy-2: ya thats the only coo thing about uo<br>
Twiggy-2: you can put it into window mode and check irc or something<br>
LumTheMad: are you guys going to publish the poll results?<br>
Ivern: yeah<br>
Aradune: lum: I believe so, but its up to smed<br>
LumTheMad: I think the poll is pretty badly worded btw<br>
Ivern: my main problem is I many times ctrl-esc by accident...I'm ctrl-arrowkey'ing
to target a mob, esc to clear target boom<br>
Twiggy-2: oo a poll?<br>
Ivern: I go ld =/<br>
LumTheMad: but there's some good suggestions in that gameplay thread it was on<br>
Aradune: lum: if you have a better wording, please send it to us. we're all ears<br>
Twiggy-2 dances around<br>
Toretzu: DaScott: yeah, from my understanding of ShowEQ, it's negligible<br>
Toretzu: Ok, Diablo...<br>
SonyEsq: Lum, I played on Fennin Ro for a long time, before the server split.<br>
SonyEsq: And an awful lot of people couldn't get anything because people would
run around with ShowEQ and suck up all the rares.<br>
DaScott: why are we getting info about mobs that aren't in your general location
anyhow. I guess I'm used to quake's line of sight stuff..<br>
melusina: hehe<br>
LumTheMad: well, before that they'd just get a pet druid<br>
LumTheMad: but yeah, SEQ is a huge problem<br>
melusina: you are lucky you are voiced =)<br>
melusina: or you would have gotten kicked when you said that horrid word =)<br>
Druppy_: EQ Caused me to fail a class, can I sue? ;)<br>
Aradune is glad we have a legal director who is also a level 50 in EQ =)<br>
LumTheMad: and UOE really wasted about a year of UO's time<br>
Elementar: SonyEsq - What about the legalities of selling our everquest
accounts. Do you guys have plans to stop ebay selling for good. Or just have
that in the EULA to protect yourselves (which I understand is fair).<br>
SonyEsq: Moreover...since people could see where the MOBs were at any given
point in time, zones like fear and hate would be easier for them.<br>
SonyEsq: So you'd have a bunch of people, with the pullers running ShowEQ,
smoking those zones.<br>
JeffD: sony, big deal, the current front end is ass... #1 patch is slow, #2 the
program has an orgy with your video card before the EULA pops up, then the 3 gay
logo screens ..blah blah... id kill for a window based front end that popped the
eula, ran the patch, asked for login and pass, gave a server list, and then
loaded eq all without having to load graphics and initialise my graphics card,
something eq is a SLOTH at<br>
SonyEsq: Verant would see those zones getting smoked, conclude that there wasn't
a challenge, and make em harder.<br>
SonyEsq: So the people who didn't cheat would get reamed.<br>
SonyEsq: (please note, this is from a player's perspective, not a lawyer's
perspective)<br>
melusina nods<br>
LumTheMad: I got to take your word on all that, my highest level active char is
like level 14 :P<br>
LumTheMad: no rares for me!<br>
Aradune: yeah, we know you're a big eq fan lum :)<br>
melusina: thats definitely a problem for us little people who struggle and are
only level 34 after over a year of playing =p<br>
Toretzu: knowing when a monster spawns or having a map of the zone? How much
advantage can that really be<br>
Toretzu: !!@# get reid of that wordkick already. getting old<br>
LumTheMad: but yes, I understand the problem<br>
Toretzu: yay for lag<br>
Ivern: I'd like an answer to elementar's question btw<br>
LumTheMad: oh I play a bunch, I just suck at it<br>
Ivern: I'm curious myself about how far you intend to pursue the 'no selling'
rule<br>
DaScott: actually I don't see how it gives an advantage aside from item farming
really<br>
LumTheMad: I'm antisocial, I hate to group<br>
Aradune: oh -- I thought you didn't care for it, but other guys on your site
did. sorry.<br>
LumTheMad: heh, no, that's asherons call. I'm the only one on my site who plays
EQ I think<br>
DaScott: but item farming is bad enough. I mean I know a guy who literally does
nothing but KS bilge and sell the loot on ebay<br>
Aradune: lum: ah, ok, sorry<br>
LumTheMad: yes item farming is a HUGE problem and no one is complaining about
the ebay part of this I don't think<br>
melusina contemplates making asheron's call a wordkick too =p<br>
Ivern: well<br>
LumTheMad: and no one is saying &quot;Yes, give us the right to cheat!&quot;<br>
Twiggy-2: item farming for ebay gets on my nerves<br>
SonyEsq: Toretzu, it's a great advantage.<br>
SonyEsq: Because you know without the feigner getting up, or doing anything,
where to grab singles (for instance)<br>
SonyEsq: Also because you know at any point in time where the patrollers are,
and can avoid them without seeing them and aggro'ing them.<br>
Elementar: To me the eBay issue is a big thing. I currently have 4 accounts I
play. I bought these for hard cash and sometime in the future would like to sell
them again. If they have no value, I would just stop paying my monthly fees for
them and just keep the one I play.<br>
SonyEsq: (By the way, I haven't really discussed with Brad my strong feelings on
ShowEQ)...we just happen to agree.<br>
Ivern: I don't farm...I don't have the time for it and I don't find it fun, but
I HAVE sold surplus gear on ebay in the past I want to know if that will be
illegal from now on<br>
Aradune: I just hate cheating in a multiplayer environment. it hurts the game,
and it hurts the other players<br>
DaScott: SonyEsq: heh that's definitely taking it to the extreme but I can see
that<br>
Aradune: we are just trying to protect the players<br>
JeffD: server lag flood<br>
Aradune: and so the question is, are the players in general willing to give up
some privacy to be protected more against cheating<br>
Aradune: I think thats the crux of the issue<br>
melusina: it just seems like the game wouldn't be fun if you had a program like
showeq<br>
SonyEsq: DaScott, I've seen it happen...honest.<br>
LumTheMad: If the level of privacy being given up is VERY CLEARLY DEFINED, yes<br>
LumTheMad: My wife seriously is pissed that you potentially could snoop our
financials<br>
zer031: I agree with what DaScott said a while back, we've seen other games
having their play value diminished with the use of 3rd party programs, and
therefore I can live with this change<br>
JeffD: oh btw... brad, uhmm... you guys all said this week you would be updating
the data files... why is the server downtime at 2 hours? I thought these things
take 5 or 6<br>
Aradune: lum: any program you use to access the net theoretically could<br>
LumTheMad: is what is sent back to Verant (process list, etc) encrypted or sent
plaintext?<br>
SonyEsq: I was in Hateplane before Brad screwed up the drops, and a nonguild
monk was suspiciously getting around the patrollers...we finally figured out
how...:)<br>
Aradune: we're saying that we have no interest in doing so<br>
melusina: but *wouldthey Lum, and why *wouldthey? and what kind of manpower
would that take? I mean seriously...isn't that just taking paranoia to an
extreme?<br>
Elementar: I personally wouldn't give up my privacy to play the game, but thats
just me. Others might. I think most 25 and over will seriously think about it.<br>
Vap1d: bleh anybody know if I can get eq working on win2k with a tnt2 vid card?
=\<br>
LumTheMad: I'm not saying they WOULD melusina...<br>
JeffD: vap, get the latest beta drivers...<br>
Elementar: Aradune &amp; SonyEsq - Anyway to give a short response on the eBay
question?<br>
SonyEsq: Lum, please remember the very narrow language.<br>
Rub-A-Dub: Is it true that scans such as the ones being discussed now have
actually been happening all along?<br>
Vap1d: just installed them eq is just saying no 3d device found when I try to
run it<br>
SonyEsq: Verant does NOT seek, nor would it seek, permission to look at your
personal financial information.<br>
SonyEsq: That information is none of anybody's business.<br>
DaScott: SonyEsq: heh.. they took away the amulet of necropotence scouting
method and it made hate no harder than it was before. I hope something gets
beefed up now that roamers are a slower spawn, because we've been killing
innoruuk in 2 1/2 hours on a full pop..<br>
melusina: exactly my point<br>
Druppy: SonyEsq: I hate most of Verant's decisions but GRATS on that ebay thing!<br>
DaScott: but now I'm talking gameplay stuff and you aren't here for that<br>
JeffD: vap, you messed something up... you want the detonator drivers btw<br>
melusina: they have no reason to at all<br>
Aradune: I don't want to talk ebay, btw, but rather focus on the scanning for
cheating programs issue<br>
Aradune: just so we stay on topic<br>
LumTheMad: I know. I'm giving that as an example of &quot;instant
reaction&quot;. Why some added text explaining what is meant by &quot;reasonable
discretion, interferes with Everquest&quot; would be helpful<br>
SonyEsq: Well, Lum, a couple of reasons. First, there is simplicity in brevity.<br>
Toretzu: well, I agree that task scanning will slow down users of the windows
hacks... but it's not going to do much on the original linux version of sh0weq<br>
SonyEsq: Anything I were to add to the language would simply raise yet more
questions.<br>
Elementar: Sorry. Just trying to figure out what I should do with my extra
accounts. If they have no cash value. why would I want to keep paying $9.95 a
month for them if I don't play them anymore. Heck, I have been paying for 3
accounts for over 6 months and haven't played them at all but didn't cancel
cause they had real cash value.<br>
LumTheMad: A lawyer? Being brief? *falls out of chair*<br>
Druppy: Aradune: do you have a way to scan for sh-ow-eq I hate that some ppl
just know all the stuff when its pops :=(<br>
melusina: Elementar, thats pretty much your own fault isn't it?<br>
SonyEsq: Hey, look at the two new phrases. Count those words, man. Lucky I'm not
being paid by the word.<br>
LumTheMad: that's kinda what we're talking about Druppy<br>
Druppy: cool<br>
Elementar: yep. guess it is. hehe, I am going to go shut them off right now. =)<br>
Druppy is also playing EQ atm so I'm missing large chunks of the convo :)<br>
Elementar: at worst I have 30 days to sell them or till the billing cycle ends.<br>
DaScott: may want to mention on some public forum that the only
&quot;cheat&quot; is receiving limited info on mobs. I hate listening to people
rant about cheats that don't exist<br>
Twiggy-2: hehe<br>
LumTheMad: Here's another theoretical that you guys may not be able to/want to
answer...<br>
DaScott: You know, &quot;hey how did you hack yourself that last name&quot;<br>
Twiggy-2: people in general are idiots<br>
Twiggy-2: they seem to flock to everlore<br>
JeffD: das, haha<br>
melusina: they are everywhere Twiggy<br>
LumTheMad: SEQ is usually run on 2 PCs (1 for EQ one for SEQ). Any plans to
probe end user's networks looking for it?<br>
Twiggy-2: yea<br>
Twiggy-2: but I haven't seen a gathering like everlore before<br>
LumTheMad: I don't even know if it's POSSIBLE mind you but that raises a whole
new can of worms I'd think<br>
Twiggy-2: any item/spell has at least two posts from complete idiots<br>
DaScott: really shouldn't be possible<br>
Druppy: its not really possible to probe for SEQ because its a passive
interceptor<br>
Elementar: SoneyEsq - Here is a pretty direct question on the EULA. Lets say I
have SEQ source code on my machine. Are you going to be banning for this. I read
before that you send back data about wether or not MSVC is running or not.<br>
SonyEsq: Lum, gonna let Brad answer that; I'm not technical enough to answer it.<br>
Aradune: lum: we don't have any plans to search networks, and I don't think the
eula change says we reserve the right to either<br>
SonyEsq: Elementar, all that Verant cares about at the present time is whether
you are running it. Not whether it is installed.<br>
JeffD: actually.. what I want to know.... is veeshan jus getting jipped by big
events? in a screen shot of that guy who first got the FA.. there was not ne but
TWO guys who had &quot;titles&quot;... and neither where dwarves so it wasn't
from the bb event... what's up with that?<br>
kaiser: bah.. that program is a plague =/<br>
LumTheMad: he he he<br>
DaScott: he got the title for some random thing on a whim. Which is weird
because GM's basically say they aren't allowed to do so<br>
LumTheMad: &quot;at the present time&quot;<br>
kaiser: makes my ranger useless =/<br>
Aradune: elementar: we are currently just looking at programs that are running<br>
Elementar: SonyEsq - So in actuality all you guys are going to be doing is
sending back the list of running programs (task list) right? Why don't you just
say that in the EULA, and avoid all this hassle?<br>
LumTheMad: That's really the whole point.... &quot;we reserve the right to add
things&quot;<br>
SonyEsq: But Lum, remember -- they must be related to EQ, and they must be
reasonable. Judged objectively.<br>
DaScott: I still think it's not legally necessary to display the EULA every time
you load the program.. should only pop up if changed<br>
SonyEsq: Not judged by me, or Versant's CFO...but by a reasonable person.<br>
LumTheMad isn't very reasonable<br>
DaScott: do you REALY have to agree every time esq?<br>
Toretzu: DaScott- agreed.<br>
Aradune noticed that :)<br>
DaScott: and yes we really are that lazy<br>
Twiggy-2: heh<br>
Twiggy-2: tab space is a lot of keys<br>
Twiggy-2: or enter depending on where the hand is when it pops up<br>
Twiggy-2 goes on and on without a point<br>
JeffD: actually its not being lazy.. its the fact that every time eq crashes..
you ld.. or you lock up.. you have to go through the sloth known as EQ's
front-end<br>
DaScott: that's all I have on the eula thing.. poll going up tomorrow?<br>
Aradune: poll should go up in the morning, yes<br>
Worth-: Is the poll gonna matter?<br>
Rub-A-Dub: what were the results from the last poll... regarding play nice?<br>
JeffD: brad, you answer that Q about if the data files where being patched
today?<br>
DaScott: who do you sucker into doing an update at 5am? Narris? heh<br>
LumTheMad: well I'm going to punch out and file my update, it's almost 4a
here... my wife has a few more questions I'm sure, she's even more concerned

useless.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I would like to see the pet
cast something more useful. Something like blind, poision, dot, slow melee spell
etc., or something the pet cast on it self to make up for the vary weak spell it
casts currently. Make it worth researching. I think the last water pet direct
damage is like around 30 damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">While I'm at it I would like to
see the fire pet direct damage spell raised a little also. The highest spell it
casts is like 50. I would like to see the spell raised so the direct damage does
the level of the pet x 2. But I'm more concerned about the water pet right now.</font></p>

:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End User License Agreement Changed</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">In addition to this change
[adding the ability to buy the upgrade through the login server interface], we
will also be modifying our User Agreement and Software License to add in some
additional Terms and Conditions that we will require everyone to agree to before
playing EverQuest. The first of these changes concerns the selling of EverQuest
Characters and Items outside of the game (i.e. things like Ebay). Here is the
text of this change:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">&quot;You may not sell or
auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or copyrighted material.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">You may ask why we are doing
this. There are many reasons, but first and foremost of them is the amount of
trouble this is causing our Customer Service group. Simply put there are a lot
of people out there who defraud others and we are being put in the middle of it,
and we don't have the time or the resources to assist people with these disputes
when they arise. The next reason is a more philosophical one and that is that we
believe people should have to earn their items and characters in the game rather
than from buying them outside the game. Obviously the second point can be argued
from other perspectives that we do in fact respect, but we wanted you to hear
ours.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">The next change to the User
Agreement and Software license concerns our efforts to stop people from hacking
EverQuest and from doing malicious acts that we feel can affect EverQuest as an
ongoing business concern. We have developed the technology to check for these
hacking tools/programs and report that fact back to us. Without getting into the
specifics of this technology, I can say that we in no way will search a user's
hard drive (aside from the EverQuest directory during the patching process),
registry nor will we send back any information other than the fact that a user
is in fact running one of these programs (specifically we are NOT sending
information about everything the user is running back to our servers). It's
disturbing that the amount of recent developments in the hacking community force
us to do this.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Many will say &quot;ShowEQ&quot;
isn't worth worrying about. To us, it's cheating and it's not something we can
allow in a game like EverQuest where it affects other people's enjoyment of the
game. In addition, although this is the first time we'll be acknowledging this,
ShowEQ isn't the worst offender. Recently we had someone attempting to bring
down our servers with another malicious program. We were able to quickly
identify what was going on and insure this didn't happen again, but nonetheless
the potential is there and we need to be able to quickly identify and stop these
types of programs. Again, I want to say it clearly that we will in NO WAY send
any information back to the Everquest servers other than information regarding
programs that we feel interfere with the intended operation of EverQuest. We
have had this technology available for some time, but recently we've found it's
going to be necessary to go to greater lengths to stop this kind of thing. To
those of you concerned about privacy (and rightly so) I want to say that we feel
it's necessary to do this but we want you to be informed that we are going to
try these measures to protect both ourselves and the game's players.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">Here is the text of this change
:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0">&quot;You hereby grant us
permission to download Game-related files to you. You also grant us permission
to access, extract and upload (i) Game-related data as part of the patching
process and (ii) data relating to any program that we, in our reasonable
discretion, determine interferes with the proper operation of EverQuest.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Corpse recovery is always a
challenge and sometimes even dreaded. There should definitely be an auto equip
button by double left clicking on equip or something. This should definitely be
looked at because here are some reasons:</font></p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">People who have slow computers are
at a disadvantage because people who have computers that run at regular speeds
see the game as how it runs compared to people with slower computers see
something happening slower. So lets say your friend Mr. Moneybags has a fast
computer and he starts fighting a kodiak. at 1:00 and finally Mr. Slowjoe sees
his friend battling at 1:01. (maybe an exaggeration, don't know how much time
difference)</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Corpse retrieval is slow enough
as is and this could not be abused in anyway.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It is annoying to have to click
and drag especially if you have full equipment and are in a dangerous area.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It wouldn't hurt to put it on
the test server !</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Back in beta when you right-clicked on items on
your corpse you would auto-equip the items. I believe it was changed to add an
aspect of realism to looting your corpse. Sure, it doesn't take the 30 minutes
it would really take to climb into a suit of plate, but it isn't exactly
instantaneous either.</font></p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Is it really true that 2/3 of the
quests in the game are yet unfound, and there are 90 caster robes yet
undiscovered ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No. There are quite a few, but not that many.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Do you have plans to allow a
command so pet classes can be told the level of their pets ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Probably not, no - can't you roughly determine
it's level anyway ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Will there ever be a message so
we know if a rogue is trying to pickpocket when he claims he is not ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Interesting idea - we'll toss it around.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Why haven't you answered
questions based on the many stat tests players were told to perform by Verant ?
Specifically, when these test results were posted why didn't you make an
appearance ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I believe Abashi has addressed the stat issue
several times.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Do you have an estimate on when
or if the main storyline of EverQuest will have an even stronger affect on the
players as a whole in the future? (GM Events, new quests introduced etc.)</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I think this will happen over time as we do
more GM Events and get more static quests in the game (which often reveal the
history of the world).</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Humans in EverQuest. What is
the Vision on them and what is their place in Norrath.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The intent was that they would be neither great
nor poor at any one thing. They have the most flexibility when it comes to class
selection. Their stats are fairly middle-of-the-road.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Apart from RP, What do the
players get from selecting Humans as their play choice (and getting mediocre
stats and being night blind) ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More class selection and one of races on the
lower end of the experience needed table.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Abashi hinted that there were
class equivalent or near equivalent weapons to the Fiery Avenger in EverQuest.
Are there indeed weapons which we haven't found yet (hard to believe) which
involve quests other than Plain of Sky alone (which can't be done until after
the expansion).</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are a few very powerful unfound items,
yes. Fiery Avenger status items, particle effects and all, are still coming for
the other classes and will take us some time.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I know you don't want to answer
questions about the future, but how about some hints on these new melee skills ?
I'm getting quite jealous looking through the Kunark spell list in Castersrealm.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Can't say yet, sorry.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">What is this &quot;Vision&quot;
I keep hearing of. I have never heard from your words exactly what the
&quot;Vision&quot; was intended to be. Not a flame here, just a question.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It would probably take me pages to answer this
properly, but in a nutshell here goes: to recapture and recreate the fun people
had grouping together and going out on quests and adventure playing paper &amp;
pencil games in an online virtual world; to create a successful, fun, and
popular graphical MUD.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Can there be more Dynamic GM
quests ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, and we hope to have more in the future.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Why are JBoots, such an
incredible item that it vastly imbalance the game in outdoor areas, still in the
game? Shouldn't this item be made more available to everyone or just dropped ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We felt that after addressing the kiting issue
some months ago, making it not as abusable, that Jboots no longer &quot;vastly
imbalanced&quot; the game.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In all seriousness... I don't
know how specific this question is. but are dark elf clerics ever going to get
any race and class specific quests ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I will ask about that.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Why can't we bash with the
Unicorn Shield ? Any fix in the near future ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I believe the shield is more of a weapon -
&quot;fixing&quot; it implies it is broken in the first place, which I don't
believe is accurate.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Can someone please explain why
the tests on stats are incorrect? Our tests show a negligible impact on melee
ability with their use. Can you please post an example to demonstrate where we
are going wrong in our testing ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some stats certainly have more of a direct
impact on the game than others. This is by design.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Would it be possible to attach
a server designation to each .opt file on our end so that when we play
characters on different servers, it doesn't use the same global file for hotkey
assignments ? Whenever I play on another server, I have to redo my hotkeys every
time because each char name has only one .opt file irregardless of the server.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It would be possible but would require a bit of
programming and I'd probably prioritize it fairly low, but we'll see what we can
do.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In the expansion, will there be
any new classes available for any of the existing races ? i.e. like having
Halfling bards or rangers ?&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No, just the new race.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Server crashes, item and exp
loss from hardware failure at Verant -- why is the burden on the players and not
on Verant when this happens ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Loaded question. Both players and Verant are
burdened when there is data loss and neither of them are happy about such
occurrences.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Are more relaxed item and exp
reimbursement policies planned ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not in general, no.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Are monetary compensations like
free 1 month playtime for affected players feasible ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No, data loss, albeit rare, is unavoidable at
times. Compensation as you describe would indeed not e feasible.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Why would a mob that is
obviously far, far tougher than the con system have you believe actually be low
blue. i.e. : Why is that guard that just kicked my ass not yellow or even ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The higher level you get, the more we expect
you to be grouping. The 'con' system assumes, over time, that you are grouping
more and more - it does not necessarily assume you are alone. Also, the color is
an indication of the experience you will receive from killing the NPC, while the
text is supposed to indicate difficulty.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Why are there very few mobs in
outdoor zones for people 40+ (aside from the nasty sorts like sea furies,
etc...) is this to slow people down once they get to level 40+ ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While we'd like people to group more and more
and to enter dungeons and such at higher levels, we do agree that higher level
outdoor areas are needed and you will see several in Kunark, including a 40+
outdoor zone.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Will shaman ever be able to
shrink in outdoor areas ? i.e. to fit in the bank in Kelethin.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unlikely. There are supposed to be size
penalties in the game, depending on the race you've chosen for your character.
Over time, we've implemented more and more ways to overcome the size restriction
and I think we've gone far enough.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">What will it take for you to
admit there may be need to change the Vision ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whenever something doesn't turn out the way we
wanted, or whenever it did but the desired effect failed to occur, we adjust the
Vision (if it's possible to do so). The Vision is both pure in its
idealistic form and flexible when it comes to what really works and doesn't
work.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">EQ tuning is not by mob rule, I
agree; but 99% of your customer base are up in arms over the melee class bind
issues (or lack thereof). What will it take to break such an inflexible Vision.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I definitely think your 99% number is greatly
exaggerated. Changing binding would change the pace of the game for both melee
and caster classes. It would also lessen the death penalty. We've no intention
of changing the binding rules.</font>
