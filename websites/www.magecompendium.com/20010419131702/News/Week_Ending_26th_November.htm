<p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">
Over the past several months, there have been a large number of Mage-related
posts on this board, very few of which have received a formal response. To make
Verant's life a little easier, I have decided to compile those concerns below.</font></span>
<p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I do necessarily agree with all these concerns, and I will append my own
opinions where appropriate. Please excuse me if I miss something (I most
certainly will).</font></span>

<p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Recent Concerns</font></span>
  <p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  Since the last patch, it has been speculated that the proc rate on sword of
  runes has decreased.</font></span></p>
  <p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My take:<br>
  Verant has stated in the past that weapons do not have a proc rate. Proc rate
  is dependant upon the wielder. I thus infer that if the proc rate on SoR has
  decreased, it is a direct result of a change in our pets' dexterity. Please
  comment, Verant. Have you lowered the dexterity on Mage pets?</font></span>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think, by now, you all know the answer to this one. The proc rate on
  all pet weapons has been reduced to be the same as any player character with
  the same dexterity.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  It has been speculated that CotH has been altered such that it's chance of
  clearing aggro has been greatly reduced. It has also been altered so that
  CoHing a pet caster does not cause his pet to suicide.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My take:<br>
  This is terrible, if it is true. CotH is the defining spell of the 55+ Mage.
  This is akin to increasing the resist rate of lures for wizards or making
  complete heal heal a random number of hitpoints in the range of 1 to max_hp
  for a cleric. If this is true, it takes what is arguably our best spell and
  renders it unreliable ... and all Mages should justly be up in arms. Please
  comment, Verant. Was CotH stealth nerfed?</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here's what I know. Call of the Hero will probably never always clear
  the hate list. And we haven't changed anything (that we know of) that reduced
  the chance that it would clear the hate list. But we have a possible fix ready
  to be patched that might increase the chance of the hate list being cleared.
  The same goes for the pet suicide thing, we should have a fix for that in the
  next patch.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Velious Spells</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  The current DoTs as listed in the spdat file are less mana efficient than our
  bolts. At their current efficiency, they are basically unusable, particularly
  because of associated stacking issues.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My take:<br>
  I am not concerned with these spells as of yet, both because I am aware that
  they are not finalized and because I do see a use. This spell gives Mages a
  high-lvl magic based nuke/dot (before SoS) that will allow Mages more
  flexibility in fire-based zones like Skyfire. These spells also supposedly
  have a stun component ... but if it is the same as our shocks, this is a
  non-factor. Personally, I would like to see these spells changed to
  Conjuration.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm not discussing Scars of Velious spells. But I'm not going to
  discourage you from talking about them.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Traditional Issues</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
Linkdeath. Mages suffer from this more than any other class, since our startup
  summoning routines (depending upon the situation) can consume anywhere from 2
  bubbles to our full mana bar.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  I almost never go linkdead. However, during the recent snafu involving
  connectivity in Boston and SF, I went linkdead every ten minutes. (I live in
  Cambridge, MA, btw) It was extremely frustrating and was compounded tenfold by
  the fact that I was a Mage. I was basically unable to play for 5 days. Thus, I
  understand the concerns of those who have a less stable connection than I, and
  I think that this problem needs to addressed as soon as possible. Please
  comment, Verant. I would suggest fixing the problem that caused the change in
  LD code and then reverting to the previous LD system (where one had a set time
  to return). Several good suggestions have also been made regarding saving
  character status upon LD in the form of a buff.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Always been that way, since day one. This is one of the drawback of
  magehood. We just can't program around accidental link death, we can't tell it
  from purposeful linkdeath.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Absor later posted a clarification of this statement:</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The problem here is well known, when you leave the game by linkdeath or
  /q, the game won't let you back in right away. Because of this, magicians lose
  their summoned items when they return. I knew all that.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What I was trying to say is that losing your items upon disconnect was
  always the way it was (a lot of us couldn't reconnect fast enough). This isn't
  really a new thing.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  Post-50 pet upgrades. Mages are not Necros, Enchanters, or Shamen. Those
  classes are all great, with or without pets. A Mage is worthless without a
  pet. He is a poor wizard in a group (very poor) and dead if he is soloing.
  Magicians have decent nukes, but no longer hold the number two slot after RoK.
  Magicians have the Malise line (useless in some situation, very good in
  others). Magicians have fireshields (see somment for malise line). Magicians
  have mod rods (very good in most group contexts). That is all Mages have. 80%
  of our power comes from our pets. If you tell an enchanter that his pets
  increase 5% in power between 50 and 60, he shrugs and wonders, &quot;Who uses
  those silly things anyway?&quot; The shamen are hurt minimally (though I agree
  that the cost on their pet is ridiculous). Necros ARE hurt by this, but then
  again, Necros can solo without their pets (and in fact frequently do so for
  exp reasons, on mobs like the raptors in TD). Ever seen a Mage do that? It is
  not possible.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  I do not feel that Mages are particularly underpowered at 60 (note that I'm
  not there yet). However, I do feel that they don't really increase in
  power between 50 and 60. That is a serious problem, because it introduces a
  question of incentive. I personally have seen or read about dozens of 50+
  Mages quit over this issue, and this saddens me. It should sadden you too
  Verant. Getting from 50 to 60 encompasses about half the life of a character,
  and yet Mages see a 5% increase in strength? We basically have CotH to which
  we may aspire ... at 55. Please reconsider your pet policy post-50, Verant,
  particularly regarding Mages. We are our pets. Nothing more. Nothing
  less.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, this one baffles me a bit. I, frankly, don't know enough about
  high level pets. All I can tell you is that I'll look at it and ask questions.
  But, by way of warning, understand that nobody was promised that they would
  become super powerful post-50.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  Post-50 fire pet.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  This is ridiculous. Fix it, please.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, I dunno. I'll look at it, with the same caveat as the last one.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  Deafening Decoy. This pet is not a decoy. Its taunt is ineffective.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My take:<br>
  I like this pet, though I wish it would have a different graphic. At this
  point, a certain bug in the game deters me from requesting that the taunt
  effect be fixed. If more than 3 or 4 mobs attack a pet simultaneously, they
  begin to hit the pet's controller through the mob, regardless of
  distance. These hits seem to be based on the controller's AC (all I know is
  that I am always hit for full). Please fix this bug, Verant, so that I can get
  rid of my eboots =) Maybe then we can look at the Decoy.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This one is new to me. You should explain this in depth, especially if
  you want this to be the defining thread on the mage class. I understood the
  previous two because I had read them elsewhere, but this one is out of
  left-field for me.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">[The mob hitting through pet] I thought this bug was fixed. It's been a
  while since I've seen it. I'll ask about it. If you can tell me how to
  reproduce this bug, we'll gladly find it and squash it.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  Post-50 spells in general. Mage summons are largely junk. Our spell lines see
  only minor upgrades in RoK, certainly not in keeping with mob increases.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  All classes lag in comparison to mobs in RoK. Sebilis, Chardok, and Charasis
  are not meant to be soloed (although certain parts of Seblis and Chardok can
  be). I have no problem with our nukes, the malise line, or our personal
  shielding line post-50. The summons, on the other hand, are a joke. I would
  have liked to see an upgrade to SoRs, coldstone (serpent sight), mod rod
  (minor), and maybe the addition of an invisibility or other utility summons.
  An increase to our pet heal line would also have been nice. Nothing major,
  just something worth getting. Thus far in my post-50 experience, I have not
  bothered to find or purchase half the spells. There is no point in scribing
  them, since I would never, under any circumstances, cast them. Once again,
  this is an issue of player incentive.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, one man's junk...</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But if I were to run out and stealth add some interesting but not powerful
  summons for you, would that be enough? Summons have never really been intended
  to add to the power of the class, only to its utility (with some notable
  exceptions). New summons would fall along the same lines. Again, I can't talk
  about Scars of Velious spells. But I will keep this request in mind if/when we
  start to look at new spells for magicians.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  Mages have no defensive spells: no root, snare, sow, harmshield, shadowstep,
  crowd control, etc. We are, in effect, the most limited casting class in the
  game.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  So what? I am fine in my role, and so long as I am not crippled in my
  offensive capabilities, I could care less about defense. It's called a
  drawback, and all classes should have them. What causes people to clamor for
  these abilities is that our offensive capabilities suffer post-50. Fix our
  pets and summons in the late game and these complaints will fade away.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ok. Because it's highly unlikely that magicians will get things like
  snare, root or sow.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  Mages have minimal group utility.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  A Mage's major contribution to a group is his pure offensive power. That power
  has decreased relative to other classes post-50, certainly; however, Mages
  remain powerful, and I think that the majority of problems that Mages face in
  groups are because other players do not recognize this. There are legitimate
  problems: zones where pets are unwanted, for instance, and against Uber Mobs,
  where Mages are wholly ineffectual. I personally would like to see some
  group-specific capabilities given to Mages, in return for our soloing ability
  being crippled post-50. However, this is not a huge priority, and could easily
  be fixed by addressing the issues with our late game pets and summons. CotH
  was a good start. (Thanks, Verant.)</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You're now getting into seriously overlapping your requests. This,
  again, seems like a request to up the power of your post 50 pets and your
  summons and these complaints will fade away. Let's not dilute the discussion
  by adding things that you don't really need. And you are telling me here that
  magicians are very powerful pre-50 and acceptably powerful post 50, but that
  other players just don't know this. Part of the problem with your initial post
  was: It's too darn long (and, therefore so is my response). You've
  included a lot of info, and that's great. But you're asking me to read and
  comprehend four pages (when pasted into Word) of magician specific stuff, some
  of which are repeated requests for the same thing...</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  Mage-specific loot in RoK is sparse, and what does exist is fairly subpar,
  compared to both existing Mage gear and what other classes get.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  /agree</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">On this one, I am completely behind my fellow Mages. Before VP, the only
  mage-specific item I can think of is the DD (bolt, actually) staff, which
  requires holding line of sight for a 12 second casting time. In VP, we have a
  staff that casts Phantom Armor but requires the reagants (useless) and a Robe
  with unspectacular stats that casts Burnout III (nearly useless; totally
  useless if Burnout IV is indeed in Velious). Clerics get a breastplate that
  cast Full Heal (Trak). Wizards get a VP Robe that casts rend (yes,
  Rend) and has superior stats to the Mage VP robe. Once again, this is an issue
  of incentive. Please address Mage loot with Velious, Verant.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, I dunno. I'll take your word for it. I also can't tell you what
  is or is not in Velious. How about we hold off until we see if this is
  addressed in Velious?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Epic Quest</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  The Mage epic quest requires clearing the 7th island of sky.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  I disagree that this is a problem. These quests were intended to be completed
  by guilds, not individuals. The difficulty of epic quests is not determined by
  the difficulty of the mobs involved. That is, in fact, irrelevant (provided
  that they are killable). It is determined by access to the mobs and the
  frequency of the drops.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ok, so we can take this one off the list, since I agree with you.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  We require a rare drop off a roaming mid-level rare spawn in a fairly
  low-level zone. Getting this item can take weeks or months.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  Mages do not have tracking. This component of the quest is entirely luck based
  and could easily take several months to half a year to complete. It is fairly
  ridiculous.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If this is the Pegasus Cloak, there are other ways to get it… it's not
  no-drop, is it? So buy the thing. It's been dropping since about the time the
  game opened, there are plenty of them on the servers.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  We require a rare drop off a seven day spawn that is highly contested. Based
  on the number of these items on various servers, it seems that it is a 1/30
  drop.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  This item, assuming that you can clear the PoH at will, can take a day or 3
  years to obtain, with the average time being 1+ years. This is more than
  fairly ridiculous. Verant, this requires immediate attention.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, again, I have to guess that you are talking about the staff. And
  again, this item has been dropping for a while. They can be gained. I'm not
  saying this is easy. But the reward is worth it. And there is a bit of
  exaggeration in your time estimations...</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Problem:<br>
  Before the recent patch, the Elemental Binder was not dropping. Now it is.
  Burning Embers and Dirt of Underfoot have still not been found.</font>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My Take:<br>
  Thanks for fixing the Binder, Verant, but in the future it would be
  appreciated if you would acknowledge when Mage quests are broken. You did,
  after all, admit that several other quests were not functioning. This is the
  second stealth fix we have received to our quest (the first being Words in
  Najena). As for Burning Embers, I suspect that it is either a) broken or b) a
  rare drop of Talendor. The Dirt is likely a) broken, b) misnamed (actually
  Holy Dirt of Brell), or c) a rare drop of Slizik the Mighty in the Hole.
  Please comment, Verant. Are these components in game and working/dropping
  correctly?</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The drop rate on the Binder was indeed increased, at the request of the
  players. It was not broken. It just was a rare drop. It isn't so
  rare now. The Dirt has been found, we did nothing to its drop rate. The Embers
  will be found. Once again; tough to get, worth the effort.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In any case, I wanted you to be aware that I do read these things. I just
  don't like to post incomplete answers like these.</font>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think I'll go back to my vacation... I still need to see Unbreakable.
  I'll be back to read this thread again on Monday.</font>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I
would have posted this in the other thread but figured that it was different
enough to deserve its own thread for discussion:<br>
<br>
I was just sitting here thinking over the latest issue with pet procing, and the
sword of runes, and I noticed something.<br>
<br>
A number of the complaints in this thread cite changing something that's been
that way since release, or saying that if we are going to nerf something, why
don't we fix something before we nerf something else.<br>
<br>
In truth, we did. Mages only got the ability to hand weapons to their pets 10
months ago (January 28th to be precise). The problem with the procs going off on
everything and going off so often only became an issue then. Sure, there was the
odd necro who had a magician friend who would summon up weapons, but it
certainly wasn't wide-spread enough to make a global difference.<br>
<br>
Your pets are more powerful now than they were at release, even given the latest
change. They dual wield now. Sure, that was a bug workaround, but the pets were
bumped up in power several times before the dual wield workaround because they
weren't beating necro pets. In many ways, they became overpowered when they
suddenly began dual wielding, an imbalance that wasn't addressed until now.<br>
<br>
So, as you see, we did address a problem that resulted in increasing the power
of the pet prior to &quot;nerfing&quot; a small portion of it. Now I do wish
that there had been less time between cause and effect, but it's too late for
that at this point. The point is that this is not an ability that has been
around forever. While I agree that many people might have come to take it for
granted, mage pets are still stronger than they were for nearly a year after
release.<br>

After the next patch, pets summoned using necromancer or magician spells of 39th
level or higher should duel wield, even without weapons. This will also include
the Shadownight pets that are the same as necromancer pets of 39th level or
better. So these pets will be duel wielding properly henceforth.<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just
one clarification, the &quot;auto dual wield&quot; ability is based upon a
calculation of both the dual wield skill and the level of the pet. So, it is
possible that you could get good summon at 34th that auto dual wields without
weapons, or a bad summon at 39th that doesn't.<br>
As a note, no change is being made to their likelihood to dual wield. The change
is only going to remove the requirement of handing your pet weapons to get them
to dual wield at the higher levels.<br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'd like to let you all in on
something that has been a fairly common occurance in regards to how these things
happen. It's been noticed before and assumed to be either coincidence or spite,
but I assure you that neither is the case. What I'm talking about is the
phenomenon whereas a class starts complaining about their class, and
subsequently have something &quot;nerfed&quot; a patch or two after the
complaints reach critical mass. Well I'll tell you that it's not a coincidence,
nor is it done out of spite to &quot;punish&quot; those who complain, but it is
those complaints that bring about the &quot;nerf&quot; for a different reason.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What happens is that people begin
complaining about an issue. Those complaints get louder and louder until someone
sits down and looks into it to once and for all determine what problem, if any,
exists. However, the person looking into the issue doesn't take into account
that issue alone, but the class as a whole. Classes are more than the sum of
their abilities, and any issue with a particular ability or lack thereof must be
juxtaposed against all of the other abilities of the whole class.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is this scrutiny that leads to
quantifying the true impact of any particular facet of a class, even when a
problem is already known. A good example of this is low-delay weapons and pets.
Everyone in house knew that necros handed weapons to their pets. They however
did not know the true impact of doing that. They did not know that not only was
the pet being sped up, but it was dual wielding only as a result of those
weapons. So when compared to mage pets, by the numbers, it appeared that mage
pets should have always had the advantage, where instead necro pets would tear
through them like a wood chipper through a tree-branch.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Back on topic, whole-class
scrutiny in regard to one complaint leading to a &quot;nerf&quot; has happened
many times. It happened with necros several times, not the least of which was
when lifetaps became subject to level caps. It happened to monks after the first
&quot;nerf&quot; of Feign Death. It happened to magicians here: There were a ton
of mage complaints on the boards over the past several weeks and one of the
programmers sat down and ran every aspect of the class through some
comprehensive balance tests.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So what can I tell you?
&quot;Balance&quot; is not a perfect science by any means. It's not a perfect
point by which any change imbalances a class in one direction or another. Every
class has some area where they are probably under-balanced, and every class also
some area or areas where they are probably over-balanced. Tendering complaints
about the &quot;under-balanced&quot; areas draws attention to the
&quot;over-balanced&quot; ones as well, and we won't ignore the latter while
exclusively treating the former. Truth be told, we would probably be
&quot;ok&quot; if we did neither, but we are trying to be responsive to the
concerns as they are raised.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just some food for thought for
those who wanted to know how things like this happen.</font>

<font size="2" face="Verdana">It looks like half the threads on the first page
are about mage issues of one kind or another. Let me see if I can clear up a few
of the rumors going around, and please try to keep the number of threads down.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though it might seem that this many threads are
necessary to properly express the feelings that some are having, all that will
happen is that we'll have to start closing threads.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Call of the Hero: No intentional change was
made to the way that this works. However, there were some changes made to the
way intra-zone teleports are handled (to actually make them work better), so it
is possible that it might have had an unintended effect on Call of the Hero.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pets: No changes were made to pet stats. The
only change that was made in regard to pets is that they now proc all-target
procs as if they were a player character. They proc special-target procs half as
often as if they were a player. The next patch will make it so that
special-target procs are proced just as often as the others, but will only work
on the intended target type.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This change does not affect what we call a
&quot;contact innate&quot; (e.g. A spell that procs directly off of an NPC such
as the necro lifetap procs on 44th and 49th) or &quot;spell innate&quot; (casted
spells such as that done by mage pets).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We will most likely be scaling the dexterity of
pets with their level so that the higher level ones will proc carried weapons
more often, nearly as much so as before. We will also look into creating new
summoned special-target proc weapons for mages.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of the other things that we should have
fixed instead: Every time we make a change considered negative to a particular
class, the boards are filled with complaints that we should have fixed something
else instead of spending time on this. While I appreciate everyone's thoughts,
we're not going to exclusively stick to making changes that everyone will like
at the expense of the overall determent to the game. To use an analogy (which
you all know I like to use), complaining that the officer should be out catching
real criminals instead of writing you up for speeding is not going to make him
say, &quot;You're right&quot;, and stop writing your ticket. There are things
that need to be done. Things that upset the balance of the game (typically by
making it too easy thus trivializing aspects of it by removing the challenge)
will get priority over other things that don't have this type of impact. It's
the way it works and the way we need to do things to keep the game interesting.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alright everyone, here's what
happened.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As all weapon-wielding pet users
probably knew, up until recently pets would proc weapon effects much more
frequently than player characters. We recently changed this so that they now
proc effects with just about the same frequency as player characters with the
same dexterity. The exception is targeted (meant for only one type of enemy,
such as summoned creatures) effects, which will now proc about half as often as
they do for player characters, but will still proc on anything (this, as you
know, is a bug).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shortly we will be fixing this bug
so that pets with targeted proc items will only proc on the appropriate target.
At that time, we will bump up the proc rate to match those of any other weapon
proc for the pet.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This only effects weapon procs,
not innate procs.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No pet attributes were changed.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All pets currently have the same
dexterity. It is possible in the future that we will modify the dexterity of
pets based on level and type to make them more flexible for their masters.</font>

this change earlier.</font>

Patch Day<br>
<br>
Today's patch addresses a few problems noted by customers since last week's big
patch. The following changes were made:<br>
<br>
- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum or below the
minimum.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Fixed a problem that caused
sound volume to be reset regardless of the slider setting upon zoning or
entering game.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Fixed a bug that would cause
some sounds to be unduly amplified whenever the volume slider was moved.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes
to show on whiskers in association with mipmapping.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Fixed a bug with /usercolor
causing settings to be saved in the wrong slot.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Fixed weapon scaling problems
with off-hand weapons and those carried by dwarves.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Fixed a bug that caused the
client to display an amount of experience in slight disagreement with the
server.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest
reward, which was procing a spell that would do around one million points of
damage if left to its own devices.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Fixed a faction problem that
made some quests designed to be doable by anyone, regardless of race or class,
undoable.<br>
<br>
In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up following the patch
today. Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god of fortune. We would have named
the new server under its full name if not for an attempt to avoid confusion
between the existing &quot;Bristlebane&quot; server (named for Fizzlethorpe
Bristlebane) and Xev.<br>
