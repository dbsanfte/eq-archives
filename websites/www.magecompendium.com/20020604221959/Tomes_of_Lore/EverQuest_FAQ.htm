questions.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.1 What is a FAQ?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions. FAQs are designed
to cover the most common questions and answers regarding a product.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.2 What is EverQuest?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest is a real 3D massively multiplayer online RPG.
Another equally accurate way of describing EverQuest is to call it a graphical
MUD.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>1.2.1 When was EverQuest released?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest was released March 16th, 1999.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.3 What is an RPG?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">RPG stands for Role-Playing Game. People often debate what
this really means, so we'll attempt to clarify what we mean. When you play
EverQuest you'll first create a character. This creation of yours can be any one
of 12 races and 14 classes, male or female, and you even have the opportunity to
adjust your attributes (for instance, how strong you are, or how intelligent you
aren't). You'll then immerse this character of yours into our virtual world and
make of him or her whatever you wish. You define your role in the lands of
EverQuest and how well you play that role it is up to you. People also often
assume that RPG means an certain theme or setting. While we don't necessarily
agree that this is always true, EverQuest is a traditional RPG. Our world is one
of high fantasy, of sorcery and dragons, of great wizards and marauding hordes
of orcs. There are quests and puzzles to solve aplenty, but it's up to you
decide which ones, if any, to pursue. You might choose to become a warrior bent
on wanton destruction, or perhaps a merchant making his profit selling goods
from one land to another. Essentially, while we've defined the setting, you
create the world.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.4 What do you mean by 3D?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We realize that the term 3D is loosely used almost everywhere
today. In reference to EverQuest, however, we mean it quite literally. Our
engine is truly 3D -- it is not a raycaster, nor does it use a pseudo-3D
isometric view. You can walk completely around a house or any structure and then
enter it, all the while adjusting the camera view between first person and any
number of top-down or 3rd person viewpoints.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.5 What's a &quot;massively multiplayer online game&quot;?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While many modern computer games support multiplayer gaming,
few are designed to support well over 1,000 simultaneous players. With
EverQuest, you don't start the server program on a local network and invite a
few of your friends over to play. Instead, you run the EverQuest client program
and use the Internet to connect to our World Server. Call or email your friends
and tell them in what city or dungeon to meet you, or better yet log on and
encounter hundreds of other people from all over the world and make a slew of
new acquaintances.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's EverQuest, and this is what massively multiplayer
really means.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.6 What's a MUD?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons/Dimensions) are online text-based
RPGs that have been around for several years. EverQuest is similar to these MUDs,
except it was designed from the ground up to depict our world using real-time
16bit color fully texture mapped graphics, as opposed to merely a well written
paragraph.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Also, while most of these MUDs are run by a couple of people
as a hobby in their spare time, EverQuest is a professional and commercial
product -- our staff will be on hand 24 hours a day to meet your needs both as a
player and as a customer.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.7 Who are you guys? Where did EverQuest come from?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">989 Studios (formerly Sony Interactive Studios), responsible
for PSX hits like Rally Cross and NFL Gameday, began development of EverQuest in
1996. Recently, 989 Studios spun off Verant Interactive, Inc., an independent
online game development studio, whose employees include the EverQuest
development team. 989 Studios remains the publisher of EverQuest.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.8 What kind of hardware and software will be required to
play EverQuest?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The EverQuest client program requires a Pentium 166 (Pentium
200+ recommended), with a Direct 3D compliant 3D card and 32 megabytes of RAM.
The program runs under Windows 95 or 98. We recommend a 3D card at least as fast
as Voodoo Graphics from 3DFX. Note that this is estimate, and is subject to
change as game development progresses.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.8.1 Can EverQuest run on NT?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest will not run on Windows NT 4 in that it supports
only Direct X 3, while EverQuest requires Direct X 6. We are, however,
successfully running EverQuest under NT 5 beta, but until that operating system
is released we cannot officially support it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.8.2 Will EverQuest support operating systems other than
Windows 95 and 98?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At this time there are no plans to support platforms other
than Win9x.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.9 Which 3D cards will you support?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest will use both Direct 3D and Glide. Direct 3D is a 3d
API from Microsoft that allows us to support most 3D cards currently on the
market as well as future cards. Glide is a 3d API from 3DFX and works with their
cards (Voodoo Graphics, Voodoo 2, etc.).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>1.9.1 I am not a technical wizard -- could you explain
what D3D is?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Direct 3D (D3D) is part of Direct X, which is a software
add-on to Windows 9x that most modern games use. Direct 3D is the part of Direct
X that allows a game or other program to utilize the various 3D cards out on the
market. If you would like to learn a bit more about DirectX or Direct 3D please
visit the Microsoft site and read the documentation. The address is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/" target="_blank"><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000"><b>Direct
X</b></span></font></a>.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>1.9.2 Will a 3dfx card be required to play the game?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A 3D card is required, however it doesn't necessarily have to
be a 3dfx card (although they work fine). Your card needs to be a Direct 3D
compliant card, and should be at least as fast as a 3dfx card. You may want to
consult some of the many articles, both on the web and in printed magazines,
that compare and contrast the features, performance, etc. of 3d cards.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>1.9.3 What version of Direct X will be used?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest will require Direct X 6.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.9.4 Can anyone tell me if EverQuest will support OpenGL?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest will use Glide (the native 3dfx API) and Direct 3D
(Microsoft API that most modern 3d cards support). We will not support OpenGL
(nothing against it, just with both Glide and D3D, there's no real need).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.10 Will the game be downloadable or will it be on CD?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">CD-ROM.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.11 What kind of music will there be in EverQuest? MIDI
files, or directly off the CD?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest uses MIDI files and supports most major sound cards,
including those that use MIDI sound fonts.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>1.11.1 Has any consideration been given to the use of
3D sound in EQ?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes -- EverQuest supports 3D sound using Direct Sound 3D. We
support both EAX and A3D.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.12 Will game info be saved on servers or on our Hard
drive?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Servers. We are very sensitive to the fact that hackers exist,
and are implementing several plans to guard against them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>1.12.1 With a rough cap of between 1,000 and 1,500
people per server, are you expecting to have enough servers to meet demand?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, while this may or may not mean more servers, we feel it's
worth it to keep the server based lag down and to preserve a sense of community
on each server.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.12.2 How much of the world will actually be on the client
side?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Basically, like any other game, your graphics and world is on
the client side, but your critical data like characters are on the server side.
Static information that isn’t going to change is on the client side. And that
typically is most of your graphics -- you don’t want to be downloading those.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.13 Will there be hot keys or programmable macros in the
game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.14 Do you plan to continuously update the game after its
initial release?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Absolutely. The world of EverQuest will be a constantly
evolving and expanding universe.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.14.1 Will the patches be real time as you’re playing
the game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It will check your version when you log in -- if we’re doing
a major change it will force you to log out.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.15 How much will EverQuest cost me in the stores?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The MSRP is $49.99, but it is up to the retail store to set
retail pricing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>1.16 Will there be a monthly fee to play this game?
And if so, how much?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At launch, we will have three pricing plans,</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">1 Month - $9.89</font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">3 Months - $25.89</font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">6 Months - $49.89</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In addition, you will get a free month upon signing up.</font></p>
<p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">1.17 Is there a plan to include a manual with EQ?</font></strong></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, a full manual is in the box.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>1.18 In the final version, how will EQ staff handle
player complaints about lost stats or equipment due to bugs?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On an individual basis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>1.19 Will the EverQuest team actually play the game or
will they just take input from their &quot;playing&quot; designers?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When we assembled the team we made sure many of the artists,
programmers, and world builders were into this genre. The entire team's input
counts and they've all contributed to this game quite a bit. Accordingly, we
wouldn't be a bit surprised to see most all of them play the game quite often.
This is a game we've all wanted to make and PLAY for many years.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>1.20 How do you intend to build an online cohesive
society in EverQuest? What elements do you think will add to this environment?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We think the focus we have on this not just being a player vs.
player game but rather also a very cooperative game will help build a sense of
community. Allowing people to group, to talk to other party members, and to talk
to people regardless of where they are will help this. And the ability to split
experience amongst a group will add to this as well. Also, keeping the server
population down will enable people to recognize names more easily.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>1.20.1 Are you trying to create a &quot;realistic&quot;
world for EverQuest? i.e. attempting to essentially create a living, breathing
world &quot;simulation&quot;, where non-player characters have their own daily
schedules, the world has its own interactive &quot;ecology&quot; and there is an
overall dynamic &quot;economy&quot;.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, but only where it really adds to gameplay. EverQuest is
not an experiment or a simulation, and our focus is on making the game world
fun. Our emphasis is on adventure and exploration, and making sure the game
mechanics are fair and enjoyable. Game balance definitely takes precedence over
any attempt at creating a super realistic virtual world.</font></p>
<p><a name="2.0 About the beta test."><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2.0 About the beta
test.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.1 What phase of beta testing are you at currently?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The EverQuest beta test is now over -- the final, which was
Phase 4, ended March 12th, 1999.</font></p>
<p><a name="3.0 Features."><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">3.0 Features.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.1 What's the screen resolution for the game and number of
colors?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">640x480 16bit color (that's 64,000 colors). 800x600 and
1024x768 modes are supported on some 3D cards.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.1.1 I absolutely loved the graphics in the
screenshots. I have noticed, though, that most games who dedicated too much time
on graphics lack good Artificial Intelligence in their monsters, etc.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, here's what one of our beta testers had to say on the
subject of EverQuest's AI:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I have seen many game companies striving toward a
  graphical work of art often overlook the basic AI of the opponents. This has
  not been the case in EverQuest. This game has the most advanced AI I've seen.
  Bar none. Even the little intricacies that make the game more believable were
  taken into account. As I am battling one creature (say a large bat for this
  purpose), I've seen a giant rat come up to me, stop, and watch the fight as if
  sizing me up. You really get the feeling that these things are looking you in
  the eye, and trying to decide if you are dinner, or something to be feared.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some attack without warning, others circle in from
  behind. Still others will act like they are going to go right past you, and
  suddenly turn around and lay into you with swords, fists, or teeth. The AI
  definitely appears to be modeled on creature intelligence, some just fight
  smarter than others. The smart ones will even retreat from a fight and go get
  help. I have no doubt that the AI programmer is somewhat of a sadist. A sadist
  with a sense of humor.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You'll know that sense of humor when you see a hill giant
  way off in front of you in the distance, and 2 minutes later find that it has
  made a wide circle to sneak up on you from behind.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Add to this some truly impressive tracking and following
  code, and SPEED. These creatures are FAST. There just isn't any outrunning
  some, you better hope you have the strength or the speed to get away quickly,
  and they will follow you for a great distance. I have seen one gnoll retreat
  from a fight, go get helpers, and return on two different tangents to surround
  the intruders. I've seen groups split up, half appearing to have lost interest
  in the fight, only to turn and rush in.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've really got to put my hats off to this AI programmer,
  I think he could give the ReaperBot guy pointers.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.2 Can we run the game at higher resolution if we have the
horsepower for it?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes -- you can run at 800x600 on a Voodoo 2, and 1024x768 on
with 2 Voodoo 2s in SLI mode. These resolutions will also be supported on Direct
3D compliant cards that can support it (for example, the Riva TnT).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.2.1 Does high resolution cause more lag if only using a
modem (assume very fast machine and SLI voodoo2)? Does more information need to
cross the phone lines if in high-resolution?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The resolution you run EQ in has nothing to do with internet
lag -- the exact same amount of information is being passed between your client
and the server.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.3 How big is the game world?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Huge. It should take a very long time to walk from one end to
the other.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.3.1 Since the current map is only one hemisphere,
what is on the other side?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's for future expansions -- the world will grow and grow.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.3.2 Will the overall size of the world get bigger,
or will more things just be put in existing space as the game gets older?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both. We will fill in empty portions of existing continents,
as well as add more lands and planes and such.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.4 What kind of communication will there be in the game?
Will we be able to send messages privately or to broadcast to the entire server?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You'll be able to do the following:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Say things to people in your general area.</font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shout things across the zone you are in.</font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tell someone a message privately.</font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Say things such that only people grouped with you can hear.</font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Say things such that only people in your guild (if you are
    in a guild) can hear.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.4.1 How exactly will communication work, i.e. when a
character says something how will nearby characters see it?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If a character says something, any other players nearby see it
displayed in the input/output section on the screen.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.4.2 Will chat programs like ICQ or IRC be disabled
during the game?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest runs in full screen mode and doesn't allow task
switching in order to deter the use of third party software that interferes with
EverQuest gameplay.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.4.3 What happens to the people who follow you around
spamming you, etc.?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You type<b>  <font color="#FFFFFF"> /ignore &lt;character name&gt;</font></b>, and then you
don't see his spam anymore.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.5 The game will be server based -- can I switch servers
to go meet friends on another server?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.6 Will people be able to switch servers and take
their character with them?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are no short term plans to allow charcters to be moved
from server to server.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.7 Will there be some other ways to travel than walking?
Horses, boats or teleport spell?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ships and teleport spells, yes. Horses will not be available
at ship (meaning, possibly after ship, as an update or expansion - this has yet
to be determined). There will also be a few other more exotic ways to traverse
the lands of Norrath.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.7.1 When traveling in the wilderness between towns, is
the player's view going to be first person the entire duration of travel, or
will there be an overhead view of the map of the region?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Travelling long distances is exactly the same as walking
around a city or dungeon. The views themselves are the same throughout the game
-- you can choose from first person or from several third person viewpoints. As
for the time it takes to walk from one zone to another, depending on the
distance, it could take a while. Now that doesn't mean there won't be high level
spells and perhaps some other ways to 'shorten' those distances.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.8 How will fighting work? Real time or turned based?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Real time, but we must stress that this is not a 'twitch'
game. It won't matter how quick you can click that mouse button. Weapons have
speeds, and they will 'go off' (i.e. swing, fire, etc.) at that speed. It's like
playing the piano to a metronome -- it's real time, but you can't exceed a set
pace. Every weapon has a speed. A dagger has a lot of attacks, whereas a big two
handed sword hits harder, but you’re only going to be able to attack so often.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.8.1 So EverQuest isn't a &quot;twitch&quot; game -- does
this mean there will be no advantage to having quick reactions (at least in
melee combat)?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, you can’t rule out the player’s reactions completely
– he or she does have to control the game either via the keyboard or mouse.
But the emphasis is definitely on the player’s character’s stats, not the
player himself. Weapons and spells have speeds, characters have attributes and
skills, and these are the components of combat. The game is in real time, but
not at the pace of a shooter like Quake or Unreal.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.8.2 Does your sword or other weapon swing automatically?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, we call it auto-attack, which allows you to concentrate
on different skills and other combat options in the heat of battle. For
instance, warriors can kick and monks have a lot of special attacks. It allows
you to do those while you do your basic swing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.9 Will someone with a better connection have an advantage
over someone with a poor connection?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not during combat or other critical times. Certainly having a
better connection will reduce lag and some warping, but it won't put you at a
disadvantage necessarily in terms of game play.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.9.1 How is the gameplay going to be through a 28.8
connection? I have played online RPGs and lag seems to be a big problem.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We don't think most of the lag people are experiencing on
these games is because they are using a 28.8. It's usually either server based
lagged or their ISP’s, or somewhere in the internet between them and the
servers. We are designing the game such that we aren't sending out more data
than a 28.8 can handle. Also, we are doing several things to reduce lag,
including using very mature network code (descended from our Tanarus game), as
well as keeping the number of people down per server, to reduce server lag.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.10 Will there be night and day and how long does an
EverQuest day last in real time?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, there is a night and day. We are still tweaking how long
each period will last -- this will be determined in the betas.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.11 How dark is night? Do I need a spell or torch to see
at night?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, many areas are lighted... but if you're talking about
whether you can see with no torch or spells in the bottom of a cave, I'd say no.
Unless you have infravision...</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.12 Will there be an active economy in the game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, there is an economy in EverQuest, primarily
player-driven. Price will change according to supply and demand. If an item is
offered more often then bought the price will go down.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.13 Will there be weather in the game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, it can rain, snow, and also be foggy.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.13.1 Will there be damage from the elements without
proper protection? (i.e. Frostbite and Cold damage on Velious without proper
clothing?)</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, in fact you can see the resistances to cold, fire, etc.
on the screenshots of the inventory screen we've released.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.14 How many cities and other zones will there be in the
game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest is launching with 12 cities and over 70 zones total
in which to adventure.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.15 EverQuest is playable from different viewpoints. Has
any thought been put into ensuring that no one viewpoint has an undue advantage
over another?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's pretty hard to look down a hall or a tunnel or a street
in the top down view. Also, there's a lot of information and detail in the
background textures that you might miss if you're not in 1st person mode. By
their natures, different views have different advantages and disadvantages.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.15.1 Is the EverQuest development team doing what they
can to ensure a player won't be &quot;unduly&quot; hampered (or favored) by his
or her choice of view?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If a person were to stick to any one view they would be at a
disadvantage. The plan is to have several different user definable camera views
that are toggled between depending on the situation. &quot;Hmm, I can't tell
whether or not I can jump across this ravine... (toggle to top down view) Oh
man! That is farther than it looked in first person view.. I better find another
way.&quot; Or (in first person view) &quot;Get ready! There are a band of Orcs
coming out of the forest!&quot; (I would not have seen them if I were in top
down view until they we almost upon my party and me.) So yes, if you stick to
one view and only one view more than likely you will not live as long as someone
who takes advantage of all the possible views.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.16 How will we control our characters? Keyboard, mouse,
joystick, or combination?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Keyboard or mouse – we will support mouselook.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.16 Will there be a screen capture utility in EverQuest?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes -- just hit the '-' key on your numeric keypad and a .bmp
file will be written to your EverQuest directory.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.19 On the creatures page there are deities. Will there be
some kind of religion in EQ?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are many different religions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.19.1 Will religions affect how I should role-play my
character in some ways?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">How you role-play your character is up to you.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.19.2 Will there be specific places of worship for
each of the deities in the game? And what deities are there in the game?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You will find temples dedicated to the various gods of the
pantheon spread throughout the lands of Norrath. At this time, however, we are
not ready to list every member of that pantheon beyond those we've already
revealed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.20 Can you give us hints as to the storyline? What will
be one's purpose in the game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There's no set storyline... just a vast history and background
to the world. The players will make the stories by interacting with the world.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.20.1 Is there a central plot or just mindless
wandering and killing things?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a rich history, plenty of quests, and also the
ability to mindlessly wander and kill things -- it's up to the player to
determine how involved he wants to get.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.20.2 Will religions/race histories be completely
written by the EverQuest team? Will you accept submissions, maybe doing
contests?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The religions and histories of the world before you players
arrive will be written, but after that, you players will be making the history
and events in the world. You are welcome to chronicle those events, and we would
like submissions as well of those events. Perhaps we will post certain ones on
the web page and such, once the game has been released.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.21 Will +mlook be supported in 1st person view?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.22 Will towns be closed after dark, ala Daggerfall?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some doors may or may not be locked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.23 When adventuring can we form parties?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes. In fact, you are encouraged to form parties.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.23.1 What about people who prefer to play solo? Will the
solo player be &quot;crippled&quot; to the point of unplayability or will it
just be limited in where you can go what you can do?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It will be a bit limited in where you can go and what you can
do (especially in more difficult areas), but definitely not 'crippled' -- there
are definitely race/class combos in EverQuest (Troll Shadowknight comes to mind)
that do fine as a solo character.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.23.2 Will experience be shared amongst party members? And
how?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes. It is split up according to the total experience each
player has at the time. The higher the experience, the larger the share of
experience split.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.23.3 If I'm in a party and we kill a monster, is the
experience shared the same way as if two people not in a party kill a monster
together?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, it's different. You will want to group up when fighting
monsters. Consider this: a warrior makes the kill, but a cleric has been healing
him -- the cleric should get some experience too.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.23.4 Is there a limit to the number of players that can
be in a group? If so, how many?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are currently limiting groups to six party members.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.23.5 Is there command to divvy up the gold the group
(party) collects?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.24 Will there be huge underwater areas, sort of like an
underwater continent?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not an entire continent, but entire zones, yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.24.1 Can I fight underwater?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.25 Will there be a notoriety system in which one can
tell thieves and murderers apart and so they are punished by the law or a bounty
system?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, however we would hesitate to call it a notoriety
system, because it works very differently than other systems you might be
familiar with.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.26 Are there any plans for special servers just for
those players who role-play &quot;properly&quot;?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Probably not. The debate as to what exactly role-playing means
is eternal, with few who agree with each other. Also, servers are very
expensive, so we're not sure how many we will set up and under what conditions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.27 Will you be able to see the names of others just
by looking at them?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That will probably be an option.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.28 Any thought given to cut scenes/cinematics in the
final version?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We will have cinematics in the beginning, to introduce the
game, similar to most games.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>3.29 Will there be a &quot;rent&quot; system? Will
there be restrictions as to where you can rent, and will the items you rent with
have upkeeps?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can camp anywhere, although it takes approximately 30
seconds to do so. There is no upkeep on items.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.3 Will there be central meeting places like Tavern's or
Fountains to meet other people?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.4 Will there be player owned vendors in the game, and
will they have a weight and item limit?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We think a significant portion of the economy will be people
who buy, sell, and trade in towns and elsewhere. We don't feel we need to make
them merchants 'officially' for them do be able to do this, nor do they require
any additional abilities. Basically, anyone can be a merchant or a vendor.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>3.5 How will you prevent the gaining of wealth by
continually creating new characters for their starting items?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When you begin the game, your character starts out with items
that are neither tradable nor droppable.</font></p>
<p><a name="4.0 Characters."><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">4.0
Characters.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.1 How many characters can one person have on one account?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eight at this time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.2 If I have more than one character, can I have both
online at the same time and trade between them?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, you may only have one character online at any given time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.3 Will character improvement be skilled based or level
based?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both skill and level based.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.4 How many classes and races are there? And what are
they?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are 12 races: Barbarian, Dark Elf, Dwarf, Erudite,
Gnome, Half-Elf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Ogre, Troll, Wood Elf. There are 14
classes: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Magician, Monk, Necromancer, Paladin,
Ranger, Rogue, Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior, Wizard.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.4.1 Will there be the possibility of adding new
races/classes as the game expands?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Absolutely. We look forward to adding quite a bit to the game.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.5 Can a character be multi-class like a warrior-mage?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are some hybrid classes, like Paladins
(warrior-clerics), and Shadow Knights (warrior-necromancers)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.6 Are certain classes reserved for certain races or can
all races be of any class?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, certain classes are reserved for certain races.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.7 Will there be alignment in the game? And how much of an
impact will it have on gameplay?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, our faction system is very complex.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.8 Can we play male or female characters?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.8.1 Are there inherent differences between male and
female characters?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At this time, choosing male or female only affects your
appearance, and not necessarily your gameplay (other than the way you personally
choose to role-play).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.9 Will we be able to select how our character looks? I
mean eyes, hair and such?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are eight faces per race/gender from which to choose.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.10 Will clothes, armor and weapon be visible to other
players?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.11 Can I have a shop or be a blacksmith like in Ultima
Online?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no 'blacksmith' class or official occupation per se,
because we don't feel this is necessary. Any player at any time is welcome to
sell or trade items, and there will be in-game features to accommodate players
who like to do this often. There are several trade skills in the game, however,
including blacksmithing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.12 Will there be a set of attributes we select at the
creation process that will remain the same through the game like intellect,
strength and so on?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, to a point. There will be attributes like strength,
charisma, stamina, wisdom, intelligence, dexterity, and agility -- however,
these can increase or decrease with special items and spells.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.13 Will I be able to put a biography on my character for
when people look at me?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.14 Will my character age? And if he does can he die of
old age?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.15 Can my character eat and is it actually required to
survive?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, your character can and will need to eat. However, eating
and drinking is not tedious, and one cannot actually starve to death.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.16 Can my character sleep?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are ways to rest in the game, but you don't need to
sleep.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.16.1 Will resting replenish hitpoints?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, but having a cleric as a friend is more efficient.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.17 Will I be able to wear disguises?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can alter what you wear, which will change your
appearance.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.18 Is there a maximum level my character can attain?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Currently, the maximum level is 50, but that is subject to
change as the game expands.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.18.1 What are your strategies for preventing
&quot;topping-out&quot; with experience points?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At this point experience caps aren't planned, however it will
become harder and harder to make levels, so it should take some time to reach
higher levels.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.19 How many items can I wear or have equipped?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are 21 body locations in which to wear items, as well as
general inventory in which you can hold containers that allow you to carry even
more.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.20 When our characters gain experience will they change
forms or change into a higher form in the class, e.g. wizard-sorcerer,
knight-paladin?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be titles based on level and accomplishments.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.21 Will there be a location available to a
&quot;medley&quot; of races to begin their adventure in Norrath, or will all
starting characters be &quot;restricted&quot; to geographic areas based on race?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of the races have more flexible starting points than
others, but there is no starting point for all races, no.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.22</strong> <strong>What is the state of the
&quot;name filter&quot;. Is that something that is truly going to be
implemented?</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The names you choose for your characters in EverQuest need to
fit in a setting of High Fantasy. Also, <font color="#c0c0c0" size="2">names
must be unique -- no two characters can have the same name on the same server.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.22.1 What if I switch servers and some one has my
name on the new server?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The person who was on that server first will get to keep the
name, you will have to assign a new name.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.23 How will height affect combat?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Taller races may have to look down in order to see shorter
opponents.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.24 Will a character take any damage from high falls
into water, or does the fact that the player lands in water negate damage from
any height?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you fell far enough and into water, you would take damage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.25 Will races have bonuses associated with being in
their preferred environment? And drawbacks relating to the environment as well
(e.g. Dark Elves in sunlight)?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Races have innate abilities and disadvantages.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.26 Will players be able to save their player info at
any time to avoid crash losses?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Probably not, however the servers save character data whenever
anything significant changes about them such that the chance of a server crash
causing losses is slim (note that this is a very different than saving the
entire game state every so often like other games do, which can lead to severe
crash losses).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.27 Will GM's be able to address problems caused by
the game? if I lose skills/stats/items from bugs, can a GM restore me?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">GMs will be able to fix problems resulting from bugs if that
bug is verifiable, and we feel it is important that we are able to verify the
vast majority of bugs and address (i.e. fix) how they wrongly affect the game
and gameplay.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.28</strong> <strong>Will aiming at specific parts of
the body be a part of combat? What about special attacks such as tripping your
opponent or impaling him with a polearm? Or is it just
stick-the-pointy-bit-into-the-soft-bit?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is more to combat than just swinging your weapon --
there are many combat related skills that can come into play during combat.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.29 Will there be a kind of &quot;super class&quot;?
(i.e. If you are a high enough level necromancer, you could complete a special
quest and become a lich?)</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We personally like very much the idea that a necromancer could
turn into a lich at a certain level, and other similar ideas, but these features
will not be present when the game is released.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.30 Do races have different languages and if there
are can we have spells to translate ?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be languages, and there are spells that allow one
to understand them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.31 In the case of a Knight/Paladin will there be
certain acts if committed that would strip the Paladin of his bonuses... thus
becoming a fighter?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be restrictions to certain classes, and it is
possible they could lose some or all of their powers.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.32 Will there be a notoriety/alignment system ?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a sophisticated alignment system, in which the game
keeps track of hundreds of factions and how these factions feel, both positively
and negatively, about your character. Your actions can adjust your standings.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.33 Will certain armor/weapons be off limits to
mages? (no mages in full plates wielding 400lb halberds)?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are race and class restrictions to items.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.33.1 Can Paladins and Shadow Knights (both hybrid classes
that can fight well and use magic) cast spells while wearing plate or other
heavy armor?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both classes may cast in full plate, and even pure magic-users
can still hold staffs and such while casting (no, they can't wear plate). Why?
Because it becomes very tedious, regardless of 'realism', swapping items in and
out all the time before casting.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.34 Will clerics be able to wield weapons?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, they will be able to wield weapons such as maces. They
are turning out to be formidable fighters.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>4.35 Will bards be a viable class?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, one of our programmers has a soft spot in his heart for
bards so they are well taken care of.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.36 Trolls traditionally have innate regeneration -- do
they in EverQuest and what does it do?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, trolls heal (get their hit points back) more quickly than
do other races.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.37 What exactly are Shadow Knights? Are they similar to
Paladins (warrior/clerics) or more like the traditional anti-paladin?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shadow Knights are warrior/necromancers, not
warrior/necromancer/clerics (that would be too powerful). Nor are they
warrior/evil clerics because we didn't want them to just be stereotypical
anti-paladins -- we wanted them to be something new and different.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>4.38 After looking at all of the exotic races one can play
in the game, why would someone want to play a human?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are several reasons, the significance of which will
depend on what one wants out of a character, of course. Among the best of these
is that innate ability in one more areas is offset by deficiencies in other
areas; for example, if a player's priorities lie in the area of brute force,
then s/he is likely to play a troll or an ogre, but with the drawback of below
average resistance to some spells, due to a very low intelligence. Dark elves,
who can see in the dark and who tend to make excellent magic-users, are
generally despised by many of Norrath's inhabitants, which makes it more
difficult for them to find merchants who will sell them anything, or even
purchase any goods they might have to offer.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Humans, on the other hand, are probably the single best
well-rounded race in the game. While it is possible for a human to excel and
specialize in some class or trade, they are comparatively neutral in their
inborn statistics, so while they don't have the strength of an ogre or the
enhanced senses of an elf, they don't suffer any special drawbacks, either
(comparatively speaking). It's all a question of that with which a player is
willing to live.</font></p>
<p><a name="5.0 Skills."><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">5.0 Skills.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>5.1 Are all skills available to all classes or races or are
some race or class specific?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some skills are available to all races and classes, for
instance swimming. Some, however, are available to only certain races and
classes, for instance stealing is only a skill for the rogue class.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>5.2 Can you tell us some of the skills that will be in the
game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can name a few (swimming, backstabbing, stealing, dual

complete listing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>5.3 Do I have all the skills available to my character at
the beginning or do I need to learn them?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You start with some, you earn others as your character
progresses.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>5.4 How do I learn new skills? From NPCs or can other
players teach me?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To learn new skills and improve on old ones, you must find a
trainer or go to your guild hall.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>5.5 Do skills deteriorate when not used?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>5.6 Can I learn all skills at the beginning or do some have
restrictions like being a certain level or having another skill?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some skills will have restrictions, and some skills are not
learnable until higher levels.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>5.7 Will dual weapon combat be available?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dual Wielding is a skill some classes get.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>5.8 How will skills be raised? Will it be on a
level/distribute points scale or more along the lines of practice a lot while
you level?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your skills go up as you use them, but they can only go up so
much per level, and certain skills won't be available to the player until he
reaches certain levels.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>5.9 What miscellaneous skills will there be? Will
there be other arts like bandaging?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be many skills, many related to combat, but then
also non-combat related skills as well, including Bandaging. Please see the
skill listing on the web site for a complete listing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>5.10 Is swimming available to all races or is it
limited?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">All races start out with swimming as a skill.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>5.11 How are skills activated? Are they automatic or
do I have to use them manually?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some skills trigger automatically, while others are activated
manually</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>5.11.1 If some are manually activated, how will I
access them? Buttons, quick slots, hot keys, or what?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In your interface you will have 6 quick slots for combat
related skills and 12 slots for social skills. You can also assign skills by
adding them as buttons to your screen.</font></p>
<p><a name="6.0 Magic."><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">6.0 Magic.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>6.1 How many types of magic are there?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5 primary schools of magic.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>6.2 Can you tell us some of the spells?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can list some at this time: levitate, water breathing,
healing, and fireball and other offensive spells.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.2.1 When will you be releasing some spells for each
class?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many of the spells are listed in the manual that comes with
the game, however we do not plan on officially releasing a full list (we would
consider that a spoiler, in that many of the spells are hidden and must be
quested for in-game).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>6.3 Will magic be mana based, or reagents, or spellbooks?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The magic system is primarily mana based, however some spells
require components.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>6.4 Do I have all the spells available to my character at
the beginning or do I need to learn them?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You start with some, you earn others as your character
progresses.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>6.5 How do I learn new spells? From NPCs or can other
players teach me?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can find or purchase spell scrolls, and then enscribe that
scroll into your spellbook.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>6.6 Do spells deteriorate when not used?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>6.7 Can I create new spells?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>6.8 Can I enchant weapons?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Enchanter class can enchant weapons.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.8.1 Is that all the Enchanter will be good for,
enchanting magic items?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No. The Enchanter class can be a very valuable member of any
party.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>6.9 Area effect spells -- will PKers be able to kill
non-PKers with them?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, PK area affect spells will only affect other PKers and
NPC's.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>6.9.1 How are area effect spells handled. Are my group
members immune form my area effect spells?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, they are immune from offensive area spells cast by a
caster in their group.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.10 Can you elaborate on how balanced magic and
non-magic attacks will be?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The idea behind having a class system is that the different
classes will have advantages and disadvantages. If we do our jobs and balance
these classes, then none of them will have inherent advantages over the other. A
mage might beat a warrior under certain conditions, and vice versa.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.11 Are you going to try to emphasize the use of
ships for long distance travel, instead of making a transport type of spell
commonly accessible?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Transport spells will exist, but they will be very high level
and hard to come by.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.12 Concerning spell targeting, will spells
automatically hit it's target or will some actual aiming be required in order to
hit your target with a spell?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">They will automatically target, however that doesn't
necessarily mean they successfully hit the target.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.12.1 From how far away will I be able to cast a
spell on a target?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The effect of long distance spell casting is directly related
to the type of spell (in other words, it depends on the spell).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.13 Will the Necromancer be able to Summon, Command,
or Create Undead?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.13.1 Will there be a limit as to the number of
undead a single necromancer can create/control at one time, and if so, will
greater experience allow you to create/control more?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, a limit. The higher the level the more powerful the
undead -- not necessarily the quantity here, but rather the quality.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.14 Will spells be scroll based or book based?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both. You will obtain new spells by finding scrolls. Once you
have a scroll you must scribe it into your spell book. Once the spell is
successfully scribed, the scroll will disappear. It is then permanently scribed
into you spell book.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.14.1 Do I have to learn a scribe skill to do
this?&quot;</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No. You &quot;scribe&quot; it into your book by simply
dragging the scroll to an open slot in your book. This process takes some time
to complete. You can be interrupted while doing this.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.14.2 How will I find new scrolls?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">By killing monsters, finding treasure, and completing quests</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.15 How many of the spells in my spell book will I
have immediate access to?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can have access to 8 of your spells at one time. These
spells are &quot;memorized&quot; into your 8 interface slots.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.15.1 How do I memorize these spells?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">By dragging the spell from your spell book to an open slot on
your screen.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.16 Will there be very powerful spells?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, although they will be very hard to come by and very hard
to cast. Some may require that you complete long quests just to cast them.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.17 Will spells cast instantly or have a casting
time?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Different spells will have different casting times, which can
also be affected by your skill in that magical art.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>6.18 Are Clerics going to just be traveling healers?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No. Clerics are pretty formidable fighters and can wear armor
and wield maces.</font></p>
<p><a name="7.0 NPC and creatures."><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">7.0 NPCs and
creatures.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.1 How much interaction will there be with the NPCs? Will
they just sell and buy stuff?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">They'll do a lot more than that, including providing in-game
information and quests.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.2 Can you kill NPCs?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, and that's fairly integral to the game.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>7.2.1&nbsp; If an NPC dies, will it be replaced by
another, or will it just return?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The NPC may or may not return right away, nor will he
necessarily be in the same place.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.3 Will monsters all act the same during combat? Or will
some retreat when hurt, or follow you until either they are dead or you are?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The latter, depending upon the intelligence and type of the
monster with whom you are fighting.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.3.1 Are we going to see a change in monsters and NPCs
depending on time of day?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It all depends on the NPC. For instance, we can assign a
skeleton to only appear during the evening.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.3.2 Will NPCs treat different members of a group
differently, depending upon the level of the party member or for other reasons?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, it really depends on their intelligence. Certain NPCs
will go after spell casters, certain NPCs will go after who hit them the hardest
last, certain NPCs like an animal will attack whatever is closest since they
don’t know any better, certain ones will flee at certain times, certain ones
will fight to the death – it all depends on the NPC.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.4 Will NPCs use magic?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some, yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.4.1 Are some of the creatures going to use spells during
fights?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some, yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.5 Will some of the creatures/monsters be the same races
and classes as our characters? I mean can I fight a human mage NPC?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.6 How many types of monsters will there be in the game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are currently over 100 types of monsters -- see the
Bestiary in the almanac section for a partial listing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.6.1 Is that 100 monster types or 10 types with palette
swaps?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's over 100 different polygonal figures. Most of these
have multiple texture sets, creating hundreds of different NPCs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>7.7 Can I hire an NPC to protect my belongings for me?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Magicians can summon elementals, and Necromancers can raise
the dead -- these creatures can be instructed to protect their master from harm.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>7.9 Will there be animals, and if so, maybe a taming
skill?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be animals, and other monsters, and these animals
may be charmed. (please read the description of Enchanters)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>7.10 Traditionally Orcs, Goblins, and the like have a
hierarchy of leaders. What most fantasy games lack is the portrayal of this
system. In EQ, will beasts travel in packs with obvious leaders and obvious
goals (e.g. to acquire gold, hunt for food, etc.)?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The more intelligent the monster, the more intelligently it
will act. We are putting a lot of effort into our NPC AI system.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>7.11 Will &quot;evil&quot; races such as Trolls,
Ogres, and Dark Elves, have towns and cities that reflect their general
alignment? Like killing members of other &quot;hated&quot; races on sight? Or
perhaps some other method to discourage unwelcome tourists?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are definitely hatreds between some of the races on the
world of Norrath, and those races would not allow each other to enter their
cities and other areas they control.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>7.11.1 Is it possible for a member of an unwelcome
race to sneak into another race's city and stay out of sight to spy or
something?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, it would be possible under the right circumstances for an
unwelcome race to sneak into another race's city.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>7.12 Will there be outside GMs (in other words, GMs
that don't work for Verant/989)?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes. The Guide program began early in beta, consisting of
volunteer GMs, and has been extremely sucessful thus far, and a very important
part of our customer service infrastructure.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>7.13 Can a player flee from Guards if they're fast
enough? If guards are not invincible, will they team up (call for back up) if
they are being beat?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is possible that you could flee successfully from a guard,
and yes, they will team up on you.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>7.14 If someone is attacked by an NPC and runs to town
to obtain help from the guards, will a guard kill the monster with one hit?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That would depend on how powerful the monster is and how
powerful that particular guard is.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>7.15 Will guards &quot;Spawn&quot; like they do in UO
or will a group be able to kill off the guards of a city and effectively fend
off the other guards by, for example, sinking their ship when they attempt to
retake the city?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The details of how NPCs spawn or repopulate is not something
we can go into details on, other than to say it is <strong>very</strong>
flexible, and will depend on the zone and situation you are in.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>7.16 Are horses yet created as a means of travel. And
if not, have you ever considered the possibility of dragon travel? This also
opens the option of Air-to-air combat.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Horses may be added post-ship, but won't be available at
release. Air to air combat and dragon riding won't be in the game.</font></p>
<p><a name="8.0 Items and properties."><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">8.0 Items and
properties.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>8.1 Will there be some magic items in the game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not some, a lot!</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>8.2 Are some items going to be unique, where there is only
one in the game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, we call them artifacts. They will be awarded to
characters who do remarkable things.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>8.3 Are there going to be some weapons or armor that are
the best in the game? Will everyone be wearing the same armor or use the same
weapon because it's the best there is? Or will armor and weapons have advantages
and disadvantages?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">'Best' will be very subjective and relative to what the player
wants for his character. It will also be situational. If one item gives you fire
protection, it may be essential in the volcano level, but useless in the
underwater zone.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>8.4 Are all items useable by all races and classes?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some are, some aren't. Weapons can be set to be usable by only
particular races and classes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>8.5 Will weapons, armor and other items wear out with use?
If so will we have a blacksmith skill to repair them, or a spell, or will some
NPCs be able to do it?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>8.6 Can we set up a &quot;safe&quot; house or rent a
&quot;safe&quot; room? Or maybe safety deposit boxes in banks in major cities?
Just a place to store items and treasures? Note: this implies that you go
adventuring in order to afford rent.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A house will be as &quot;safe&quot; as you make it. Some may
be vulnerable, some may not be, and some may be in-between.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.6.1 What will be done to curtail the &quot;urban
sprawl&quot; of houses?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Houses are rented and already exist in cities -- you do not
build a 'new' house.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.6.2 Will certain races have different
player-buildings than other races?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Races definitely have different styles of architecture, which
would extend to houses built for players.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.6.3 Will houses have locks that require a key to
open them, and the key is in turn stealable, or will there be another system,
like a combination?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In that rentables (houses) will not be activated until after
launch, we will not be releasing this information as of yet.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.6.4 Will we be able to have player bought houses
underground?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In that houses are rented rooms inside cities, and that there
are cities underground, yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>8.7 Will a long sword, broad sword, and short sword all
look the same or will they each have their own look?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many items have different appearances, both in the 3D world
and as icons in the inventory screens.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.8 Will there be ship-ship combat? If so, will it be
with projectile weapons and spells of crew members or will ships have their own
methods of attack (i.e. Cannons)?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, the emphasis in EverQuest is on that of interacting with
your character and other characters, not on vehicles.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.9 Will we be able to interact extensively with our
environment?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are very happy with how interactive the world is, and just
how many places you can go.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.10 Will people be able to purchase 'safety deposit'
boxes or some such in order to store items and other valuables?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One can store items and money in banks, which are typically
found in the various cities of Norrath.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.11 Are boats hollow? i.e will things be able to be
stowed away below deck, and will you be able to go down into the boat?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The larger ships are indeed explorable and have rooms and
such.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.12 Will there be a &quot;decay&quot; rate, as in
certain items only last so long? This would prevent certain people from having
the &quot;invincible&quot; set of equipment and require them to actually go out
and get it again?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.13 Will rivers be barriers to travel without swim
skill? If so, will bridges/ferries come into play (as strategic chokepoints)?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be ferries and bridges and you can swim.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.14 Will we be able to build and destroy buildings
and boats?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.15 Is there an upkeep associated with owning a
house?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes. Not only are houses extremely expensive, but there will
be a periodic fee that guilds and players must pay, lest they lose ownership of
their houses and halls.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.16 How will the money system work? i.e. just gold,
or gold, silver, and copper, all of certain worth?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Platinum, gold, silver, and copper. Also, some gems and such.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.16.1 What are the relationships between the
different types of money?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Currently 1000 Copper=100 Silver, 100 Silver=10 Gold, 10
Gold=1 Platinum.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.17 Will we be able to log off safely on ships?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>8.18 Will there be public ships/caravans that can take
you safely from city to city or continent to continent?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In some cases, yes.</font></p>
<p><a name="9.0 Quests."><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">9.0 Quests.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>9.1 What kind of quests can we expect in EverQuest? Simple
quests, like go fetch something for an NPC, or more complex quests that will
require either teamwork or finding clues as to how to accomplish the quests?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>9.2 Are the quests generated automatically or will there be
some kind of GM introducing major quests once in a while?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>9.3 How will the quests be reset? I mean can I do the same
quest over and over?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can repeat quests to some extent, however they are level
based.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>9.4 Will quests be reserved for larger guilds, or will
we see NPC dictated adventure for those who opt for a party-based system?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be plenty of quests for all sorts of people,
whether individual, or in parties, or members of large guilds. As for GM run
quests, we don't have infinite time and resources, so these will be limited, but
not necessarily limited only to guilds.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>9.5 You mention that GM's would be able to provide
quests/adventures for any player at any time. However, how do you plan to
actually accomplish the feat of having GM's provide quests for 1000 + players
per server?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Certainly our GMs will not be providing custom quests at all
times of the day for all players. However, they will quite often do so, meaning
they will create dynamic custom quests. If you the player are in the right place
at the right time, you may encounter a GM instead of an AI controlled NPC.</font></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">9.9 Can I stack items and turn them in for a quest?</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">NO. Items should NEVER be stacked when giving them to an NPC
for a quest. Also, items should NOT be stacked in containers that
&quot;COMBINE&quot;. One example, Brin Stolunger of the Qeynos warriors guild
asks players to get 5 Snake Scales and 5 Bat Wings...there must only be ONE of
an item per slot, filling up the container, THEN 'combined' to make a new item
that Brin will accept as a quest item.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">9.10 Should I give all my quest items at the same time?</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">YES. Do NOT give an NPC a quest item, then go adventuring for
a few hours and come back with another quest item. NPCs do not remember who gave
them what item, and reward the player that turned in the last item to complete a
quest. If you give 3 quest items to an NPC, and another player gives the 4th,
then that player will get credit for completing the quest that you worked so
hard on. When doing a quest, store items in the bank until you have gathered
them all, and then give them to the NPC.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">9.11 Why does the NPC say, &quot;Thank you very much&quot;
when I turn in a quest item?</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When give an NPC an item and he/she gives the generic
&quot;Thank You&quot; text, this means that the item was NOT a quest item OR the
NPC ALREADY has this quest item and is waiting for the others to complete a
quest.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">9.12 If the NPC asks for a Large Snake Rattle, will any
snake rattle work?</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">NO. &quot;Large Snake Rattles&quot; are NOT the same as
&quot;Giant Snake Rattles&quot;... a &quot;Ruined Blackburrow Gnoll Pelt&quot;
is NOT the same as a &quot;Blackburrow Gnoll Pelt&quot;... yet, people often
make this mistake. Writing down the exact item(s) needed by an NPC for a quest
is good idea.</font></p>

<p><a name="10.0 Guilds."><strong><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">10.0 Guilds.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>10.1 Will there be guilds in the game? Game operated guilds
like a thieves guild or just player run guilds?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>10.2 Will there be special guilds functions? Like ranks or
the ability to buy a guildhall?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>10.3 Can guilds have special clothes or uniforms, or a logo
on their shield?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are no short term plans to support this.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>10.4 If my guild becomes very big and active, will there be
special quests for it?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, sometimes we will introduce quests for very active
guilds.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>10.5 What will the government be like in EQ? Will
there be company rulers (Like Lord British and Blackthorn), or could players
start their own government? If so, will you support them in some way, give them
tools or such?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no overall ruler of the lands of Norrath -- there are
many kings, dukes, lords, etc. ruling different parts of the land. As for
players starting their own government, they could take over an area, and attempt
to hold it and enforce their own laws should they choose to do so.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>10.5.1 Will players be able to take over cities and
the surrounding lands? How will this be handled if it is possible?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I assume one would take over an area by enforcing your rule
upon it, by threat of violence or something else. A group could certainly kill
NPCs in an area, and all PK players, and in that way 'take over' a section of
the world.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>10.6 Will guilds be able to declare war and fight
without interruption or penalty?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It depends where they choose to conduct their battles. A guild
war in the streets of Qeynos will not be tolerated by the guards.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>10.7 Is there some way that newbies will be introduced
in-game to other newer players to adventure together, or will everyone just be
thrown into the common &quot;town center&quot; to fend for themselves?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're creating a game with an emphasis on cooperation and
group play, however we don't feel we can force new players or otherwise to
interact with others. We can only provide the tools to make it easier for them
to do so (the fact that you can 'tell' to a person anywhere in the world, 'gsay'
to people in your group, sharing experience with people in your group, etc).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>10.8 Will guilds be officially recognized in some way
in the game?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes -- you will see the guild name displayed underneath the
player name.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>10.9 Will you work along with famous, very dedicated
guilds or players? Perhaps honor them with a role of a villain for players to
battle against, or give the guild special privileges and a guild house in town?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>10.10 Will there be a way for players to declare their
own quests in game through a sort of world wide notice?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, through in-game bulletin boards.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>10.11 Will there be a limit to the number of official
guilds on the game?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Most likely, yes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>10.12 Is it okay to have a multi-race guild?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sure, you are welcome to make a multi-race guild.</font></p>
<p><a name="11.0 Pkilling and death."><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">11.0 Pkilling and
other player vs. player issues.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>(note that in this section two new terms are used: +pvp and
-pvp (pvp stands for player vs. player). Previous FAQs have used the term PK and
non-PK. Essentially, +pvp means PK, and -pvp means non-PK).</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.1 Will player killing (PK) be allowed in the game?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Player killing is a subject that is debated constantly on the
net, and both sides to this eternal argument have great points. We want to
accommodate both gameplay styles (player killing and non-player killing), but we
don’t want to separate the players in terms of which servers they can play on.
So soon after a player creates a character, he or she will choose whether they
want to participate in player killing or not. If they choose not to, then they
will be immune to other player’s assaults, and can only die in battle against
NPCs. But those who like the added danger of player vs. player competition can
simply create their character with player killing switched to on and then do
battle with those who have chosen similarly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There has been some concern that this feature could limit
freedom and role playing, but if you really think about it, the bottom line is
that the only thing you can’t do in EverQuest because of the PK switch is kill
another player who doesn’t want to be killed. And while this will purposely
curtail the few who can only have fun at the expense of others’ enjoyment, the
rest of us can go ahead and have a great time playing the game, regardless of
whether our personal definition of role-playing includes player vs. player or
not.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.2 I've heard about this PK switch. How will this work?
Is it something you select at the beginning when creating your character or is
it something one can toggle on and off at will?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shortly after creating your character, you have the option of
becoming +pvp (by solving a simple quest). If you choose not to PK, only NPCs
can kill you. Certain actions can switch you from -pvp to +pvp, and it may be
possible to switch back, although if we do allow this, it will be a long and
hard series of tasks one must complete before switching back to -pvp.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.3 If I have my PK switch set to -pvp, can I heal a
friend while he fights another player?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, but that will most likely result in you switching to +pvp
(you are given fair warning before this occurs).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.3.1 If I have my PK switch set to -pvp, can I heal a
friend while he fights a monster without turning +pvp?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A -pvp cleric will become +pvp anytime they heal a +pvp player
(again, you are given fair warning before this occurs).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.3.2 If a healer heals a +pvp person while they are
*not* in battle, will the healer's PK switch also be turned to +pvp?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, any aid a -pvp character renders to a +pvp character
would result in his own status switching to +pvp.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.4 Can I steal items, or pickpocket, with a -pvp
character? Wouldn't that make it impossible for people to retaliate?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You may not steal from another player if you are -pvp. You
can, however, steal from NPCs. If you are +pvp, you may steal from both +pvp
players and NPCs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.4.1 If I am -pvp and go adventuring with my friend who
is +pvp and another player kills him, can I take his stuff before the killer
steals it?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, a -pvp character cannot loot a +pvp corpse.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.5 Are there negative consequences to Pkilling? Like
getting arrested in cities, not being able to shop, and other similar
deterrents?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In general, yes, but keep in mind that with 12 races, many of
which simply do not get along well with each other, there will be plenty of
cases where Pkilling makes sense in terms of role-playing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.6 Will some areas be safe-zones or can you be killed
anywhere even in shops?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No safe-zones, but there will be consequences if you do it in
civilized areas.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.7 Will there be guards in the cities?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, and they don't react well to PKilling.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.8 Will there be any environments where a -pvp player can
challenge another -pvp player?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, there will be Arenas and other locations where -pvp
characters can fight one another -- the fight is not to the death, but rather to
unconsciousness, and the victor will be unable to loot the loser's corpse. Also,
a -pvp player can challenge another -pvp player to a duel, and if both consent,
they can fight to the death just as if they were +pvp.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.8.1 Can someone I'm dueling have his or her friends heal
them during the fight?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, no one else may interfere in any way.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.8.2 Is there the possibility of allowing multiple people
to participate in duels?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not at this time, but we'll toss the idea around.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.8.3</strong> <b>Isn't dueling technically PKilling?
Why should someone who is -pvp be allowed to duel?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The -pvp option is designed to allow adventuring without the
necessity of dealing with non-role-playing attacks from PKs. The dueling option
is meant to further player interaction in a role-playing context. If someone
you've never met or heard of challenges you to a duel, it is probably out of
context and you have a right to refuse the challenge if you feel it does not fit
in with your perception of the game story line. If, however, a particular player
has really started to bug you (or vice versa) in a way that makes sense within
the gaming parameters, you can interact with that player in an aggressive manner
without having to relinquish your -pvp status.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.8.4</strong> <b>Given the dueling option, could not
EverQuest just eliminate PKilling completely?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Absolutely not. The switch allows players who get a thrill of
living dangerously the opportunity to do just that with other like minded
individuals. +Pvp players don't need to request a duel with each other -- they
can just start swinging.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.9 Will there be an in-game explanation provided for
the PK switch? i.e.: blessing of a god of peace, or something like that?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes -- we want it to make sense in the world and have context.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.10 What measures will be taken given that -pvp
players are free to go anywhere they want? What if they got in your guild house
and just sat there?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You'll need to lock the doors behind you.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.11 Will EverQuest GMs be biased against pkillers,
and will they interfere with a player's game play?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We really don't need to with the PK Switch. We will favor
neither +pvp nor -pvp players.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.12 Any news on the reward for killing staff people?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No new news, but there will be one.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.13 What are the consequences if you PK a lot,
randomly?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There will be consequences to this, but we're not revealing
details at the moment.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.14 Will there be an option such that a player can
tell if another character is +pvp or -pvp?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, it will be visually apparent to players whether a
character is +pvp or -pvp.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.15 Any chance of there being a way for +pvp players
to kill -pvp players, maybe by contract or something?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.16 Will races be balanced such that one race is not that
much stronger than the others in player vs. player combat?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, we are in the process of balancing the races and
classes, but that doesn't necessarily mean that each race/class combo should be
able to go toe to toe with each other and be about even. Our idea of balance is
that each race/class has a compelling reason behind it, such that they will all
be needed in adventuring and questing. There will undoubtedly be some race/class
combos that do better one on one, especially in a PK situation (note, that's one
on one-- some of these 'weaker' race/class combos might be extremely deadly when
they work together, which adds another dimension to the whole PK environment).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>11.17 Which is the race the most interesting for
player-killing?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That's rather subjective, and we encourage everyone, when you
play the game, to try them all out and come to your own conclusions and
preferences.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.18 Will you receive experience points for killing
another player?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No. In EverQuest, if you want experience, go quest and
adventure. If you want to PK somebody, go ahead, and if you win, loot him. But
you won't receive experience, nor will your skills go up in PK combat. This is
to avoid inherent potential abuse -- for example, two players sparring with one
another to increase their skills.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>11.19 Will you launch with a PvP only server (where
all players are succeptable to PKilling)?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, there are two types of PvP servers reserved for this.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">11.20 What are the &quot;Team&quot; PvP servers?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Team PvP servers consist of four teams. A member of a given team may freely
attack any member of another team, but not their own. Note, this does not rule
out the possibility of traitors or alliances between teams.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">11.21 What are the Teams for Team PvP?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are four teams: The Humans - Barbarians, Erudites, Humans; The Elves -
Half Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves; The &quot;Shorties&quot; - Dwarves, Gnomes,
Halflings; and The Dark Races - Dark Elves, Ogres, Trolls.</font></p>
<p><a name="12.0 Character death."><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">12.0 Character Death.</font></strong></a></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>12.1 How will you deal with death? Is it permanent or do
you just lose some stats, skills, and items?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is not permanent, however there are serious penalties. You
will want to seriously avoid death, but if you do make an error, it doesn't mean
that your character you've worked hard on for six months is gone.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>12.1.1&nbsp; Is there the possibility of a character
being &quot;permanently&quot; killed? (i.e. Permanent Death)?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We feel that part of the allure of EverQuest is the pride you
take in building up a character over time. And given the fact that nastiness can
happen in an online environment... like your ISP croaks, your modem dies, or
whatever, that permanent death just isn't yet viable in this genre.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>12.1.2 But in most paper &amp; pencil RPGs if you get
killed in combat, you're forever dead. Why isn't this going to be the case in
EverQuest?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because you can't control every aspect of the game environment
like in paper &amp; pencil RPGs. You might unavoidably go link dead.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>12.2 Is there a limit to the number of times you can die?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No official limit, but given the penalties, you won't want to
do it often.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>12.3 When monsters die, will they remain as sprites or fade
away slowly like in Quake?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Corpses deteriorate over time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>12.4 When you die, do you &quot;resurrect with
penalties&quot;? Must you run off to a temple in &quot;ghost&quot; mode, or
what?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You do come back with penalties -- but not as a ghost, nor
where you died.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>12.5 Any idea how much stats you will lose when you
die?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You don't lose stats -- you lose experience, the amount of
which depends on what level your character is.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>12.6 Can you fall from great heights, and will it kill
you?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can fall, and you will take damage, and that damage can
kill you.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>12.7 Can I log off from a fight to survive?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you log off, your character will still be in the game for a
few minutes. He will defend himself, but I'd say it's certainly not without
significant risk.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>12.7.1 In Tanarus, if you hit the ALT-Q, you actually send
a signal to the server indicating you want to willingly leave the game. But if
you lose your connection (local brownout, blackout, rodent chews through power
cord, etc.) this signal is not sent. In this situation, couldn't you simply be
listed as &quot;XXXXX has been disconnected&quot; without any penalty and
without your character remaining in the game for a few minutes?</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We would have to handle both cases in the same manner to avoid
abuse by the less than honorable who would intentionally drop signal
(ctrl-alt-del, reset, etc.) to avoid defeat.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><b>12.8 If I lose connection during a fight, will my character
