<td width="100%"><font size="2">On June 11, 2004, questions from the Magician community were sent to SOE President John Smedley, and Everquest Community Relations Manager Alan Crosby (aka Brenlo).<br><br><br><P>John Smedley, Alan Crosby, and the entire EverQuest development team,<br><br><P>On behalf of the Magician community, I thank you for this opportunity for<br>reading this feedback and for answering our questions.<br><br><P>With the Omens of War expansion coming up so soon after the (poorly<br>implemented) Gates of Discord expansion, the entire EverQuest community has<br>place extreme criticism over Sony Online Entertainment. I needn&#39;t go into<br>the flaws with Gates of Discord; however, SOE, until recently, seemed poised<br>to repeat the mistakes of the last five major expansions:<br><br><P>-Creating class imbalance due to level increases, mob difficulty increases,<br>and poor creativity and implementation in class abilities and spells.<BR><br>-Alienating the common player, and catering to the high end player base (aka<br>uber-guilds).<BR><br>-Providing little or no benefit to low and mid level players, and providing<br>heavy emphasis on the high level player base.<BR><br>-Straying away from the fantasy roleplay aspects of the game, and instead<br>concentrate on "alien" themes.<BR><br>-Making the game less "fun" by removing, among other things, the "Quest" in<br>"EverQuest."<br><br><P>The Magician community addresses the representatives of the EverQuest<br>development team and seeks to find out more about the new expansion to<br>determine its value.<br><br><P>However, before we can understand Omens of War, we must understand the<br>Magician class further. We MUST know the CURRENT state of the Magician<br>class. Therefore, I present these specific questions.<br><br><P>-What is Sony Online Entertainment&#39;s definition of the Magician class? What<br>is our role?<BR><br>-What is our relative rank among "DPS" classes? Among other spell caster<br>classes?<BR><br>-Are we, or are we not, the premier pet class? If so, why are we less<br>capable of supporting our pets as other classes? Why are Dire Charm pets<br>perceived as outdamaging our pets?<BR><br>-Are we, or are we not, a soloing class? If we are, why is soloing from<br>level 61 beyond far less viable than it was from levels 1 to 60? Why do many<br>classes (especially classes able to Kite and Quad-Kite) have a superior solo<br>advantage?<BR><br>-At this point in the game, why are we the only caster that has no way to<br>survive a hostile environment except Gate?<BR><br>-Why are Magician pet heals so lacking?<br><br><P>The members of the Magician community also want to know answers to the<br>following class balance issues.<br><br>-Why are druids overall a better nuke class than Magicians? [Note: As of<br>June 9th, Test server was patched to bridge the gaps between Magician and<br>Druid post-level-63 nukes. However, Druids still retain their nuking<br>advantage from levels 1 to 62, and 63+ with Quick Damage]<BR><br>-Is our pet expected to cover the full range of abilities (Root, Snare, etc)<br>that other classes have?<BR><br>-Where are the pet-specific focus items? (Aeromancy, Aquamancy, Geomancy,<br>Pyromancy)<BR><br>-Why has it taken so long to resolve the issues with the 51+ fire pets?<BR><br>-When will Magicians receive a form of defense that is actually usable by a<br>level 50 mage with zero AA?<BR><br>-Why was the summoned population of Plane of Fire apparently nerfed, while<br>Planes of Earth and Air were left untouched?<BR><br>-Will pets ever return to high (invulnerable or near) resists to specific<br>element AoEs?<br><br><P>There are several things known about the new expansion. However, the<br>Magician community seeks more specific answers to the following questions.<br><br><P>The number one question on EVERY EverQuest player&#39;s mind is:<br><br><P>-What kind of Quality Assurances will be in place to ensure the "Cluster"<br>(as elequantly put at the Guild Summit) does not happen again in Omens of<br>War, and future expansions?<br><br><P>Furthermore, the following questions about Omens of War are asked by the<br>Magician Community:<br><br><P>-What is the expected level range for Omens of War zones?<BR><br>-Related to the above question, will the Gates expansion be required to gain<br>access to Omens zones?<BR><br>-Will the Epic 2.0 be accessible to Non-Time-equipped players?<BR><br>-Will the Epic 2.0 quests be mostly 1 groupable, or will raids be required<br>for most parts of the epic?<BR><br>-Will summoned creatures be put into the new (and retroduced into existing)<br>zones so we have a reason to use our anti-summoned spells?<BR><br>-Related to the question above, will there be a continuation of the poorly<br>implemented summoned-charm and summoned-mesmerization spell lines?<BR><br>-Will a large number of Omens zones be seeded with direcharm-able (normal,<br>animal, and undead) creatures? If so, how many will also be seeded with<br>level 60 summoned and charmable creatures?<BR><br>-Will there be any new spell lines for Magicians? In general?<BR><br>-Will existing IV focus items and focus items from the Elemental Planes and<br>beyond be usable from level 66 and up?<BR><br>-Will Magicians be receiving any kind of aggro reducing abilities or spells?<BR><br>-Will spells in Omens be common, similar to Kunark, Luclin, and Planes of<br>Power, or will they be rare and hard to obtain, leaving only the elite few<br>to collect them?<BR><br>-Related to the above question, will spell scrolls be NO DROP?<BR><br>-Will there be new content for low to mid level players?<BR><br>-Will the new Task System be implemented for ALL levels of characters?<BR><br>-Will magicians get the needed resist modifiers to our damage spells that<br>all other dps casters (dru/wiz/nec) get? (Even bards were given a -50 resist<br>modifier in their attack spells recently)<BR><br>-Are there plans for an upgraded Mod Rod in Omens?<br><br><P>Finally, the community wants to know about the state of Everquest&#39;s future.<br><br><P>-When will Everquest return to being a fantasy role-playing game, rather<br>than the space/alien themes of Shadows of Luclin, Gates of Discord, and<br>apparently Omens of War?<BR><br>-When will Roleplaying become a significant part of game play again?<BR><br>-When will we hear feedback about our class balance posts that are on the<br>official SOE boards?<BR><br>-Will there be new models for pets in Omens of War and the new graphics<br>engine? Will they be humanoid to allow riding on mounts while under an<br>elemental illusion?<BR><br>-Will there be a second Summit for those classes not represented as well, if<br>at all, at the first Summit?<BR><br>-What is being done to ensure the longevity and survivability of EverQuest<br>in the current MMORPG market?<br><br><P>Please respond to these questions in a prompt and timely manner. Sony Online<br>Entertainment and EverQuest are poised to recaptre and retain the title of<br>best MMORPG game and company.
