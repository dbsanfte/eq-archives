<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Hey guys, sorry
for the lack of responses lately. I've been hard at work on the Luclin spells,
and haven't had much time to go through the Dev Corner emails.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm wondering will PotG and
Barrier of force ever stack I find it rather silly that a rune and a HP buff don't
stack seeing that barrier is the effect of an epic weapon which would be far
more powerful then a normal casted spell.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I've corrected the
issue in the spdat, these two effects should stack next patch.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last night as I sat in Dreadlands
meditating, a kind enchanter cast Clarity II and Gift of Brilliance on me, and I
in return cast Spirit of the Wolf on him. When I got to my choice of hunting
grounds, I attempted to cast Form of the Howler on myself and I just kept
getting the &quot;your spell did not take hold&quot; message. I could not cast
Form of the Howler while I had the spell Gift of Brilliance on. As soon as that
spell wore off, I was able to cast Form of the Howler. Please look into the
stacking issue on these spells.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Both of these
spells share a mana regen component in the same effect slot. They won't stack
because the components are the same value of 2 points.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Oh those crafty people at Verant,
hiding a 61 level enchanter spell in the Temple of Marr, clerics guild in NFP,
sold on the first floor by a merchant named Anata D'Lavi. I was so excited!</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What could it be?&nbsp; The mighty
Smite spell! For CLR and ENC, so I quickly bought one and tried to scribe it.
Yes, I received the message, &quot;Must be level 61 to scribe&quot;, hehe can't
wait.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">When a spell is
listed as being level 61 for your class to use, that means your class doesn't
get it and the item is incorrectly flagged. I've fixed the Smite scroll, sorry
for any confusion</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">- Lawrence Poe</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I was shopping in Neriak with my
Shadow Knight today shortly before I logged.. I was looking through spells and
when I got to the merchant Rizyra F'Lok she had a spell on her that caught my
attention when I noticed it was a level 61 Shadow Knight spell Augment Death, is
somewhat distressing seeing level 61 spells when can never reach level 61. Is
this spell going to be changed so Shadow Knights will be able to use it, or is
it remaining out of their level reaching capabilities to ever use?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">See Previous
response on level 61 spells.... Fixed the scroll, sorry for any confusion.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have found that the Paladin
Self-Regen Spell, Divine Perpose, will not stack with the Scourge DOT. If Divine
Perpose is on me, Scourge will be able to be cast on me, but if scrounge is on
me, I cannot cast Divine purpose on myself.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This is a result
of the changes we recently made to the stacking code. If you have a buff on that
shares components of a negative spell, the negative spell will overwrite the
buff. On the flipside a negative component can never be overwritten by a
positive one under the new stacking rules.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I do not want to be given credit
publicly for this, but I am concerned that by not reporting this, I may be
exploiting and given the recent penalties for exploiting, I do not want to be a
part of this practice. It seems that after wednesday's patch, it is possible to
stack Form of the Howler, Form of the Hunter, and Spirit of Oak. From that
point, you can cancel spirit of oak and keep all the benefits of Form of the
Howler and Form of the Hunter without wolf illusion and the negative and
positive faction (mostly negative) that come with it. Please either say this is
ok or not intended.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This was a bug
that we introduced a couple of patches ago, it should be corrected now.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Any chance there will be solo
teleports (gates) to points in Velious other than the Iceclad Ocean? We got them
for Kunark (Combine Gate), and it'd be a great savings in time and mana if we
could get them for the Great Divide, Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scar as well.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I've been wanting
to put those in for a while, hopefully I can get them in soon.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have noticed that some spells I
cast on myself randomly decide to give no warning when they begin to fade.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the past, I would get something
to the effect of &quot;You feel as if you are about to fall...&quot; when
levitate is wearing off in addition to the icon blinking for about 10 seconds.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I have noticed buffs fading
in either of two manners; they simply just go away (No blinking icon or warning
text at all) or the icon blinks for a few seconds and no warning text.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have noticed this with Arch
Shielding, Dead Man Floating, Levitate (ouch) and a few others.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I saw someone shouting in
Dreadlands tonight that they needed a rez because their levitate gave no warning
when it was fading. So, they fell to their death running out of the snow tunnel.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Is this a known issue? Is
experience loss reimbursable if caused by this?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This is the first
I have heard of this happening. I will forward your email to our testing
department and have them take a look. Thanks for the feedback.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A few weeks ago there was talk of
a skeleton form being added to the spell lists for SK's. What happened to this ?
Is it still in the works ?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I've always liked
the idea of giving skeli form to SKs, I wanted to put it on Shroud of Death,
unfortunately that would have caused large race SKs to not be able to Slam. I
would still like to give skeli form to SKs. Hopefully I can get that in sometime
soon.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Could you please consider making a
spell at level 60 for enchanters similar to what clerics get with Aegolism? It's
becoming so tedious to buff everyone on raids at 60.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Something like &quot;Gift of the
Phantasmist&quot;. A group spell that would wrap up Gift of Pure Thought,
Enlightenment, and possibly Gift of Brilliance.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Although you can consider leaving
out Gift of Brilliance if you insist on keeping the mana cost at 450. Talk about
an broken spell. Four hundred and fifty mana! for a spell that adds 150 mana to
your mana pool, and *BARELY* increases mana regen. Not worth casting in 99% of
situations.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Gift of the Phantasmist, level 60<br>
Group C2 and Enlightenment<br>
Casting time: 5 seconds<br>
Duration: 2 hours 30 minutes<br>
Mana: 1500</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can see how Gift of Brilliance
is so out of whack. If you added GoB to the proposed spell, it would make the
spell cost 4200 mana. Laugh.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I'm hard at work
on the Luclin spells.... Anything is possible</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Shouldn't the cleric spell
&quot;Cure Blindness&quot; effectively cancel the necromancer &quot;Clinging
Darkness&quot; line of spells?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the moment it does not do so. I
tested it to be sure. I even tested it with a level 9 cleric attempting to
cancel a Clinging Darkness from a level 6 necro. Numerous castings all failed to
remove the effect.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It would seem a logical
application for an otherwise rarely-used spell.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Clinging Darkness
does not have a blind component, which is why Cure Blindness does not effect the
spell.</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">During the development of a
product like EverQuest, at what point is there no turning back? Technology
speaking. How far into the design and implementation can you allow for inclusion
of new technology prior to release? Like graphics(software) and servers(hardware).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, the good news is that with MMOGs,
there’s really never a time when you can’t include new technology. The
client software is always patchable, data on the server side can be updated, and
even server hardware can be replaced. And we’ve done all three with EverQuest
in the last couple of years. Not only have we updated the client’s engine,
we’ve also started using newer versions of Direct X. The server-side data is
updated almost every patch with new content. And the server-side hardware has
been upgraded many times – we’ve added more memory, faster CPUs, and faster
hard drives as technology has advanced.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I was a beta player and am
still a big fan of the game (EQ) after all this time. One of the things you did
when you created the game was to say that all the servers would be maintained by
Sony/Verant rather than like what ID had been doing with QUAKE, where anyone
could set up a Quake server. There would be no private &quot;World Servers&quot;
in EQ.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I guess my question is: Is this
the model you are following for all future games currently planned? Will you be
setting up a Neverwinter Nights style game eventually where players generate the
content for one another?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Guess we players are all just
frustrated Game designers at heart.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Personally I think there’s a big future for
both traditional MMOGs as well as ‘Neverwinter Nights’ style games.
They’re both very different, afterall.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’ve no plans on making EverQuest such that
the public could maintain servers for two reasons:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. It’s not the economic model we’ve
designed both the game and its support structure for.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. One EQ world takes something like 20+
high-end dual processor machines with tons of memory to run, not to mention gobs
of bandwidth. So we simply don’t think it would be very practical for people
outside of our business to run.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That said, while EQ, Star Wars: Galaxies,
Planetside, and Sovereign are all being designed as premium subscription based
MMOGs, I wouldn’t rule out an SOE/Verant ‘Neverwinter Nights’ style game
one day. I can’t wait to play the game myself, as well as to discover the
potential of user-generated content.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Ok, so Verant likes grouping...
But, they apparently don't like multi-group raids... Why isn't there a 'raid
channel (or channels)' for each zone?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A lot of people aren't in
guilds, and a lot of guilds get allies to raid - why not fix this 'design flaw'
so you can accommodate us?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">(granted, 'design flaw' is not
the most appropriate word, but it fits my feelings on this...)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You’re right: we need to better accommodate
multi-group raids. We definitely have lots of content in the game designed for
raids, and we love the fact that the game can handle massive battles. But it
wasn’t always that way, which can help explain why we don’t currently have
any features to support groups with more than six members.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Way back when we were designing the game we
were very worried about how many players we’d be able to display on the screen
at once. This was back when we were developing a software render and using
Pentium 133s to develop the client. In the text MUDs we’d played, groups could
be huge (sometimes there’d be between twenty and thirty people all attacking a
dragon). But we were worried about framerate, and what might happen if a bunch
of players appeared on the screen at once.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Single player games didn’t really have such
concerns because their developers could always control how many players and NPCs
could appear on the screen at once – they could budget for a maximum. But we
couldn’t stop an army of players from assembling (nor did we really want to).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So we designed the game for a maximum group
size of six, made some character optimizations (for example, dynamic level of
detail on character models), and hoped for the best.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turns out, over time, technology has advanced
such that we can display many more players than ever we’d hoped. Not only
that, bandwidth optimizations have been made as well. So we’ve been putting in
raid content for some time, but I agree with you – it’s time to put in
additional support and features for larger group communications, experience
splitting, etc.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t have a time frame for you, but I hope
it will happen by Luclin or soon after.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My question is about the effect
&quot;pulling&quot; has had on the game and if it's not what you originally had
in mind when the game play was being designed. Would/will you design your next
games to be Pull proof?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have read on the boards from
time to time, that Verant was disappointed when certain situations were being
single pulled because your intent was for those to be multi mob encounters. I
play a Monk and in my 59.4 levels I have pulled A LOT of mobs. I have abilities
that make it easy in most cases to pull a single back for processing.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have follow up questions that
ride on your answer being that pulling is not what you originally intended,
especially FD splitting. What was your intent was with FD if it wasn’t
pulling? Will you include similar ability in future ventures?</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Observation from me as a
player: It doesn’t work in a fight if other players are still hitting said
mob, so, it only seems to be useful for pulling and CR.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, yes and no. The original intent of the
game certainly did not include ‘pulling’. We rarely pulled when we were
playing text MUDs; rather, we’d fight room to room, adventuring through a
dungeon or towards a specific goal.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But, obviously, 3D graphical MUDs like
EverQuest aren’t room based (in other words, there’s no clear delineation
between rooms like most text MUDs have). One of the several results of this
evolution from text to graphics was ‘pulling’.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">From a design standpoint, pulling is a bit
frustrating because it’s much harder to set up an encounter with multiple NPCs
that you desire to fight the player (or group of players) all at once. Pulling
allows one to separate groups of NPCs, singling them out, making them easier to
kill.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">All that said, we did realize these
ramifications early in beta and started adapting the game accordingly. Spells
and other strategies were put into the game to support and actually help players
pull, and the game designers started laying out dungeons and other adventure
areas accordingly.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the future, I’d love to experiment further
and try to recapture more of the multi-NPC battles we experienced in text MUDs.
But EverQuest is and will remain a game where ‘pulling’ is a valid and
recognized tactic. Oh, and Feign Death was originally designed to be merely a
feature that would save a Monk should a battle go rather badly. It was an
ability we gave that class to make up for their lower Armor Class.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">You are discussing a lot of
ideas with the player base that undoubtedly your competition is reading also.
What are your thoughts on this? Giving the competition a bit of a glimpse to the
internal thinking at SOE/Verant and potentially giving them ideas. Or worse yet
seeing them make an idea you discarded work very well.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When it comes to competition and ideas, there
are two extremes, and I like to think we’re somewhere in the middle. One
extreme is to carefully hide all ideas and technology until the very last
minute, lest some other company use an idea in their product or be influenced in
some positive way. The other extreme is to talk about everything and have no
secrets.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think we’re early enough in the evolution
of MMOGs that it helps all those involved to share ideas to some extent. To that
end, we’re a pretty open and friendly group of developers. Most people
involved in making these games know each other, hang out with each other at GDCs
and E3s, participate in email lists and message boards, sharing ideas and
dreams.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That said, you won’t read some ideas of ours
in detail in this column or elsewhere. We do have some pretty nifty plans and
schemes we think should remain private until such time they can be implemented.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s really all about balance. Will our
competition glean something from my posts here that will help them? Well,
that’s very flattering, and if they do, so be it. I know we look at their
products and posts, trying to learn what to do and what not to do. It’s only
fair that they do the same.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Are there any plans to have
books written that take place in the world of Norrath, perhaps telling the
exploits of Firona Vie, Lanys T'vyl or other noteworth folk? Maybe giving more
detail about things that have happened, like Bloody Kithicor? I think it would
be great, and a nice way to carry a little EverQuest with us when we can't be
near our PC.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’d love to have novels written about
Norrath and its inhabitants. I can’t say much more right now, but we ARE
currently talking to publishers and writers.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Brad who the heck are you any
way ?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I’m Brad McQuaid, currently the Vice
President of Premium Games for Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">John Smedley hired Steve Clover and me in
March, 1996 to work on a massively multiplayer RPG. Initially I was the lead
programmer, but after a few months became EverQuest’s Producer (the Producer
being the person who manages and leads the development team, which typically
consists of programmers, artists, and designers).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Steve and I were also the game’s original
designers, and architects of the original Design Document. We came up with the
core design (modeled heavily on MUD principles) and a rough outline of Norrath.
Bill Trost later came on board and became the official lead designer, filling in
most of Norrath’s detail and background history, and also replacing our
initial alignment system with a much more intricate faction system.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I also did a lot of the PR for EverQuest early
on, because 989 was focused more on Playstation titles at the time.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After Verant Interactive spun off of 989
Studios, John Smedley became president of that company and I became Vice
President. We took on more projects and I moved from a direct management role
into more of an Executive Producer (Jeff Butler replaced me as EverQuest’s
Producer and he took over the Live/Expansions teams).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And finally, when Sony Online Entertainment
bought Verant Interactive, I became one of several Vice Presidents, but remained
managing our Premium subscription based games. Currently I’m the Executive
Producer on EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, as well as some other unannounced
titles. I also oversee, albeit at a higher level, the Star Wars: Galaxies
project, with Rich Vogel, Director of Development, running the project. I’ve
also been involved in the design process behind Planetside and Sovereign.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I was wondering about the
capacity that each server has for zones. When EQ started, the only zones were
from the 'old world'. Then the Kunark zones were added, then Velious and soon
Luclin. What is the limit for zones? Is there one? Are the servers actually
single box solutions, or is each 'server' a number of machines, making the
number of zones almost unlimited?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The sever architecture behind EverQuest is very
modular, with zones running on multiple machines. So as we expand the world
(which really means simply adding more zones), we also add more ‘zone
servers.’ Kunark and Velious added several machines per world, as will Luclin.
As for a limit, I’m sure there is one, because there are still functions that
need to be centralized. But, luckily for us, technology has continued to advance
such that we’ve always been able to upgrade both our central and zone computer
hardware with faster and faster components.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I'm really curious about how
all the EQ servers are housed, i mean, there's over 30 servers and they got to
be huge, do you all house them in a big building ? Does everyone on the EQ team
work there as well? or are you all really covert and hanging out in mom's garage
powering these beasts ?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This question, the previous one, and many
others were about EverQuest servers and topology. Scott McDaniel (our VP of
Marketing) and Adam Joffe (our Director of Operations) recently did an interview
where they discuss our servers at <a href="http://www.hostingtech.com/eb/01_06_everquest.html" target="_blank"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>http://www.hostingtech.com/eb/01_06_everquest.html</b></font></span></a>
-- check it out and let us know what you think.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My question is in regards to
the Luclin expansion. As an answer to a previous question you stated that the
zones in the old world zones would not be enhanced with the new Luclin engine.
My question is about the characters, will those all have the new look once the
expansion is enabled? Will we have to remake our characters to get the new look?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Don’t worry – no need to remake any
characters (that is, unless you decide to start a new Kerran character). The new
character graphics will show up for all characters if you upgrade to the
Expansion and turn those graphics on (even if you do upgrade, you’ll have the
option to turn them off if you still prefer the older graphics). And you’ll
see the new characters on Luclin as well as on the Old World.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">What are your thoughts on having one character
per account on a server? I personally think it shot down two birds with one
stone. It made twinking much harder and also made people think twice about
soiling their reputations. Will this be considered in future EQ servers and
future games, and is it Boxers or Briefs for you?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I definitely think fewer characters per server
is a good thing. To understand why there are eight character slots per server,
we’ll have to take another walk down memory lane:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Back when we were designing the game, we had NO
clue if it would turn out to be popular or not. We certainly had no idea we’d
end up with 30+ servers. In fact, we were thinking we’d have five or six at
most. And because we wanted to have a game with 12 races and 14 classes, we also
wanted to make sure players had the opportunity to explore and enjoy most of
those race/class combos, should they so choose.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Obviously, with 20/20 hindsight and 30+
servers, eight character slots per world isn’t necessary. And that is why you
see the feature restricted on Sullon Zek and the future RP server. We will also
consider fewer character slots with our future games.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Just a couple of questions
about Luclin and stuff.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I know that current characters
will have the option to &quot;remodel&quot; their character in the expansion,
such as changing faces, etc.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1. Will you be able to colour
hair? Just curious.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Don’t think so, no.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2. Will current characters be
able to opt *not* to turn into a new model?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You’ll be able to toggle between showing all
player characters using the new models or the old (but probably not a
combination thereof).</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">3. Will people who do not
upgrade to Luclin (I don’t imagine there will be many. ) be able to see the
new models? (They'll obviously have to have higher system specs if they will be
able to)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, they’ll need to buy Luclin in order to
see the new models.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">4. Will my paladin ever be able
to wear a plate helm without it looking like a bucket on his head?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’ll have to wait and see.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">5. Do you think that SOE is
trying to gain a monopoly on the MMOG market? They've already got Infantry, EQ,
SW:Galaxies, and a few others I cant remember...</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I certainly wouldn’t call us a monopoly,
because we currently have some formidable competitors and there are also lots of
future MMOGs in development. That said, with both the experience gained and the
pool of talent we’ve put together, I definitely think SOE/Verant is poised to
be this market’s leader for quite some time to come.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">6. Do you and the GMs have LAN
parties on your what must be an unimaginably sweet office setup?</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana">Heh, not often enough.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I was recently reading through
your posts and stumbled on your comments regarding DirectX and OpenGL.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I beg to differ on one point.
There is an advantage to using OpenGL, and that is EQ could more easily be
ported to Linux or MacOS. I for one, would love to see a MacOS port. I have many
friends who are unable to play EQ, because they are Mac diehards and refuse to
pay Mr. Gates.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">While I realize it is probably
too late for EQ, are there plans to port future Verant MMORPG titles (SWG --
*hint* *hint*) to other platforms?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That’s a very valid point – it’s
definitely easier to port to other platforms using OpenGL. Unfortunately,
however, EverQuest is very Win32-centric, and not only because we chose to use
Direct X, so I don’t think you’ll be seeing it ported any time soon.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our second generation engines, however, are
being designed from the ground up to be much more portable.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Short and simple question: Why
didn't casters get disciplines, or some equivalent ability?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Short and simple answer: We came up with
disciplines so we could enhance the melee classes because it didn’t make sense
to give them spells. In other words, casters get new spells instead.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I was wondering... I noticed
every Expansion of EQ comes with a map with the new continent added (i.e.
Kunark, Velious). Well this may seem a silly question, but how do you plan on
adding the moon to this map? Isn’t the moon a Three Dimensional land? Will
there be a nice cardboard un-foldable cut out?</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana">Luclin will indeed come with a
new map, and hopefully in a more unique and three-dimensional format.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Why are some, smaller cities
divided into zones, like Kaladim and Felwithe? It seems like they could've
easily been one zone, especially when compared to other one-zone places.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many of the earlier zones were so large that
the game designers had to split them up because they were too large to work on
all in one piece. Zones like those you mentioned, as well as Solusek’s Eye,
Qeynos, and many others began as one zone but were later split into two (or even
three with Neriak) because the files grew so large it brought their systems to a
crawl. More recently, with Kunark and Velious, we were able to make large,
single zones, because PCs are so much faster now (speedier CPUs, more RAM, and
better 3D cards).</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I remember reading about a
possible EQ comic book and some fantasy novels coming out. Is this being
developed?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Funny you should ask that, because Jeff Butler
and I are having lunch tomorrow with Jim Lee to check on the comic's process.
Jim is a very busy guy, but we do plan on getting this comic done this year (I
hope). And for those of you familiar with Jim Lee’s art, well, you know the
comic will certainly be worth the wait.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thanks for all your emails! Keep 'em coming!</font>
