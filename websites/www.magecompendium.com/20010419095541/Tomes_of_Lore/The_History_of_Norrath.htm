<p align="left"><font color="#ffffff" face="Verdana" size="2">From the Dawn of
Time to the Present Day : The History of Norrath</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is said that outside of space and time an
entity known only as the Nameless exists, and that this being created all that
there is and was and will be. It is also written in ancient texts that from His
mind sprang not only the universe and its countless suns and worlds, but also a
myriad of sentient, powerful, yet finite creatures whom one such as a man, or
elf, or dwarf, would call a god.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In aeons past came one of these gods upon the
world Norrath. Veeshan, Crystalline Dragon and ruler of the Plane of Sky, found
this world pleasing and deposited her brood onto the frozen continent of Velious.
With one swipe of her mighty claws, Veeshan opened several great wounds upon the
surface of Norrath, staking her claim to this promising new world. Dragons then
walked the land and flew the skies, powerful beings of great intellect, wisdom,
and strength. Thus began the Age of Scale.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In time the other gods noticed Veeshan's work,
and being often petty and jealous beings, they too came upon Norrath, intent
upon leaving their mark. Brell Serilis was first, and from his Plane of
Underfoot, a dark realm of vast caves and endless tunnels, he quietly created a
magical portal to a cavern deep in the belly of Norrath. Through this portal the
Duke of Underfoot seeded the depths of Norrath with all manner of creatures.
Brell then returned home, sealing his portal within a labyrinthine chamber of
mystical Living Stone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And when the other gods came to Norrath, Brell
Serilis approached each of them, and after some time convinced them to meet as
one to discuss the fate of the world. The Great Mother Tunare, and Prexus, The
Oceanlord were in attendance, and Rallos Zek, the warlord, was also there, yet
in mistrust kept his distance. Brell, carefully avoiding all queries as to the
origins of his information, told of Veeshan's discovery of the new and
potentially powerful world in which she had deposited her brood. Words befit of
the King of Thieves poured forth from Brell's lips and he proposed that they
accept an alliance of sorts, to which all save Rallos Zek agreed, ignorant of
the fact that Brell had already released some of his creations into the
Underfoot of this new world. The planet that would be called Norrath was divvied
up between these beings of power for the purpose of keeping the Wurmqueen in
check. Each would create a race of beings to watch over Norrath and keep a
vigilant eye on the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell claimed the bowels of the
planet and created the Dwarves, stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains of
Norrath. In the abysmal depths of the oceans Prexus left his children, the
Kedge, hearty aquatic beings of great mental power and stamina. And on the
surface of Norrath did Tunare create the Elves, creatures of limitless grace and
beauty, and Rallos Zek the Giants, fierce and formidable beings, intent upon the
defense of their lands. Thus began the Elder Age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was inevitable that such energies involved
in seeding planets with life would attract even more of the gods, and it was the
Elves who drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. In a decrepit
tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he ruled,
Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He
cursed his fellow gods for not including him in their pact and vowed to make
them regret such disrespect. From the halls of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz,
the Prince of Hate snatched away the first Elven King and Queen. In his realm of
pain and anger he slowly tore them apart, physically and mentally, over the
course of three hundred years. He then gathered the quivering remnants of these
beings of light and rebuilt them into his own dark sadistic image, a twisted
mockery of Tunare's noble children. In depositing the Teir'Dal, as Innoruuk's
Dark Elven creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot of Norrath,
the seeds for The Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane and Cazic-Thule came
next to Norrath, and Brell met them, concocting a second pact with these latter
gods, wishing another excuse to create more peoples into the world. Rallos Zek
again watched from afar, determined to add to his creation as well, and this
time Brell convinced the Warlord to join the pact, assuring him that it was
indeed an appropriate time to fulfill his desires. Deep in the earth did Brell
return to create the gnomes, resembling dwarves to some extent, yet more wiry
and gnarled, consumed with tinkering with devices more so than their cousins. On
the surface, away from Elves and Giants, Bristlebane made the Halflings, short
and stubby folk, agile and with a propensity to meddle and even pilfer at times.
Cazic-Thule, Lord of Fear, was drawn to the swamps and jungles of Norrath and
there created the green skinned Trolls and reptilian Lizard Men. And Rallos Zek
returned to the surface, pleased with his sanction to create even more peoples
for his army. He made then the Ogres, massive, unmovable beings of questionable
intelligence, and the Orcs, bred for battle and singled-minded in their desire
for conquest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By this time, those who are now known as the
elder races of Norrath had begun to expand and mature. Villages became cities,
and cities became kingdoms. Several of the races became bent on expansion and
warfare became part of their developing cultures. And of all the races, it was
the Ogres who quickly proved the most interested in battle and plunder, and
their empire grew outward from their mountain home until it eventually
encompassed a large portion of Tunaria, largest of the known continents. Their
knowledge of magic grew as did their greed, until they became weary of only
Norrath, and when they learned of other planes and dimensions, invaded the Plane
of Earth itself. Rallos Zek watched with pride as his creations challenged the
gods of that realm, and when they eventually knew defeat, the Warlord himself
led a second invasion. The war that ensued shook the heavens and angered the
greater gods. Through their combined might, Rallos Zek was finally thwarted and
forced back to his domain, after which a great barrier to the Planes of Power
was erected, denying entry to both the lesser gods and mortals as well. And
then, in what some view as spite and others justice, the gods cursed the
Warlord's creations. Thousands of Ogres were slain and their empire collapsed
around them. The Giants were spread from one end of the earth to the other,
forced to flee their homes as the gods brought snow and ice to their previously
lush lands. And the goblins were also cursed, but no writings remain of their
punishment as they no longer keep records of their history (which is perhaps
some indication as to the severity of their curse). Thus began the Age of
Monuments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the dust settled, the last of the gods came
to Norrath. Mithaniel Marr, god of Valor, and Erollisi Marr, goddess of Love,
created the Barbarians, a hardy race who settled the cold and rugged northlands,
near the ruins of the Giant empire. Being the youngest race, they were generally
unwashed and rugged, possessing very few social graces. And while they too had a
warlike culture, there were those amongst them who began to believe in something
more. By this time the other civilizations of Norrath had either long since
declined, or were well on their way, and this small minority of Barbarians saw
an opportunity to triumph where the others had failed. Perhaps this was a seed
of wisdom planted by the Marr Twins, or perhaps it was only by chance, but as
the Barbarians spread out across the lands, warring with both each other and any
other race encountered, this tiny movement continued to grow. And so even amidst
desolation and war, there was hope. Thus began the Age of Blood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The last of the old races to decline was the
empire of the Elves. The Elddar Forest spread across the entire southeastern
quarter of Tunaria. Cities and villages built high into the trees housed
thousands of Wood Elves, and the marble cities of the High Elves were built in
the forest's clearings and meadows, their white towers and spires climbing out
of the forest, higher than the tallest tree. But then came the last curse of the
gods, as Solusek Ro, Lord of Flame, arched the spine of the serpent mountains,
bringing heat from the burning sun to the ancient forest. The rivers ran dry, it
rained less each year, and while the great elven druids fought long and hard,
using their powerful magics to combat the change, they could only delay the
inevitable. Slowly the forest gave way to desert, and eventually even great
Takish-Hiz crumbled and the elves were forced to flee Tunaria, leaving much of
their greatness behind. Thus began the Lost Age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This next period of Norrathean history as it
relates to many of the races is the least known. It is surmised by the more
knowledgeable historians that while the elder races regrouped and reestablished
themselves, a small group of Barbarians were suddenly transformed both
physically and intellectually. Most believe this to be the last major and direct
act of divine intervention, and perhaps the reason so little is known about this
period is that the gods wish it to be so, deciding afterwards that they would
have less to do with their creations. In any case, this small and enlightened
group were the fathers of the Human race, and they rapidly gained a foothold
throughout the lands, studying the lost art of geomancy. The Combine Empire, as
this lost race of Humans is called, spread throughout the known world, but then
died even more quickly than it grew, and for reasons still unknown. And while
they are the ancestors of every Human on Norrath and their relics and ruins
still litter the lands from Odus to Faydwer, little history of this period
remains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After the fall of the Combine Empire, the
remnants of mankind dwelled mostly in the center of Tunaria, inhabiting
primarily the vast and fertile plains of Karana. Villages appeared and
prospered, several reaching the size of towns, and two even became cities. To
the west a strong and noble band of Humans, lead by Antonius Bayle the First,
founded Qeynos under the lofty principles of law. Freeport, to the east, became
an active and dangerous port of call for all who dared to venture into the Ocean
of Tears. Humanity, much to the disdain of the elder races who watched from
afar, remained strong, even daring to rename their home after one of their own
instead of one of the gods. The great continent of Tunaria would forever more be
known as Antonica. This is not to imply, however, that humanity was at peace.
Competition was fierce, and when resources grew scarce for one reason or another
many groups abandoned the promises and alliances of their past and fought. A few
leaders spoke out against the violence, urging the masses to remember why they
had fled the cold north. Others reminded them of their former glory and the
might of the Combine Empire. These leaders insisted that humanity adhere once
again to those principals to which all had agreed. Explorers and adventurers
returned from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as
well as descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A few even came back with
limited knowledge of sorcery and the mystic arts. And when that discontent
minority of leaders heard all of this, they became both jealous and determined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A small, frail man of great intellect called
Erud led this group, and he formed them into a council. They quickly became
irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of spies
behind, the remainder of Erud's followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a
small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and landed upon the barren coast
of the island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing
to the council and their people. They quickly built a city of their own,
dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, for it was almost
entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within it the scribes and
scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered and analyzed reports,
captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by their spies.
The first human mages since the Combine Empire were born – wizards, sorcerers,
and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both
power and knowledge. Thus began the Age of Enlightenment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It came to pass some years later that a small
group of Erudites discovered the lost art of Necromancy. They were branded
heretics and great conflict arose. For the first time in several hundred years,
the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that
which they had loathed and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one
very significant difference – they did not use swords and bows, but rather
magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great
buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to
flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern regions of Odus. In one final
battle, great mystic energies were released and an immense hole leading to
unknown depths beneath the earth was created. Into the sides of this chasm the
heretics built their own city which they called Paineel. And while both sides
still seethed with anger and hatred towards one another, their fear of what the
last battle had wrought has kept any further conflict at bay. Thus began the Age
of Turmoil.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is in this age you find yourself, an age
filled with wonder. The elder races have begun to reclaim their former glory.
The younger races have matured, and an active economy stretches across Odus,
Antonica, and Faydwer. And while conflict and battle is hardly rare, it has also
been centuries since open war has plagued the lands. A myriad of alliances and
factions exist, friend and foe plot and scheme, and the world of Norrath is ripe
for action. Equip yourself for adventure, seek allies and knowledge, and head
out into a rich world of dungeons, towers, crypts, even planes and realities
beyond your imagination. Learn skills, earn experience, acquire treasure and
equipment, meet friends and encounter enemies. And whether you assume the role
of a noble human knight, a vicious dark elf thief, a greedy dwarven merchant, or
whatever suits your desire.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffffff" face="Verdana" size="2">The Erudites, Necromancy, and
the rise and fall of Miragul</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Over three thousand years in the past humanity
was in its infancy. Mankind dwelled in the center of Antonica, spreading out
slowly to inhabit the vast and fertile plains of Karana. Villages appeared and
prospered, several reaching the size of towns, and two even became cities --
Qeynos to the west, and Freeport to the east. Humanity, much to the disdain of
the elder races who watched from afar, was strong -- it rapidly gained a solid
foothold in the world of Norrath and was there to stay.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is not to imply, however, that humanity
was at peace. Early on small groups formed, some linked by similar appearances,
others by common goals. Competition was fierce, and when resources grew scarce
for one reason or another many groups abandoned the promises and alliances of
their past and fought. A few leaders spoke out against the violence, urging the
masses to remember why they had fled the cold north. They had broken away from
the lands of Halas and their barbarian brothers in the name of peace, and these
leaders insisted that humanity adhere once again to those principals to which
all had agreed.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their cry was not totally ignored, and the
fighting subsided. Villages were encouraged to trade with one another and to
respond to competition nonviolently. An economy based largely on agriculture
appeared and the villages and small towns were surrounded by large farms. Most
of humanity’s leaders were pleased with this, wanting nothing more than peace
and food on every man’s table after a hard day of work. A few, however, wanted
more. Even though their people had risen well beyond the standard of living
endured by their barbarian brothers to the north, they were not content.
Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, and
other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A
few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and the mystic arts. And
when that discontent minority of leaders heard all of this, they became both
jealous and determined.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A small, fragile man of great intellect called
Erud led this group, and he formed them into a council. They quickly became
irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow man. Leaving a small network of spies
behind, the remainder of Erud’s followers fled the city of Qeynos and boarded
a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the west and landed upon the barren coast
of the island of Odus. The land was sparse and uninhabited and quite appealing
to the council and their people. They quickly built a city of their own,

entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within it the scribes and
scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered and analyzed reports,
captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by their spies.
The first human mages were then born – wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters
occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and
knowledge.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the more adept practitioners of the arts
was named Miragul. Unlike and more extreme than the others, he not only abhorred
his human brothers on the mainland to the east, but he also grew to hate his
fellow Erudites. To him they were both short sighted and narrow. They created
schools of thought, categorizing magic into three groups and assigning
themselves to three classes: Wizards, Sorcerers, and Enchanters. Miragul found
this limiting and thoroughly resented the thought of being restricted to one
school of thought or another.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He soon found others who felt similarly. They
were a small but growing group of outcasts who often studied forbidden texts and
other knowledge generally kept secret from the majority of students. The council
was morally and ethically opposed to much of the information gathered afar by
their spies. Miragul found that these outcasts not only studied the three
schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was called Necromancy and a few lucky
spies had returned from a distant underground city (Neriak, it was called, home
of the dark elves) with both their lives and also ancient texts describing this
art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using powerful magic, created for himself
four identities, four separate countenances and names, and joined all four
schools without the knowledge of the council, nor anyone else for that matter.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It came to pass some years later that the
council, in its ever growing desire to know all there was to know, both in
distant lands and also in its own city, discovered the group of Necromancers.
They were branded heretics and great conflict arose. For the first time in
several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in a civil war not
entirely dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from back on the
mainland. But there was one very significant difference – they did not use
swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives by the
hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually the
heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern regions
of Odus.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Miragul, being a member of all four schools,
was not blind to the implications when the conflict began. He left the heretics
before they fled the city, abandoning his fourth identity and siding apparently
with the council. But this was only a ruse in order to buy time. He soon
gathered every artifact and tome he could discreetly steal and then left Odus
entirely, taking a ship back to Antonica and to the city of Qeynos. The lands of
men, however, were not only to his dislike, but also filled with Erudite spies.
Miragul grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon fled again. He headed far to the
north and then to the east, wishing to avoid the barbarians of Halas. After many
weeks he found himself near the great lake called Winter’s Deep and he hid
there for some time.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Miragul waited in secret his mind was not
idle. He schemed and planned, and looked over every letter of every scroll and
tome he had taken from Erudin. Time passed and his understanding and power grew.
But he was unsatisfied and a deep hunger for even more arcane knowledge ate away
at him. He soon left his hiding place and began to travel long distances in
search of more ancient texts and artifacts. His power had grown and confidence
overcame his fear of Erudite spies. Once again he cloaked himself in false
identity and countenance and traveled the lands of men.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not far to the south of where his cache of
artifacts lay, Miragul soon found another of the new races, the Halflings, and
their town Rivervale. The mage feared these small people and their propensity to
sneak and to steal, and as his treasures grew in both size and value, he
eventually made the decision to move even farther north, and away from all
intelligent life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far beyond the range of both
Erudite spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came to a vast tundra. This
land had no name, and was not until centuries later referred to as merely the
Frigid Plain. This frosty and remote environment appealed to Miragul’s heart,
for it had grown cold, obsessed with only knowledge and the abstract, and filled
with only hatred for others. Creatures with intelligence forced him to be
discreet and slowed his acquisition of knowledge and items. He had as little to
do with them as he could, only hiding amongst them when absolutely necessary.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains,
Miragul created a large network of tunnels and rooms in which to hide and study
his collection. He used no labor, but rather deep magic to remove the earth from
his way. Room after room, passage after passage, he did create to house his
store of artifacts. He split his years, spending one score out in the world,
exploring and amassing knowledge and items, returning them to his cache, and
then the next dabbling with them, experimenting in one of several laboratories
he had created.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew
old, even though he did his best to extend his life using magical means. There
was a limit to his enlightenment when it came to aging, and he soon acknowledged
that one day even he would die. Only one aspect of death did he fear, and being
no longer able to learn and collect wrought him with terror. As his skin grew
wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul’s time was spent less exploring the
world of Norrath and more studying the existential. He soon discovered the
various hidden dimensions that neighbored his own, the Planes of Power and
Discord. He discovered means by which he could traverse these planes, making
portals that led between them. But his strength was leaving him, and his
journeys into these realities were short and often unprofitable. More and more,
his own mortality limited his reason for living, and the specter of death
haunted him daily.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The mage’s research into life and death was
built upon a foundation he had learned from his fellow outcasts centuries before
in Erudin. Necromancy, more than any other art, became Miragul’s obsession.
Eventually he discovered a means by which to create portals within his own plane
and made them to travel great distances in mere seconds. He traveled back to
Odus, to its southern regions, in search of the other Necromancers. Perhaps, he
mused, they had unearthed by now a way to cheat death.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin
had built a city into a great hole that led to unknown depths beneath the earth.
This chasm was apparently the result of that huge civil war from which Miragul
had fled centuries earlier. The city, called Paineel, though somewhat
suspicious, allowed Miragul to enter and after a time he earned its
inhabitant’s trust. Many humored the old man and his claims, while a select
few respected him and were willing to trade knowledge for knowledge, power for
power. They revealed to him the true power of necromancy, the ability to raise
the dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every way to their master.
Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast armies of undead, to
wreak revenge upon the council that had exiled and made war upon them in
centuries past.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One important aspect of their necromancy
interested Miragul, the fact that the undead ceased to age. Their lives appeared
endless and the elderly mage knew that he must discover a way to be like them.
He feigned interest in the heretic’s goals, learning spells to raise the dead,
helping them raise their undead army. All the while, however, he was
experimenting himself, hiding much of his research in the small home he was
given in Paineel. After some time he discovered that which he had sought, a way
to transform a living being, as opposed to a corpse, into the undead.
Unfortunately, time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead himself, his
body deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost ready to make war once
again.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Miragul then left Paineel, using a small
portion of his dwindling life energies to make a portal back to his cache
hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, he withdrew silently to his most
secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. Dreaming all the while of
endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready his ultimate experiment.
The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, and Miragul hid his
remaining and fragile life within the phylactery, a small device he had pilfered
from the other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy gathered and then
dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an undead mage, what
ancient scripts and legends called a lich.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In his haste, however, Miragul had made a
miscalculation. The lich, while retaining all the mystical power of his formal
self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage’s soul, now locked within the phylactery
hidden deep in the cache, retained the ambition and desire to amass knowledge
and power. The spiritless lich possessed none of these human traits, and
Miragul’s soul screamed in silence as the undead creature began to aimlessly
wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, his rooms filled with
artifacts of power.</font></p>
