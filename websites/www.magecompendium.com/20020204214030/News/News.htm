Items<br>
<br>
- All beastlord-usable items are now useable by their requisite races.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Regular, medium quality, high quality, mithril, brellium and adamantite rings, as well as their enchanted versions are now stackable.  (this time we mean it)</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Made Rune Encrusted Short Sword rentable (was No Rent, should not have been).</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Fixed Shadowscream and all related recipes so that they return the correct mallet.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Reduced the price of the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk and Cloudy Stone of Veeshan.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>

- Shiny Trinket of Speed - An appropriate level of haste has been added to this item.<br>
<br>
Interface<br>
<br>
- Added /tgb as a short version of /targetgroupbuff.<br>
<br>
- /shownames now works with the following parameters:</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    no parameter = display the current setting.<br>
    off = don't show player names over their heads<br>
    1 = show only first names of players<br>
    2 = show First and Last Name<br>
    3 = show First, Last, and Guild (if any)<br>
    4 = show Title (if any), First, Last, and Guild (if any)<br>
<br>
Also, the LFG, AFK and LD tags will always show if names are not off.  There will no longer be brackets around them, and LFG will now appear at the end of the name with the AFK and LD tags (instead of being a * at the beginning)<br>
<br>
- A player character will always have a name over its head, even if they are skeletons (unless /shownames is off), with the exception of some rare cases when players are turned into certain NPCs.</font></p>

<br>

Mind Wrack will be fixed soon.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Shadowknight "Torrent" spells have also been fixed and have had their duration increased as well.</font></p>

- Flowing Thought effects will now stack.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Meditating on a horse occurs only while not in combat.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- NPCs that cannot be stunned will once again take damage from damaging stun spells (this was actually patched earlier along with an emergency patch).</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Critical heals and nukes now display damage numbers (this was actually patched earlier along with an emergency patch).<br>
<br>
Zones<br>
<br>
- Characters will no longer take falling damage when in the Bazaar.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Characters can now bind in the Nexus.<br>
<br>
Alternate Advancement<br>
<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>

- Mental Clarity and Body/Mind Rejuvenation now give mana regeneration both when standing and medding, as intended.<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous<br>
<br>
- Added a few new socials:  /nudge, /pat, /flex, /fidget, /purr and /smack.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Changed the automatic targeting code so that it won't automatically target someone that cast a beneficial spell on you.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Adjusted the timing of the Luclin Spire activations to more closely match the announcements by the Scions.  This has the net effect of reducing the time between portal activations.<br>

Soulbinders<br>
<br>
A new group has appeared in Norrath (and on Luclin as well).  Rumor has it that these 'Soulbinders' have dedicated themselves to research on the power and essence of our inner being.  Some call them fanatics, as they claim that knowledge of the spirit that dwells within will lead them to an understanding of the whole of existence.  Citizens often treat them with the same respect and distance that they treat the Priests of Discord.  However, these Soulbinders  have dedicated themselves to public service, and for them that service falls along their lines of specialty...<br>
<br>
The next time you find yourself far away from home, you might seek the services of a Soulbinder.<br>
<br>
/ooc: We've added these "Soulbinder" NPCs to all cities that player characters can start in, as well as Shadowhaven and Iceclad at the request of players.  It is our hope that these new NPCs will help players by reducing the time it takes to find a bind from another player character.</font></p>

Welcome to Luclin<br>
<br>
"As you know, youngster, we of the League of Antonican Bards have made it our primary goal to travel to places before others.  It is our duty to see what hasn't yet been seen and to make song of it when we return.  We carry news, song and spirit to all of Norrath.  We have also taken it upon ourselves to carry personal news in the form of letters wherever possible.  And that's what I've called you here to talk about.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
No, I am not assigning you the duty of establishing a mail route into Grobb.  We've lost far too many young bards trying to do that.  Recruitment of smart young lads and lasses is nearly impossible when they all think that we plan to send them out to become bard fillet.  We've only been able to recruit youngsters that no other guild wanted because they were so...<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
No, of course I don't mean you.<br>
<br>
Now stop interrupting.<br>
<br>
I have a job for you.  You know, don't you, that Al'Kabor has once again been clomping about using his powerful magics without much regard for consequences, don't you?<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
/em sighs.<br>
<br>
Ok, your FIRST task is to read up on current events! (http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/al_kabor.jsp)<br>
<br>
Your second task is to find out if the rumors about his recent experiments are true.  They say (and "they" are pretty reliable) that things such as noble-looking Kerrans calling themselves the Vah Shir, strange beasts of burden and new spells and songs have started showing up on Antonica.  They also say that this is all due to the experiments of that Erudite Wizard Al'Kabor.  You are to head out to one of the great wizard spires and investigate.  If you can, interview one of these cat people and bring us back one of these horses they talk about...<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Maybe you should talk to my assistant about things like directions out of the city and where you can find some shoes more appropriate for travel."<br>
<br>
All this you overhear as you wait outside for your turn to talk to the loremasters of the League of Antonican Bards.<br>
<br>
The door opens and you see a dejected and confused looking young bard step out.  Following him out the door you hear a bellow,<br>
<br>
"I also expect you to let everyone know that we are NO LONGER trying to establish mail routes to Grobb!  Trolls can't read very well anyway."<br>
<br>
<br>
Shadows of Luclin opens up new adventures and new challenges, as well as new rewards for those with a spirit of adventure.<br>
<br>
Are you up to the challenge?<br>
<br>
Notes for Shadows of Luclin customers<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT:  do not lose your Shadows of Luclin CDs.  Because of the immense amount of data on the three Shadows of Luclin CDs, you will not be able to just copy the executable file into a new directory and download the rest of the expansion.  We have placed restrictions on the amount of data that customers can download from our patcher so that massive patching as a replacement for reinstalling from the disk will not impact our other customers.  So if you have a hard drive problem or you wish to install EverQuest on a new computer, you will need to have your CD to do so.<br>
<br>
/facepick (Or hit the "Face" button on the inventory screen in full view mode) - this new command will allow those of you with Shadows of Luclin to change your characters face.  It will only work for characters using the new models.  If you've turned off Gnomes and your character is a Gnome, you will not be able to use this command on that character.  And it will, obviously, only work for those with Shadows of Luclin installed.<br>
<br>
/dismount - This command allows your character to dismount from a horse if for some reason he has lost the ability to do so using the bridle.  There is no /mount command, only the bridle will allow you to mount a horse.<br>
<br>
Other Changes with this Patch<br>
<br>
Along with our preparations for the introduction of Shadows of Luclin, we have made a few other changes with this patch:<br>
<br>
Gameplay Changes<br>
<br>
- Increased the amount of mana given by high Intelligence and Wisdom scores, as well as that granted by items and spells.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that was causing rogues to critical with every use of a thrown weapon.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that caused the experience bar to displaying incorrectly after leveling.  This also seemed to cause a crash in certain cases when in F10 view.<br>
<br>
PvP Changes<br>
<br>
- PVP looting will now display to the group.<br>
<br>
- Empty corpses will no longer disappear when looted by an enemy player, they will decay at the normal rate for empty corpses.<br>
<br>
- Guards in 'guard zones', such as cities, will continue to protect characters that they find the least offensive (the one with the highest faction).  But guards in outdoor zones will be less likely to join in a fight.  They will only come to the aid of people that they like.  Otherwise they will not get involved in PvP combat.<br>
<br>
Item Changes<br>
<br>
- Etched Peridot of Nature will be removed from all locations, including those held by players on their characters or in their banks.  This item was not intended to be available until Shadows of Luclin went live, and then only in Luclin zones.<br>
<br>
Spell Changes<br>
<br>
- Spells that heal less than 10 points of damage will not generate a message to the player.<br>
<br>
- Velious portal teeth (Great Divide, Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scar) are no longer required to teleport to those locations.  These items are also no longer soul bound.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug with the Bard Song of Occlusion<br>
<br>
New Commands<br>
<br>
- /stand now implemented.  We've added this command because not everyone speaks programmer and would think that the logical reverse of /sit would be /sit off.  :)<br>
<br>
- /particledensity command - Switches particle density on the fly without having to click it in the menus and exit the game.<br>
<br>
Some new things you'll see<br>
<br>
- We now have the ability to flag an NPC as non-targetable.  This in effect renders the NPC non-attackable as well.  Clicking on one of these NPCs will cause your current target selection to clear.  This functionality is used primarily for the presentation of content.  For instance, if we want an NPC to spawn and tell you a story, he can tell his story without being attacked mid-sentance by other players.  It also opens up some pretty interesting content avenues.  As an example, we can make NPCs unharmable until you do a quest "stripping them of their power".&nbsp;<br>
<br>
- There are several new item classes (types) in the world.  For example, there are weapons that do enhanced damage versus certain races (e.g. Perhaps you'll find a +2 vs froglok sword, or a +4 vs Bear club.  In addition we can do the same type of thing with types of creatures (+3 vs humanoid, +1 vs Undaed).  We've also added elemental modifiers (e.g. a +4 Fire sword).   The bonus value is calculated as and increased DMG stat on the weapon, except that the elemental portion is run through the resistance system before calculating the strength of your hit.  There are some items out there with bonuses to some more interesting stats, but we'll leave it to you to figure them out :)<br>
<br>
- There's a lot more out there.  Be prepared to reevaluate your assumptions and redefine the way you approach the world.  Proposed solutions to situations and quests that you might have previously written off saying, "They can't do that in EverQuest", might be exactly the way you need to approach the problem at hand.  As fellow gamers, we envy you as you approach Luclin and find everything fresh, new, and waiting to be solved.  And to those of you who aren't first to solve the quests or adventure in the new areas, we urge you to do so with your friends, and leave the spoiler sites out of it.  Good luck on your
journies.<br>
<br>
Note on New Features<br>
<br>
EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin contains many new features which have yet to stand up to the scrutiny of 400,000 experienced players.  Without doubt there will be some situations where we need to reevaluate the gameplay-impact of some of those features and adjust them accordingly to maintain game integrity.  As an example, we think that horses might accelerate and decelerate too quickly, but will have to wait until we see them used by a broad spectrum of players before we can make a final determination.  We thank you for your patience in these matters.<br>
<br>
Note on Impending Features<br>
<br>
As we approached our launch date we found that several features which are planned are also not yet ready for prime-time.  We're currently working on the following items, many of which will be implemented in the very near future:<br>
<br>
- Extra flora in outdoor zones.  Sprigs of grass, small bushes, flowers, etc.<br>
<br>
- A robuste merchantile system in the bazaar that lets you flag yourself as a merchant, set prices, and conduct business without having to conduct business manually with each buyer and seller.<br>
<br>
- We will be polishing up issues regarding tinted items in game.  In other words, things that shouldn't tint with a tinted item (e.g. your skin) won't tint when the feature is complete.<br>
<br>
- Light beards on high elves, dark elves, half elves, and dwarf females will be tintable along with the hair color.  We are going to leave in the ability for you to change your appearance until after we've added more customization options.<br>
<br>
We thank you for your patience and patronage as we implement these features.  Good luck with your adventures on Luclin!<br>

EQClient INI Setting<br>
<br>
There's some confusion about the information that's been released on the Test server over the past couple of days, and that confusion is resulting in some people having trouble playing EverQuest.  To clear it
up :<br>
<br>
The GraphicsDLL setting in your EQClient.ini file should read "GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx7.dll" regardless of what server you are playing on or what version of DirectX you are running.  If you are having problems getting in to EverQuest, specifically, problems crashing prior to reaching character select, please check and set this entry in your EQClient.ini as necessary.<br>
<br>
Also, as a reminder, all EverQuest subscribers will need to have DirectX 8.1 or better installed on their system in order to play beginning Tuesday morning.  The latest version of DirectX can be found at

Server Outage for Shadows of Luclin Launch<br>
<br>
In order to update our server for the launch of EverQuest: Shadows of Luclin, all servers will be taken down starting at noon on Monday, December 3rd.  They will be brought back up again on Tuesday, December 4th at 8 am (Pacific Time - which is -8:00 GMT).<br>
<br>
We regret the down time that setting up the new expansion requires.  Shadows of Luclin offers some exciting new content as well as a fantastic new graphics engine.  We hope that you'll agree with us that Shadows of Luclin is well worth the extended patch time.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience.<br>
<br>
DirectX 8.0 or higher Required for EverQuest<br>
<br>
When we update the servers on December 3rd for Shadows of Luclin, we will also be updating a lot of the code for the existing game.  This code is written specifically for use with DirectX 8.0 and higher, and should provide better performance to most of our customers.  The improvement will be most noticeable for people using newer hardware.<br>
<br>
This will require that all EverQuest players update their DirectX to version 8.0 or better to play EverQuest.  We will be providing an instructional page to help people with this upgrade in the very near future at www.everquestlive.com. If you want to test your DirectX 8 configuration and drivers sooner rather than later, you can do so by running "TestEverQuest.exe" in your EverQuest directory and logging on to the Test Server.  Please view the patch message there for information should you have any problems logging in.<br>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Yes! This was what
I had been hoping for, and not only for performance reasons.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have indeed set it up so that
you can choose the models you see. I have to admit to having some of the same
reservations about the new models that some of you had. But now that I've had a
chance to see all of them, I really think you'll want to turn them all on.
They're fantastic.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I was kind of
shocked when I heard the new upgrades with ram, I run with 128, and I'm going to
try out the new models to see if it works.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">But my real
question was : if i do not use the new models/textures how can i still see the
new race? Will it be with old textures on the cd too?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, since there are no old
models for the Vah Shir, you will indeed see the new models. Everyone will see
the new models, whether they purchase Shadows of Luclin or not, much like
everyone saw the Iksar when Ruins of Kunark came out. We'll be patching those
models to every EverQuest player when we launch Shadows of Luclin.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've seen some complaints about
the new requirements. Please keep in mind that really the only part of the
expansion that requires the minimum specifications of 256 megs of RAM are the
new character models. Here's a quote from the Shadows of Luclin site that I
wanted to bring to everyone's attention :</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, no features of EverQuest:
  Shadows of Luclin will be lost even at 128M of RAM, except for the ability to
  see the new player models. The rest of the rich world, along with the new
  graphics enhancements, will work. The Shadows of Luclin still has more zones,
  more new NPCs, and more exciting encounters than any other expansion, as well
  as a new class AND a new race to enjoy. As you upgrade your computer to 256MB
  and 512MB of RAM, and obtain future graphics cards, your EverQuest experience
  will be enhanced right along with them.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And they forgot to mention the
Alternate Advancement stuff too…</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are doing everything that we
can do to provide an up to date game while still accommodating those that don't
have the most up to date hardware.</font>

Your help is requested<br>
<br>
As we announced previously, we are beginning testing of the new DirectX 8 graphics engine that will become a central component of EverQuest.  This new graphics engine will go live mid-next week, and will require that all EverQuest players have DirectX 8 or better installed, along with suitable drivers from your video and sound card manufacturers.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The new engine will include many features including a new visibility solution which will dramatically increase framerate in some areas of the game, and in addition will eventually support cards featuring Hardware Transform and Lighting
(GeForce/Radeon or better cards).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We would like your assistance in testing this engine with the multitude of system specifications employed by EverQuest users before it goes live.  To do this, please launch TestEverquest.exe from your EverQuest directory, and edit the line in your EQClient.ini in your EQ directory from
&quot;GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx7.DLL&quot; to &quot;GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx8.DLL&quot;.<br>
<br>
Please email any newly experienced problems (cf. problems that you do not have using the EQGfx_Dx7.dll) to
luclinbugs@station.sony.com.  Be sure to include a description of the problem, the dbg.txt file from your EverQuest directory, as well as your
DXDIAG.TXT, which can be obtained by running dxdiag.exe and saving information out to a file.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You will be able to run on normal EverQuest servers using the DX8 DLL once you get it as well.  Just remember that if you have any problems you need only set the GraphicsDLL line in your EQClient.ini back to EQGfx_Dx7.dll.<br>
<br>
Please take the opportunity to log on to Test and let us know about any problems in order to minimize the chance of problems when the DX8 engine goes live.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your help.<br>

: The Shadows of Luclin is unique as an expansion to an existing product. Rather
than simply more zones, more items, and more encounters, Shadows of Luclin goes
several leaps further and includes an almost entirely new graphics engine, and
with that engine, new player character models which change the &quot;look and
feel&quot; of the world dramatically.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In
creating these new player characters, the goal was to provide the highest
quality models ever seen in a first person game. Every model was made extremely
detailed, in many cases ten times the complexity of the original models in EQ.
Rather than simply &quot;catch up&quot; with current technology, Shadows of
Luclin raises the bar even higher.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Minimum
Required RAM</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
The amount of memory required to display 40 all-new models with high quality
textures, realistic bone structures, etc., greatly increased polygon counts and
as such we have changed our minimum memory requirement to 256MB of RAM, and our
recommended to 512MB of RAM.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Although
technically below minimum specifications, EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin WILL
run with 128M of ram, and you will be able to see all the new zones, the new
race (Vah Shir) and the new class (Beastlord) without much decrease in
performance. However, if you want to see all the new models you will need at
least 256MB of RAM. Even at 256MB you may need to modify new graphical options
we will be providing. If you want smooth performance and fast loading times, we
recommend that you get 512MB of RAM.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Additional
menus are added for those with 256MB of RAM to tune which models are loaded
(among many other options we will be providing), further increasing performance.
For example, you may choose to see the Troll Male but not the Ogre Female. Fewer
new models will reduce the amount of memory EverQuest requires.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We
understand that this may be upsetting to those caught off guard by the increase
in memory requirements. But rather than reducing the detail of the character
models we have in order to display them all at lower quality with 128MB RAM,
with only minor improvements for players with 512MB of RAM, we felt it better to
create models that would remain &quot;high quality&quot; for years to come.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hardware
T&amp;L</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
Along with these changes, a new graphics engine which supports hardware T&amp;L
is included. If you have a graphics card with hardware T&amp;L, you should see
much higher frame rates in all zones, not just Shadows of Luclin zones. However,
some older cards may have trouble displaying all the new player models with
their increased polygon counts. This is why we recommend a GeForce 2 or better
video card. See your video card manufacturer's website to determine if your card
includes hardware T&amp;L support. A list of models supported in EverQuest: The
Shadows of Luclin will be presented on the official EverQuest website very soon.</font></p>

I'm sure). Perhaps some software that looked like it closed didn't and was
hogging memory, or maybe there was some sort of hicup on the PC itself.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Unfortunately, if
you can't repeat the problem then we probably won't be able to do so either, and
that means that it will be very hard to fix. And, well, if it doesn't come
back…</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Yes, I am
encouraging people to try to reproduce a problem before sending it in to us.
It's infinitely more efficient for us if we have some confirmation that the
problem can be reproduced. Otherwise we have to spend a lot of time building a
computer to match the one that the customer is using and then spend a few hours
trying to reproduce the problem so we can find it and fix it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">We certainly want
all reports of problems, I'm not trying to discourage folks from sending their
bug reports in. But we will tackle the ones that are repeatable much more
quickly just by their very nature.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In our initial enthusiasm to help
get things rolling on this new server, we made a mistake with guilds.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Basically, we started creating
guilds before we removed all the guild associations from the characters. It
tends to cause all sorts of trouble when we add someone to a guild when they are
already associated with a guild (even if that guild doesn't really exist).</font>

before this wipe, we need you to make certain that you zone at least once before
we recreate your guild. This should clear the guild name from above your head if
you still have one. And it is a good idea to do it even if you don't have a
guild name over your head, just in case.</font>

Project M Implemented<br>
<br>
Tonight we have patched something to the PvP servers that many players have been waiting for. The ability to play that gnoll, orc, or the cute and fuzzy rat. On your character select screen you will notice another button in the upper right part of your screen called "Monster". Clicking this button will randomly place you in a low-level NPC in a random zone. You will be given full control of the creature to do with it what you like. You may hunt and kill other creatures. You may even attack other players.<br>
<br>
Some things to remember when playing your own personal monster (NPC).<br>
<br>
-You will not be able to interact with players or NPC's other than moving and hitting attack.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
-You cannot speak, trade, sell, or do anything else that a player can do.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
-You will spawn with normal loot for the monster you are playing and Player Characters will be able to kill you for loot and experience.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
-If you are a spell casting monster you might want to take a moment to memorize some spells.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
-Once you die, you will return to the character select screen where you may choose to return as another NPC or play your normal character.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
-You may gain experience, levels, and skills as this NPC, but once you die, it is all lost. You will need to start over the next time you choose to be a NPC character.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
-You can't zone as a monster.  If you try to cross a zone-boarder you will lose your progress and return to the character-select screen.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
-Monster PCs (MPCs) can not loot, sell, or gain items.  They only get what they start out with.<br>
<br>
This ability to play a monster is being implemented for PvP servers only as we have no plans to implement non-consensual PvP on a non PvP server.<br>
<br>
However, we are still working with this system.  We may find other ways to implement Project M on the non-PvP servers that are acceptable.  We aren't done looking at the possible uses of this new feature.<br>
<br>
PvP Server Related<br>
<br>
- Guards, when seeing PCs in combat, will now attack the one that they like the least (the one with the lowest appropriate faction).  If all the PCs involved are highly regarded (have very high faction) the guards will allow them to resolve their own issues without interfering.<br>
<br>
- Guards should also refrain from attacking PCs that are attacked by pets of any sort.<br>
<br>
- Sullon Zek now has an across the board experience bonus of 20%, and the experience loss on all deaths on Sullon Zek is now 50% less.<br>
<br>
Zone Specific Changes<br>
<br>
- Kael now has specific bind locations, located only at the entryways.  This means that binding will only be possible in those areas.<br>
<br>
- Trivial Loot code has been removed from the Stonebrunt Mountains and the Warrens.<br>
<br>
- Added a melee bind location to the dock in Iceclad.<br>
<br>
Bug Fixes<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that allowed corpses to get stuck inside walls while creating a phantom corpse at the zone line (on your client only) with which you could not interact.  Now if a corpse ends up in a location that is not 'valid' the corpse will be moved to the 'default coordinates' of the zone.  Also, the /corpse command will now summon your own corpse to you anywhere in the zone as long as that corpse is on the default coordinates.  As a rule of thumb, if you died near a wall and cannot find your corpse where you died, try /corpse before petitioning.<br>
<br>
- Fixed it so that Critical Hit damage messages match the actual damage done.<br>
<br>
- The visible damage bonus modifier on two-handed weapons has been corrected.  The value that was displayed was incorrect, no change has been made to the damage bonus itself.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a language-learning bug on the Firiona Vie Server.  Players will now be train each other up in languages once they train the first point with their
guildmaster.<br>
<br>
Item Changes<br>
<br>
- Fixed an issue with the Bardic Epic weapon.  Now if the bard has his Epic and an instrument that gives bonuses to songs, the best effect will take precedence, rather than the Epic bonuses always being used.<br>
<br>
- Cloak of Imperception should now have charges.  You will need to exchange your old one for a new one with your GM within the next five days.<br>
<br>
 Donal's Chestplate of Mourning has unlimited charges again.  You will likewise need to exchange yours should you get an 'out of charges' message when attempting to use it.<br>
<br>
Gameplay/Interface Changes/Additions<br>
<br>
- We have changed the way the /consider command works and expanded the level range at which players are able to gain experience.  We have added a 'light blue' area between green and blue.  NPCs that used to /consider green but gave experience will now /consider light blue, as well as NPCs of slightly lower level than those greens.  You will always get experience for something that is light blue.  You will not receive experience for greens.  At the same time, by including lower level NPCs in the light blue /consider, we have increased the range of lower level NPCs that will grant experience.  This will be most noticeable for characters of higher level.<br>
<br>
- Added /targetgroupbuff.  Type /targetgroupbuff on to activate, off to turn it off.  When on, all group buff spells you cast will require a target but will affect everyone grouped (and in range) with that target, even if it is not your own group.  When it is off your group buff spells will act normally.  This will only work with group buffs that have a duration, and will not affect heals, portals or change form spells.<br>
<br>
- Added code that will put one item onto your cursor if it won't fit into your inventory due to a cancelled trade or looting items (and other cases).  This will only work if there is not already an item on the cursor.<br>
<br>
- Added code that prevents player characters from dropping coins on the ground.  This should prevent the loss of coins due to accident or scam.<br>
<br>
- Made a modification to the chase camera mouselook code.  Moving the mouse forward or back in this camera view will make the camera move up and down, and the camera also automatically pitches to keep your character in view.<br>
<br>
- You now see the number of hit points you are healed, and you also now see how many hit points you heal when healing others.<br>
<br>
Skill Changes<br>
<br>
- Bard Piercing cap was raised to 250 at 60th level.<br>
<br>
- Foraging and Fishing will now result in a wider variety of items, especially in zones that have unusual items available to forage or fish (such as quest items).  Quest and unique items were too common in zones that had them, often making it hard to use those skills to obtain items such as food and drink.  These quest and rare items will now actually be rarely foraged or fished, as they should have been.  Such items will still be available, even to those with low foraging skills, but they will be more easily found by those who have practiced the skills.<br>

moving the characters or can it be done so next time we log in our characters
will be moved?</font>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">There have plenty
of comments about the idea of preventing any coins from dropping at all. I'll
see if I can answer a few of them.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It said that the patch was going
to be on Wednesday November 7th. Did this get bumped up to Tuesday or just a
mistake in posting?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It's Wednesday,
whatever date that is…</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Sorry about the
confusion. The patch is so early on Wednesday that it may as well be Tuesday.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a terrible fix. Dropping
of coins can and is used in the following ways:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">1) Marking a spot or path.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">2) Commit a server save.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">3) Transfer cash to another
character on same account (Although you seem to be against this one)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">4) Newbie treasure find. New
players find a stack of silver coins.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This seems the lazy way to fix the
fireport trade scam, and in the process takes functionality away from the player
base. How about putting your designers to work to come up with the RIGHT way of
fixing this?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I support a lot of changes you
make, but this one is just plain lazy programming.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Well, let's look
at those:</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1) Anything would
work for that, muffins, fish… whatever. Admittedly, coins are more prevalent
and easier to carry, but this won't be a major problem for path marking and
such.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2) Any change in
character status will force a save, so destroying the coin will do that too.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">3) We don't
officially support such activities, as you noted. We're not really going to
avoid doing something because it makes twinking harder.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">4) Sorry about
that. This is something that will indeed be lost. If you want to be a generous
character you can still go buy something with that coin and drop items for the
newbies, but you won't be able to drop coin.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Others have
suggested other things, such as using Minor Illusion to turn into a coin. This
is technically a bug, so it's kind of hard to worry about not being able to do
it anymore. Though it is indeed a cool trick, and I understand how it will be
missed. Also mentioned was coin art. Another neato thing that would be lost, but
not really game-breaking I don't think. Maybe someone can invent a new form of
art.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This has nothing
to do with lazy programming or stupid designers. We have indeed looked at the
options and find this one best. We were asking for your suggestions for other
ideas. If you have one other than name-calling, please let me know.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The only problem I can really see
with this other then &quot;self-trading&quot; is that monks just drop there
copper and silver due to the large amounts of it, and destroying would be a
complete waste. Why not making it so you can't drop more then 5pp or something
like that?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">5 plat isn't a lot
to get scammed out of if you're a 50th level character, but it might be a lot to
a new character. Allowing lesser amounts (or as was more commonly suggested,
allowing characters to drop silver and copper but not gold and platinum)
wouldn't prevent the problem, it would just shift it to the lower level
characters.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since you are changing things
about coins anyways I am wondering if you can change something else. Can you
please put in a way for us to stop the looting of copper and silver coins? As a
Monk I destroy all those types of coin as soon as I get them. I cant afford the
weight and they are useless anyways at my level. Normally I drop them on the
ground. However with the new changes I wont be able to do that, instead I will
have to click the destroy key constantly. This is not a major deal but I am sure
it will become annoying very fast. I, and I am sure many other monks and
casters, would be VERY grateful if you could impliment a way for us to not loot
or auto destroy all silver and copper coins.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Here is the
biggest area of concern, monks. I've, obviously, received a fair number of
comments from monks. It is easier to drop coins than to destroy them.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">We are looking
into the possibility of setting up a command for destroying coin, something
along the lines of '/destroycoin copper' that would just destroy all copper in
your inventory. We will also be looking into the idea of limiting the coin you
loot or split. So you could use a command to tell the game never to let you loot
certain coin types and to never accept them as part of a split, most likely
destroying the coins in the process. These are things we'd like to do and may
tackle in the future.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I know that
doesn't help now. But stopping the scamming is a priority, as it should be. It
has to take precedence over convenience.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Please understand I say this as
politely as possible, but since your customer service policy strictly prohibits
replacing coins or items that are lost or inadvertently dropped .. other than
saying &quot;I'm sorry we can't help you .. &quot; how is this a burden on
customer service ?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I mean, I doubt this change will
really effect the number of those type of responses you have to send out.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Personally I use the option to
drop coins quite often (whether it's a good idea to do or not, sometimes it's
the only alternative) and I do so at my own risk.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I appreciate your efforts to
thwart scams, but please don't take this ability away.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The hard truth
here is that it would indeed reduce the burden on our customer service staff.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Despite existing
rules that say very clearly that we will not reimburse characters for items or
coin dropped on the ground, we still receive a large number of petitions asking
for just such reimbursement. Adding a confirmation box for dropping coins would
not lessen the number of petitions very much at all either. This we know from
experience. People that lose something, no matter how well they know that we
will not give it back to them (even if they had to click &quot;yes&quot; to
confirm the loss) still want it back. And many folks will petition anyway,
regardless of all of that. And our CS people answer those petitions because they
should, even if all they can do is say is that they are sorry about the loss.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This is one of
those fine lines that we have to walk. We certainly don't want our customers to
be upset by accidentally dropping their hard-earned coinage and losing it. We
don't like it when people scam other people and take that same hard earned cash.
It upsets our customers and uses up time for our CS reps.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">At the same time
there are indeed some conveniences that the ability to just toss away coins
brings (mentioned above), and we don't want to take those away either.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">But we think that
preventing customer loss and freeing up more CS time in one stroke outweighs the
things that will be lost, especially since most of those things can be done in
other ways.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just a quick question, money will
still be trade-able right? It would be very difficult to have a player economy
without the ability to trade money.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Absolutely. We're
just talking about dropping coins here, not trading them.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello all,</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are a number of scams out
there where nefarious inviduals attempt to get people to perform a series of
operations that results in the victim unknowingly dropping their coin on the
ground. In order to help our players avoid these scams, we're taking action in
the patch on Tuesday. We first considered popping up a confirmation box when
attempting to drop coin on the ground, however upon reflection we could not
determine a reason why anyone would want to do this, except perhaps when
attempting to &quot;self-trade&quot; items and coin between characters. However
dropping things on the ground is as you can imagine an extremely unsafe and
unsupported way to trade items, and has created more headaches for players and
our CS staff than it has done them good.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To that end, beginning on Tuesday
the dropping of coinage will no longer be allowed by the client. Players will of
course still be able to destroy it if they wish, for instance, to releave
themselves of unwanted copper.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We look forward to hearing your
comments. If there are any reasons that dropping coinage should be allowed that
we haven't thought of, please reply and let us know.</font>

Movelog for the Antonius Bayle server<br>
<br>
Please Note - This message includes a NEW START TIME for the Movelogs<br>
<br>
We will be opening the Antonius Bayle server for our European players on November 1, 2001 (today!).  We will also be opening a move log from all standard servers (not from the PvP or special rules servers such as Firiona Vie and Sullon Zek) to the new server on November 1st (also today).  We will be giving priority to European players when we move characters, and we will only be accepting a limited number of moves.  Obviously we want this server to be used primarily by our European players and we don't want to move so many characters to the server that it becomes too crowded.<br>
<br>
Here is a schedule for the movelog.<br>
<br>
11/1/01 - Thursday at 11 am (pst) - Movelog opens.<br>
11/5/01 - Monday at 11 am (pst) - Movelog closes.<br>
11/6/01 - Tuesday - Moves begin and characters start becoming available to play.<br>
11/7/01 - Wednesday - We expect to finish moving the characters and have them all available to play.<br>
<br>
Due to the sheer volume of players that we expect will be putting in a request to move, we expect to have to cut the list short.  Again, priority will be given to European players on a first come, first served basis.<br>
<br>
If you want to have your characters moved to the new server, here's what you should do.<br>
<br>
Log in on the account and server that you want your characters to be moved from.  Pick any character that you have on that server and enter Norrath.<br>
<br>
Then all you have to do is type "/movelog yes" (without the quotation marks) and Enter and you will be on the list to have your characters moved to the new server.<br>
<br>
If two characters are moved to the server with the same name, one of them will randomly have an X appended to their name.  You can then ask a GM to change your name if you don't really want that X appended.  :)   Character names must be unique, so someone has to lose their name.  That's one of the unfortunate necessities of moving characters.<br>
<br>
Characters will be moved with all items.<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT!  Loot any corpses you might have before the move date!  While we will be moving all equipment and banked items and cash and all that, we won't be moving corpses.  So if you leave something on a corpse you will lose it.<br>
