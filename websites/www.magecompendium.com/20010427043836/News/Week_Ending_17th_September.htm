to be some no stat robes that could cover over your regular armor that everyone
could wear. I think it would be fun to just walk around in a cloak as a warrior
and have everyone blind to what race and class you were. I doubt if it would
ever happen but I would really like to see some items for roleplaying. No stats
and all/all. I haven't played any roleplaying game that doesn't allow you to
wear a robe no matter you class.</font>

number of meshes that we have available. Robes were only allocated to those
races who could be casters to limit the number of different graphics that could
be displayed at any one time in order to adhere to the system requirements. We
do have some new ideas going forward and you'll see a lot more interesting
things on the characters.</font>

Smoother would look nicer once you get the distance adjusted, but its probably
also what is causing the performance drop to be so severe.<br>

</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">We have a plan for the
MipMap issues, as well as others present with some of the more advanced features

that the client uses. This would require that everyone update their DirectX
drivers to the most recent version.<br>
We'll have more information to post about this next week. We plan to give a
couple of weeks lead-time before making such a big change, so the updates won't
be in Tuesday's patch.<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First
off I’d like to thank everyone who participated in this discussion. As I read
through all the posts I was very pleased to see that most of the ideas,
requests, and suggestions you all have here mirror my own ideas as a game
designer. I thought I’d take this opportunity to address some of the key
topics and concerns brought up and give you all my perspective on them.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">On Announcing Quests to the Public<br>
</font><br>
While we’d ideally like to have everyone involved in our dynamic quests, the
reality of limitations such as internet latency, zone overcrowding, and sheer
lack of manpower make this difficult to do. If you announce that a huge quest is
going to happen in Qeynos Hills for example, chances are that everyone who can
get there will. With a limit on the number of GMs and Guides who can facilitate
the quest, this can make it almost impossible to run. And although we’ve
increased our functionality to facilitate these quests by a lot, we’re still
not at the point where we can have a large scale quest involving an entire
player base of 2000+ people at once. Until that time dynamic quests are always
going to have the luck factor of being in the right place at the right time.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">On Rewarding Role-playing<br>
</font><br>
I am a firm believer in the principle that for most dynamic quests the rewards
to be reaped should go to those who role-played the quest best and made the
biggest mark in the story line of it. The biggest problem with rewarding
role-playing is that it is a completely subjective thing. What one person views
as good role-playing another sees as acting like a fool. The other inherent
problem with this is that we can’t watch everyone at once. You may be doing
the best job in rallying the troops to defend Rivervale against the invading
goblin army, but if no one facilitating the quest sees you do it they can’t
reward you for it. We have a limited number of people who run these quests, and
while we often do have a bunch of invisible people running around, we don’t
see everything. At the end of such quests all the guides and gm’s who
participated will usually talk about all the people they thought were doing a
good job and vote on who to give the treasure to. If you can think of a fairer
way to accomplish these I’d love to hear the suggestions.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">On Being the “Hero”<br>
</font><br>
Let’s face it, everyone in any fantasy role-playing game wants to be the hero,
central figure in which the world revolves around. This is perhaps the greatest
challenge for a massively multiplayer game to meet. Rather than just saying this
is impossible I choose to look at it from a different perspective. It is my
belief that everyone can be a hero in his or her own mind and in the minds of
those around them. The 12th level warrior who makes a stand to hold off the
gnolls while his party escapes is indeed a hero to that particular group. The
50th level cleric who travels the world resurrecting and healing those in need
could be considered a hero on the server in which he does this. The point I’m
getting at is that you, the player base, decide who your heroes are based on the
way they act and the things they do. We provide the content, the background, and
the stage. But you all are the real dynamic actors, the heroes of our world.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">On GM Slaughter Sprees<br>
</font><br>
We’ve all heard the tales and some of us have even been a victim. “I was
sitting there camping something when all of the sudden a Red mob came running at
me and killed me before I had a chance to think. Then I found out it was part of
some GM quest…I have become a victim of a vicious GM out to get players.”
This is a common tale told on message boards and in taverns and I’m not going
to say it doesn’t happen that way. What I do want to know is what is the
difference between that and a rare spawn popping in the zone and killing you? I
remember one of the first times I was hunting in Oasis with my level 15 cleric
and got a visit from Lockjaw. He was bigger, meaner, and scarier than anything I
expected to run into there…and I didn’t stand a chance. There are encounters
like this throughout all of Norrath; it’s that extra rare danger that makes
things a little more dynamic and exciting. When a GM or Guide assumes the role
of an actor in a quest they have a responsibility to portray that character
properly. And if that character happens to be a bloodthirsty monster or a
vicious dark elf, then you would expect them to kill people. Most quests have a
certain level range in mind that goes along with the back-story of a quest. One
of the biggest complaints I’ve seen is that quests often use npc’s that are
a much higher level range than the players who typically frequent the zone the
quest takes place in. The biggest reason that this happens is that it fits in
best with the story. Dark Elves wishing to invade Qeynos for example would
probably send some pretty tough troops in to throw at the city, and the fact
that many newbies hang out around cities is none of their concern, invading
Qeynos is. My advice to those of you that suddenly find yourself in a situation
like this is to hide behind something and call for reinforcements. Whether you
like it or not you are now part of a dynamic quest, you’re the victim of the
story that people need to save =).<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">On Dynamic Quest
Etiquette<br>
</span></font><br>
Another big concern of most people, myself included, are the antisocial players
who just try to ruin a quest for others. These are the people that run up to the
dynamic Npc’s and shout, “Stop messing around you stupid GM” or “Gimme
ur Ph@t L3wtz!” It should be noted that these people would promptly be ignored
or worse by most dynamic quest npcs. In the type of quests requiring more
interaction and role-playing, these people aren’t going to get anywhere and if
they become too disruptive we are committed to removing them from the quest
entirely. Recent additions to our functionality now give us new powers to more
strongly control situations like this. One of the best new features we’ve
added recently is the ability to set a maximum player level range that can still
hurt the mob. This will allow us to create a lot more lower level quests without
the concern of higher level players “stealing the quest” from those it was
designed for. Just remember, if you want to participate in a dynamic quest
portray your character and leave the ooc comments out of it, you’ll find that
the npcs will interact with you a lot more and you’ll learn more of the story
going on. And please, if you don’t want to participate in a role-playing type
of quest, just leave the zone and let those who do have it. But whether you’re
role-playing or not, don’t be surprised or angry at your swift death if you
attack a npc for no reason, they will retaliate just as you would in their
position.<br>
<br>
In conclusion I’m happy to see that many of things I saw suggested in this
discussion are actually in the works right now. We have a dedicated team of
Quest Masters who are working day and night on just this sort of thing. As our
functionality increases, so will the frequency and quality of our quests. There
will always be many varying kinds, from pure combat ones like a rabid wolf in
Qeynos Hills to pure role-playing ones involving only npc interaction and
figuring out some kind of puzzle. We are committed to conveying more of the
history and story of Norrath to you all, so you can better understand the world
in which you’re character lives. I think everyone will be pleased with some of
the new dynamic content coming out, and even more importantly nearly everyone
will get a chance to participate.<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
What good are trade skills if you take away the ability to buy, trade for
things, then trade for better things ? Is pp just for mundane items ?<br>
</font><br>
In general, I really don't like no-drop items (unless they're quest components).
As most of you know, I'm a huge proponent of player driven economies, player run
bazaars and market places, etc.<br>
<br>
No-drop basically removes an item from the economy.<br>
All that said, though, there are places and encounters in the game where the
rewards are so special that we want only those who participated to wield/wear
the rewards.<br>
<br>
I'm not totally happy with that, but at this point it's the lesser of evils.
This all, of course, relates to the twinking issue as well, which also has great
arguments for and against.<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello
all,<br>
<br>
There have been a number of requests here on the boards asking what warnings,
suspensions, and bannings mean when applied to player accounts based upon
actions taken in game or on these boards.<br>
<br>
Warning - A warning is issued when we can give the customer the &quot;benefit of
the doubt&quot;. It's the assumption that they may not know what they are doing
is inappropriate. It's very possible that warnings could be issued for
borderline cases, and it really has no affect upon the account by itself.
However, a pattern of someone not knowing that what they are doing is
inappropriate leads to us no longer being able to give them the benefit of the
doubt. This can very well lead to suspension or banning.<br>
<br>
Suspension - Suspensions are temporary in nature. They typically last 7-10
business days, and customers are not allowed to access the EverQuest servers or
message boards (for posting) during this time. They are appropriate when there
has been a pattern of inappropriate conduct as indicated by warnings, or when
there isn't question that conduct was inappropriate. A suspension means that
while we still want your business, we want you to know that your conduct isn't
appropriate.<br>
<br>
Suspensions are also the first step taken when account-ownership is contested by
someone with a bona fide claim.<br>
<br>
Banning - Banishment is permanent removal from the game, and possibly future
products as well (to be decided at a future date). It means that though we
appreciate your past patronage, it is not in our best interest to continue the
business relationship. Bannings are appropriate when the intensity of a willful
act causes us to reach this determination. Bannings are also appropriate when
there is past problems such as warnings or suspension.<br>
<br>
Bannings are also appropriate for things such as confirmed EULA violations,
attempts to defraud a GM/CS Rep, or other such problems.<br>
<br>
Warnings are typically not contestable beyond the person who issued it. At most,
the Server GM, at their option, may consider the issue.<br>
<br>
Those who have been suspended or banned can contact <a href="mailto:EQAccountStatus@verant.com" target="Main"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>EQAccountStatus@verant.com</b></font></span></a>,
which is an email address reserved solely for communication with those
customers, and is serviced by dedicated staff. Normal emails from people who
have not been suspended or banned will not receive a response from this email
address, and should forward their issue to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com" target="Main"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>eqmail@verant.com</b></font></span></a>.<br>

(hits for less damage) than the best pet I could summon at 34 was capable of.<br>
</font><br>
It is very possible that a pet summoned with a higher level spell can hit for
less damage than a pet summoned with a lower level spell. Most often it would be
the worst possible pet of the upper level spell compared to the best possible
pet of the lower level spell.<br>
<br>
Remember that max damage is not the only attribute that the pet has. Pets have
skills just like player characters. Higher level summons will have better skills
than lower level ones, regardless of the max damage. As an example, the worst
39th level pet may hit for less than the best 34th level pet, however the 39th
level summon will have better skills and do more damage on average.<br>
<br>
There's also the matter of pet hitpoints, which is another factor in the
strength of a pet.</font></p>

all,<br>
<br>
I'm still trying to get together a list of changes for this Friday's patch and
will have final data tomorrow, but either that one or the one after will include
some new features in the in-game chat channels.<br>
<br>
In the last patch, we implemented the ability to expand the &quot;@&quot; symbol
into the targets name when used in an emote. There was a problem with this
implementation that will be fixed in the new one. However, the @ symbol has been
replaced with a series of @-variables that expand into various pieces of
information, and now works in all chat channels (emote, say, shout, ooc,
auction, group, guild).<br>
<br>
The new @-variables are:<br>
<br>
@T - Returns the current target<br>
@S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It)<br>
@O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It)<br>
@P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her,
Its)<br>
@R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters)<br>
@C - Returns the class of the target (only works on Player characters)<br>
<br>
Furthermore, animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned
emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be
specified. That will continue to work. So if you type &quot;/point Abashi&quot;,
the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but
you must specify the target as &quot;say&quot; (getting a bit complicated now,
sorry). For instance, if my current target is &quot;a gnoll&quot;, and I were to
type:<br>
<br>
/point say points at @T, indicating that he is ready to kill @O.<br>
<br>
...my character would execute the /point animation, and the text output would
be:<br>
<br>
&quot;Abashi points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Custom text for canned animations must be directed at a target named
&quot;say&quot;.<br>
<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Out
of curiosity, the original EQ game was sold with the understanding that you
could go to the planes and kill gods and stuff. To do this required you to be
level 45.. well, there was no level at one point but was increased to a min of
45.<br>
</font><br>
The planes were not on line when the game was released. They were added in a
post-production update. In any case, the fact that the game would change over
time was stated in the EULA, and it's not &quot;illegal&quot; for us to make
those changes.<br>
<br>
Perhaps after the plane changes you will not be able to kill an NPC named &quot;Cazic-Thule&quot;
at the same level you used to, but you will still be able to take on an
encounter that difficult and acquire the similar loot to what you get now off of
that NPC. Neither of those are, however, required by law.<br>
<br>
From a game design perspective, top level encounters were always meant to be top
level encounters, and if the top level changes, those encounters should as well.
We made an exception in order to avoid putting them all out of the reach of
those who chose not to buy Kunark by placing the level cap on Vox and Nagafen.
The other solution would have been to buff them up to a level that is
appropriate for level 60 encounters, which we desperately wanted to avoid in the
name of servicing our customers.</font></p>

<br>
This Friday's patch will includes updates to the tradeskills in game. This
doesn't yet represent a final revision, but is the big step necessary to get to
the point where we can call them all &quot;revamped&quot;.<br>
<br>
As part of this update, we are including trade specialization. Players will only
be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available
tradeskills. This includes:<br>
<br>
Baking<br>
Blacksmithing<br>
Brewing<br>
Jewelcraft<br>
Tailoring<br>
Fletching<br>
Pottery<br>
<br>
Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able to
exceed 200. This does not include class or race-specific tradeskills such as
Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering.<br>
<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Did
you FORGET that tinkering was a trade skill ?<br>
</font><br>
No. Tinkering isn't a generally available tradeskill. You can exceed 200 in it,
and any generally available tradeskill if you are a gnome. Also, if you were for
instance a gnomish rogue, you could exceed 200 in tinkering, make poison, AND
any generally available tradeskill.<br>

is only one way to solve this problem - bring the server populations back down
to their intended population levels.<br>
</font><br>
Though likely to improve the situation somewhat, it's not really a solution. The
Test server which only has a couple hundred people on it at peak still has
people camping items. The newest servers averaging around 1500 people at peak
also have people camping items.<br>
<br>
I truly think that the only way to stop camping is to make things more rare
across the board, or to somehow detect camping and dynamically reduce the reward
based upon the length of the camp. I know that many have suggested just the
opposite, but you cannot discourage people from engaging in a behavior by
providing more rewards for engaging in that behavior.<br>
<br>
I know that others have suggested that we look at it from a different angle, and
strive to reward &quot;doing&quot; rather than nerfing &quot;camping&quot;.
However the current reward rate, whatever the method of acquiring that reward,
is already sufficient.<br>
<br>
My idea is to dynamically reduce the chance of a creature to drop loot, and
reduce the experience garnered, the longer the person has been camping. It's not
however something that we'll see in EverQuest, due to the way spawns and item
creation works.</font></p>

No, it hasn't been abandoned, but we have been short on content due to our
continual posts here on the boards which get broadcast to the playerbase. Many
of the subjects we've chosen to discuss here would make excellent content for
the Producer Letter, however we've preferred to have two-way communication.<br>
<br>

ever again be updated ? How is it decided what qualifies as a letter and what is

It will be updated again, probably when we get closer to the Velious Launch. The
difference between a post here and a Producer letter is subject material that we
feel is better to be announced in a two-way forum.</font></p>

DO NOT execute the test for NO RENT items, skip it (for now). BUT, record a date

may already be doing this). Then, the next time that character logs in, check
how much time has elapse since the last removal date/time stamp. If the elapsed
time is greater then... say... 60 minutes, THEN run the test for NO RENT items,
before the character becomes visible in the world. But, if the elapsed time is
less then that 60 minutes, DO NOT delete the NO RENT items, leave them there.<br>

</span></font>This suggestion has come up quite a few times. As I mentioned
before, there's no place to store that date-time stamp, and as such it would
require a player-wipe, which isn't something that's possible. The other side of
this is that our current process does not remove the items if the server goes
down unexpectedly, which the suggested process very well would.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">When you decided
to make the boards available to subscribers only I knew what you were trying to
do. You actually believed that the 'whining' would go away because you created a
great game and only those people who quit the game were disgruntled and kept
posting here to stir up the 'silent minority'.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, we never believed complaints
would go away. We did however believe the constant baseless flames would go
away, because that's what we were going to commit to make happen. We also hoped
to see more people who formerly only lurked for fear of being flamed come onto
the boards and let everyone know their thoughts as well. We've made great
strides towards both of those goals.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The reason that it
did not go away is because, although you created a very immerse game, you have
made some bad decisions in the design, testing, alteration, and expansion phases
of the game.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The concept of 'bad decisions' is
entirely subjective. What one person thinks is a bad decision, another person
thinks is a great idea. In any case, we'll be the first to admit that the game
isn't perfect, but it is inline with most of our goals and as such is
responsible for the number of people that choose to play it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No game can be perfect, and at
some point continuing to tweak it to get it closer to 'perfection' in *our* eyes
will sooner or later take it further away from that goal. Perfection is
subjective as well. I've yet to see any subject that 280K could agree upon. Even
the latest UI changes which hurt NO ONE still had people who disagreed with the
changes because they felt we should be working on something else that was
important to them.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It is not our
fault that this is so. How could it be the players fault that we are losing
interest in a game that we love and feel so passionately about.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Who says that it has to be
anyone's 'fault'? Growing disinterested in a game over time is part of the
natural course. I just wish that instead of people saying, 'I've played a year
and a half, wasted 150 days played 4 level 50 characters, and you've finally
upset me enough that I'm quitting', they'd say 'OMG! I've played for a year and
a half and put 150 days played into my 4 characters! I've never had something
keep me this interested for this long. It's time to move on, but I just wanted
to extend my thanks for the entertainment. It was well worth the money.'</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Frankly, if someone plays for a
year or a year and a half before quitting, we feel that we've done our job well,
regardless the reason stated for quitting. A computer game keeping someone
interested for that long is truly amazing, and we're happy that our game was one
that could do it. Over 70% of everyone who has ever purchased EverQuest is still
subscribing today, and that is a fantastic testament to what we're doing.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Don't talk to me
about burn-out either. There is a difference between baing burnt-out on a game
and getting tired of the negative changes imposed on that game.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Oops, too late, I spoke about
burnout already. Anyway, I've found that people who are ready to quit are
looking for a *reason* to do so, rather than quitting just because they've had
enough. These changes are excellent fuel for that. I sincerely doubt that anyone
goes from completely happy to 'quitting' over one minor change such as the stats
on one item or the location of a drop changing.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You talk about 'negative changes'
like 'negative' is a factual statement when in fact it is an opinion. Take this
Veeshan loot issue as an example. People want risk and reward to make sense.
We're going to make it make sense. That is a positive change if we are
implementing what people want, right? A great many people have posted how some
loot in other areas belongs on dragons. This was truly a case where it wasn't a
case of items in VP being underpowered as much as it was a case of items
elsewhere being overpowered. We can't keep raising the power of items found at
the higher levels every time an item shows up in the mid levels a little more
powerful than expected.</font></p>

I've been in a few MUDs, including one that demanded a monthly fee, and nowhere
else did I find this disconnect between the users and the 'gods' of the servers.
None of those (admittedly primitive) MUDs found the players regarding the sysops
with such naked contempt.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I disagree that there is that much
of a 'disconnect' given the scale of what we are doing here. I think that we
have far more communications with our customers than other service companies out
there this size, in or out of the game industry. The MUDs of old have a much
smaller player base to deal with and thus have a much greater chance of pleasing
everyone with the decisions that they make. That's a rough thing to do at this
size. Consider this, more people have played EQ than live in the state of
Wyoming.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Yeah sure you
always had your share of bellyachers but here, I've seen some seemingly decent
ideas and valid questions prefaced with lines like 'I'm sure this will be
ignored, but what about..' and 'I know Verant doesn't give a **** but this would
be cool..'</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I really hate to see people prefix
their posts like that as well, because it virtually guarantees that the post
will go unanswered. Answering posts that are prefixed with some negative
statement designed to promote a response out of spite get us off on the bad
foot, and just encourage more posts of that type.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Average players
I've been in pick-up groups with treat /petition like the lotto: good freakin'
luck. For them patch messages are out of left field (What is this moss twig, and
why is it being nerfed?). And they're always seeing another 'stealth nerf'
behind every new situation, failed/useless spell, or bad death experience.
(Stealth nerfs exist but I have no idea how widespread they are.)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The foreseen 'stealth nerf' is
certainly our fault due to repeated problems with getting the appropriate things
announced to the public. We've made great strides in that department over the
past 9 months, and I think that we'll continue to improve.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">And some staff
members with Verant have slipped into a bunker mentality: it's us against the
ignorant, whining, class-envious players who play 20 hours a week and then
complain about how awful the game is.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I disagree, concerning the bunker
mentality. Again, I feel that we have a great deal of communication with our
customers. We not only have me here on the boards every day, but Aradune, Rowyl,
Ester, Hobart, Akriss, people in customer service and tech support, as well as
Yak over on the tradeskill board. These others weren't 'ordered' to come post
here on the boards, they chose to because of their commitment to satisfying the
customers and their respect for customer opinions.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I'm just an
ignorant consumer so I can't say.. however I DO know that this discontent will
continue until EQ is no longer the hyper popular online game it is now.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As I mentioned in another thread
today, that's the natural cycle of these things. If you visit the boards for the
other games out there, you'll see the same type of thing that you see here.
There is always going to be a percentage of players for whom we fail to fulfill
our goals. Considering our over-70% retention rate over 18 months, and the fact
that we are still growing and adding servers, I think that we're doing fairly
well over all.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1) Un-gag more
staff members. Letting the coder in charge of the UI, and the guy in charge of
tradeskills speak was a stroke of genius! Why don't we see GZ speak out anymore?
What's the deal with the gag orders in the first place ?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">GZ is involved on another project
but still consults with the EQ team and will always be the ArchMage&nbsp; We do
have to place some limits on how many people can be out here in the public
light, and how often, since they of course are working on ways to add content to

Guild Maintenance<br>
<br>
We are in the process of preparing to do maintenance on the guild database. To
that end, guild creation and activation will be on hold for the next three
weeks. After that time, we may be running a process to remove inactive or
under-subscribed guilds from the system. We would ask and recommend that those
in guilds with under 10 separate members (on separate accounts) consider merging
and deleting the under-subscribed guild.<br>
<br>
In addition, it's apparently become common practice for people wishing to
register a guild to enter the chat server and advertise there for help creating
the guild. This will no longer be permitted. People wishing to submit a guild
must organize prior to entering the chat server. Advertising for assistance
within the chat server could result in a short-term (24 hour) suspension for the
account.<br>

NPCs corpses 55th level or above will decay in 30 minutes rather than 5. We
ended up deciding to make this change due to the difficulty of getting the dead

in the ability, we went ahead and extended it to all of the high end special

At some point there probably will be, but not just yet. Those dragons operate on
a timer while the dragon is idle until it depops. Any time they respond to quest
text, that timer is suspended. We had NPCs in the game like this at one point,
but found that people were able to get them to stay around indefinitely by
constanly /hailing them.<br>

At some point we might change the way those timers work, so ruin your faction

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
following was my third post regarding the subject prior to the thread corrupting
(*sigh*) :<br>
<br>
I don't mean this in a condescending way at all, but I honestly wish some of you
would at least try to put yourselves in our shoes.<br>
<br>
What options do we have in these situations ?<br>
<br>
First, let's establish a few facts :<br>
<br>
1. This is a dynamic game. It may not be as dynamic as some would like with
massive invasions and huge volcanic eruptions and entire NPC governments taking
action that affect players' lives, but it DOES change. We add to the game, we
change the game, and some times we take away. (Actually, it makes me worry for
when the technology is such that we can do all of that stuff -- how will people
respond... 'That volcano created a mountain where my favorite hunting grounds
were and blocked the entrance to my favorite dungeon and now I have to walk
farther to the new entrance at the top of the crater! You nerfed me!').<br>
<br>
We cannot have stagnant games, yet when the status quo changes, SOMEBODY always
get's upset, especially if the change is not universally positive (and what
change is ?).<br>
<br>
2. We're not perfect! We will make mistakes. We will continue to make mistakes
as long as we continue to add content, and things will be out of balance in the
future.<br>
<br>
3. We learn and get better. For example, lots of universal class non-specific
loot like Rubicite is bad.<br>
<br>
So, what options do we have:<br>
<br>
1. We could just leave mistakes and aspects of the game that didn't turn out as
planned. I think that leads to stagnation. I also think it leaves areas of the
game untouched... empty zones, ignored quests, etc.<br>

2. We could upgrade the VP items that are weaker to what they should be. This
doesn't address the other items that are too powerful relative to their
difficulty to obtain, but it would address one side of the problem. The problem
is that they'd be comparable then most likely to the other broken items. Many
players would then simply try to obtain the broken items since they are as good
as the upgraded VP items but easier to get. And we'd still have broken items.<br>
<br>
3. We could upgrade the VP items and make them better than the non-VP broken
items (and not adjust encounter difficulty). Here's where the MUDflation comes
in. Now, what have we done to all the other items in the game... they're all
indirectly weaker now. And, we've set a new (lower) standard of risk vs. reward.
The game becomes less challenging, etc.<br>
<br>
4. We could upgrade the VP items and make them better than the non-VP broken
items (and then re-adjust NPC encounter difficulty throughout the game as well
as other treasure tables everywhere, raising the entire risk/reward ratio but
keeping it balanced). This, by the way, is what the infamous mud wimping article
would have us do -- either that, or nothing. Basically, it's a ton of work and
would probably introduce a whole slew of new problems and potential for
mistakes. Bluntly, we'd rather allocate those resources elsewhere.<br>
<br>
So, our solution is to identify the non-VP items that are out there that are too
powerful and probably move them to VP. And then take some underpowered VP items
and move them elsewhere AND/OR make some new items to replace the over-powered
ones.<br>
<br>
I also want to emphasize that there really aren't that many items. Also, just to
let you know, MORE of this is going to occur when EQ Live starts revamping old
world zones (Permafrost, Najena, etc.) We will be adding new content AND moving
existing content around.<br>
<br>
I know this isn't compatible with some players' feelings that how and where
things are in the game the day they started playing MUST also be the same 3, 6
or 12 months later. But, with all due respect, that's simply NOT how MMORPGs
work. As mentioned earlier, if anything, MMORPGs will become MORE dynamic and
less predictable/dependable in the future.<br>
<br>
In closing, I'll quote from one of the EQ Live game designers emails to me
regarding some of the items that very well might change - I want to emphasize
again that there aren't that many we're talking about :<br>
<br>
&quot;Broken Weapons include: Blade of the Black Dragon Eye, Warding Star, Runed
Fighters Staff (Somewhat easy to acquire, godly proc ratio), Moss Covered Twig
(we all know this one), etc.<br>
<br>
Those are a few examples of broken items which have been acquired by players and
severely hamper our attempts to create new and interesting loot. The players
should be made happy soon however. We just went through and nerfed the drops of
those broken weapons and &quot;added new content&quot; -- replacement new items.
Near copies of some of the broken weapons are being placed into VP.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>

<br>
You might want to note that there have been two important announcements added to
the Sony EQ Board. Both are Real Life Events that are designed for the players.<br>
<br>
First, on November 4-5, players are invited to attend the Velious Launch Party
in Las Vegas! They can meet other players, the Velious Development Team and have
a chance to play on the new Velious continent before it is released! They can
also win great prizes, including signed copies of the expansion pack (to be
shipped when it is shipped to the retailers).<br>
<br>
Also announced is the next Real Life event I will be coordinating. The EQ Fan
Faire will be held in February in a yet to be determined East Coast city. Check
out the site to cast your vote for our destination !<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I
think that there’s a common misconception going around that, “All dynamic
events consist of GMs going on a killing spree.” This isn’t the case, as
there are many different types of dynamic events, ranging from the typical raid,
to story-telling events, to epic quests with a vast story-line behind them.<br>
<br>
Raids are typically short on story and last anywhere from a half an hour to an
hour or two. They usually consist of trio of actor NPCs or so entering an area
and running amok until they are killed by a sufficient force of players.<br>
<br>
Story-telling events typically have little-to-no fighting of any kind, and are
usually used to tell a story leading up to or concluding an epic quest.<br>
<br>
Epic quests often run several hours and boast a slew of actor NPCs that both
tell a story and engage in combat at some point during the quest.<br>
<br>
In addition to these, there are also “Invasions” which are more static in
nature and deal with a temporary data reset of the zone. Examples of this have
been the period undead invasions of Qeynos Hills, or the recent one in Najena
that was launched with a small epic quest.<br>
<br>
We realize and agree that there have been problems publicizing the story behind
dynamic events, and will be launching a new section of our website in the next
couple of days to deal with that issue. However, the question I would like to
pose is, what do you want to see in the way that dynamic events are handled? It
seems that no matter the event, or the story behind it, there are always some
people who felt that the event was nothing but a “killing spree”.<br>
<br>
What can we do to make these events more enjoyable for the players ?<br>

he means is that if you have soloed your entire career, you will not be making
all of the connections with other characters. If I don't know you from Adam and
no one else I know does, the odds are we're not going to be to thrilled with the
idea of letting you into our group where you may kill us.<br>
</span></font><br>
I'd say that's an accurate description of the issues. Grouping is a skill that
needs to be developed early on. Certainly, some classes support soloing, but
we've always said that soloers not be able to go everywhere and do everything.
If going everywhere and doing everything is important to the person who plays a
soloable class, I'd certainly recommend that they work on forming relationships
early on and throughout the leveling process.</font></p>

for running the questions of the week. For the camping question, you posted a
summary of what you learned. Are you planning to do this with the topic of fun ?
I'd like to see what you found.<br>
</font><font color="#C0C0C0"><br>
I think that if anything, the thoughts presented supported my original post
where I spoke about the diversity of EverQuests players, and the fact that many
people see different things as fun. Some spoke, for instance, about trade skills
being fun, while some others said specifically that they weren't fun.<br>
<br>
The task before us is to provide more. More options. More content. More things
to do. We need to provide as many avenues to fun as possible, without infringing
on other players' idea of fun. For instance, there are those who find it fun to
cause other players grief. We do not wish to support that play style.<br>
<br>
EverQuest already has many avenues to fun available to the players, leaving it
up to you to decide which avenues to take. We can always provide more, as long
as those avenues do not cause other avenues to break down as mentioned above.<br>

up at the tuning meeting.<br>
<br>
After some discussion, we agreed that risk vs. reward as it relates to quite a
few Kunark high level items is not as intended.<br>
<br>
The solution will be to move items around, making sure the encounter and
difficulty reaching the encounter is more in line with the quality/power of the
item(s) obtained.<br>
<br>
The solution will NOT be a retroactive upgrade of existing items due to our
desire to avoid MUDflation whenever possible.<br>

people who don't agree with us (Verant)...<br>
<br>
...is flaming nonetheless.<br>
<br>
I've run across several threads since yesterday where people are posting
personal attacks upon those who are voicing a dissatisfied position on various
issues in the game, specifically for class issues.<br>
<br>
Though there's no problem with you posting opinions to the contrary to
illustrate why you feel that some posters opinions are unjust or flawed, they no
more require personal attacks than the original statement of dissatisfaction
does. We have to moderate these boards with a firm but even hand to ensure that
they fulfill their purpose, and telling other posters to &quot;shut up&quot; or
calling them &quot;whiners&quot; doesn't fulfill those purposes.<br>
<br>
I'll ask the moderators to go through those posts on Monday and take the proper
actions. Though we certainly appreciate the support, flaming isn't allowed
regardless what side of the issue you are on.</font></p>

are silly names no longer being changed in EQ ? I remember hearing that when EQ
was to come out on the market character names would have to be in theme. I see
names everyday that are not.<br>
</font><br>
Names are being changed when they violate the naming policy. Unforunately
&quot;silly&quot; is subjective. Of the name examples you mentioned, only one
would be immediately ruled inappropriate. &quot;Twomoons&quot; would only create
a problem if one tried to get a last name of &quot;Overmiami&quot; or something
of that nature. &quot;Physikal&quot; would only be a problem if the last name
was something along the lines of &quot;Attraction&quot;.<br>
<br>
That said, a name has to be noticed and escalated when a GM or Senior Guide is
online to get it changed. The obvious exception to this is if a name is horribly
vulgar.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello all,</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're quite pleased with the
direction that the board has taken since we implemented the changes only
allowing active EverQuest account holders the ability to post. It's caused the
overall tone here to change greatly for the better, allowing us to raise the
quality and quantity of our communication with the customers.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That said, there's been some
slippage over the past day or so, leading to 15 account warnings, 4 suspensions,
and 2 bannings for posts made in the past 24 hours. There is still too much
baseless flaming, personal attacks, insults, and general discourtesy going on.
We’d like everyone to feel free to discuss opinions and issues, however there
is no opinion worth stating that must contain discourteous content in order for
the point to be made. People who cannot post without engaging in such discourse,
who also want to remain EverQuest subscribers, should not do so on these boards.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I want to reiterate our commitment
to maintain these boards as a viable medium for communications with our
customers. If they cannot serve that purpose, and if it is not advantageous to
have them (both for you and for us), they won’t be something that we’ll
continue to have on the official site.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We appreciate everyone’s
cooperation in keeping these forums civilized and respectful.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank you,</font>
