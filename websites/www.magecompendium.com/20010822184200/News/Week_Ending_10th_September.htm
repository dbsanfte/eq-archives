<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's highly unlikely that we could implement
this in a reasonable amount of time. It would require indexing of all creatures
that are close enough, or on the current view screen, loading them into an
array, and cycling the position of the array each time the button is pressed.
The difficulty is that the array would have to be updated on each press to
account for creatures that had entered or exited the range, making keeping a
logical position in the array difficult. We could try going alphabetically based
upon the true name of the NPC (a_moss_snake24) but it would still require
loading NPCs into the &quot;in range&quot; list upon each press.</font>

finally receiving craftable plate, which can be produced in a variety of colors.
In addition there will be craftable cultural plate armors. Fine Plate is the

requiring only a little traveling and currency, and it has a broad market since

Cultural Armors, Weapons, and Shields!<br>
</font><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana">Rumors of these items have
been causing quite a stir here on the Coalition of Tradesfolk board. The
Cultural items are not profit making items for a smith. The materials are rare
and expensive and the chance of failure to successfully craft a cultural item is
high. In addition, the market for these items is very small being restricted to
only a few races per culture. Obtaining your class specific quest armor is a
cakewalk in comparison to obtaining smithed cultural armor. The primary purpose
of the cultural smithing is to provide more cultural distinction to Everquest
and enhance the role-playing environment.</font></span>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana">Q:
Are all races capable of wearing at least one of the cultural blacksmithed
armors ?<br>
<br>
A: Yes</font></span>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana">Q:
Are all races capable of forging at least one cultural blacksmithed armor ?<br>
<br>
A: No</font></span>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana">Q:
Why Not ?<br>
<br>
A: Several reasons, most of which have been brought up by players on the
Coalition of Tradesfolk board. The main reason is why I call it Cultural
Smithing instead of Racial Smithing. I'll use dwarves as an example. Kaladim is
a mining city and the best dwarven blacksmiths are revered as heroes. They are
heroes because of their 'unique' blacksmithing techniques and secrets that
allows them to forge armor that no one else can, like the Bloodforge Armor that
the dwarven npc's produce. Sharing those smithing secrets and techniques would
greatly diminish their importance. Dwarven players who have a love of
blacksmithing are simply now given the means to reach for and achieve that
status 'within' their culture, but crafting that ultimate suit of magical imbued
dwarven brellium platemail is harder than any other quest that dwarven player
can attempt.</font></span>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana">Q:
What races have their own Cultural Forges and who can wear the Armor they
produce ?<br>
<br>
A: Dwarves can craft Brellium armor that can also be worn by Gnomes and
Halflings. High Elves can craft Mithril armor that can also be worn by Wood
Elves and Half Elves. Dark Elves can craft Adamantite armor that can also be
worn by Half Elves. Ogres can craft Adamantite armor that can also be worn by
Trolls. Humans can craft High Quality Ore armors that can also be worn by
Barbarians, Erudites, and Half Elves. Iksar can craft Skyiron armor that can
only be worn by Iksars. Barbarians culturally do not prefer plate armors but do
have a chain class armor in addition to their line of weapons.<br>
Gnomes have a forge that will be used in conjunction with tinkering to produce
some gnome only cultural suits of armor.</font></span>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana">Q:
Will other races have cultural products produced by trade skills ?<br>
<br>
A: Yes. Erudite craftsmen are known for producing some of the finest robes and
silks. Halflings are travelers and collectors; thus have a cultural demand for
comfortable leathers and lightweight bags. Wood elves admire intricate
leatherworking and Kelethin is home to Norraths finest fletchers. Iksars have an
abundance of rich clay at their disposal and have a long history of crafting
fine pottery, plus their claws are great for intricate etching. Trolls...well,
trolls eat a lot.</font></span>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana">Q:
What about Half Elves ?<br>
<br>
A: Half Elves are a unique case. They have no culture of their own. The Half Elf
advantage is that they can use more of the cultural items than any other race.
Their disadvantage is that they have no cultural items of their own.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have been amazed
at the ignorance shown towards the 3d engine in EQ.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Since the graphics
engine should be entirely abstract from any gameplay and networking (for the
most part) issues why cant the engine simply be upgraded and the old engine
still be available for those who use lesser hardware. The actual interface with
the servers would be identical with a new engine, simply the local rendering and
displaying of the scenes would change.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">One must ask why
we have to put up with an engine that is pre quake 2 and extremely outdated?
Lesser hardware configs would still perform better on a more efficient engine.
The Kunark upgrade was a joke... use the same poor engine and add more
polygons... anyone could have realised that it was a bad idea and has succeeded
in chunking quite powerful systems.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Unless EverQuest
has been designed in a very poor manner, that is not allowing the graphics
engine to be fully abstract, then a new engine would be a much needed change. It
could also be optional for those who don't have the hardware to support it. But
as I mentioned before, a more efficient engine will improve performance on most
systems.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's not so much 'can't' as it is
'can't feasibly be done with reasonable time and resources'. The art used in
EverQuest represents nearly four years of work for a team of artists. Going
through and revamping all of EQ proper with updated textures would take roughly
half that time for a full team. Now, if you are talking about a completely new
engine, it would then take additional man-years of work by programmers.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">New zone geometry, though not
being possible for a platform that has to be backward compatible for people
using the current engine, would have to match up in every way at every
coordinate, so there wouldn't be much of a benefit there either.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Basically, it's not feasible
because by the time we'd get EQ rebuilt in the suggested fashion, all of the
next-generation games would be out, and we'd have an old game with a fresh look.
We'd rather, when that time comes, have a new game with a fresh look.</font>

seems like another life now, I was a young wood elf Rogue making my way through
Cazic-Thule with a young high elf cleric and another wood elven rogue. We fought
long and hard battles with the denizens of the inner courtyard of Cazic-Thule,
sometimes, even poking our heads into the maze of Thule to try and pick off
straggler Defenders and Warders.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">At this time, the
history of EQ had not yet been written. Uberguilds didn't exist, nor would they

many unknowns.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My small group of
friends were the only people of sufficient power at that time to even attempt a
fearsome dungeon like Cazic-Thule. We had advanced very rapidly and the Gods saw
our powers growing.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">One day while
fighting in Cazic Thule, a mighty figure appeared out of thin air, wielding a
great flaming sword. We knew of this person as Aradune, Avatar of the God Karana.
He had appeared before us before, apparently checking up on us for his God, and
to make sure we were still in good graces with our own Gods.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This day we spoke
of many things... Aradune told us great stories of his times in another realm,
long before Norrath or any of its denizens existed. He spoke boldly of his
adventures that sprawled across the darkest regions of this other world.
Proudly, he told us stories of his many accomplishments. We were all in awe,
such courage was yet unknown in our realm.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Aradune then
looked at us sternly, pointing the flaming sword at each of us, and told us,
'Perhaps one day, if you risk your life and limb, and traverse the deepest
regions of this realm, you will be rewarded. In the realms of Norrath, bravery,
courage, honor, dedication, and belief are given the highest of rewards. Those
willing to take the largest risks are rewarded justly.'</font>

hard, that it punishes casual gamers, etc. In other words, your concern that the
best loot isn't necessarily always in the toughest dungeons is virtually drowned
out by other players' concerns that good loot is only obtainable by Uber guilds
in the depths of difficult dungeons after adventuring for hours and hours.</font>

still the same gamer as I was back then. I'm still damn proud of EQ and still
very involved with it. I've less time overall because I'm also responsible for

have. In fact, with our merge with SOE I've now more time to be involved with

reports that there may be a dupe bug somewhere in game. While we're confident
that we do not have any current issues of this type, we'd like to provide an
incentive to everyone to report such things should they become aware of them.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The FIRST person to submit
reproduction steps for any dupe bug will receive the following: a) A free
EverQuest account. We'll mark your current account as free, or provide you with
a new, free account, and b) Subject to approval by us, the title of your choice
will be applied to one of the characters on your account.</font>

you get less xp for reds then blues ?<br>
<br>
Now I am level 30. I was fighting blue Mountain Giants in Frontier Mountains
most (blue to me at 30) for a while in a group of four all around 30 and getting
great xp! Like noticable movement. Then I joined a group in Overthere fighting
RED and YELLOW mobs with a group of four all around 30. We fought those mobs for
a much greater time and ended up with much less experience.<br>
</font><br>
Things can be a little harder to measure in level 30, which requires more
experience than normal were the experience curve linear in nature. I would
imagine that your experience might also have something to do with what will
typically be more downtime between fights when encountering yellow and red NPCs.<br>
<br>
Also, while I can't say if the zones mentioned apply, some zones have greater or
lesser experience modifiers than others. For instance, fighting in dungeons
gives more experience per kill than fighting in most outdoor areas. The zone
that gives the greatest experience modifier is actually on Faydwer, not Kunark.<br>
<br>
It is possible that a red in one zone could give less experience than a blue in
another.</font></p>

Aside from initial spawns that occur once the servers come back up, anything
with a spawn time of over two hours receives a random modifier to the spawn time
that could cause it to spawn sooner or later than when expected. The modifier is
percentage-based, so that the average spawn time (based on large numbers) is
roughly the same as when they were spawning after an exact interval.</font></p>

seriously it is more about principal. Why should someone new to the game get a
better deal by $40 than I get since I have been paying $10 a month for a year
and a half, and they haven't given any money at all? I have been here
contributing to the world and the play.<br>
</font><br>
It's just a matter of modern economics. When something new comes out, people pay
more to get in on the ground floor. For instance, one of the analogies that we
think applies is with DVD players. People who went out and bought a DVD player
as soon as they came on the market paid more than those who buy one today. If I
buy a DVD player today, not only do I get it cheaper than I would have when they
first came out, but I'll probably get a better DVD player. The additional amount
paid by the first people to go out and buy it is the cost of being able to enjoy
it for the last 2 years or so.<br>
<br>
Yes, you've been paying for the past year and a half, but you've had the
opportunity to play the game during that time, and that is what the money for
you've paid has gone towards.</font></p>

a Verant spokesperson at ECTS reported that one of the new features in the
expansion would be an all-new, fully customizable 3D user interface. Since it
was released in early 1999, EverQuest players have had to use a somewhat
cumbersome and plain-looking but nonetheless serviceable graphical interface
while playing the game. The new interface in Velious will be much more
customizable by comparison; for instance, you'll be able to create multiple chat
windows, so that you could isolate messages sent by your group or guild from the
rest of the messages that normally appear on screen. You'll also have more
control over what elements appear on the screen, and where they go.</font></p>

</font><br>
Actually yes, we can only list actual classes in the class listing.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">I guess my biggest gripe, is EverQuest is the first game
where there is absolutely no documentation on what a spell does nor how to use
it. Without the hacking of the data files, about half the spells would still be
unknown. Was this Verant's intent ?<br>
</font><br>
Well it obviously wasn't our intent for people to crack the data file, but it
was our intent that there would be virtually no information on what spells do in
game. We wanted players to figure them out and pass the data around through
anecdotes.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Second, Even after we give the muzzle to our pets, we get
no message indicating it even did anything. I gave the pet grubs and I get the
exact same response. Could the pet at least acknowledge that the item didn't
just get eaten ? &quot;Jobeker twists in defiance as you place the Muzzle
on.&quot;<br>
<br>
</font>Can't do this either. Object-specific emotes are not supported.<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
Lastly, Duration ? Is it permanent ? Does the pet eat thru it eventually ? Does
it stack with burnout, or does burnout overwrite the effect ?<br>
<br>
</font>Yes, it is permanent, or at least until the pet dies or disappears. And
yes, it does stack with burnout, in the same fashion that haste spells such as
Alacrity stack with haste items such as the FBSS.</font></p>

realize this was put in to reduce corpse lag my making NPC corpses with nothing
on them disappear, or newbie corpses that are naked disappear, but WHY do high
level players' corpses disappear in under a minute if they have nothing on
them????? Countless people have lost countless experience because of this
bug/design oversight.<br>
<br>
Will this be fixed ?<br>
</font><br>
First, PC corpses disappear in three minutes when naked, not &quot;under a
minute&quot;. It's done to keep people from clogging up areas with corpses.
Obviously this only catches those who do it unintentionally, but those who do it
intentionally can be addressed via other means.<br>
<br>
This isn't something we plan on changing going forward. The best solution I can
offer you is to not die naked. Pick up something before running into a dangerous
area to retrieve your corpse.</font></p>

Gnolls are here and Broon is here, and the guards are here... Oh Fippy...<br>
<br>
</font>A truly and realistically dynamic world is one of the MMORPG 'holy
grails.'<br>
<br>
I expect we'll 'get there' some day, but it will be a while. On the road there,
however, you'll see incremental advancements. Second generation MMORPGs will be
more dynamic than first, etc.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd like to see a huge, detailed world that changed according to
what players and GMs wanted/did. BUT, the changes need to make sense, they need
to retain context.<br>
<br>
One short term way to achieve a 'dynamic world' is to randomly generate and
scramble content, whether it be quests, world geometry, or whatever. I think
we'll see more experiments into this realm in the future because it is a much
easier route to a 'dynamic world.' You don't need hordes of game designers and
world builders... you don't need incredibly sophisticated world and NPC AI that
reacts and changes based on events... rather, you just need lots of variables
and a good random number generator.<br>
<br>
This approach, however, at least for a player and designer such as myself,
leaves me wanting. One day I'd like to see a huge, detailed world with every
alleyway having a story behind it, a world so vast that it might take several
years for a player to have explored everywhere (if it were even possible for one
player to do so!). A world that changes but makes sense... perhaps a war ravages
several villages, or perhaps a volcano erupts creating new mountain or island
(and you SAW it erupt!)... perhaps a group of players went on a daring quest
and, barely surviving, triumphed -- and the nobles of the land talked about your
accomplishment and treated you differently for some time...<br>
<br>
Anyways, we have a long road ahead of us in terms of MMORPG development and I'm
glad to be part of a company who is committed to reaching those goals :)<br>

version of the EverQuest Patch Program that includes a new button labeled
'Thorough File Check'.&nbsp; When pressed, this button will run a full CRC
comparison on each file in your EverQuest directory versus the file located on
the server, guaranteeing that you have the correct version of each file on your
system.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've found that some people
experiencing crashes while in EverQuest were actually being affected by file
corruption that is not detected by the fast file comparison done each time you
start EverQuest.&nbsp; As such, anyone experiencing unexplained crashes should
run the 'Thorough File Check' to see if that improves the situation.&nbsp;
