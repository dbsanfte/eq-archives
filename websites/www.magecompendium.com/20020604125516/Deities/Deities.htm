        Created at the whim of the demi-goddess Druzzil Ro for the purpose of
        creating music to soothe the soul, Ayonae Ro grew to develop powers and
        a distinct personality of her own. Druzzil sacrificed a small portion of
        her own place to create a new realm to be dominated by Ayonae Ro, the
        Demi-Plane of Music. Ayonae can not only cause others to become caught
        up in her music to the point of feeling the emotions therein, she is
        able to mold and shape the very realm in which she lives, much as her
        mother does with her own magical skills.</font></p>

        and Rallos Zek. He rules the Plane of Disease, which is dark and drippy
        with geysers of ooze and rivers of pus. The land itself looks, feels and
        even smells like decaying flesh, and is inhabited by all manner of evil
        creatures and undead.</font></p>

        Followers of the Duke of Below find true happiness in the caves, caverns
        and tunnels that permeate the belly of Norrath, but this is one of few
        points upon which all followers of Brell can agree. The Runny Eye Clan
        of goblins claim he is their father, much to the disgust of the dwarves
        of Kaladim who are certain that only the dwarves are the true children
        of Serilis. The vicious gnolls of Split Paw disagree entirely, for was
        it not Brell who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove?
        Followers of Brell Serilis, in one form or another, can be found nearly

        followers. They are almost always very charming, clever, and witty,
        traits which all Bristlebane followers should strive to have. Mischief
        in all its forms is encouraged. Practical jokes are performed as if they
        are the highest of rituals. Very few of Bristlebane's followers are
        outright wicked in their desires but it is best to keep at least one eye
        on your purse if they are about. And never let one deal you a hand of
        King's Court.</font></p>

        the lives of others. Pain, misery, violence, torture, living sacrifice -
        these are the tools of a Cazicite. Many lizardman tribes are devout

        Magic became the home of the goddess of magic. In its natural state, it
        is an infinitely expansive plane of perfect white and unblemished marble
        under a gray and featureless sky, though one would likely never glimpse
        her plane in such a state. Through the will of Druzzil Ro, her home
        takes the shape, form and features that reflect her current mood. Her

        to Mithaniel and Erollisi Marr is a source of constant debate amongst
        their followers. He is believed to have given physical form and
        intelligence to the influences of Love and Valor in the personages of
        Erollisi and Mithaniel Marr, respectively, and given them power over

        Cazicite, though a combination of religious zeal and prophetic visions
        stripped from her any semblance of sanity. Lifted up by her deity and
        given her own domain, the power of her madness shaped it into the
        semblance of old Paineel after its destruction. From her realm, Vazaelle
        occasionally foresees an event in the future of some unsuspecting
        Norrathian citizen, whose life will change drastically when that event
        occurs. Depending on the severity of Vazaelle's mental state during the
        vision, that poor individual will know some degree of madness for the
        rest of their days, suffering from the touch of Vazaelle the Mad.</font></p>

        Veeshan is the great crystalline dragon who rules the Plane of Sky. She
        needs no allies but considers Brell Serilis an enemy. Veeshan is known
        as the Mother of All Wurms and this title includes all of dragonkind
        such as the drakes and wyverns. When the universe was young, Veeshan
        traveled throughout the cosmos depositing Her children on worlds She
        deemed worthy. She would then strike the planet with Her massive claws
        so that the other deities would know She had laid claim to that world.
        The continent of Velious on Norrath bears Her mark, known as the Scars
        of Veeshan.</font></p>

        follower of Zek yearns for strength, courage, but above all, victory.
        They believe that the heat of battle is the only place and time where
        enlightenment can be gained, that the universe was formed by conflict
        and in conflict it will end, with the victors feasting upon the remains
        of their fallen enemy. No respect or regard is given to the dead, for if
        they were worthy their hearts would still pump blood through their veins
        and not upon the soil of Norrath. The followers of Zek are almost
        exclusively warriors .</font></p>
