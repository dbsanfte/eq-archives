<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You aren't dealing
with constants when fighting things in Oasis. NPCs have level ranges. Pets have
level ranges. Hit and miss percentages have ranges. Damage dealt and damage
taken have ranges. A combination of good or bad rolls on one side or another can
make it appear that things have changed in one way or another, but they haven't.</font></span></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
I've been back and forth with several programmers over the past two weeks about
this, in addition to running my own tests and having them run theirs. The only
determination that we've made is that aside from the procing weapon issue, which
I think people understand as a bug fix at this point, is that they have not
changed.</font></span></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
Perhaps the best way I can &quot;prove&quot; to everyone that they haven't
changed is by pointing to the lack of people with concrete figures here. When we
*really* change something, the board is flooded with a certain type of player
making complaints. These are the people who log and parse everything, and can
find changes with the combat engine down to single percentage points. Those
people are not here. What we have are people who &quot;get the feeling
that&quot; something is different.<br>
<br>
Trust me, if there was something different with the basic way pets were in
combat, there would be players here with exact figures explaining
exactly what changed.<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hi.<br>
<br>
We looked over all the details about pets (again).<br>
<br>
For example, in order to make a sweeping change to pet stats someone would have
to change the data for every individual pet (and there are dozens of them). If
something like that were done on purpose it would take a lot of time, it would
never be an accident. If it happened accidentally, it would probably have had to
happen by some sort of software glitch, and would have probably happened to
every NPC. Regardless, we looked at the stats, they are all the same as they
were pre-patch.<br>
<br>
We looked over the code that determines how the pet acts, its attacks and all of
that. It's all just as it was pre-patch. We checked it over, summoned pets and
looked at their stats, how they fought… Nothing has changed.<br>
<br>
But, as of Monday we will be making one small change to something that has
always happened. Some spells could summon pets both under and over 35th level.
Pets 36th level and over are more powerful than those of 35th and under. We
didn't like the idea that pets summoned with one spell would range so greatly in
their power. So we've set it up so that such spells will only summon pets over
35th level. This is, obviously, a small increase in the power of those
particular spells. But I want to stress that this will be completely new as of
Monday. Pets have always had that level range problem. This is one of those
fixes that comes of careful scrutiny of a situation like this. So some good has
come of all this.<br>
<br>
I don't know that there is much more I can say.<br>
<br>
I ask you all to keep in mind that your pets were procing more than they were
before, and that they could proc even on a miss. Keep in mind that your pet
levels can vary greatly with each summon. Pets will have to fight longer without
procing weapons, so they may seem to be more vulnerable…<br>
<br>
We've looked over everything, and we found nothing wrong in the programming.<br>
<br>
I have a few e-mails from mages telling me that they've seen no change with the
exception of the procing (and see the improvement from the auto-dual wield
ability). Please, take a step back and look at your pet again.</font></p>

SBLive Soundcards and Hardware Acceleration<br>
<br>
Due to some past problems with SBLive cards, users of those cards who called
into tech support were asked to turn &quot;Hardware Acceleration&quot; down one
notch in DXDIAG. The last patch corrected those problems and most users should
again increase hardware acceleration to maximum.<br>
<br>
To do this:<br>
<br>
1. Click &quot;Start&quot;<br>
2. Click &quot;Run&quot;<br>
3. Type &quot;DXDIAG.EXE&quot; and press enter.<br>
4. Click on the &quot;Sound&quot; tab.<br>
5. Increase the &quot;Hardware Acceleration&quot; slider to maximum.<br>
<br>
Doing this should correct issues such as not hearing certain sounds or sound
volume disparities.<br>
<br>
The only users who may not want to do this are Windows 2000 users. Creative Labs
is currently working on new drivers for Win2K, so you may wish to wait until
these drivers are completed prior to increasing hardware acceleration.<br>
<br>
Finally, all SBLive users should get LiveWare 3.0 from <a href="http://www.soundblaster.com/liveware/." target="_blank"><b><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF">http://www.soundblaster.com/liveware/</font></span></b></a>.
After installing LiveWare, you will then want to REINSTALL the latest drivers
for your sound card. The order of installation is important.<br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I do recall replying to
AuntieShaynta publicly quite some time ago, stating that it was still our intent
to implement Enchanters enchanting items, but that such plans were still very
much in the planning stages and considered long term.<br>
<br>
And I stand by it -- I still think we'll see that one day (and given our desire
to pretty much freeze class balancing, it will probably be one of the last
significant class enchancements). But hey, never say never :) Consider traps :)<br>
<br>
Also, if I recall correctly, item enchantment was also talked about in earlier
pre-release (probably pre-beta, but I'm not certain) FAQs, but I later had it
removed (along with guildhouses, lycanthropy, vampirism, etc.) It simply was one
of the few features we'd planned on but didn't have time to deliver on.<br>
<br>
It does trouble me a little that even though I try to be clear about whether
something is short term, or long, or something we're only thinking about, etc.
that it often turns into a 'promise' over time... but I guess that's
unavoidable. It's a form of the 'telephone game' quite often, where one person
hears that we said one thing, and then they tell somebody else, and the message
sort of evolves from there :)<br>
<br>
Just to let you all know, there are still a TON of things we want to add to EQ,
and we feel EQ has a very long life ahead of it. For example, although it's too
early to say much, I will say that we've got some VERY big plans post-Velious.<br>
<br>
And Tera, wow... not sure what to say :( I certainly do my best to live up to my
word. Again, though, some times things I talk about as something planned evolve
somehow into 'promises'... And then some things I hopefully characterized as
'long term' are still just that: long term plans that haven't happened yet.<br>
<br>
All things considered I'm very proud of our track record and just how much of
the game we talked about pre-release game into fruition. And I'm also very proud
of where the live and expansion teams have taken the game post-release. IMHO, EQ
is almost everything we'd planned it to be and a whole lot more.<br>

Epic. There was some talk from alan that you might change the cloak from
quillmane. If that is planned than i would like you to hear this suggestion in
how it would drop. Have a new NPC in a mid level zone (that doesn't have a lot
of newbies that would try and ninja the items). Have that NPC ask for the two
quest focus items that wasn't requested in the epic (the torch and the stien).
When you turn these 2 items in it would spawn a high level elemental (like the
one in Burning woods for cleric epic quest) that a 4 to 5 groups could kill with
some trouble. The elemental would drop the cloak used in the Air portin of this
quest.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If there is a change to the cloak
drops, it will probably not be anything nearly that dramatic.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Next concern
in the mage epic is that so far nobody on any server has gotten burning ember
and can prove that they got it. People has been killing every wurm countless
times that are a short jounery from skyfire. Is there any way for you to get
EsterTheTester to go to a live server and let her try and get it. &quot;the
burning embers from a notable member of wurm-kind who can be found a short
journey from here &quot; this is the only clue to burning ember and there are a
lot of notable members of wurm-kind near skyfire. Dirt of underfoot a stealf
enhacement and than a stealf nerf. It was put into the game on the patch before
thanksgiving and it dropped every time when you killed silxen the mighty in BW.
About 5 days later BW was patched by itself and mages thought that it was to fix
the noexesting burning embers but what happened was that the dirt of underfoot
now is a very rare drop.&quot;</font></p>

that it will be moved to an equally difficult opponent. Such a move will
probably not make the item easier to obtain. I've got no estimate for the timing

As most of you probably already know, EverQuest will be featured in TV Guide on
December 9th.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in obtaining a copy but you don't subscribe to the
magazine and you won't be able to get to a store to pick one up (say, for
example, you don't live in the United States), there is a way that you can get a
copy.<br>
<br>
Call 1-800-866-1400 or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:tvg.customer.support@tvguide.com" target="Main"><b><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF">tvg.customer.support@tvguide.com</font></span></b></a><br>
<br>
I've been told that it will cost $2.00 to purchase the issue this way (you will
essentially be ordering a back order copy) and $3.00 to ship it internationally.
But make sure to verify the cost with them when placing your order. They said
that they will accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express,
International Money Order or a check drawn on an American<br>
bank.<br>

Patch Day<br>
<br>
Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems reported
by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other gameplay issues:<br>
<br>
- Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or losing
faction with associates when the primary faction was at its maximum or minimum.
Players will now be able to further modify associate factions in the appropriate
direction.<br>
<br>
- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the pet is a
player character rather than an NPC. The change last patch reduced them to a
rate below player characters. As part of this patch, target-specific random
effects will only work if the target is the intended type. For instance, a
weapon that processes &quot;Dismiss Summoned&quot; will only &quot;go off&quot;
on a summoned NPC instead of everything.<br>
<br>
- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem reported by
people whereas the client would &quot;freeze&quot; for a second or two every few
minutes. For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or driver problems, this
should address the issue.<br>
<br>
- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards. Included in
these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash while carrying it.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and attempting
to get back in.<br>
<br>
- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from the
character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather slow when mip-mapping
is enabled. Most of this problem is due to routines in DX required to release
resources consumed by mip-mapping and may not be addressable until the next
version of DirectX is adopted.<br>
<br>
- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the &quot;NOKEY&quot;
setting instead of the &quot;Backspace&quot;. This means that you can now assign
&quot;Backspace&quot; to a function in game.<br>
<br>
- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be played
&quot;rapid-fire&quot; under some circumstances. There is still a potential for
this to happen with some other sounds that will be addressed in a patch in the
near future.<br>
<br>
- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more difficult
than intended after the server had been up for a while.<br>
<br>
- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have the ability
to dual-wield without being handed weapons. The calculation used to determine
whether or not this ability exists takes several things into account, but for
the most part 39th level and above summons (higher for the Shadowknight) will
have this ability. It is possible that you could get a &quot;good&quot; 34th
level pet that will, or a &quot;bad&quot; 39th level pet that will not have this
ability.<br>
<br>
- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered
parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant. Abandon your mates,
though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's tune.<br>
<br>
- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to their
one-handed blunt skill.<br>
<br>
Remember! Only a few days left until the launch of EverQuest: The Scars of
Velious. Reserve your copy at your local retailer today!<br>

Upon logout (via camping, /quit, or LD...doesn't matter), the server should
store the player name and time in a table in memory. Make the table big enought
to store the last, say, 1000 logouts. Overwrite the oldest one when the table is
full. This will take at most 30-60k of server memory.</font></span>

On login, the server looks up the player in the table from #1. If the player is
not in the table, or if the timestamp on the player's entry is more than, say,
20 minutes ago, destroy all summoned items the player has.</font></span>
