And yes I am referring to Manaburn. So... here is my little pov on some possible alternatives to the use of manaburn.<br><br>1. You can pretty much line it up with a lure base disintigrate, which we have never been able to loot, nor gain experience for. For that reason I feel that ANY person that is killed should not be lootable, and for the same reason - any monster that is SLAIN (the last HP taken by) manaburn should ALSO be unlootable and give no xp (given that is it below level 55 - which conicides with the 30 min loot rule). This way they can still kill people pvp, but the risk of weaing gear vs these clearly destructive foes is balanced a LITTLE. Wizards can still cause considerable losses to an opposing team - but not *sit-afk-2.25-hours-still-burn-pops-burn-someone-score-fungi-playerauction-rinse,repeat*<br><br>2. Disable Manaburn altogether in pvp - ANY wizard with both critical nuke3 and the class +% nuke skill can tell you that they crit a HEAP. Sunstrike - 3260 dmg ? Like that isnt bad enough that they need to include a death touch... And yes they also need to fix the pvp damage of critical nukes, it IS still broken which is rather ridiculous.<br><br>3. Dramatically change the skill all together. some alternatives ?<br>a) Inner Peace - an instant cast harvest type skill that increases mana much like the harvest spell does - with a relatively small recycle time, much like the mend skill for monks. 10 mins sounds about fair on recycle.. maybe 450 mana?<br>b) Spell Evasion - Acts as a &quot;hate-controller&quot;, with a 1min 30 seconds recycle, the next spell cast will result in no addition to your agro. Or alternatively this could have a permanent percentage of &quot;hate-reduction&quot; - 3,5 and 10% doesnt sound unfair.<br>c) Spellburn - with a 72 minture recycle time, the next spell cast will be absolutely free of mana cost and instant casting.<br><br><br>k well its late and I cant think of any more alternatives. Thoughts ? flames ? alternatives ? Feel free.<br> <p>Neckros Dundee"That's not a knife..."</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uwootling.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Woot Ling</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(3/13/02 5:22:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=625.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://users.bigpond.net.au/woot/images/woot4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We all want it nerfed - but what are alternatives ?</span><hr size=1> Manaburn rox on bloobie servers!<br><br>More damage would be nice though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=66789" target="_blank"><B><I>Woot~</B></I></A><BR><IMG SRC="http://users.bigpond.net.au/woot/images/sleeperdt.jpg"></IMG></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#333333>(3/13/02 5:51:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=625.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We all want it nerfed - but what are alternatives ?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> and for the same reason - any monster that is SLAIN (the last HP taken by) manaburn should ALSO be unlootable and give no xp (given that is it below level 55 - which conicides with the 30 min loot rule). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Hi, I just spent a shitload of points on a useless skill.

Some people don't have AA points flying out of their ass, and let me point out that to buy MB, you need to buy MC3 first, and not the (arguably) better line of crit hits. Now, whereas I agree that it would be quite natural for a class specific skill that comes after MC3 to be something that gives you back mana, and not some nuke, that's how things are, and in my case, that's what I have been working to obtain, despite the fact I'd rather be putting my AA points into crit nukes.<br><br>If MB is completely changed (not that I say what you propose is not good, I just say it's not what I want, and it's not what I was advertised for when I started buying the MC line) then I find it quite unfair for people like me who spent their time trying to obtain something that now has disappeared, and who are left with a whooping 3 mana regen per tick for only consolation.<br><br>To close this post, I think that the point is int casters are pretty weak in PvP due to their low HPs, and whatever happens, since in EQ the damage output of _all_ classes never goes down, only up at different speeds, the people with the less HP are always going to be the first to be fucked. When everyone is dishing out ungodly amounts of DPS it's up to whoever can sustain the damage longest. <p>Aurore<HR>~Seekers of Divinity~<BR>Sorceress of <a href=http://www.ralloszek.net>Rallos Zek</a><BR><a href=http://www.progressquest.com><img src=http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~bnguyen/pony.gif></img></a>The Pony with the Pointy Hat.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ubydn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bydn </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(3/13/02 7:41:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=625.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We all want it nerfed - but what are alternatives ?</span><hr size=1> overall i think Neckros has really good points, but as we all know Verant doesn't want to take initiative to actually change manaburn, they could really care less about pvp servers and people losing items like fungi in one hit.<br><br>I think the first option was good, but no wizard wants manaburn to be like disintigrate so they lose exp, maybe they can just make a no loot policy.  <br><br>the third option will never happen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , verant would never change a skill like that, it would take time out of their day, something they don't want to do.<br><br>Bydn Dovairous<br>Suck Mage <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=salloxsawbones>Sallox Sawbones</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 138<br> <font color=#333333>(3/13/02 9:04:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=625.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We all want it nerfed - but what are alternatives ?</span><hr size=1> 39th lvl was the last lvl that classes were even remotely balanced.

And that is the Enchanter with Dire Charm.<br><br>Yes folks, Dire Charm and Manaburn are on the same teir.. Both can result in an instant lootable kill. Hell with manaburn its just 1 click and loot, with Dire charm its charming the player and letting someone else kill ur pet while u back off. <br><br>We already know that Vi doesnt like charm in pvp, nor do they like fear. So by their logic Dire charm will be nerfed to mob only... Where it should be. Also by this same logic, that if a enc has to spend all his points to gain a skill that is MOB only, then the wizard's being nerfed to mob only manaburn is justified.<br><br>There is no class that deserves 1 shot kills. Hell there is no classes other then those 2 that can. Ppl seem to wanna say wizards are weak w/o manaburn, but lemme assue you. If u feel weak w/o manaburn its cuz you lack the skills. There are plenty of wizards that can kill and be deadly w/o manaburn.. Hell max up crit nukes then grt. crit nukes and you have a force to be recked (sp) with. <br><br>I think the top nuke from luclin does 2k dmg, or damn near.. A crit blast from that is gonna STILL drop any class out there unless full raid buffed. Ok, then you have to cast like 1 or 2 lures... <br><br>In short, both skills should be made mob only seeing as thats what they are meant for. It still is a useful skill, as will be dire charm but both should never have been useable against players. It makes the pvp of eq way outta whack. <p><img src="http://www.users.qwest.net/~njcogswell/bigusssig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#333333>(3/13/02 1:56:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=625.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We all want it nerfed - but what are alternatives ?</span><hr size=1> I didn't know dire charm worked on players, what's this? <p>Aurore<HR>~Seekers of Divinity~<BR>Sorceress of <a href=http://www.ralloszek.net>Rallos Zek</a><BR><a href=http://www.progressquest.com><img src=http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~bnguyen/pony.gif></img></a>The Pony with the Pointy Hat.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usighkolifedrainer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sighko Lifedrainer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 249<br> <font color=#333333>(3/13/02 3:07:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=625.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We all want it nerfed - but what are alternatives ?</span><hr size=1> Or if you wanna really be bad, send your Dire Charmed enemy to attack something really nasty and xp kill him...thats what got charm removed from PvP in the first place isnt it?<br><br>Manaburn solution is to remove it completely from pvp.

It's powerful enough in PvE, but it makes pvp stupidly unbalanced (if slightly amusing).<br><br>Manaburn- it's a difficult one and no mistake.  For a start, VI have openly admitted that EQ wasn't designed for a PvP atmosphere.  Not only that, but the majority of their customers don't play on pvp servers, or care about the unique difficulties created by some of the spells/abilities in pvp.<br><br>I don't think that it should be a 'no-loot/no exp' nerf- after all, the sense of risk in losing an item is part of why we all play on rallos isn't it?  As for no exp, that is insulting to wizards who have put a lot of time xping for this ability.  Nor do I think that it should be removed from the pvp environment totally, casters are clearly unbalanced versus melees in terms of damage potential over time.  Melees also see defineable and very practical advancement in their pvp ability through new weapons, spells and AA abilities.  Plus, the amount of hitpoint and balanced resist-gear available significantly decreases a caster's potential in pvp- it is practically impossible for a caster to 'resist' a hefty 2-handed hit or a backstab.  Wizards are possibly worst-off in all this.  Clerics and druids have the opportunity to outheal nukes efficiently, and with a damage-shield plus healing, they can make even a well-geared melee think a bit before they attack.  Mages and necros both have pets, and a good array of spells to back them up, chanters have mezzes and debuffs.  A wizard's only chance of killing a well-geared melee is to nuke quickly, position well and hope for the best on the resists.  <br><br>I do however think, that the way to go about changing the way manaburn works is important to ensure that ganking with a death-touch then gating to a non-pvp area doesn't happen that often.  I concede Auro's point- there aren't that many manaburn wizards now who do use it as a death-touch ganking tool, but this needs to be changed for the future, not the present.  A death-touch of any kind, be it dire charm or manaburn trivializes the experience of pvp...reducing it to clicking a hotkey, then the gate spell, then /afk or /camp until refresh.  <br><br>Just to pre-empt a commonly used argument by several wizards I have spoken to- they all point to Harmtouch and cry foul when people discuss nerfing manaburn.  Well, a couple of points - discipline harm-touch while very powerful, isn't a death-touch.  Secondly, due to an SK's inability to gate, you don't see many (or any in my experience) portal-camping.  Last and most importantly, it requires a fair slice of skill and ability for a shadow-knight to do the required damage putting their victim within range of HT (in an outdoor zone) against a caster who is running around and making use of the terrain &amp; levitation.  The fact that a manaburn wizard can simply hit a hotkey within spell-casting range, /loot, mod-rod and gate to a non-pvp zone makes a lot of people frustrated, understandably so.  So yes, harmtouch is instacast, yes it is powerful, but it doesn't give SKs a death-touch, especially given the skill ceiling required to hit a circle-strafing caster with 200+ ping.  Manaburn requires almost no skill to use, it's a one-click kill most of the time.<br><br>How to fix it then?  Well, my suggestion is to give it the chance of taking off between 70 and 90 percent of a player's TOTAL hps, assuming the wizard starts from full mana.  Lesser percentages if you start from less than full mana.  The wizard's total mana pool determines the exact percentage.  This balances manaburn versus all classes nicely imho.  Remove the possibility of critical blasts in mana burn in pvp ONLY.  This still allows the wizard a chance to save a raid with a crit manaburn for stupid amounts of damage, but doesn't allow them to deprive their pvp opponent of any chance whatsoever.  For all those who might say that this emasculates a wizard's ability to kill an opponent, I agree with Biguss.  A wizard who uses the right nukes, and balances damage potential with his/her mana can kill just fine without manaburn.  Especially if they have an OOR bard muling them speedsong (/hugs Voltaic).  Bear in mind that you can still lure + sunstrike + manaburn and score a kill.  And let's not forget the abuses easily introduced if you add a mod rod/MR2 and a conflag wand or two to the mix.  <br><br>For such a powerful ability there should also be hefty penalties (both PvE and PvP imho).  Current restrictions of going oom and refresh time should be kept, but here are some examples of what could be done to add an element of risk to using manaburn (there is very little now).  After casting manaburn the caster should be *stunned* for 7-10 seconds.  This is to prevent he/she from mod-rod'ing and gating to bazaar or drinking an instagate potion right after casting what still amounts to a virtual death-touch.  It also hands the advantage clearly to the player fighting the wizard.  EQ is about risk versus reward...if the wizard wants to take the risk of being stunned for up to 10 seconds within casting range of a melee with a mean 2H, or giving a caster time to pet up/waste them, chances are the wizard will think twice about using manaburn as their *only* weapon.  Not only that, but it could be easily and gently introduced in PR terms, Verant simply stating that 'the vast release of magical energies has serious short-term consequences to one who uses it, etc, etc.&quot;  This change would also makes the manaburn ability more of a last resort, which is how it was intended PvE, and what these changes would try to achieve pvp-wise.  This still makes the wizard a fearsome pvp class solo...with another manaburn wizard added in however, you would just have to throw up your hands and eat the death.  Still, it would be a step in the right direction imho- sticking with current 'limitations' is a road to disaster and frustration for those ganked by its raw power.  <br><br>Just my 2cp.<br><br> <p>Taranna Dhossarim57 Cleric, Seekers of Divinity</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usomthor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>somthor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#333333>(3/14/02 12:04:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=625.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.iofthestorm.org/images/EQicon.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Regardng Dire charm</span><hr size=1> let them keep the skill but then give Melees a inate resistance such that it about negates it<br><br>so as a 60th warrior getting manaburned would reduce my curent hitpoins by 50% if unresisted and less if resisted<br><br>if im fully buffed thats a 2500 dd which isnt bad<br><br>in general i think that pure mele should have a much higher resitance to majic anyhow<br><br>right now it jsut seems tash me and im doomed <p>Orchid and Cascia are my personal Goddess but I'll share.....
