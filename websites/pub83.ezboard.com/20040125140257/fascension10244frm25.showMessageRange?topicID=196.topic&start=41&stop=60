<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There you have it folks. France doesn't need to pretend that it wants to develop a cash for oil deal with Saddaem. Money that Saddaem could easliy buy guns, tanks, missles, and tyranny with. Didn't you mention something earlier about containment and sanctions? Ohh my bad. Didn't know the same rules didn't apply when France get a big phat billion dollar check.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You're not too bright are you lurker?  Saddam doesn't need more money from the French- money was never the problem, he's rolling in it.  275 million dollars of American credit he received one year before the Gulf War goes an awful long way.  Money isn't an issue for domestic weapons programmes anyway, he has no need of it- as the supreme figurehead of a command economy he simply comandeers all the resources he needs, when he needs them.  Labour is awfully cheap in Iraq too, especially if the labourers have families and your name is Saddam Hussein.  To understand the French position- look at the way the Clinton administration approached China- not with gunboat diplomacy, but with trade and aid packages.  As a result of that, China is a far more democratic country, has opened up trade significantly and is well on the way to liberalizing fully.  The Soviet Union didn't switch systems under the threat of force, but through the incentives of trade and aid.  The French favour a similar policy with Iraq- China and the Soviet Union were arguably far more brutal regimes, but success of this approach there is likely to produce results here too.  That is the French hope- and I wish them every success in pursuit of that policy.<br>
<br>
  The issue isn't money at all anyway- but resources and production capability- both of which were irreversibly crippled if not utterly destroyed in the last inspection regime.  Scott Ritter, former US member of the UNSCOM inspection team under the last regime had <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views/030700-106.htm" target="top">this</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> to say about the state of Iraq's WMD programme- that was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>two years</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> before the current regime of inspections even started- after 10 years of the so-called &quot;12 years not disarming&quot; a key US member of that team says he's disarmed!  Whaddaya know...<br>
<br>
In addition, only a complete thicko would fail to see the obvious- that Saddam's is not a suicidal regime- and even assuming he had useable weapons of mass destruction + a delivery system (by no means proven)- <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>he would never use them</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Almost a hundred nukes within range of your entire country on British and American warships would deter anyone quite frankly.  The Soviet Union and the United States, both superpowers with vast nuclear arsenals deterred each other for the best part of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>half a century</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> without the principle protagonists firing a shot at each other in anger.  Are you seriously telling me that the US, a superpower can't deter a militarily backward nation crippled by 12 years of sanctions?  Think about it.<br>
<br>
Try and see past your own agenda-driven media painting French policy as Machiavellian lurker.  Their position is the most likely to disarm Iraq both from an effectiveness and a moral standpoint.  95% of Iraq's weapons programme was destroyed by inspectors- not bombs, not unilateral intelligence, not special forces, not by a war.  After 12 years of intelligence operations, air strikes, the Gulf war- the most effective means of disarming Saddam has been the inspectors- not these other means.  Inspections have worked, their techniques have improved, and they will work again given the time.  And there's no rush as I said, Saddam isn't going anywhere.<br>
<br>
A brief word on your sources regarding historical occurence.  Quoting Howard Stern (now there's a respected politically conscious public figure if ever I saw one)... is a joke.  Quoting that right-wing Zionist site that blatantly <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>lied</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> about who attacked who first in 1967...is a joke.  That kinda destroys the credibility of any other information you've posted which comes from that site.  In fact I note <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> your information about Israel comes from a self-avowed pro-Israeli site.  Whoever wrote that piece on the Six-Day War lied cynically to mislead the opinion of the person who read it.  If such a person or persons are willing to lie once like that in their cause, I have no doubt that they'd be capable of the same again.  Try an unbiased or respectable source to support your key arguments lurker- the truth really does set you free.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I don't deny the US backed Iraq in the Iraq/Iran conflict. I don't deny the US probably trained terrorists in the Soviet vs Afghanistan conflict. I don't deny the US has a very shady history when dealing in the affairs of the Middle East.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If your going to hold America accountable for every nasty thing it did, look to Europe first<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The striking differences are two-fold-  firstly, European imperialism, while very nasty in the 17th through 19th centuries- did not shape the 20th century.  Our parents and grandparents did not live in the world of European imperialism- but they did live in the 20th century.  Thus, the actions of major powers in the 20th century is of significantly more relevance to the way in which the world shapes itself today.  This is blatantly obvious, it's a shame you ignore it cynically to further a vindictive snipe at a position you disagree with.<br>
<br>
The second major difference is that European governments have by and large learned their lesson- and drawn lessons from history.  Aggression and regime change hasn't entered the field of European foreign policy since the end of the second world war- with two notable exceptions, both which had disastrous effects- Eden and Suez in 1956, and De Gaulle and Algeria in 1961.  But again, the lessons were learned and policy moved on.  US policy never moved on- save for a blip in the 1970s with Jimmy Carter who engaged Anwar Sadat and signed the Camp David agreement.  Throughout the post-war era, from McCarthyism to the Vietnam War, to Pinochet &amp; the Shah of Iran in the 1970s, to Iran Contra in the 1980s- US policy has repeated the same mistakes over and over and over again.<br>
<br>
Well, what's wrong with drawing lessons from history may I ask?  It clearly would save time, money, effort, and above all human life.  The following example is somewhat bare to the bones and light on specific details, but the underlying principle is one I believe is sound, so please bear with me.<br>
<br>
  Consider the history of the Suez crisis of 1956 and the political aims surrounding that badly thought-out policy following Nasser's nationalization of the canal.  Churchill during the second world war had brought Britain out of the era of colonial rule into a self-sufficient capable state, a superpower in its own right, a permanent member of the Security Council.  Anthony Eden's disastrous attempt to capture the Suez canal ultimately resulted in Britain being dismissed as an imperial power, and effectively sidelined politically for almost 3 decades in the international community.  It wasnt' until Thatcher's second term that we were able to effectively take the world stage without being ignored and denied cooperation on key issues because of such a fundamental mistake of more than 30 years ago.<br>
<br>
Consider the recent history of US foreign policy and compare it- Clinton brings the US out of an era of regime change, support for dictators and cynical exploitation of other nations for national interest.  The Middle East peace process was never closer to finalization than when two Presidents who believed in the diplomatic process (Carter and Clinton) helped forge respectively- the Camp David Agreement and the Oslo agreement.  Hasty military action, regime change and short-sighted policies akin to these were scrapped in favour of a diplomatic approach of engagement.  The Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland, resolution of crises in the Balkans, constructive engagement of China and North Korea, positive commitment to international treaties on the environmental, disarmament, landmines and a comprehensive conditional aid programme for Africa including debt write-offs.  <br>
<br>
All these policies yielded a greater feeling of security and stablility for the regions concerned and the international community as a whole.  All those policies have been scrapped by the Bush administration.  Regime change is back in the agenda, coupled with pre-emption, a dangerous cocktail that is in danger of isolating US policy even more severely than what happened to Great Britain after Suez.  It is a foreign policy package that will play directly into the hands of terrorists, swell their ranks and strengthen their resolve- it makes the world a more dangerous place than it is now.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The point is, the US does what it has to do to keep America safe.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What it did prior to 11/9 with all due respect, did <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> keep America safe, it made America a target.  Aggressive policies that alienated the Palestinians, propped up the Saudi regime, pursued a hard line towards an Iran already crippled by the effects of a US-sponsored regime change and an Iraq crippled by sanctions.  That coupled with the blatant double standards of foreign policy in the region did not keep America safe lurker.  If it had- then 3,000+ innocent civilians wouldn't have paid with their lives in that brutal and uncivilized massacre.  <br>
<br>
The idea that you can catch or eliminate terrorists willing to sacrifice their own lives with force is a myth quite frankly.  Terrorists cannot be deterred the way Saddam Hussein and North Korea can.  The Israelis are certainly the very best in the world in terms of dealing with suicide bombers and state security in general- and even with aggressive inhuman policy in Palestinian areas they are unable to prevent these attacks.  In 700 years, British governments were unable to guarantee peace on their own soil by engaging the Irish republican movement with force- and that was dealing with terrorists unwilling to throw away their lives.  Ultimately it was by power-sharing and diplomatic compromise that the situation has been resolved- again, draw lessons from history.  <br>
<br>
Everything we know about this indicates that the only sane way to resolve terrorism is to address the fundamental injustices that drive people to strap bombs to their chests.  It isn't even an issue of religion by the way- Palestinians, whether Christian, Shia, Shi'ite or Ba'hai have all blown themselves up in Israeli civilian centers.  Yes it is distasteful to seemingly reward terrorism with a chance at diplomacy- but it's the only proven way to halt a cycle of violence.  There is always a price to be paid for peace- better that the price is a moral one than the lives of soldiers and civilians over decades.  <br>
<br>
To me, it takes greater courage <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to go to war, greater courage to be the first of the two dissatisfied parties to be willing to put violence to one side and start talking.  That is the sort of courage that is needed to secure a safe future for the children of the Middle East, and indeed our own children.  I fully accept that I am in a minority in thinking this- we are a fundamentally violent species, at times seemingly violent against all reason.  Yet if you are in a minority of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>one</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->- the truth is still the truth.  History is littered with nations that freed themselves of oppression with violence- only in two were freedom achieved with peace.  Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela never picked up a weapon, but they fought with greater courage and conviction than any soldier I've ever seen.  Let's see that courage from our leaders in their approach, and we will see a peaceful resolution to this crisis, in time to the Middle-East peace process- and eventually to terrorism itself. <p>Taranna Dhossarim<br>

Your're not too bright are you Taranna?  Or are you so old and prejudiced with blinders that if the offending message comes from someone you don't like, then they must be wrong.  I backed what howard stern stern said with creditable sources.  Do you deny what he mentioned as false?<br>
<br>
Your CNN link also supposed what the pro-israeli website said as well. But let me repeat for the blind and deaf impaired, the pro-israeli website I'm quoting ADMITS it attacked first in 1967.  Here is the direct quote from the stie again: <br>
<br>
The Six Day War of 1967<br>
On June 5th, Israel decided to launch a pre-emptive attack on Egypt. Israel issued an appeal to Jordan to stay out of the war. Jordan refused and opened a heavy artillery barrage on both west Jerusalem and the Tel-Aviv area which forced Israel to counterattack. By June 8th the Israel Defence Forces defeated the Jordanian forces and captured the whole of Judea and Samaria. On the morning of June 9th, Israel attacked the Syrians on the Golan Heights. <br>
<br>
And quoting again from the CNN link that Taranna posted himself:<br>
&quot;In June 1967, Egypt, Syria and Jordan massed their troops on Israel's borders in preparation for an all-out attack. Israel launched a pre-emptive strike on June 5, targeting Arab air fields and destroying the Egyptian air force on the ground.&quot;<br>
<br>
There is NO DISPUTING that Israel attacked first in 1967.  But do you deny your own source that the Middle East was about to attack Israel in 1967?  <br>
<br>
What about the FACT that the Middle East countries attacked Israel first in 1948 and 1973.  Or did you conveniently forget that ever happened?  Your harping on 1967 when I readily concede your points really discredits your objectivity and makes you look like a complete thicko, jacko.  It's like the little yellow chicken who kept saying, &quot;the sky is falling, the sky is falling&quot;  Ok already.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote from Taranna:<br>
Saddam doesn't need more money from the French- money was never the problem, he's rolling in it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
Every terror regime and legit country needs money.  Money to pay the workers, money to feed the troops, money for buying items on the black market, money for financing terror operations, money for bribing or influencing other countries like France and russia, money for any transaction that might be filtered to that swiss bank account.  Don't be so naive to think billions is chump change.  Even that slave worker in Iraq needs money to be spent on him for food, drink, and rags.<br>
<br>
As for the Taranna article by Scott Ritter, Scott Ritter also said the following, which Taranna failed to mention:<br>
<br>
&quot;There were some areas [of wmd] that we didn't have full accounting for. And this is what plagued UNSCOM. Security Council 687 is an absolute resolution. It requires that Iraq be disarmed 100 percent.&quot;<br>
<br>
also<br>
<br>
&quot;What was Iraq hiding? Documentation primarily - documents that would enable them to reconstitute - at a future date - weapons of mass destruction capability....But all of this is useless...unless Iraq has access to the tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars required to rebuild the industrial infrastructure (necessary) to build these weapons.&quot;<br>
<br>
OMG, let's connect the dots folks.  Iraq still has some unaccounted WMD.  Iraq is required by the UN to be 100% disarmed, not 75%, not 90%.  Iraq has the knowledge to build more WMD.  France would willingly give money to Saddem in exchange for oil. Even if France doesn't give Saddem money, Saddem can still rebuild his own plants and mobile chemical flatbed trucks that are hidden in the desert in the years since the UN inspectors were kicked.<br>
<br>
Knowledge is power, let's not forget that.  You can rebuild whatever has been destroyed with time, power, money, and knowledge.  And I don't want Scott Ritter's OPINION.  I want the facts.  Saddem has no right nor position of power to play games and ask for sanctions to be lifted when he's not in full compliance. Saddem you desert rat arse bastard, you comply with the UN and it's demands or we'll see you on the battlefield.  And we'll see about those sanctions when we're ready.<br>

<br>
Thought about it...and I'm scared if Saddem gets WMD.  Would he attack the US?  Probably not.  But he might use that nuke on Israel or any other surrounding country he can't get his way with.  That folks, is a powder keg waiting to explode.  Let's admit here please that the Middle East could care less if Iraq destroyed Israel.  If Saddaem attacked Kuwaitt, he sure as hell would attack Israel AGAIN if he has the time, weapons, and opportunity.  The US won't stand idle if Israel gets thumped.  As I'm sure France, Turkey, Saudi, etc etc, will all jump into the fray.  And Saddem is just the type of person who might start a mess like WWIII.  Think about it.<br>

I find it amusing you actually think the 18-19 century did not shape the 20th century.  Your narrow tunnel vision of a 100 years needs expanding.  <br>
<br>
The distrust and problems between Islam and Christianity take place before the 20th century.  The colonial rule and oppression by Europeans on the world takes place before the 20th century and influences how these former countries view the West.  Culture, values, music, beliefs, diplomacy, lessons, all these things evolved before the 20th century.  It really is a shameful shortsighted élitist attitude to think that past actions of a country from a century before are not remembered by the former oppressed population of today, and hence are of no consequence.<br>
<br>
You know why Israel was created.  Supposedly a safe haven from the constant anti-Semitism directed towards them from the world throughout history.  <br>

If things can be resolved peacefully, I'm all for it.  But if the terrorists your talking to don't want to talk, don't want to compromise, hold unrealistic expectations on powersharing, then nothing can be done.   <br>

Saddem has the terms laid out in front of him.  Fully comply now.  Don't demand concessions, don't play games, uncover your hidden chemical trucks and factories, expose your knowledge of WMD and be done with it.<br>

Posting under an alias destroys your credibility- it essentially says you're unwilling to stand behind your identity.  That doesn't make your arguments any less absurd than they already are, I mean could could it? :P  It'd still be nice to shred that shroud of cowardice and tell us all who you really are.  On to the arguments:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I backed what howard stern stern said with creditable sources. Do you deny what he mentioned as false?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yes, categorically.  I see no reason for a grain of truth in any of his remarks- his purpose is to say what will make him popular and gain him listeners- his agenda has no accord with the truth or integrity, merely money.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is NO DISPUTING that Israel attacked first in 1967. But do you deny your own source that the Middle East was about to attack Israel in 1967? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You're missing the point here I feel- for a start- the source you quote is biased beyond belief, you admit this.  It has a vested interest in painting a good picture of Israel- such a source can hardly be credible in its presentation of the facts.<br>
<br>
The other point you seem to miss is that whether those forces attacked Israel or the other way around- Israel would have won.  Their forces were better prepared, trained and outfitted (primarily through US funds and military equipment).  The issue I'm pointing out is that Israel's response was neither proportional nor legal.  Consider the Indo-Pakistan conflicts- India saw off the threat of a Pakistani invasion- occupied a third of Pakistan- and then <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>withdrew</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Why did they do this, a warmonger like yourself might ask?  They were the sole nuclear power on the subcontinent, they'd subjected the Pakistani army to a total and humiliating defeat, the land and resources were there for the taking.  <br>
<br>
The answer is simple- if you infringe on another nation's sovreignity, violate the UN charter and fly in the face of the very idea that a nation's identity and land are sarcosanct- then you risk completly undermining the international order.  It's the same reason Britain didn't decide to invade and occupy Argentinian soil during the Falklands war- it would be neither moral, nor politically acceptable to the international community for such a barbaric and imperialist response to have been initiated.  Israel is illegally occupying land lurker- you can spin that any way you want- but them's the facts.  The Golan heights belong to Syria- point me to a single point of law that says otherwise.  The West Bank belongs to Jordan- show me a single treaty or point of law that says otherwise.  The same is true of the Gaza strip belonging to Egypt.  Israel has absolutely no right from any civilized viewpoint to still hold onto these lands.<br>
<br>
You may paint the surrounding nations as aggressors- but you're clearly living in the past there- wake up and smell the coffee.  Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> accept Israel's right to nationhood currently- that is their stated diplomatic position.  Granted, that wasn't the case 40 odd years ago- but rather a lot's changed since then wouldn't you say? :P  Given that their position no longer threatens Israel in any way militarily, give me one good reason why they shouldn't return the land they are occupying illegally.  Even better- show me <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>proof</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not a biased position- PROOF- that there is a legal or moral case for keeping these other nations' lands.  And before you ask- no, &quot;Finders keepers ha-ha&quot;- and &quot;I get 2 k33p ur fat l3wtz y0&quot; are not acceptable as points of law.  We've rather moved on since the Middle Ages, fascinating isn't it.  Well, some of us have anyway :P<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Every terror regime and legit country needs money. Money to pay the workers, money to feed the troops<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Heh, Iraq is in complete trade isolation, there is no ERM, no connection with world markets- it has to function as an internalized economy in a fishbowl pretty much.  If Saddam wanted to he could just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>print</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> more money.  There is no need to pay these workers in little slips of paper- very often brutal intimidation, threats against their families, and promises of substantial gifts and incentives (houses, other intangible resource structures) ensures loyalty far more effectively.  You seem to think Iraqis are actually paid, spend in consumer terms or function as any free market economy would.  Have you ever visited the planet Earth by any chance?<br>
<br>
As for what use money would be - you obviously aren't aware that Iraq's been under strict and heavy-handed sanctions for the best part of over a decade.  They are prohibited from buying <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->- that is the severity of the sanctions imposed- that includes any dual-use technology or any precursors for WMD or anything that assists in those technologies.  The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>only</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> kind of export any nation is permitted with Iraq is food and medicine in exchange for oil.  The US has been the biggest exploiter of this scheme- as has been pointed out, it's far cheaper to commandeer or barter cheaply for oil than it is to buy it legitimately.  <br>
<br>
Even if Saddam had an endless supply of monies- it's all rather pointless if he can't even buy a toothbrush with it.  Containment is working lurker- he's being contained and being deterred just in case.  If containment isn't working- where is the evidence that it isn't?  If he's &quot;giving succour to terrorist groups and arming them&quot;- where's the proof?  I haven't seen a shred of it, just spurious claims founded on suspicion.  Innocent until proven guilty, evidence before action- those are fundamental principles of any  democractic system.  If in defending democracy you callously abandon those principles- then, putting it bluntly what's the point of being a democracy?  No person living in a free democratic society should be expected to prove their innocence- burden of proof always rests with the prosecution in any fair or judicial process.  Even if you're dealing with a hardened criminal who has certainly committed these crimes in the past- the burden of proof <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> rests with the prosecution and evidence regarding those past offences is inadmissible (at least in this country).  <br>
<br>
If these principles can be callously thrown aside in international affairs- how sure are you as an American that they won't be thrown aside on more important domestic issues?  Some might say this is already happening with the cynical exploitation of Guantanomo bay, and detention without a charge or legal advice currently signed into US law to hold &quot;suspected terrorists&quot;.  But going that extra step further, crossing the threshold of abandoning key principles of democratic justice has consequences- mainly that democracy has no meaning if you're willing to sacrifice its very heart and soul in its defence.  Aren't you afraid of that consequence?  <br>
<br>
What if the justice system in your country could arrest, convict and sentence you without a case having to be made?  What if that arrest, conviction and sentence were carried out based on suspicion- rather than proof beyond a shadow of a doubt?  That is what advocates of this war stand for- whether they know it or not- they stand for a system which only requires suspicion and impatience to declare war.  No case has been made, no threat has been established, no plan has been constituted for rehabilitation.  I would genuinely fear to live in a nation that upheld those principles in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>any</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> arena of policy.  And that is the state of affairs regarding Iraq- they are being asked to prove a negative, and the governments in favour of war haven't provided a single scrap of irrefutable evidence either that:<br>
<br>
1) The weapons exist, and in a useable condition<br>
<br>
or 2)  That such alleged weapons are being passed to &quot;terrorist groups&quot;<br>
<br>
and 3) That inspectors and experts on the ground feel that peaceful disarmament is no longer a reasonable option<br>
<br>
If any of these are manifested or proved beyond reasonable doubt, then you will find none more strongly in support of military action than myself.  Given that there is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>no</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> case beyond reasonable doubt and there is no proven threat and inspectors still feel they can do their job- why military action now?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>OMG, let's connect the dots folks. Iraq still has some unaccounted WMD. Iraq is required by the UN to be 100% disarmed, not 75%, not 90%. Iraq has the knowledge to build more WMD<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's like saying if the potential exists then it must be true.  Farcical argument- show me its proof, identify the veracity of such claims and I'll believe it.  Not before then.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Thought about it...and I'm scared if Saddem gets WMD. Would he attack the US? Probably not. But he might use that nuke on Israel or any other surrounding country he can't get his way with. That folks, is a powder keg waiting to explode. Let's admit here please that the Middle East could care less if Iraq destroyed Israel. If Saddaem attacked Kuwaitt, he sure as hell would attack Israel AGAIN if he has the time, weapons, and opportunity. The US won't stand idle if Israel gets thumped. As I'm sure France, Turkey, Saudi, etc etc, will all jump into the fray. And Saddem is just the type of person who might start a mess like WWIII. Think about it.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have thought about it, and it's bollocks.  Israel's own defence minister was quoted less than a month ago on a BBC Radio 1 interview saying that &quot;Iraq did not pose a substantial or imminent threat to the state of Israel- if they indeed posess materials necessary for weapons of mass destruction, in our evaluation these are not in a useable state to threaten the Israeli people&quot;  So- if the political head of Israel's defence forces don't think these alleged weapons are a significant or imminent threat- why does George Dubyah think they are?  Could it be *shock horror* that it's because it's not WMD he cares about especially, but regime change?  Noooooooo, surely not!  I mean, it was only a week after 11/9 that he announced that regime change in Iraq by force of arms was a &quot;desireable and achievable policy&quot;.  The more I hear, the less I'm convinced that WMD are even in the top 10 reasons the Bush administration marches inexorably towards war.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I find it amusing you actually think the 18-19 century did not shape the 20th century<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well that's because it didn't quite frankly- two world wars shaped the 20th Century- if imperialist dogma had shaped it we'd be living in a very different world.  Show me a single expert opinion that doesn't believe the world you and I live in today was shaped almost entirely by those two wars + the Cold War in geopolitical terms.  Those three wars- two hot and one cold fundamentally changed the entire cultural standpoint of Europe in *every* event.  Your spurious and farcical unproven or backed up claim that culture and political standpoints are influenced in any significant way by the happenings of 200 years ago is completely absurd.  In a nutshell:  prove it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If things can be resolved peacefully, I'm all for it. But if the terrorists your talking to don't want to talk, don't want to compromise, hold unrealistic expectations on powersharing, then nothing can be done.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well no- defeatism dogma like that would really mean that nothing could be done.  But, and here's the funny thing- <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>it has been before</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  If you don't believe talking will work- then what's your alternative?  Read peoples' minds to discover who the terrorists are before they blow themselves up?  Remember- these terrorist groups aren't an elective government, they are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a mandate of the masses.  You've constantly harped on about the Middle East being a huge swell of one-minded opinion- yet you've provided no proof of this. <br>
<br>
 Most of the people I spoke to when I was there desperately <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hate</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Hamas, and loathe what is being done in their name.  They also incidentally, hate their homes bulldozed and tankshells fired into residential areas- and the actions of a few extremists being forced on to the many innocents by Israeli government reprisals.  Israel on the other hand <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a government, it has the responsibility to act like one.  The current Israeli administration is acting on exactly the same level as the terrorists in terms of responding to senseless violence against civilians with...senseless violence against civilians!  I'm not taking sides on this either btw- Arafat's as shady as they come, and threw away the last best chance he had at a diplomatic solution.  <br>
<br>
To be quite frank, I trust neither of the principle protagonists in this- Sharon the Butcher of Sabra &amp; Chatila or Arafat the cynical ex-PLO man I have equal contempt for.  The problem is that your government and mine are overwhelmingly supporting Israel on this- our governments like it or not lurker <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>are</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> taking sides- that is NO way for an impartial arbiter of the conflict to behave.  And they're doing it with blatant double standards.  If Israel bulldozes innocent civilians' homes, then they're defending themselves from aggression- same for the Russians shooting innocents in Chechnya.  If on the other hand Saddam bombs the Kurds (who've over-run the northern third of his country and are a clear threat to his government)- it's an unbelievable human rights violation and our governments are suddenly appalled.  You tell me now lurker, man to man- is that either fair or consistent?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Saddem has the terms laid out in front of him. Fully comply now.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Iraq is a sovreign nation with charter rights and national interests- as are the US and Britain.  Your quoting the Bush administration's position on this is as irrelevant as if I were to quote the Iraqi position- they're both lying through their front teeth.  The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>only</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> impartial observers in this are the UN civil authorities- and especially the inspectors.  If they see a reason for inspections to continue, if they believe that inspections can produce results- THEY are the ones we should all be listening to.  They have absolutely 0 vested interest in either side of the position, and if they feel disarmament can be achieved via inspections with the level of cooperation they're currently receiving- then <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>why go to war?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Based on the current facts, there is no reason to go to war.  &quot;Time is running out,&quot; say Bush and Blair- well why?  What's the almighty rush?  You've refuted a lot of my arguments lurker- but you've ignored the crucial points.  IE- where is the threat, and where is the rush?  Why isn't containment working?  If you can't answer those questions and come up with clear-cut proof, then there is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>no</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> case for war- none whatsoever.  I am not a pacifist, I am not against the judicial use of force.  That option isn't going anywhere, Saddam isn't going anywhere- there is not hourglass with sand running out, there is no pressing need for action.  If the criteria above are met- then I fully support the use of force, because at that stage all other practical alternatives (short of capitulation regime support a la Reagan) would have been exhausted.<br>
<br>
You can call me names lurker, you can spring little low-brow witticisms, you can even rely on biased sources for &quot;proof&quot; and suspicion as hard evidence for war.  But you can't dispute the key arguments, because there is no proof that supports you.  In fact, beyond your own bigoted convictions about the &quot;Middle East&quot;, there isn't a leg to stand on.  <br>

I finally decided to throw in a few points.<br>
A few side notes first.<br>
<br>
Side note 1:No fly zones<br>
They were not created by UN resolution. It is a bit rich to complain about iraq targetting or even shooting down planes in the no fly zone when those self same planes have been bombing targets in the no fly zone for the last 10 years. To draw a simplistic eq analogy - your guild has been pking me for 10 years and you complain when i finally pk one our your guys back?<br>
<br>
Side note 2: 1967 and 6 day war<br>
Israel carried out a pre-emptive act of self defence which was 100% legal as they were under imminent danger of attack from surrounding states (the surrounding arab states in 1967, 6 day war as israel did a fantastic job of defeating its foes in 6 days).  Pre-emptive as in, they attacked first, but only because they knew the other side was about to attack them. Eq analogy 2: the pker comes up and starts inspecting your gear, you attack before he mana burns you.<br>
<br>
Side note 3: West Bank / Palestine ownership<br>
The west bank / Palestine / Judea and samaria / Occupied Territories / Administered territories, call it what you will, are not owned by Jordan. there was what was called a  &quot;sovereignty vaccum&quot; in the west bank in 1967. Israel occupied them as part of a legitimate war of self defence. In my view the legitimacy of that occupation has long ended and Israel turned legitimate war time occupation into illegitimate annexation and colonisation. The west bank belongs to the palestinian people themwelves in exercise of their legal right to self determination.<br>
<br>
Main point - is an attack on Iraq justified?<br>
My gut reaction is no. And i can give you plenty of instinctual reasons why i say no:<br>
1. i don't like hypocrisy. Meaning saying one thing and doing another. Meaning propping up or supporting morally suspect regimes throughout the world but acting against them in one place.<br>
2. i dislike being told not to think. I don't like the mass media subservience to official government lines. I don't like being told that if i am not &quot;with&quot; the west, then i am &quot;against&quot; the west. I don't like propaganda spewed out from official sources.<br>
3. I don't like the demonisation of a people or of a religion, of the iraqis or of muslims, or of arabs in general.<br>
4. i dislike american imperialism gone wild, only this time with popular support. America has covertly and overtly intereferred in the fate of countries all over the world for years, oblivious to the rights of those concerned and all with the purpose of advancing america interests. The difference this time is that those who object are practically labelled &quot;terrorist sympathisers&quot; or supporters of despots like saddam hussein.<br>
<br>
Like i said, these are gut reactions and could be informed by inborn prejudices. I would like to cast them away and argue purely on the question at hand, which is, is it correct to invade iraq?<br>
There are 3 reasons advanced:<br>
<br>
1. He has links to al quaida, or other terrorist networks.<br>
The al quaide links are spurious at best. The actual hijackers came mainly from saudi arabia.  Upon being questioned, the best that Jack Straw, the British Home Secretary could say was that iraq provided an environment in which terrorists could thrive. That could be said about the UK providing a home for arab terrorists, the Republic of Ireland providing a home for Irish terrorists, the USA providing a home for south american terrorists, pakistan providing a home for kashmiri terrorists, southern india providing a home for sri lankan terrorists, the list goes on. A suspicion of this nature is no grounds for a war.<br>

2.  He has WMD and is prepared to use them.<br>
If i am honest enough with myself, i would have to say he probably does still have them. In addition, he has used them on his own civilian population in northern iraq in teh 1980s. No amount of anti war rhetoric will change this. He has also demonstrated a capacity for belligerence in invading kuwait. If i criticise the current nuclear powers for having nuclear weapons, then i must also criticise Irqa for having chemical ones and tyring to develop nuclear ones.<br>
Does this justify a war on iraq? Possibly yes. If these weapons are being loaded up now and being prepared to be fired at another country, then yes, step in and act in pre-emptive self defence. It would be fooolish to wait until the missile is in your own airspace before launching your own attack.<br>
However, this should be a last resort. There is no evidence that missiles are in the process of being fired over to neighbouring states. Neighbourign states are more likely to be against the war. Turkey (who it was claimed the US needed to defend) has actually refused permision for US troops to land there and base an attack from it. Even saudi arabia is expressing disquiet about being used as an airstrip for the western powers.  If the inspection and destruction programme is producing results, then it needs to be allowed to continue.  Far better a long drawn out inspection process with plenty of diplomatic fighting and debate going on than a war killing thousands of iraqis followed by an occupation of their country.<br>
<br>
3 Saddam is a bad man leading an oppressive regime.<br>
Yes, he is, and it is. Do we really need to start pointing the finger at other bad men in charge, and other oppressive regimes? Not liking someone, or them being &quot;bad&quot; is no reason in international law to justify an invasion. If it were, there would be constant warfare in the world. The UN charter doesn't accept it as a reason for war.<br>
<br>
Taranna has much more eloquently than me put forward the case for no war in the present climate. Even if i wanted to counter what he says, i would find it difficult. I am posting here to say that no, its not just one crazy brit with stupid ideas, there are lots of people all over the world with reasoned and principled objections to this war. <p>Bollix Braker <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Warlord <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Officer <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Celestial Empire <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

Im euro. I agree with a lot of what Tar says. I think the US is crossing a line with their Iraq policy, plus its the US' fault to begin with.<br>
<br>
My knowledge of the whole thing is relatively limited. But, I do think for invasion of Iraq there needs to be proof of some kind. Since there is none... well I dont think I need to finish my sentence here. Let Bush proof his right first.

You're shitting me right?  Ally (Brits &amp; US) jets patrol the no fly zone.  They DO NOT fire unless Iraq shows an act of aggression...ie a SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) site targeting &amp; locking on them.<br>
