<br>
How many times do I have to say this ... the problem is FUNCOM. I have been calling out FUNCOM on this. The company, as so many barely-literate Official Forum dwellers say, that &quot;puts the FU in Fun.&quot; Remember them? </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Certainly do, but due to your ‘wanabe LTM style’you come across as a pretentious whiny prick, not saying you are, but that’s how you came across, you were *wrong* you accused Funcom of favoring one site and used an example of two screenshots posted on our page and claimed they were ‘exclusive’ NEWSFLASH DUMBASS every *active* page got it, you did not because you were not on their list for whatever reason. The assumptions you made and the accusations regardless who they were directed at were not at all correct, your posts ever since have completely avoided the issues, and this was the exact reason I singled it out and gave it the attention I did, you made a tit of yourself, we all laughed, get over it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   I'm telling you this as one human being to another. Step away from the box, Sion. Breathe. Go outside. Breathe some more. Think, for a few minutes. Question you're role in this. Think about what you are saying here and what you've said in the last 3 days on this issue. Maybe you won't get it, I dunno. But if you don't I would seriously be questioning your reading comprehension skills, at best, or what in the hell put such an almighty large chip on your shoulder that you simply cannot admit when you're wrong</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Hello? Earth to whoever this crackpot is, you were wrong, what you were right about is not being in some mail list that gets mailed once in a blue moon, but your whole lashing thrashing feet stomping display was based around something you were actually wrong about.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I never asked for your help, I never noticed that I required it before and I don't see what exactly you could possibly provide me that I can't get on my own. Did I need you to contact Cz for me and get me on some distribution list? No. Do I appreciate it? Obviously, why wouldn't I? But I'm fucking furious over it. Why? Because I should have already been on it, because we're a website trying to get news to the community paying them and we've asked for it 100 fucking times. This has nothing to do with you, and you really need to comprehend that. If for nothing else than for yourself, man, because this is downright ridiculous at thi</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Again, I offered you a hand, I said 'fuck it, if it bothered you this much why don’t yall let me see what I can do’ you said ‘fuck off’ fine your call.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> In terms of the one thing, up until you opened these floodgates, that I've bashed Basher for, I very clearly told Chaos via email a ways back that I have no intention of backing down from calling you guys out for what, whether you want to justify it to the moon or not, is a very serious conflict of interest issue with your host when I feel like it. Hey man, I host a site too, and I pay bandwidth costs just like you all do. I know the issue, and I know why ya'll are hosted there -- any idiot can see that. But don't try to sit there and tell me it's OK, because it's not. Even at it's worst level what you do is considered journalism and you are operating under a conflict of interest. <br>
<br>
You don't have to look further than the ARK event posting incident to figure out why. And yeah, I do know what went on behind the scenes with that one. We get email too, believe it or </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
What the hell are you raving on about? You really cant get over the fact that Funcom host us? I already told you, visit somewhere else if it bothers you that much. And what the hell is your attachment to the ARK event post? someone posted it, someone said ‘that was not a good idea’ someone else removed it, end of lesson.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   You think it stops there? Do you honestly believe, if you had something Funcom absolutely did not want you to print and you did it, that they would hesitate for a Mississippi minute and pull the plug on your site? Yes, that's the point. You think you're fine because you've tickled them a few times and they've still been OK ... just wait, Sion. It's an old, old story. Read up on the Dallas Morning News and Bell Helicopter (think that was the company) someday, you might learn something.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
If you say so, I can see it now, Basher posts something that is rather nasty (any one see my 12.6 post, it is still me fav to this day), Funcom pull the plug, and we all live happily every after, is it nice over there on planet Mars? Can you send me a postcard please?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Here's the question ... have I ever, in the 5 months or so we've been live, called out AO Basher for something beyond that? No, at least not to my recollection. Have I given you guys credit for a good question, or a good scoop? Often. And this is the thanks I get, a day of arguing with someone too immature to read and think about the issue, and his moronic sheep to boot? Has to be a Monday, just has to be a Monday.<br>
<br>
For the absolute, penultimate, last time ... I didn't call out Basher for being anything more than favored and maintaining a serious conflict of interest relationship with Funcom until one day you can't find something better or more productive to do and take on first one of the MA community members and then myself. And you better fucking believe that won't be tolerated.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
<br>
No I called you out for posting incorrect information, I don’t deny who our host is and certainly don’t deny that could cause a confliction, we never actually have, we are a fanpage we are a tad bit on the biased side Einstein. You did not mention anything about hosting, you went of on a limb about Funcom sending only AO Basher information when it was not actually the case. The comical part of it was in your post you accused Cz of only viewing one URL when a visit to any other page would of reveled a &quot;funcom sent us these two screenshots&quot; highlighting the fact that you did not actually go any where else (visit the page all date stamps there match the date we posted ours, some the day after but we are rather fast with posting our information)<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I don't need a bigger audience, Sion, because the MA's are already here and there's not a hell of a lot more here, except my occasional fits of outrage, for any other profession. do you see ads here?

I do this for fun, period. 1 reader, 10,000 readers, 100,000, my goal's exactly the same, the rewards are the same and the gratification is the same.

Don't get me wrong..  I was implying a MORAL choice.  <br>
<br>
I know I have read the entire thread.  You are not into journalism and don't wanna be a journalist.   But you defanitly don't mind getting paid to write.  (I mean indirectly through the whole funcom pays for the websight so indirectly you prophit via free web hosting).   <br>
<br>
Maby I should give an example even though you will say it is not the same the similarities are there.<br>
<br>
When I pick up a copy of the New York Times and read it.  I know who is paying that writer.  <br>
<br>
If your url were www.funcom.com/basher   that would be a different story.   (or whatever your web page is called.)<br>
<br>
You have made mention about your 40k plus subscribers.<br>
Well I would imagine if I got product placement all over the web sight of the developer I would get more hits.  (Humm I dunno actually I quit the game..  but it is good business to promote your own product..  because really.. basher is a funcom owned product even though it might compete..  I wonder do they coun't you guys as part of there QA team?)<br>
<br>
here is an example of that..  Go see a movie produced by sony studios.  Count the number of sony products or sony business partner products.   There is a reason for that!<br>
<br>
You may feel otherwise...  but I am also REALLY curious about some other things..  conspiracy theory type things that COULD be but may not be.<br>
<br>
1.  Are you the real Sion?  Perhaps the real sion had to sign over there &quot;handle&quot; to funcom as part of the funcom financial support agreement.  Perhaps youare actually the 3rd &quot;Sion&quot;  and just use the same nic.    <br>
<br>
Ok well that was all I had..  but if I wanted to I could think of some more but I am at work...  getting paid..  sigh..  perhaps I should tout my company..<br>
<br>
buy IBM.<br>

Sensei tried to explain it to you.<br>
<br>
It's impossible to reason with you. You're being irrational and refuse to think outside of the box.<br>
<br>
You seem to be incapable of intelligent discussion. You merely come off as an angry, bitter man. I'm sorry if this has hurt your feelings. <br>
<br>
Now, about me being sore. Perhaps sore is the wrong word.<br>
<br>
I'm angry that you refuse to listen.<br>
I'm angry that you seem to practice &quot;selective reading&quot;. <br>
I'm angry that you said things about someone I care about (I'm only human) .<br>
Mostly, I'm pissed at myself. I allowed you to sidetrack TPB forums (one thread ) from the topic at hand, which is MA issues  in AO. I should have ignored you. <br>
<br>
You know, you really do have a troll-like personality, Sion. You need to correct this if you're going to be a successful Editor.<br>
<br>
And to say you're no longer welcome here, was wrong. I only hope that you can curb your maliciousness and go back to commenting on AO. <br>
<br>
Good luck to AOB. Basher has tons of great information. <br>
<br>
TPB is not a gossip rag. And to our forum dwellers and lurkers, I apologize. <br>
<br>
Sensei is no longer commenting on this, nor am I.<br>

The game had potential and some good ideas, but Funcom's incompetence has pretty much rendered AO an also-ran.<br>
<br>
Since the word imcompetence has been brought up (quite deliberately), we'll move on to my impression of Sion. <br>
<br>
I've never visited AOBasher and Sion's behavior here certainly wouldn't give me much desire to. I find it curious that he/she/it styles itself as a &quot;journalist&quot;, yet can't construct a complete sentence or even punctuate. Amazing. <br>
<br>
The content of these, ahhh, posts, also reinforces the image of a drooling, whining, 12year old fanboy. Of course, it's transparent attempt to &quot;get in the last word&quot; tends to put the lie to any journalistic pretensions. <br>
<br>
Ahh, well. I can't say as I miss the game, but what Sensei has created here is worthy of respect on it's own and I do enjoy this site even after abandoning pathetic, broken AO. I don't appreciate Sion's attempts to pollute it with his own mindless vitriol. Go away, troll. Go away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ugrimlakin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimlakin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#660000>(12/11/01 11:28:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sion - (AOB News Editor&quot;?&quot;)</span><hr size=1> Don't stop now..

And Enchant, I'm lettin the cat out of the bag, but Funcom's going to be adding a new skill in the game: Troll Baiting. It's like pulling aggro, in a way. And since Sion has such a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> close relationship</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (sans lube, I'd imagine, cos the little boys like to think they're Ruff'n'Ready and whatnot) with Funcom, it seems he's been picked to be the test mob to see how the skill works in action.<br>

Because I could not give a rats ass about your “I don’t get enough attention” argument, only in the “they get more attention than us” part, I quite purposely have completely avoided the issues that I have no control or say over.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I'm angry that you said things about someone I care about (I'm only human).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Fair shout, I would be as well.<br>

<br>
You might want to speak to your partner in crime who openly implied TPB forums was a place used for these sort of discussions, and even invited readers to attend for lashings of his spectacular vibrating tongue attention.  I am simply here after a signed invitation from this pages proprietor offering a orgy of flames, not being one to ever miss out on some fun I eagerly accepted, its your ball, if you don’t want to play any more I respect that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And to say you're no longer welcome here, was wrong. I only hope that you can curb your maliciousness and go back to commenting on AO. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No maliciousness here pal, just someone who was more than happy to rise to the occasion. I also wish you the best of luck and even in my reply’s have all along stated I find TPB to be one of the best profession specific AO pages out there, if not the best all round opinionated news page, Sensei has a unique talent, and I have never questioned his ability and this pages ability to do its job. I will continue to visit here because I enjoy reading, and my offers of help were actually in good faith, and still stand.<br>
<br>
Again best of luck to you, pass my regards on to your partner, it has been a pleasure.<br>
