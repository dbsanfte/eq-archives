He deserves a shot to try and I know that if he gets in he will serve AD loyally and faithfully. He's one of top SK's on our server(which pretty much means one of the top in teh game because I do believe we have the most skilled players in EQ right here on this server. We &quot;grew-up&quot; having to learn PvP and PvE), and he will be a great addition to your SK ranks. He was amazing on raids and would benefit you greatly. Whenever we had adds, he was the first one to get one and tank it. He never broke mezzes. He's on the ball, he's intuitive, and he's motivated.<br>
<br>
Ghouldan is a true hearted person. People talk about butting heads with him. I've probably butted heads with him more times then anyone else in all of EQ. And yet I remain his friend. Because every day, I know he's out there to help others. And Mearis you're right, he did put you on ignore, and then you and I butted heads. I retain no hard feelings towards SoD, and I don't believe Ghouldan does either. I think we were all passionate in doing what was best for our respective guilds and as a result we always had something to talk about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
As far as this inner-circle crap, Ghouldan cares about his friends and wants nothing but the best for them. I don't know how many times he went through the coldainian ring quests just so he could MQ it for the melee's in the rev sect.  He used to stay up till all hours of the morning dragging corpses while Zayda and I ressed them because we thought we could take ToV by storm! He'd take time out to listen to us when we were having problems, RL or in game, and just be that person you needed so you could vent for a while. Reverant wasn't just a guild. It was a family, and remains that way. There is no inner-circle bullshit. Its about friends. <br>
<br>
And my final note is this. Look at the people in AD who are supporting him. Yes many are ex - Rev, but if Ghouldan is so bad, why support him after being so close to him for so long. Altaris, Briaar, Slivur, Primadona. They don't have to support him but they do because they believe in him. Zayda, Rakizi, Faerluna, &amp; Sighkox are all MIM, have absolutely nothing to gain, yet they show favor for giving Ghouldan a chance. <br>
<br>
Anyway, these are my thoughts. I think he deserves to be given a chance to raid with you and become a recruit. And look at it this way, what do you have to lose by giving him that chance?<br>

Re-read my post.  You, obviously, come from this inner circle of friends that Ghouldan has.  They are easy to spot.  They lash out against ANYONE who says ANYTHING remotely negative about Ghouldan.  They will even lash out at their own current guildmates appearantly.  If you loved him so, why didn't you stay in Reverant?<br>
<br>
I'm wondering if Ghouldan is the same person, or, at the very least, if he even remembers who I am, cause he sure as hell don't remember inviting me to go to ToV (maybe he's still drinking).  I NEVER went to ToV with Reverant.  What I said in my ealier post was that Ghouldan offered to MQ some chain boots.  I said that I went to Fear with them.  I helped them kill CT and happened to pick up some loots that would have rotted (thorny vine stuff).  As far as I knew, Vindi was a free for all mob and there were AD officers along, so if someone had a problem with us doing Vindi, they should have talked to them, not me.<br>

I was in Eternal shadows a guild that was equal to reverant and doing the same mobs...<br>
Ghouldan always appeared to me to be very driven to help his guild and very loyal to his guild.  The frustrations that people talk about here are frustrations that may have come up in the process of ghouldan trying to help his guild succeed.  I give him kudos because of his tireless work ethic he built one of the strongest guilds on rallos at the time prolly 4th or 5th under AD, wudan, mim at the time.  He also built that guild up from scrath in a matter of a few months something it took ES 1 year to do.<br>
If you ask me, do i think it may have been frustrating to deal with him when competeing for similar mobs i would say it must have been because he was &quot;fighting&quot; to improve his guild.  The most important thing to me in any person in any guild that I am in is LOYALTY.  This is something that ghouldans friends seem to have for him and something i put alot of stock in.  When i guild with somone I want to know that they are going to take my side no matter what and no matter what expense to them even if the chips are down.  Ghouldan seems like that kinda person to me.  He seems like he works tirelessly to help his guildmates and in the process also helped others, but in competing for mobs prolly rubbed some elbows.<br>
<br>
I dont think the guy puts on a facade but I think he may have stepped on some toes in trying to help his guild which is something that can be worked on and that he can learn to be better at.  One of the things that made Eternal shadows so special to me is that we would go out of our way not to steal camps from smaller guilds if they were there first and to treat others with respect.  When you do that people notice and when u dont people notice that too.<br>
<br>
To sum this up I think he deserves a chance to prove himself.  He may have in the attempt to improve his guild  hurt others but i dont feel he did this intentionally at least what i know of him.<br>
<br>
Im just a damn recruit and my opinion dont matter anyways but this is how i saw him from afar but I never had to deal with him much directly as i was not an officer.<br>
<br>

What Briaar said even with sarcasm was close to the mark. I'm not lashing out at you. Just reinforcing the points Briaar was trying to make. I am a friend of Ghouldan's. I'm not part of an inner circle. And I have not lashed out at you or others. There are several people like me who feel as I do, who are not so easy to spot as you might think. I even helped you with gear while also helping Reverant while we were both AD recruits. <br>
<br>
Just because we are friends of Ghouldan, it doesn't mean we are &quot;followers&quot; of Ghouldan. We are independant thinkers and not sheep to be led. Sometimes we disagree with Ghouldan, sometimes we don't. Just as we sometimes agree and disagree with you. But even though I disagree with some of your thinking, I work together with you and others in AD to meet a common goal. Ghouldan would like to be given a chance to do the same thing as a member. Not a leader. <br>

There is no need to insult anyone or any guild while trying to make your point. You don't see Ghouldan doing that while addressing the issues people raise against him in this thread do you? Thanks.<br>

People tend to judge ex-leaders of guilds based on their opinions of said guilds instead of what they are applying for...to be a member.  People who have never in their lives led a guild are quick to judge.<br>
<br>
I am positive not one of Ascending Dawns officers cares one little bit of any opinions about Reverant as a guild on this thread.  They are likely more interested in Ghouldan as a player and an individual.<br>
<br>
I never did anything with Ghouldan besides an old joint raid in NTOV months ago.  I am not in his &quot;inner circle.&quot;  Just someone who has been through a similar experience.  <br>
<br>
To members who want to post about Ghouldan's actions, remember that while Ghouldan was wearing a guildleader Reverant tag - he in essense was Reverant.  Decisions made were decisions he might have made very differently if he was only an SK member of a guild.<br>

It's an issue of respect. If you step on my guild (or more specifically... steamroll, killsteal, attempt to coax random people to leave to join your guild, downright call us a &quot;shitty guild&quot;) expect me to be pissed off when you apply to the same guild as me 6 months down the line. The only reason I'm getting so many replies is cause of shock value. Nocturnalist posted a very valid concern (same as mine, mind you) yet he hasn't been addressed at all by anyone other than Ghouldan.<br>
<br>
I do appreciate Ghouldan's respectful demeanor on this board, but one could argue he doesn't have much of a choice.<br>
<br>
And finally, I have no intentions of insulting anyone. I'm simply pointing out my opinions of the past actions of this recruit. When you post that I think I &quot;own AD,&quot; you're not only insulting me but you're insulting AD as well.

<br>
I refuse to have MIM or Reverant called names, and this is not the place to do so.  So if you want to talk more shit about either of my guilds, like you've been doing, please feel free to send me tells in game.  This is not about your hatred of Reverant and the people in it, this is about Ghouldan's usefulness to AD, which anyone who REALLY knows him, there is no question that any guild would be lucky to have this guy.<br>
<br>
I would like to know which guild you called a stinky vagina though, if its MIM you're in deep trouble.  If it's reverant you're in deep trouble....mind you, Reverant has given quality members to every large guild on this server, and we stick up for each other.  I seriously suggest you stop the name calling. <p>Gnome &gt; all<br>

All your posts are based on he was mean to me and i hate him.  But ill only talk shit now that im in AD and your last guild disbanded cause i dont have the balls to tell things to peoples faces.<br>
<br>
Or maybe its more then that.  Maybe you hate him cause of the fact that he would take major hits on his own person FOR his guild.  Can you say you did that?  Doubt it.  Would u be willing to take heat.  take the Blame.  The consiquenses down the line to help YOUR friends in YOUR guild.  Highly doubtful  This man has done all that time and time again.  You Slap Myself sighkox members of your OWN guild in the face saying that we only got loot cause we wehre in ghouldans Inner circle. thats a crock of shit everything that we have or where givin we earned by being loyal, at the raids and doing our job.<br>
<br>
Now what this is all about Ghouldan.  Ghouldan is one of the top SKs on RZ imho.  He has shown time and time again he has leadership skills pulling skills determination drive and ambition.  Not giving this man a chance would be crazy imo.  Anyone would be lucky to haev this guy who is a Friend and cares about people in there guild.<br>

Give him a real honest chance please he has done alot for people all over and should get his chance imo. <br>

I understand you have opinions about Ghouldan. Ghouldan led Reverant, but that doesn't mean he did the things you are holding against him personally. If someone or even multiple Rev were attempting to coax Revered folks into joining Reverant, that does not mean Ghouldan was doing it nor does it mean he gave any orders to do so. It was not common practice by Rev officers to insult anyone's guild and I highly doubt Ghouldan would have called Revered a &quot;shitty Guild&quot;. I know Ghouldan on a personnal level and know him IRL through our trips to Austin TX and Pasadena CA. Even when I spoke with Ghouldan about people he dislikes, such as PB, he at least treated them as people. I won't deny its possible that some of Rev were attempting to get some people in revered to leave and join reverant, but I think you should consider that Ghouldan may not have asked, ordered, or suggested that those people do it, and I doubt Ghouldan did it himself just because Ghouldan would not have spoke down of Revered in the way you have explained it happened. <br>
<br>
As for Reverant lasting 1 month, we both know it was around a lot longer then that. Ghouldan busted his ass for Reverant, and without him we would not have shared the success we did. Leading a guild is tough, damn tough. Was he the only reason for Reverant's success, no. But he was a big part of it as were some other people. One thing however he is not responsible for is Reverant's fall out. There are those who blame Ghouldan for it, but they don't know everything that went on. I however do, and I can say 100% without a doubt, it was not Ghouldan's fault Reverant fell apart at the end. I won't say whose fault it was because thats not at issue here, and it would be inappropriate for me to bring Reverant issues here. But I can say Ghouldan was a major part of Reverant's success and I wish you would not use the downsides of Reverant against Ghouldan, because just because he led the guild does not mean he controlled what everyone did or what happened all the time. <br>
<br>
Finally, I'm not posting this to piss you off, to tell you your opinions are shit, to stfu or to die plz, I'm simply posting it in hopes that maybe you'll see that Ghouldan may not be the asshole you believe he is. He's not applying to make your life miserable. He's applying to help AD with his experience, and in turn enjoy the side of the game he hasn't been able to achieve due to his leadership obligations of the past. Consider giving him a chance. No one said AD had to guild him just because they give him the chance to be a recruit. He still has to prove himself before he'll be tagged.

<br>
Need I remind you that I very rarely post insults until some idiot (i.e. Macoo) comes out of the woodwork and insults me. Feel free to point me somewhere to prove otherwise. Hell, remember that big thread on the Gimp Gallery? That whole argument started cause I mentioned some &quot;Reverant jerks&quot; steamrolling us in Kael... which they did do, and Macoo bragged about them doing, therefore it wasn't an insult, it was a fucking fact. Or check out my posts on the LV board; I rarely even insult Tareslaeyn, for example, even though every single one of his posts is an insult towards me or AD. YOUR ex-guildmate(s) are responsible for this mess of an argument that you recreate every time a new ex-Reverant posts on this board.<br>
<br>
Posting witty insults isn't my &quot;field of expertise,&quot; if you will... rather, pointing out the obvious vices in people is what I do best. They're not intended as insults at all; think of them as constructive (albeit harsh) criticism if you want. If you can't take such criticism, maybe you shouldn't bully people and act like complete assholes (as a guild), creating my impression of such a vice. Again, that's not an insult, its a fact. I don't make up stories about Reverant bullying Revered for fun. And as long as your ex-Reverant buddies (Macoo again) come here and BRAG about bullying other guilds, I can rest my case. Reverant was well-known for these tactics, so you can either stfu and accept the fact, or you can do some fucking research (ask guildleaders of Seekers of Divinity, or Covenant of the Wolf, or anything for their opinions), or you can continue to live in denial. It matters none to me as long as you eventually figure out that, at least as a group/guild, you were assholes to &quot;lesser guilds&quot; for whatever reason and you'll hopefully work on not giving that reputation to your future guilds.<br>
<br>
I also find it &quot;lol funny&quot; that you're threatening me so much. You called me a big pussy for insulting your guild after they broke up, yet it must not be too pussy to do so if I can still get reprecussions from doing so. You know, in kindergarden there was this 1st grade dickhead named Jeff who always threatened to beat me up... so one day I slugged the fat fuck in the stomach and he never bothered me again. Threats accomplish nothing and just make you look like an asshole.<br>
<br>
But this is Ghouldan's goddamn recruitment thread, and he's admittedly been nothing but cordial so far, so fuck you for making me reply again; I'm going to sit on the bench until the winds change. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 7/12/03 2:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ghouldanrz>GhouldanRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#333333>(7/12/03 2:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=519.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: s</span><hr size=1> Morb,<br>
<br>
I flaged many revered for PoV/PoS and helped with BoT out of good will, this wasnt some plan to get all of revered to join Reverant. I helped alot of people in your guild and spent many hours flaging people.  At the time Reverant adn Revered were on good friendly terms, so I helped for that reason.  I didn't try to coax and recruit your guild.  I am only guilty of recruiting Luvvy, I activitely did this because I knew him and his brother from the past form Sots.. Luvvy is an excellent player, person, and guildmate I wanted him yes, he left you guys sorry.  Chapelstoh and Dinliich came on thier own accord because they both knew Luvvy IRL.  It wasn't that they hated Revered its that they wanted to stay with Luvvy.  Quedyiana and Lehammer had a hard time leading Revered they did an excellent job and were two of the hardest working leaders out there to get Revered moving at that time.  While we were on good terms we talked alot at times they were frustrated. I let them know fully well what I thought of them that they are great people, with great attitudes great player skill and great devotion.  I told them if they ever choose to leave Revered that they would have a home at Reverant if they so choose.  They stuck with it and I respected that.  When the relationships between Revered and Reverant went bad and I was at words with Lehammer and Quediyana, I still held them in high regard.  When they apped to AD, I bumped both thier posts positvily cause I hold them im high regard.  I am not phony like you say because I knew we werent friends anymore but I knew they were good people and that we just had an arguments about the guild and that it was only guild related so I posted on both thier apps.  I have been on this server since the start Morb, I have been called a jerk, an ass sure, I have just like you have, but I have NEVER been thought of as dishonest or unloyal, or a bad friend. There is truth to what I write here today.  I don't blame you for hating me so much, you don't know me but you know im the leader of the guild I represent the guild, so if you hate the guild hating me seems the logical thing to do I understand this.  The best thing about me apping to AD is the show of friendship that people have shown for me, old friends from AD, MiM, Rev, Sots, etc come to this board and show support.  I am the luckiest guy to have so many true friends.  Many of these people I am sure you respect highly as many are in your very own guild.  I may be a jerk at times or to certain people but I must be doing something right as a person to have the quality of friends that I have.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Asshole, P.I.</span><br>  Posts: 210<br> <font color=#333333>(7/12/03 2:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=519.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: s</span><hr size=1> Holy shit Draaxx do you have any reading comprehension?<br>

Yes, Dupre, you're exactly right here. Except if you're the leader of your guild maybe you should control your fucking cronies. It's not my fault that I hate Reverant for their actions... it's Reverant's fault.
