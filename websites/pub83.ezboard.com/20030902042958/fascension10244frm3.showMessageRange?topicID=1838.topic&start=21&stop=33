I have no intentions of trying to make a bad situation worse.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are, however, in effect, making a bad situation worse, much worse.<br>
<br>
Bear in mind I have very little direct experience with any of the &quot;Totenreichs.&quot; So, the opinoins and deductions that follow, are based solely on this thread and the events in game that this thread pertain to.<br>
<br>
First, having been caught in a falsehood, that being the &quot;e-mail from Sony,&quot; you posted a retraction in an attempt to indicate that this was supplied to you by someone else who had fabricated it. All well and good, that is possible, but you've failed to consider your audience.<br>
<br>
Many of our members, your audience, were there for that event, and are quite convinced that they saw a ressurection. To post a fraudulent e-mail is only going to further convince them that you have been lying about that event. <br>
<br>
You then propose that you contact Sony yourself to find &quot;proof&quot; yourself, what you should have done in the first place. I can save you the trouble. You won't be believed. People who were disinclined to trust you in the first place have been given ample proof that you are untrustworthy. You could have Abashail himself post logs indicating that events transpired as you maintain, and you wouldn't be believed, until we'd verified his identity, and seen the original logs for ourselves.<br>
<br>
In short, one or all of the &quot;Totenreichs&quot; who you are representing has lied. The fraudulent e-mail makes this very clear. <br>
<br>
You were directed, by your officers to apologize, and have, instead of doing so, made a mockery of one of the conditions of this cease fire.<br>
<br>
At this point, in addition to a sincere apology, which has aproximately zero chance of being accepted, you should be asking yourself what you can do to avoid making this situation any worse than you already have.<br>
<br>
Allow me to advise you in this.<br>
<br>
Arguing particulars, offering posts of &quot;proof&quot; will not facilitate this. Your opinion of what you have done wrong is not relevant.<br>
<br>
What is relevant is what Wudan's officers and AD's officers have agreed to, which is an apology for actions, real or perceived, that occured during the first stages of the war.<br>
<br>
Is your pride worth more than the good of your guild, or this one? Is your pride sufficient reason to contravene the directives of those that lead your guild? Is your arrogance and need to be right of greater value than the rest of the people in your guild that have helped you get to the point you have in the game?<br>
<br>
In short, how selfish are you?<br>
<br>
Apologize or not, make a decision and stick with it, and live with the consequnces. Dragging it out, arguing about how much of an apology you feel like giving dosen't serve anyone, in either guild, at all well.<br>
<br>
Either way, from our perspective, you're simply a problem to be dealt with. How much of one, and to how many people is all that remains to be seen.<br>

I assume he will be posting here and explain why he made up such a bs letter while he begs for unkos and not making me hunt him down and call him out.. the punishment will be less.  He certainly did his share in this case to make the situation between ad and wudan &quot;better&quot;.<br>
<br>
also, as for posting under the totehreichs, use your own ezboard names.  Your attempt at recovery from slap in the face to an apology is laughable when you come to these boards balls in hand trying to prove your point with false information.<br>

<br>
I've stayed off the server while Wudan and AD warred except to log in and say howdy once in awhile.  This is for two reasons:<br>
<br>
(1)  Most clerics I group with are in Wudan, AD, or are applying for either, and the war makes them unavailable.  A warrior without a cleric isnt raking in exp, which is my current goal, and<br>
<br>
(2) I like too many people in both guilds to want to get involved, as I inevitably do when I hang around, with wars that I don't even get to start because someone somewhere will say &quot;Rile did this!&quot; or &quot;Rile did that!&quot; even when Rile was just standing around waving his tail.  I figured if I am not on, can't be blamed for squat.<br>
<br>
That stated, and I do remain interested, I read the original post on this thread and some of the replies.  I think some of the replies ignored one sentence in the original post.  That sentence is:<br>
<br>
&quot;This information was obtained by one who question the incident themselves so they contacted Sony&quot;<br>
<br>
This tells me that the person who made the original post was acknowledging that it &quot;was obtained&quot; by someone other than the poster.<br>
<br>
As Neckros pointed out with his 22 inch penis claim, the post would not &quot;prove&quot; anything.  I might add, I would have loved for you guys to chime in while people were busy spewing such &quot;official&quot; crap about me, but remained silent instead.<br>
<br>
However, that doesnt mean that the poster did not believe the email was real.  The poster acknowledged they were from a 3rd party, and did not name that party.  The poster didn't say &quot;I recieved this email direct from Sony.&quot;  If I were to speculate, and I have no idea if this is what occurred or not but is is an example of how it MIGHT have occurred, lets pretend:  A is the poster.  B plays A's character once inawhile.  B sees his friend C's character dead, and so resses C's character at C's request.  B finds out that that was a bad move because that screws A because C is currently persona non gratis to a large portion of the population.  A finds out by D-Z yelling at him about A's character ressing C's character at a given time.  A yells at B.  B says it wasn't him.  B fakes an email and gives to A, A says &quot;Okay, so you didnt do it, I wont beat you to a pulp&quot; or such.  B, the liar in this case, passes off the lie to A without A the wiser.  A then posts the email to show that it wasn't A's char that did the deed.  D-Z point out the email is a fraud, and A is frankly shocked and pissed, and kicks B's arse.  It doesnt excuse the character action, but it does explain the player action. B is the &quot;evildoer&quot;, A was duped.  Of course, it could be that A ressed C.  A simpler explanation, but no more or less probable than any other (see &quot;The Messenger&quot; for other hypos&quot;).<br>
<br>
Some of the replies seemed a bit viscious without making as good a point as either Neckros' or Adell's.  I, for one, was amazed that Neckros had only a 22 inch penis.  I thought his had to be bigger than mine, but it appears not!  (This is obviously a jest, so don't ask for photos please... I don't want your wives all calling me for appointments.  They can have Neckros as a close second <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This post isn't meant to be for or against anyone, its just one of the observations I tend to make, and thus am sure someone will get pissed at me for making it, probably because it is a dead issue anyway.<br>

Ah, the &quot;little brother/cousin/room-mate/close in-game friend was playing my character&quot; excuse.  Cmon Rile- we've both been on RZ long enough to know that someone else playing your character is no excuse for actions committed by that toon.  The same applies to posting 3rd-party information.  It's the law of common sense- if you post it, you take responsibility for its veracity.  The gist of the tone leads one to believe that the e-mail exonerates him- that clearly isn't the case.  Plus- if any of what was said is true (heh), then there would be no reason whatsoever for him to have been in tactics when his guild was clearly instructed to leave our events alone.  <br>
<br>
The facts are against him- regardless of who was playing him- they are against him, no matter who posted the fabricated e-mail.  Those possibilities change nothing as regards culpability or responsibility- if every such incident could be put down the the infamous RZ little brother syndrome there would never be a case to KOS anyone.  Brothers, sisters, old friends and cousins twice-removed would pop out of the woodwork like nobody's business- messy :P<br>

I never once said the poster was not *responsible* for what the poster posted.<br>
<br>
My intention was to point out that the poster did indicate that the source he was using was a 3rd party, which the poster did not name.  This implies the information is &quot;as is&quot; and generally unreliable, as there is no chain of endorsement to make a judgment about (other than no judgment).<br>
<br>
The other point I tried to make is that we all act upon information *as we know it to be*.  That is, we each make our decisions based on the information we possess and our own judgments of the reliability of that information.  That means, we are perception driven, and anyone can therefore be misled by being supplied bad &quot;facts.&quot;  I provided a stated hypothetical that would provide a good faith belief, even if it was misplaced belief.<br>
<br>
I wasn't making a call one way or the other, again, I just intended to point out that the poster may or may not have had good faith in making that post.  To make a judgment one way or the other in response to the post may or may not be made with good faith either.  <br>
<br>
I didnt say it was warranted or justified, and I didnt say it wasn't.  I just attempted to point out it might have been done in good faith.<br>
