And I must say during the &quot;early years&quot; EQ was AWESOME.<br>
<br>
The gameplay was solid, lag free, and the society was very friendly. It seemed things got worse around the time of AC. Yes. I dont know why, but thats what seemed to happen - all of a sudden we had a huge rush of people playing the game but with a complete lack of RolePlaying.<br>
<br>
Now, there is nothing wrong with this. Some people dont want to roleplay. BUT when u dont roleplay then you tend to bring your true self MORE into the game... and this is what caused the problems so it seemed. People started to talk in-game about RL events... and thus other people started to argue about RL events because they did/didnot agree and so on and so forth until people just started spamming the channels with 'crap'.<br>
<br>
It does seem to me that this same attitude has prevailed in AO rather quickly =( I have not really seen much roleplaying occuring - possibly because *so far* there is no REASON to roleplay. At least to me.. thats my experience =)<br>
<br>
Anyway I dont know if I had a point except dont bash EQ unless you have played it and even then understand that there was a time when EQ was possibly the most amazing, fun, pretty games on the market...<br>
<br>
Just as AO could become.<br>

That's when it started going down hill. Throw out cons because a blue in Kunark was pretty much a red anywhere else, the NEED of some ppl to hit lvl 60 brought about a whole new brand of politics and pretty much all the problems I posted above. Yes, at one time EQ was damn good game to play (aside from Verant) and I call it the addictive time. Once you were hooked it was hard to stop even if you grew to hate it. AO has never, nor probably ever will enjoy that kind of rabid fanbase. Ppl were expecting it to be a polished and more enjoyable game than EQ was when it was first launched. That will never happen it seems. Anyway off to dinner, have fun playing (praying for that patch on Monday or I'm out) this weekend.<br>

<br>
Question to the early players of EQ, when it first shipped out : how long did V. take to make it really enjoyable for most classes, and for most levels ?  I wasn't there, so I can't really compare.  From what I heard, some classes in EQ were broken for a year or more, and they are still making big changes now (triple attack for rangers and monks for example !).  <br>
<br>
Sure AO is far from being finished, they have a lot to do, but they're trying hard, and they are listening to players.  I'd give them another 3 month b4 I consider quiting the game.  I said this b4, but I'll reiterate (sp?) : don't play a MMORPG from first day if you want a polished game.  That will just never happen.  I played EQ a bit before Velious was released, and there was still some problems with the game, although it was running quite smoothly.  I went through several patches for the 6 months I played, and that was 2 years after initial release.  This is bound to happen with MMORPG.  We have to live with it.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usynionghrym.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synion Ghrym</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#660000>(9/22/01 9:38:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1086.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: EQ is ok ... if you have to right mind set</span><hr size=1> I played EQ for 2 years...Was in a great guild, had a lot of fun. And also began to really feel like it was more a heavily political job than a GAME... The high level game of EQ was probably the most UN fun of any &quot;game&quot; I have ever experienced... It wasn't fun to lose 10 hours (soloing) of exp, because of a single mistake. It wasn't fun to have to do verbal battle with all of &quot;uber&quot; d00ds that had a spot camped. It wasn't fun to have to have 30 people accross the world glued to their keyboard, so that like one or 2 people could get a single piece of loot...<br>
<br>
I loved EQ in the beginning (Before I ever leveled over 50th basically). I liked being able to solo when I only had a little time. Loved good groups. Loved the sense of accomplishment the first time you did something (killed a god, successful raid, etc, etc...)<br>
<br>
Never cared for Verant's customer service on any issue; always hated the mythical vision. When AO hit retail I was eager for something new, and also going thru changes in my RL that left me with signifigantly less play time than before.<br>
<br>
So I started AO, and I enjoy it. I don't like the constant nerfs, and bad ideas implentmented even more poorly, but I am willing to cut funcom some slack. It's a first attempt. And, to be frank, at least they seem to care SOMEWHAT what their customers' think (the MA &quot;fix&quot; is a good example of this).<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I am not particularly pleased with the &quot;yes we intended to make the mobs harder&quot;. This further reduces the ability to solo, which, to me, is one of AO's biggest draws. I never have to fight over a spawn, no uber loot to camp, no raids to contend with multiple guilds over...I can log on for a single hour, grab a mission or 2 get thru em and have a little fun... I like being able to SOLO AND group, if the mood strikes me. Being part of a larger game world that is intended to be dynamic (And this says nothing about the skill/ip system, which I like ALOT better than anything in EQ).<br>
<br>
I am still having fun with AO now. This latest patch hasn't impacted me THAT much (only level 51) but it's still not a positive sign of things to come for me. Guess I will wait and see... Because the thing I lost sight of in EQ (and still wonder how that happened) is simple: <br>
<br>
Games are supposed to be fun.

<br>
EQ was a ton of fun!   aside from Vrants nazi atitude<br>
<br>
I started a month into the game , and yes things where broke in some instances, but NO WHERE near the magnitude of AO ! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
And I was so looking forward to a futuristic MMORPG <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would have no problem paying  to beta test, only if i knew it was just that, beta<br>
If this is'nt a beta test then sheesh!! Funcom has a TON of work to do.  Maybe even more than I think their capable of<br>
Maybe they'll sell it to some one that can actually  run it, and not ruin it!<br>
<br>
not sure which of the last posters wrote it but  I thought it was incredibly funny, to bad it seems to be so true <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ... I know their from Norway and there is a language differnce, but didnt know it was that hard to hire some one who could speak/write English<br>
<br>
And their last daily update saying they dont really care when they patch?! WTF  sounds  kinda like Vrants (spelling error intented)  response to EBay and the like<br>
<br>
All that said I will go back to EQ, Starwars when it comes out, if Funcom hasn't fixed their problems, dispite my dislike for Vrant<br>

i agree with everything crimhawk has posted.  EQ was fun until lvl 50; post 50 its a political job that requires massive amounts of time to do anything.<br>
