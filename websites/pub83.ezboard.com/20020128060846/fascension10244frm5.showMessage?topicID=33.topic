<br>
I am looking to join a guild with such a reputation as AD.  Some of you may or may not have heard of my skills and reputation, so if you have, please indulge me for just a minute here.  I am a level 60 (maxed out) Dark Elf Grave Lord with my Epic weapon.  I have been a long time member of Reverent but recently became disenfranchised with them because of their decision to suddenly switch to Velious dragon faction.  This came after much effort on my part to become ally to the giants and collect all my quest gems, which I have done.  I am now a dutiful shadowknight stuck in a delimma.  Do I go about the long and arduous process of changing my faction to the dragons only to bet rewarded with armor that, in the end, is not as good for an SK as the Kael armor?  Or, do I make the hard decision of moving on, leaving many friends behind.  Needless to say, I have decided to take the step of moving on and am looking for a new home with new friends.  I have always been considered one the hardest working, nicest, easy to get along members of our guild.  I go out of my way to help people.  Some of you may also know of my other characters: Figglesworth (level 51 Bard) and Sparkes (level 51 enchanter).  In days past, I fought with such people as Awfal in Sol B with Figglesworth.  I was also invited along as a guest of Adell's on one ToV raid.  Please consider me for your community as I think I would be a great addition to the AD community with my skills and character.<br>

joining ad b/c we are on Kd faction is 100% the wrong reason to join and it looks like it played a large part in your decision. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uckalvarnsondragonslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ckal Varnson Dragonslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(11/5/01 2:04:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Membership</span><hr size=1> I was afraid that my post might be construed this way but this could be further from the truth.  As I told Xezzt in talking to him in game the other day, I am not some kind of loot whore.  Heck, I even offered one of your AD members a couple of quest gems last night in Kael cause I had extra (sorry I can't remember your name bro).  In fact, I have been going on raids with Reverant without concern whatsoever as to my loots, simply going to help friends out as they did me.  I've been sitting there at the zone in to ToV helping clear mobs till I could get CoHed into the Halls of Testing to help kill some more mobs so those that want SS armor can get their loots.  I've done this without complaint and without care.  As I said, I'm just trying to help some friends out.  But here's the question I found myself asking: What do I do now?  I don't want SS armor and I don't want to spend the time changing my faction.  So, as I see it, I am at the end of my EQ career (at least till expansion).  I cannot gain anymore experience and there is nothing else to do without a raid group.  Honestly, if it wasn't for helping Reverant out as I've been doing the last month or so, I probably would have just sold the account because I would never have played this character again.  Like I said, what more is there for me to do?  Now, all this is aside from the fact that due to some misunderstandings and miscommunications about me having to take another job and not being able to play as much for about a 3 month period of time, I'm not even technically listed as a Reverant member.  Go to their site and have a look for yourself.  Once again, I will miss some of the people in Reverant but, come on, these are only in game friends.  People I have never met before in real life.  To suggest that I am somehow backstabbing or abandoning my friends is, at the very least, wrong, maybe even ludicrous.  I have grouped with AD and Synergy people alot when exping and none of them have had anything but good things to say about me.  It comes down to this: I am looking for a guild that has the same goals as me.  If we have the same goals, I am trustworthy, loyal and always ready to help others even before I help myself, i.e., offering your guildmate my quest gems.  If your guild cannot see the value in having someone around like that, then maybe you are correct about AD not being the guild for me.  I am confident, however, that AD and I are on the same path and do have the same goals.  Once AD realizes the strenghts of my character and personality, you will know that I am a valuable addition to AD.<br>

<br>
But there are several reasons that i dont think you are just what we need now:<br>
<br>
1. As a member of AD you could be told to switch faction, and no mocking about it. It doesnt take alot of work to get ally with kael, and i really think its weird you would leave reverant for that.<br>
<br>
2. AD have alot of members, we have enough people to do every mob we want to do. What we need is to get our people equipped and trained for our tasks, not get new people to equip and train.<br>
<br>
3. If we should add more recruits, we will probably pick the classes we need, and right now, SK isnt actually what we are missing.<br>
<br>
Im sorry, but at the moment i dont think you will be the addtion we need.
