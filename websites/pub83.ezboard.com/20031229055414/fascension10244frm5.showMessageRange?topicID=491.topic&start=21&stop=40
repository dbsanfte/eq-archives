I know I am not perfect and you all act like your so fucking riches get real, at least I can admit when I make a mistake!  Mind I remind you guys that the so called number one warrior that Created  this AD negative talk about me has turned into a pker.  I am amazed that you guys have not made me  KOS just because I have offended some of you.  Kringe was such an  honest guy I am surprised I didn't become KOS permanently.  <br>

Good luck with more trains in kael when things don't go your way, Sorry you think an apology when you want something goes far enough to wipe an incident away from a week prior when your milk got spilt and you threw a temper tantrum<br>

I have better things to do then to train people,  but I do believe in an eye for an eye.  No matter how people dress up the incident in Kael I saw what happened.   You weren't there  nor was  Sighkox there when Ghouldan trained.  He was training because  he knew there were five  us waiting at the zone for them to get  her body, if he was not he would not had to fake death right  at Faypixies body.  My apology to them is genuine and  has nothing to do with me applying to AD, simply put I should of been better then that but you guys wouldn't know anything about making mistakes.  Basically not many of you have grouped with me nor have any dealings with me but you all seem to know me so well. I mind my own business for the most part and  I could care less about what you all do , just thought I would try to see if I could be some help to others and to see if we could put the passed behind us.  I know that I have been honest and truthful about both incidents so if I have made a couple mistakes along the way  so be it.<br>
<br>
Happy gaming to you all, I am not interested in training or PKing.  I just wanted to group with people that knew how to raid and not waist time at raids but it's okay I'm sure there is room for all of us to play the game.   <br>

<br>
Fact: I was non kos at the time.<br>
Fact: all 5 of the Maloudi Clan were 60+ most 65.<br>
<br>
Now lets bring logic into your world Polgra so we can smash it.<br>
<br>
Since I am non kos, it would take me an immense amount of time to run up to each giant I see and aggro it, to get enough giants to kill 5 60+ charatcers who are&quot;waiting at the *ZONE*&quot; as you say.  Honestly does anyone have any idea the sheer size of a train I would need to kill 5 &quot;waiting&quot; 60+ characters who are &quot;at the zone&quot; ... also how the hell would I not die while building up this train of instant death?  Why did you guys die Polgra? I'll answer cause you seem confused.  I dragged Faypixie who 5 characters &quot; waiting at the zone&quot; killed at the WL zone.. those 5 people choose to wait no longer and followed me, regardless of the train they saw being created because I was dragging faypixie.. By the time I got past the see invis guards I fd'd... not to train but because I didnt want to train MY sect.   So Polgra after I fd'd you found your self standing around many giants, who like most people on this server, don't like you.  I would stop here, but for someone as delusional/slow as you, I feel I need to tell the whole of the story.  You died.<br>
<br>
Thats what happened. Polgra I said nothing to slander your app, I stayed completely out of it, and you keep bringing MY name into it when you think or feel it will benefit you or justifiy YOUR wrong deeds in some way.  That's pretty lame of you.<br>
