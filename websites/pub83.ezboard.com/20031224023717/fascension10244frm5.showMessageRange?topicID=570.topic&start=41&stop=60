You make some very valid points and Id like to answer them directly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Pay no attention to the numerous other people on the server who like to play in Bastion of Thunder that died to that tactic who had absolutely nothing to do with DoZ/MIM war.&quot;<br>
<br>
We go to BoT to kill mobs. MiM comes to BoT to kill us. MiM started the war. DoZ has tried everything in its power to stop war. Unfortunatly in war inicent people get involved. Same thing happened in Wudan / AD war. Im sorry for anytime that you were caused inconvience, but it wasn't in my hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;I've witnessed you training MIM, and having others caught up in your wake.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can tell you that this is simple not true. I dont train. Never have and never will. I challenge anyone in last 8 months to show a screen shot otherwise. I fight hard and clean, while most of the time outnumbered. Please be clear as to who was training.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's been stated by a MIM officer that you are KOS to their guild and rather than attempting to rectify the situation... you approach it condescendingly and with arrogance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Your talking about a guild that systematicly destroyed the guild i was in. Not with pvp, but by threatening perma kos to the recreational members of the guild unless they disband by a certain date. A guild that then, after the guild disband, made a list of people that were perma kos anyways because of war crimes, in a war they started. A guild where just about every single leader that we dealt with from the begining of the war quit and joined other guild. Where the remaining officers don't pvp and give no reasons to why they cannot work out any peace other then &quot;trash talk&quot;. What exactly do you want me to do? Get on my hands and knees and beg for forgiveness for daring to defy their will? Im a very reasonable person, and if MIM cared enough to post specific things that I did, or any kind of solution to this problem id be more then happy to work with them. My point is this, I have no way to negotiate with MIM. I was hoping this application would make them understand i am seriously ready to move on and and make amends.  <br>
<br>
&quot;My personal opinion of you is that you are not cut out for Ascending Dawn unless you royally clean up your act. By the looks of things, it doesn't look like you're prepared to do that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Other then talking trash back and forth between MIM during an intense 8 month war, what do i need to clean up? Obviously im prepared to move on, or I would not be applying to the best guild on RZ. If anything i think all of this proves my loyalty and compassion to the people around me. What kind of guildie would i be to allow MIM to disband my guild and leave some of my guildies out to dry with there irrational perma kos policies. I did what i believe any of you in AD would do for each other in the same situation. And if there was any point, or anything that could be accomplished by staying with DoZ, I would until then end of EQ. But flags, LDoN, kos with smaller guilds, interference, drama, and all of the actual pvpers leaving MIM (hi setti and zaria) have made it not only pointless, but a complete waste of time and energy on both sides. So I assure you, Im ready to &quot;clean up my act&quot; and move on.<br>
<br>
Personal note to MIM, I welcome any of you to drop me personal tells in game and tell me what &quot;grudges&quot; you still have. Anyone that doesnt have a kill shot of me, ill meet you in PoV and you can get out your frustrations. Beyond that, best thing i can do is take yall out for a beer. <br>

This was back when i played though, so he may have turned into a prick over the past 2 months.<br>
<br>
That said, shrug. I've seen Akorn train Seeknd, I've seen Kazug train Seeknd, I even saw UT train Seeknd (though i don't think that one was intentional), but the MiM all zone and its the DoZ running to the zone in with the mobs. Im sure DoZ has trained MiM too, but my point is Seeknd always seemed to be fighting in an honorable fashion. To be honest im surprised to read this application for many reasons- One, I didn't think he'd ever give up that pvp war, and Two, from my interactions with Seeknd I always thought he was like 12 years old =p but he proves me wrong with some decent articulation in this thread.<br>
<br>
I personally think its kinda bs for MiM to hold this kos but i mean its their guild so if they want to what can be done, but from my point of view Seeknd fought the good fight and the only people I see from MiM pushing for that perma kos are the ones who are looking for a little bitch to be their slave and aid in the removal of sand from their vaginas.<br>
<br>
Good luck Seeknd, hope shit works out for you. <br>

I never claimed to be good at pvp, and my smack talk is childs play compared to some of the stuff I've seen.  Most of you guys I really don't mind at all, is it so bad to want someone to fight in a game without hating them irl?  The only person that I wouldn't consider myself having a civil rivalry with is Sadko.  That guy just always got on my nerves.  Nothing personal, I just don't like you.<br>

Is it really that bad to be kos to us?  You may not get into AD because of it, but trust me....pvping us is more fun than elemental raids.<br>

He has NEVER once trained me (and training I promise is something I never forget).  Any accusation of training on his part I dont think is part of his charactor based on my past experiances of pvp against him.

Your behavior then was bullish and the same male posturing that I exp w/ Seeknd. I dont DO male posturing! <br>

Thats so funny considering the first umm month, maybe two months, of the war you were staying at 60 getting AA's while shit talking in /ooc saying how MIM was going down. Glad AD saw you for who you are.<br>

I was hoping this application would at the least open a forum to discuss the ideas of war and acceptable KoS policies, but I can see that no one is interested in dealing with the subject. <br>
<br>
Lohengrin, i attempted to talk to you in game, and give you my perspective on the situation, but obviously feedback from me was not important. I agree that I did not attempt to resolve KoS with MIM in this thread. This is an application to AD, not a forum on the MIM site to get in yet another flame war. I challenged MIM in this thread to bring up ANY valid arguement to why they continue to KoS people that leave a guild they are at war with, or offer any personal griefs with me beyond &quot;trash talking&quot;. I was hoping that AD would decide if I would be a good guildie based on my merits, not on another guilds power trips. <br>
<br>
I also do not believe my &quot;conduct has been both rude and lacking in any sense of humility&quot; in this situation. If anything i would consider it frustrated and jaded. Since this war has started, there has not been 1 MIM officer since Tavil to take responsibility and deal with such issues. I have talked MANY times with Aolis, Hesikih, Machaveli, Miradori, and even Inka over the last 8 months. Since I left DoZ, Aolis told me to deal with people that &quot;have an issue&quot; with me. Rakizi told me to &quot;not bother&quot;. Inka will not respond to me at all anymore. Not ONE post on this application from MIM gave ANY reason for my KoS status or their inability to let go and move on. Not ONE post gave any kind of solution or ultimatum by MIM to resolve the situation.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I think this application highlighted my opinions very well. I think that Sighkox post are the BEST example MIMs policy. Sigh and I had a decent relationship when he was in reverent. He joined MIM months after the original war was over, and has no legitimate connection or beef with anyone in DoZ. Yet, he decides his opinions are valid enough to post on my application to AD and attempt to keep me from moving on for WHAT REASON? &quot;Well considering I havent played in 2 months&quot;- then what the fuck do you care. You dont play and you joined the guild 5 months after war started yet &quot;you wont support letting Seeknd off KoS&quot; because? <br>
<br>
&quot;but trust me....pvping us is more fun than elemental raids.&quot;<br>
So, you feel sabotaging my recruitment to AD so you have something to do after raiding is legitimate? get help dude, serious help.<br>
<br>
One last subject to touch upon. Does AD respect everyone KoS lists equally? If DoZ decides to keep ex- MIM members kos after they deguild until they work it out with them would AD reject their applications as well? Would this have affected Tavil and Kattara as well, or even Koorn, Cepheus, and Faerluna now? I feel it is important to have some kind of permanant policy reguarding wars and kos on the server to keep guilds from &quot;punishing&quot; people who dare to fight back for there guild. Otherwise guilds like MIM will continue to suck the fun out of pvp and guild wars, undermining what RZ is and should be all about. <br>
<br>
Thanks for your time and consideration,<br>
