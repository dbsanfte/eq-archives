My friend and former guildmate Redwin offered to sponsor me and after some thought I decided it would be something worth pursuing. <br>
<br>
I'm sure some of you know me. I've been around for along time on RZ, first as Serras and now as my monk Everas. Currently my monk is lvl 60 with fairly decent gear (magelo #33117). I've spent the last few years on EQ doing events, first as a member of Sabbat and then more recently as an officer in Synergy. I've also been involved in most of the major wars on the server on one side or another. So I'd like to offer AD my help at events as well as my loyalty in any future PvP issues.<br>
<br>
Anyways after my experiences in Synergy I've come to the conclusion that I don't really like message boards, abit too impersonal maybe. If anyone has any questions or concerns for me I'd be more than happy to speak in game or in IRC. <br>
<br>
Hope to see you all in game,<br>

Everas would make a fine addition to any guild on RZ.  He's a dedicated player, fine individual and skilled at playing his class.  Quite honesty, he brings a good deal to the table from his experinces in PVP/PVE/Leadership on RZ that make him a very valuable resource.  You simply won't go wrong adding him.<br>
<br>
I'm sure by now, some malcontents/hate mongers have tried to portray Everas in poor light.  I urge you to investigate those issues yourselves before you make any decisions on Everas.  I'm sure one or two people will go out of their way talking about Everas, and the vast majority of this information will be incorrect.<br>
<br>
Everas was a solid guildmate of mine and I'm sure you will see what I mean if you take the chance on him.     <p>Arturo Illtemper <BR>

As far as him being a solid guildmate, I guess. If what you want is someone that can never be wrong, always knows best, publicly berates his guildmates in guildchat with profanity and name calling and deguilds people who don't agree with them....then ya hes solid. <br>
<br>
Everas comes with alot of baggage but as long as he keeps his ego and mouth in check he should be ok but then again we've all seen that is nearly impossible for him. <br>

I have actually always respected your posts so I'm curious about a few things..<br>
<br>
I'm not here to debate whether or not everas makes a good leader.. for the sake of this post I'll say that there are some people who don't make good leaders for one reason or another but who otherwise would be/are good guildmates.. <br>
<br>
That being said, I also realize what its like to lead people and how frustrating that can be at times, and while I prefer not to resort to cursing at people.. Well, sometimes it's happened <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I've yet to meet a GOOD leader who didnt make regular mistakes.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, the complaints you posed about ebon seem more directed at his role as a leader.. most specifically &quot;deguilding people who disagree with him&quot; as far as I can tell this would only be an &quot;officer/council&quot; function.<br>
<br>
Are you minimizing his overall contribution as a member? And do you really think its impossible for him to keep his &quot;ego in check&quot;? Even under new management?<br>
<br>
My personal past history with him extends well back even before the Sabbat was formed and into the SR days (god help me its true), and I always experienced him to be loyal, dedicated and fair; however, I do agree he can be hot-tempered.. but if that alone was excusion criteria one of my favorite and best performing clerics would be gone from ad too!  Ebon was also a very good member of The Sabbat during his active time, and as far as I can tell, he was also the same in synergy.  In fact, the positive alliance between AD and synergy was formed by ebon and affinity on synergy's part.<br>
<br>
Tavil: I asked everas to post once his kos issues were cleared, after long talks with perp he thought they were and posted; however we are aware now that there were internal problems with that &quot;decision&quot; and that it is currently being discussed (to my knowledge).  I hope that his application to AD wont influence the decision either way; however his status as a recruit is contingent upon him working out those problems.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=everas>Everas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(6/3/02 1:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=201.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My formal request to join</span><hr size=1> Hmm I hate to use ADs recruit board to post this but with the way this thread is going I think its in context.<br>
<br>
First thanks for your support Art. Always appreciated, especially when I need it most. =)<br>
<br>
Second Wardaen. Yes I did say some very harsh things during Synergy. I never really wanted a leadership position in that Sect but when most of the original leaders retired or left I felt obligated to try my best. From the point after Affinity left to when Kanleb took over I did everything I could to keep the Sect together and to handle any problems that arose. It was a huge challenge and one I honestly don't think I was really up to. If it seemed to you that I ignored others opinions or disregarded them completely you're wrong. I simply couldn't deal with internal strife in MiM as well as maintaining Synergy and preventing a war between MiM and tB/IE. I do regret some of the things I said then and afterwards though, even if I didn't say them alone. I do appologize though, to any MiM members I offended, particularly to Raddar. In the end I failed anyways, Synergy fell apart. I don't know whether people are better or worse off for it but its nolonger something that can ever be changed. I'm tired of RZ politics though and still very burnt out from Synergy. I don't ever want to be responsible for a Sect or guild again and I'm more than happy to let someone else call the shots. At this point I'd just like to move on and try to really enjoy the game again.<br>

<br>
Its no secret that Everas and I have clashed in the past and that we dont particularly like each other. However, I never wanted him to leave MIM despite the internal struggles that were going on that he largely helped to inflame. Everas had been with MIM for a long time, even during the UO days. So by his tenure alone, his opinion counted and as long as he stayed within the confines of fairly normal, respectful behavior he could have stayed in MIM for as long as he wanted. <br>
<br>
It only became more of an issue when the conflict of MIM and Synergy became more focused. Everas was very out of touch with the wants, needs, desires, thoughts etc. of the guild. He pursued his own agenda of what he thought was best and ignored and belittled anyone who disagreed with him and made excuses for the bullshit, all in an attempt to not make waves and keep MIM in Synergy. His ego took over and his main concern was to ensure the survival of Synergy rather then to ensure fair treatment of all within Synergy and to protect his own guilds interests. <br>
<br>
With this very obvious distancing of the guild and himself and his representation of it, guildmembers became upset, angry etc. that his focus was not on what they percieved to be the right thing but Everas was dead set on his own agenda regardless of what it did to MIM. Things became increasingly difficult and tension was at an all time high. Everas couldnt deal with people questioning his moves and it all boiled over with him leaving. <br>
<br>
Even though I was one of his critics he can tell you himself that I was one of the few that also extended him an olive branch in the hopes of him not leaving but trying to be more open to the guilds desires and to not be so demeaning to them. The damage to his ego though was too much and he couldnt face being in a guild that clearly did not respect him or want to follow him at that time. <br>
<br>
Everas was very irritated with what he viewed as being pushed out of MIM but make no mistake it was his choice to leave. Everas was very bitter and spiteful. So he joined the ranks of Kanleb and Kanleb fed the flames of anti MIM that Everas just ate up. Throughout Synergy, Everas had nothing but bad things to say about MIM and its members and on several occassions attacked certain members of MIM verbally with little or no provocation and butting into issues that clearly were none of his business any longer. With this came his backing up of a series of on going Bullshit moves by Kanleb and there was Everas defending the actions which continued to bring him in greater conflict with MIM.<br>
<br>
Synergy then splits up and MIM/TB/IE go thier own way and leave Wudan and DOZ. Kanleb decides to guild bridget even though he kos to all three guilds and war starts. Everas was present at the first part of that war and was involved with and approved of as an officer of DOZ the exp. killing, disturbing our events, training, corpse camping until res timers expired and if he says he wasnt present for those things hes lying. <br>
<br>
Which bring us to the present. So you see there is alot more to the Everas issue then just while he was in MIM. Now did he contribute in the raid setting as MIM or while in Synergy of course. If the question you are asking me is, is he competent, can he do the job then the answer is clearly yes.  However, if youre asking about his character then thats a different story. Of course everyone will have thier own opinions of him such as Arturo, which isnt surprising since they both were in Doz at one time.<br>
<br>
I think the real issue besides Everas attitude, his hurtful words and actions, its the betrayal of his former guild that really is still at issue here. Many people were deeply disappointed if not hurt by how he conducted himself and how he turned against us after being in MIM for so long. In truth, because the DOZ war is still fairly fresh, the wound from that has never fully healed and still festers to this day. Had he left MIM and not joined DOZ in synergy and took such an active roll to screw us over so many times and then not warred us his departure could have been dealt with and forgotten by this time. <br>
<br>
However Everas is very stubborn and to this day he states that he hates MIM, that when he came back his reason for doing so was to kill MIM on our message board only 18 days ago, he despises what MIM is today, he thinks he did no wrong and has nothing to apologize for. <br>
<br>
Koorn made a post joking around that he wanted more KOS. Now Everas could have ignored it etc. but no he just had to comment and fan the flames. Does this really sound like someone that wants off KOS?<br>

Ill be back soon hopefully... <br>
Miserable client got fucked up shortly after I made Isildr plug (hope ya dont miss me redneck). Anyway you guys can get back to your mindless vendetta against me soon as I manage to shake someone down for an instal cd. Though it'd be more amusing if all of you make sure to finish what you start. <br>

Im not saying everything was his fault but he clearly played a huge role in what happened and why and how we feel about him now.  So there in lies the problem, He wants off KOS to join AD but yet he refuses to apologize or to pay to get off our KOS and thinks all that happened should just be forgotten. <br>
<br>
So instead he now has gone around us and over our heads and appealed to Perplexer, which has has now made people even more irritated with him. Hes willing to post his view of the &quot;truth&quot; but not an apology. There are some like me that view loyalty as the foremost thing to judge someone on and if it were up to me he would remain KOS forever. Luckily for him, its not soley up to me and there are some in MIM who wish to just be done with him but in good conscience cant just let him off, when he shows no remorse and refuses to settle his KOS status just like others have had to do. <br>
<br>
In a way, Everas story is very tragic. We never wanted him to leave. We never wanted to dislike him. We never wanted to war him. However, to much water is under the bridge now for reconciliation. What he fails to recognize is its the winners in a war that dictate the terms of surrender. He wants his cake and eat it too. Since we know hes not really sorry, he can either meet our KOS terms and not bother with an apology or he can remain KOS. Personally, thats what Ill be pushing for but if he REALLY wants to get into AD then I suggest he makes his peace before its to late.<br>

Im sorry for the rambling, the one thing I wanted to communicate is how deep the issue goes here between MIM and Everas.  I would never want that to affect MIM and AD because the potential for problems to remain between MIM and Everas is real if this isnt settled and besides damnit...I like just about everyone in AD. Years ago no one would have dreamed Everas was capable of doing what he has done so I dont put it past him to try to spoil the relationship between AD and MIM down the road. Thats why I think its important for you to know just how serious we view Everas and his KOS status. <br>
<br>
If I were in your position and by no means do I mean to assume to tell you what to do or that I could run a guild as good as you but in my opinion, if i had the opportunity to take on a good monk and I didnt really need another monk, knowing his past, that he was a major player in drama in not only MIM and in synergy but in Doz, knowing the dislike many people now have for him....I personally wouldnt touch him with a ten foot pole.  <br>
<br>
Now am I minimizing his contributions? Ya i probably am. Why because we all have a part to play, we all do the job our classes dictate, most monks that level up thier character are proficient in doing their jobs, therefore you can pick ones up that wont nearly bring the baggage that Everas does. Whether or not you can keep his mouth and ego in check remains to be seen, Everas has a streak of doing what he wants, when he wants. But I guess its up to you whether or not hes worth giving a chance to and having to worry about if hell revert back to his MIM bashing.<br>

I know Ill never be friends with you again but at least I tried to let the past go. You however twist, manipulate and outright lie to attack me when I appologized for the only thing I've ever really done. <br>
<br>
First don't ever presume to know better my own motives than I do. I did want to keep Synergy together, very badly. I also was NOT GOING TO LET MIM GET FUCKED OVER IN THE PROCESS. I fought hard in Council meetings over that ridiculous scale incident to get MiM its fair treatment. I had people from tB tell me I was so stuborn on that count that they'd have liked to kos me personally for it. I also got the very real impression from them that if MiM left Synergy it was war. MiM was in no shape to fight IE and tB at the time, we'd barely made it out of our war with FU. But you decided you knew better than me. You weren't an officer and you had NO AUTHORITY but you decided to state your opinion of MiM's policy. Based on nothing more than a handful of supports you claimed you spoke for majority of MiM. Despite all of that you decided it was your decision to make, not mine, simply because no other officer could be bothered to take ANY INTEREST whatsoever in MiM. And yes I left very bitter, and as for your olive branch all I saw was you looking for an opportunity to gloat, kind of like what you're doing now.<br>
I took MANY very personal attacks from members of MiM and after all the shit I went through to get them their fair treatment in Synergy I decided I could never be guilded with them again.<br>
<br>
Second about the war. I was an officer in DoZ yes. I also left for college shortly after Synergy collapsed where I was not able to play on RZ. I did not condone any of the bullshit you just attributed to me and the only way I ever even heard about it was second hand. And I dare you to prove otherwise. I have no screenshots of kills from the war (which I almost always take) and I know noone has any screenshots of me dead or logs of me being present. So drop that attack even if you'll never admit to making it all up. <br>
<br>
As for my KOS status Plex was very clear with me and with the people online at the time. It is over. You and a handful of others however once again couldn't let it be. I heard about Isildr's fit in guildchat. I heard how he insulted my friends who tried to defend me, people he was guilded with. MiM's problem with me is much less widespread than you'd like to believe. And lets get another thing straight while we're here. You don't tell me who I do or do not hate. I make no secret of disliking several members of MiM. That does not mean I hate the guild. I still consider several members to be very good friends.<br>
<br>
All you've ever had against me is my reaction on message boards. When someone insulted me or my guild I had no problem insulting them back. When you ignored an order in MiM from an officer I got angry and I don't believe I wasn't justified. On retrospect I should have removed you personally for insubordination, especially after you admitted to me your reasons privately. But after all that I still offered you an appology where you've offered me nothing but venom and threats. If you're trying to portay me as the bad guy here you'll need to do better than over elaborate posts and outright lies about my participation in the recent war. Then again I appologize and you throw it back in my face, that seems pretty in character for you.<br>

You said,” I do apologize though, to any MiM members I offended, particularly to Raddar.”<br>
<br>
I pray and ask for the strength to forgive those who have harmed me daily. The guidance God gives me is best said in Saint Francis’ prayer, “it is in pardoning that we are pardoned: and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.”<br>
<br>
I accept your apology and wish you well.<br>

I have always liked Everas, I have always thought of him as a fair guy. Even during the DoZ war when people like Makita were running around PoM exploting faction and xp deathing my guildmates, and Dovairous was training shit around XXXXXXX zone in an attempt to make up for his surprising lack of any pvp skill, Everas played it fair always in my eyes and acted like a civil person should. <br>
<br>
Don't know what else I can say really, but I think he is a good guy and should be given a shot at whatever it is he decides to set his efforts toward joining.  <p>Sirdario of Rallos Zek<BR>

Thats fairly standard leadership role right there here is a recent post by officers in my guild concerning same deal<br>

First off, anyone that wants to write an e-mail is welcome to. What I don't want happening in game is alot of people flooding the GMs, Let me make this clear, If your name isn't officername or guildleadername you are not to speak on behalf of Vexare to any GM. You do not know what we have discussed and are willing to accept, so I don't want to log in anymore and hear about conversations that happened with the GMs today. Officername and I will be the ONLY 2 voices representing Vexare in game. Please understand this and comply.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> &lt;- in regards to GM fuckups on tier tests with super mobs(tunare had aary ae in addition to her normal abilities)<br>
<br>
Sounds like Everas did what most guild leaders would do.. Expect that they and the officers who are informed would state guild policy.. The second quote was my guild leader telling the guild basicaly the same thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
So Wards post just sounds like hes complaining about how Everas did his job, but Everas's explination seems to be in line with how most guilds are run. The times that Ive interacted with Everas were always fair, I cant think of anyone hes treated unfairly while I was guilded with him so I know putting people down in guildchat isnt a trait that he tends to have, musta been a serious personality clash<br>

Everas is NOT KOS to MiM by june 1st, what Tavil posted was wrong by that day. probably he spoke for IE but not for MiM (he is IE and not MiM member)<br>
<br>
the everas issue is a ongoing discussion on our boards (which dont work atm) and his status wont change until we solved it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=201.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=201.topic&start=41&stop=56>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=201.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=201.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=201.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.threadControl?topicID=201.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=201.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=201.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Gimp's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5>Recruitment Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
