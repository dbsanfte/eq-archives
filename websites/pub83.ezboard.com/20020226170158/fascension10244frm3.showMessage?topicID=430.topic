As most of you have all seen, lying, misinformation, and half truths are about the only thing Josheb and PB are even remotely good at. Unfortunately, as always, Piss had to delete my post -- because to put it simply, he knows he was owned. :0<br>
<br>
So I'm going to repost it here, where he can't do a damn thing except like it. We only need a snippet of his original message to see just how moronic he really is.<br>
<br>
---- Begin PB bullshit ----<br>
<br>
(BTW - You must be the same person that counts 100 of us in NTOV when we do events. This is starting to make sense.)<br>
<br>
-Josheb<br>
<br>
---- End PB bullshit ----<br>
<br>
LMAO, this is hilarious. It was in fact a PB that originated this little rumor. One night not long ago, AD were doing NToV, Synergy was doing Dozekar, and some random guilds (OM or SOTS?) were doing HOT armor mobs. This brought the total  zone population to around 105 or thereabouts. So a PB_gimp01 zones in, and exclaims, in all his stupidity, something along the lines of &quot;haha AD need 105 ppl do NToV dragon~~&quot;. Ever since then, it's been sort of an inside joke among the guild. (As you could clearly see if you read Neckros' suck news updates!)<br>
<br>
So if an AD said this to you in the past, it was MAKING FUN of the factless garbage your spin-doctoring members like to spew out on a constant basis. The propaganda machine hard at work, no doubt.  But hell, I'm sure that collective of mediocrity you call a guild has grown accustomed to being the laughing stock of the server by now.<br>
<br>
Oh and one last thing. When's the last time you filthy cumstains killed a NToV dragon since they removed the gimp factor? (i.e. cohing to your safe-spot and scavenging the few easy dragons you could kill while the rest of us work/sleep) None? Damn, it must suck to be you? <br>
<br>
And no, Ikitiar the Weaksauce doesn't count. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ualtaris.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Altaris</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/02 12:35:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=430.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.theotaku.com/gundam/pictures/shot57.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To my dear friends, Josheb and Piss.</span><hr size=1> Yup, it was Synergy in part of HoT, and Reverant in the other part of HoT, while you guys were doing NToV.<br>

Actually, it wasn't recently. When we were doing NTOV and AD wasn't, that was the generic excuse. I haven't heard it said recently, but I heard it enough back then for it to stick out in my mind.<br>
<br>
Hearing you simpletons talk about your &quot;pvp dominance&quot; just brings back fond memories of your excuses back then.<br>

On another note, since you're now calling me a liar:  Please point out one place where I have ever lied on a message board.  Just one.  (Or even somewhere where you think I'm lying.)  I'm really interested to hear this, since I have absolutely no reason to lie to any of you, and I don't.<br>
<br>
BTW, Kilyin, the one and only time I've ever seen you PVPing was on the Thurg / GD zone line, where you promptly pulled the plug to avoid PVP death.  Don't fault me for using one of my spells to get out of a bad situation .. at least I don't exploit the game engine.  (But hey, according to Neckros, exploiting in that manner is a &quot;valid part of PVP&quot; ..)  As he would say, lol?<br>

There was already one wizard luring me, a druid nuking me, a shaman, and a necro... then Josheb zones in and starts to cast a lure. So, yes, I zoned... and plugged. My machine was rather shitty at the time also, everyone zoned faster than me. It was still wrong to plug I will concede, but I did, and I've got the balls to admit it. That problem has been remedied now though. <br>
<br>
PB doing NToV before AD? You didn't. You used pussy coh tactics and killed Jorlleag (wow, that's quite an accomplishment) before us. It was AD that was the first to REALLY DO NToV on RZ (That means clear it, not scavenge it).<br>
<br>
As for lying in posts ... read much? My entire post was based on your lie Josheb. So you want me to show you where you're lying on a msg board. You're doing it right now.<br>

In regards to NTOV, we DID NTOV before you did.  We killed multiple dragons there BEFORE you did.  I don't give a fuck what your definition of &quot;DID&quot; is, we were there before you, end of story.<br>

In regards to me lying -- please pull the text out of your original post (or anywhere in this thread) where I'm lying.  I understand that the first post by you was dedicated to me, but I don't see the part where I lied.  (Sorry, I guess I'm slow?)<br>

Since I already know what you're going to say..  Anything starting with &quot;You must..&quot; is an assumption, and does not qualify as a lie.  Are you going to start telling me what I assume and what I don't assume?<br>
<br>
Sorry to get technical there, but you and I both know what I said was a joke more than anything.  Feel free to point out where I lie in the future if you see me posting anywhere else.  Until then, I accept your apology.<br>

I go back to pb cause its easy for me to help pb seeing the guild chat and such, just cause i left pb dont think i ever stoped helping them dunno why youd even assume that. Although i really dont see why this concerns you AD so much. And yes i am not guilded formitas but i will help them with anything they ask of me, they are a small guild of people that dont pvp much or spend much time playing eq but when their on i enjoy hanging with those guys as much as i do with pb. Guess its hard for you to grasp the concept of haveing friends in 2 different guilds.<br>
<br>
 Id also like to state i wish formitas would all join back to pb or vise versa but outstanding differences will not allow this so i respect my friends descions and still have fun with all of them. If this makes me a loot whore well i guess i am. <br>
