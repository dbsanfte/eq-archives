I summarise the point then my response.<br>
<br>
1.  &quot;If we want to kos someone cause of the face model they picked, we will do so.&quot;<br>
It is a guild's prerogative to kos anyone they so desire.  However, if you kos someone for capricious, whimsical or random reasons, that to me is a decent working definition of random pking. Just because you have the power to act without reproach doesn't mean you should act in this way.<br>
<br>
2.  &quot;You are in our house, comport yourselves accordingly, we are only considering the views of AD members /inits here.&quot;<br>
Agree on the first part, i personally am not one for smack talking and discourage it on my guild boards.  Disagree with the second part.  A point of view can still have merit even if it doesn't emanate from within your guild. Deleting trash talk posts is good with me.  Deleting / removing reasonable posts seems disrespectful.<br>
<br>
3.  &quot;This is not for debate, this is a diktat.&quot;<br>
Its hard not to sound arrogant saying this. It doesn't really seem to give any chance to any dos member to argue their case, or persuade ad. Perhaps ad have debated this internally, or in tells with some dos.  However, it does seem somewhat unfair to pass a death sentence on a guild without giving them any sort of recourse to argue their case.<br>
<br>
4. &quot;DoS help pkers.&quot;<br>
I am not really aware of any of the facts of this so can't really comment.  Except to say that a while ago (maybe 6 months?) i was in a cross guild chat about lucid vision. As far as i remember, it was me (celestial empire), cotw, temerity and tekas from dos.  tekas did seem to be mad keen on hitting back at lucid vision, and this was the point of the channel. (yes lv, we were obviously very succesful at it which is why your guild has almost disbanded <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , ok, idea never really got of the ground then)<br>
<br>
5. &quot;Dos is full of ex/random pkers or pbers&quot;<br>
To be fair, you guys did say that wasn't a reason why you were warring.  But there have been suggestions that this justifies it.  I am quite sure we could all go through adepts site and find the ex pkers in all guilds.  I know we have a few in ours that are trying rehabilitation and there is always that question mark over them. However, this can be said of all guilds, so cannot be a valid reason for picking on one only.<br>
<br>
Some may say, why stick up for dos here? well, now it is time for some mangled and half remembered quotes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I don't wish to trivialise something as evil as nazism, but there was a quote about it along the lines of &quot;when they came for the communists i said nothing, when they came for the jews i stayed silent, when they came for the gypsies i opened not my mouth. when they came for me, there was no-one left to fight for me&quot;. I have no particular love for dos, but i am unhappy about ad having a policy where they can kos people because they don't like the face they picked. Therefore, i speak up now.<br>
<br>
There is always a danger amongst the high level guilds that some of them may turn into what i would call HLA, High Level A'holes. I have to say, that i haven't seen this in AD before.  However, as people get more powerful, more out of range of others, as any pvp incident would become more lopsided, the danger is that (quote time again) &quot;power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;. It becomes possible for the high level guild player to:<br>
kos another guild<br>
train a zone without warning<br>
pk for  percieved insults<br>
take mobs without any heed paid to mob rotations etc.<br>
<br>
Yes of course, it is possible for a guild like AD to say &quot;we will do what we want, when we want it, and we will be beholden to no-one, and we will do it because we can do it&quot;. That way lies the way of the archetypal HLA.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this post too long now.  Next week i debate &quot;do unto others as you would have done unto you&quot; as forming the ethical basis for interguild relations with reference to JS Mills &quot;harm to others&quot; rationale and Rawls &quot;minimum accepted postion&quot; postulations.<br>
<br>
PS. Just to make sure there can be no confusion, i am not any in way implying that AD are nazis or HLA. Only real HLA on this server is kadarx and he too dumb to read AD boards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Bollix Braker <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Warlord <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Officer <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Celestial Empire <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

<br>
let me sum it up for you.<br>
<br>
WE DONT HAVE TIME FOR STUPID MESSAGE BOARD WARS, WE MADE UP OUR MIND NOW LIVE WITH IT.<br>
<br>
The fact that AD operates a public message board is for the good of the community, we dont need to use it to justify our actions. Tohde and Theis and a good many other AD members work 10+ hour days in the real world.<br>
<br>
Also if you didnt want to compare AD to Nazis then you should have thought of a better analogy, in case your english teacher didnt tell you what that was , cause thats exactly what you did.<br>
<br>
I for one highly resent it as I lost most of my extended family in the Holocaust.  I think you need to choose your words a bit better when talking about a game.  I read how you weren't trying to tivialize nazism , yet you use it as a frame of reference talking about the most trivial of all mans pursuits, A GAME.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes perhaps me and the rest of the AD stormtroopers are coming for you next, all you need to do is piss us off.  <br>
<br>
And if you do aggrevate us to the point that we decide to kill you, which takes a lot btw, I dont think we are going to have time to post a 10 page dissertation on why we have decided to kill a toon in a game. <br>

In that respect, I believe AD has a right to judge in situations like this.  Our reasons may seem frivolous to the &quot;neutral&quot; perspective, but unfortunately the insight most people have on the situation is pretty limited.<br>
<br>
AD alone has the power to crush almost any guild on the server.  The fact that we are instead a very cooperative and overall positive presence speaks volumes on our authority to arbitrate violence. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=quillarstav>QuillarStav</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 439<br> <font color=#333333>(12/16/02 8:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=109.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/quillarstav/ WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a neutral view's view on AD/DoS war</span><hr size=1> <br>
      I'm still semi-retired, but I'd like to put my 2 cents in.  In the last real war of this server that AD was in(FU/PB/BoK vs. AD/MiM/TB), we made a policy that helping our enemies via. buffing them, grouping with them etc. was unacceptable.  This policy still stands.  Now there are some overly aggressive types in AD that would war others fairly easily, but there are also others that mitigate this by requiring proof and opening a dialogue with the offending persons/guild to try and rectify the situation.  We don't allow personal KOS lists, much to the chagrin of many of our members, and thus if someone is KoS to one of us, they are KoS to all of us.  There are people that even the officers would love to KoS but don't simply because that grudge is personal, rather than guild oriented.  It's easy to read the spam that the spinmasters post and come to a different conclusion I'm afraid.  Spending the time argueing with them won't change their mind if their sole purpose is character assassination.  As the guild that has done the most on Rallos, we are a big target for these people and thus, we stopped listening.  Yes some legitamite, honorable posts are lost as a result, which is unfortuneate but there seems little we can do to separate them out.  <br>
