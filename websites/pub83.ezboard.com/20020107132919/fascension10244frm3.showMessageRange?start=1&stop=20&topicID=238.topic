If what I say ends up being contradictory with any of my TRUE BoK brothers or officers, I will re-post an apology, and step down from BoK.<br>
<br>
This post is directed to the former BoK members and others that have crawled to this board to seek asylum.  Some of you in BoK are the reason why we are even in a war with AD.  The only word that comes to mind when I read a post like zzedd's is pathetic.  Not because he doesn't want to fight, but he would sit back and acknowledge Ruhi's comment about &quot;are you sorry for the sins you committed against AD.&quot;  Zzedd, you request is even more pathetic after reading that.<br>
<br>
BoK has been at war with one guild or another for as long as I can remember.  We have taken our share of beatings, and we have given them out.  We have fought guilds that outnumbered us 10-1 but we have never surrendered or groveled to anyone to end any war.  This will not changed.  We will not kiss anyone's ass for the sake of peace.<br>
<br>
With that being said, I have posted on our MoTD that no BoK is to attack any AD unless they are attacked first.  We will not interfere with any event that AD is participating in, regardless with whom, will try to avoid even going near such event, and again, will not attack ANY in that event group unless they attack us first.  If that is the case, I will still adhere to the statement that BoK will not attack AD, unless AD initiates it.  This would also include any kind of help given to a Guild fighting us.  <br>
<br>
Our war with synergy will continue, but only if it does not interfere with an event that AD is part of.  If synergy guilds want to agree to what I have said  - that is fine. we can end that too.<br>
<br>
The ball is now in your court.  You can vote on ending this war, and it will end, or you can vote to continue it, and it will continue.<br>
<br>
Livre and I were in KD today talking, and we decided to duel.  We were doing it for fun, until Booyea comes in and starts attacking.  Well, I zoned out and asked Livre what was up, but he had crashed.  I ask Booyea, and his comment to me was that he killed me then, and he will continue to kill me and all other BoK until we disband.  Well, I didnt die, and BoK will never disband.  Booyea also didnt know Livre and I were dueling for fun.<br>
<br>
If we continue this war, we will not go head to head with groups, we will change our tactics to guerilla warfare.  We will sit in hiding and wait for AD to engage in mobs, and then kill them, the same way Xezzt and Synthol did to me the other day.  They sat and watched me fight 3 mobs, dispelled all my buffs and waited to see if the mobs would kill me.  When they didn't, they attacked me.  To me, that is no different that my rooting someone waiting on a CR and then training a mob on them for an xp loss.<br>
<br>
Don't take these as threats, dont take any of this as shit-talking.  It is peace that BoK seeks.<br>
<br>
One final thing to all you guilds out there, remember the people that turned their backs on their guildmates and quit when they were most needed.  Do any of YOU want them watching your back if needed?  I would rather watch my own, than to have to rely on a coward that will run and waive the white flag at the first time of trouble.<br>

Darkfyre, fuck you. I was with BOK to the bitter end, and I was the only person that talked with you at length about my departure before hand.  You singled ME out over ALL the other people that just slipped out without saying a word? <br>
<br>
Incase I did not make myself clear as a fucking crystal to you, I left BOK for one reason, and no other:  BOK is/was too inactive.<br>
<br>
BOK has a chronic ailment. It never does anything. We weren't PVEing, we werent PVPing.  Either of which would have cured my boredom, but you chose to do neither. Basically, you failed as a leader, and your crew abandoned ship.<br>

AD may beat us, but they will never humiliate us.  Ruhi's comment to you should have humiliated you.  But you let it go without so much as a comment.  THAT is why I used your post.

I will be very curious to see exactly how many guilds are lining up to ask you to join.  Maybe other Guilds don't take into consideration someone turn-tail and running because they are at war.  Maybe AD, MiM, TB, etc... will open their arms up to you, but regardless of what I think of any of them, I don't believe they add people just for the sheer numbers in the Guild.  BoK WAS guilty of this.  We gave too many people officer status, and consequently admission rules were broken and ignored and we paid the price for it.  We had people quitting when things got a bit too hot for them.  <br>
<br>
Zzedd what can YOU offer any Guild, no more in ablility than any other player.  Could anyone of Rile, Kasg, Staff, Arkar, Jookie, myself, and anyone else I missed,  add much more in ability to make any other Guild better - no.  But one thing we have, will always have, and can offer is loyalty.  And that is what makes a Guild great.  <br>
<br>
BoK was a great guild.  Not because we were the biggest or the best, but because we were loyal to each other unconditionally.  That changed when we opened ourselves up to new players.  We became bigger, but we lost the foundation on what Kasg built BoK on, loyalty to each other.  We are getting it back, it may take some time, but none of the people that truly matter are going anywhere.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zzedd>Zzedd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(11/11/01 12:51:10 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Zzedd</span><hr size=1> Loyalty is a wonderful thing, but it must be earned.<br>

You have been in BOK much longer than I, and obviously, before my membership, Rile and Kas had earned your loyalty.<br>
<br>
Rile, Kas, and you had yet to earn my loyalty, however.  Full temple of veeshan armor, lvl 60, and primal warswords doesn't garner my respect, or command my loyalty.<br>
<br>
The ability to lead a guild garner's my respect, and commands my loyalty.<br>
<br>
The current state of Blood of Kings proves that you are incapable of leading, so on what grounds do you ask for my loyalty? Your shiny ToV armor?<br>
