<br>
Back when FC nerfed MA fist crits in PvP I threw in the towel.  About a month ago they finally reversed themselves on that - now our crits are just nerfed with anything BUT fists and MA weapons.  Well seeing as how my major bitch had been addressed I decided to give it another go.<br>
<br>
So over the last month of so I've leveled to 195 ( as of this writing) as a base line for which portion of the game i'm refering to.<br>
<br>
Here's what I've found, keep in mind this is only one persons opinion and you shoudl form your own:<br>
<br>
1) MA's are still the profession that fell between the cracks.  The damage is decent, the ability to take it also decent, and the ability to heal still sucks ass ( no shock there ).  I'll go into these in more depth later.<br>
<br>
2) Our ability to buff a group basically falls down to these buffs: <br>
Mark of X ( crit hit buff which some people will now tell you they don't want / need )<br>
  <br>
Evades ( which most people prefer fixer run speed programs too -those overwrite our evades btw )  <br>
<br>
AC buffs ( which any other prof that has AC programs can do better then MA's at ) <br>
<br>
Dirty Fighter ( which occasionally some Enforcer will ask for ).<br>
<br>
Now on the upside it's generally only Enforcer that will tell ya not to bother with MoP ( and in all honesty they really don't need it - their new weapons are based around need to crit but on solid scary consistant damage output ).  You'll still be buffing the  Mark of X line on your team ( these programs really need a group cast instead of taking two or three recharges to buff the rest of the group )<br>
<br>
3) PvE - lots of new stuff in the ql 201+ range - including implants.  As a title 6 MA I could get into ql 220 implants without much trouble - if they where actually available.  Plan on spending a lot of cash or a ton of time blitzing if you actually want to see yourself in these.  This leads to another point - ninja'n seems to be on the rise - with FC new policy an ARC won't do jack if someone in team ninja's a no drop ( have fun with that one folks ) their stance is that if your in the kill team it's not a ninja loot if it's snagged while the group is rolling to see who get's it.<br>
<br>
Triple wielding ( 2 ma weapons + fists ) appears to still be broken - hell i'm not entirely sure duel wielding a MA weapon with fists is worth while - it will still bug out sometimes ( though not nearly as badly as it used to ) and require you to remove the weapon in order to get it swinging again.<br>
<br>
News on Specials: there's a new one called Upon a Wave of Summer - it's a root breaker, and in that capacity it's not bad, but I've got an issue with a root breaker that's only usable once ever ~4 minutes.  It also uses your Riposte skill ( though it a fairly sane req - 511 riposte for a ql 200 UaWoS if remember correctly ) and it's got the nicety if of being dropable ( so you can trade for it or buy it ).<br>
<br>
Flower of Life is working - can and will save your butt.  This is one that having one over ql 200 is really nice, and the req's are still pretty sane.  For a ql 200 it's a 2500 hit point heal when it hits ( and about ~4 minutes recycle time ).  It's a save your butt button - not a regular item to count on imo.<br>
<br>
No new programs - unless you wheren't around for the addition of the Mark of _____ / Presence of _____ lines.<br>
<br>
4) PvP - when crossbows got changed to basically tell MA's to keep their hands off them we really got our options limited for any ranged ability.  The best advice I can give in the ranged combat area is the highest ql Pow Bow you can get yourself into without gimping your fists for pve ( unless you are only pvp'ing of course ).  I've also noticed a lack Pow Bows as boss loot - haven't seen one in a month of missioning.  <br>
<br>
Shen ( the special attack ) has been nerfed to hell and gone - don't even bother with it - Blessed with Thunder now does more damage in PvP and PvE now. A Shen with a 751 Dimach req is now hitting for about 600 inital damage and then DoTing for about 150 points ( literally i @#%$ you not ) and of course.. the skill lock is still 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Dimach still has the annoying habit of being parried in PvE, and it's still a suicide bombing run in PvP.<br>
<br>
On the up side: we do have a root breaker - Upon a Wave of Summer ( as mentioned before ), and Flower of Life IS finally working ( as mentioned before ).  Given that you can reduce root timers with a special type of FA kit now - I'd recommend that FoL be the one you save your timer for.<br>
<br>
I won't even get into a comparative with other professions - let's just say Enforcers are king of the hill in damage and hit points ( if they aren't rooted <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5) Game play! <br>
<br>
Okay exp groups are some times a pain in the butt to find and / or get togather.  On the upside being able to pull 16 to 24million exp off one mission makes up for it some what.  <br>
<br>
If you're in an org that has bases for Notum wars - the contracts your org has ( do a /org contract to check out what your org has going for it ) can be a huge boost in your ability to use programs.  Additionally - if missioning isn't your cup of tea and your tired of arena pvp - notum wars may be just the ticket for you.  If you can stomach the lag ( which isn't too horribly bad on min video settings when crowd limiting is in effect ) then fighting base defense / offense can be a lot of fun.  Mostly it's a disorganized mess of throwing massive numbers at something and hoping that works.  I've yet to see any reall strategy employeed by the Clans or OT.  Beyond the initial scouting - tactics seem to consist of the aggressor either having overwhelming numbers - or if they don't - playing a game of tag with the defenders from the suppresion gas line ( stupid boring and lame ).<br>
<br>
Clearly this game needs some master strategists on both sides of the conflict that actually has the command and control skills needed to make this more then what it currently consists of - a brawl.  Notum wars combat is very straight forward with little or no innovation.  <br>
<br>
Overall - it's still AO.  There is some new stuff, new armors most notably, but over all not a lot has changed.  MA's just aren't as nerfed ( still playable - but certainly not one of the power house professions ).  In short we are still generalists and do very little better then any other profession.<br>
<br>
About the only this a well set up Ma will do better then most is damage is over time, but there are other professions better at that to ( so don't be surprised ).<br>
<br>
<br>
That about wraps it up, hope it helps get you the highlights of info you need to make an informed decision about your return.<br>

You're basically right about NW just being about mass confusion and overwhelming numbers. But I've been seeing people employing more tact rather than the lemming approach a bit more often now. Works fairly well as long as you persevere. <p>Bellerephon, Master of All Cool Engi's<br>
