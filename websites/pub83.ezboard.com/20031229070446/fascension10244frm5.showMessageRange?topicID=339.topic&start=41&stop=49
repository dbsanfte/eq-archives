<br>
I love EQ because I have fun playing, loads of fun.  That is why I play, and the reason I have fun in the high end game that I am at is:<br>
<br>
Achievement being able to accomplish something to make me feel good, like taking down a mob.<br>
<br>
Friends to be with,  people I look up to and like.<br>
<br>
Improve my character in both levels, playstyle, and equipment.<br>
<br>
I have had fun in the last 2 months as an AD recruit doing just that.  <br>
<br>
I feel accomplished because I was a small part of a group that did a dozen 1sts on the server, saw mobs that I thought I would never see, and I helped kill them. <br>
<br>
I have met and made many friends and many people I like playing with in AD also and not to forget many of them recruits who helped me as I helped them and we managed to have fun even when tediously campoing shards!  For that friendshisp and support I thank you.<br>
<br>
I have improved my character, mainly with the understanding of how far i have to go and how much more stuff I can do to become a really good tank.  I didn't get scared of that, I think it motivated me to work harder to get there.<br>
<br>
To the people who migh have misunderstood me, the above is what I seek...oh and to be truthfull to myself.  And being able to be who I am and not pretend and try to guess what I can say to please people.  I am aggressive, yes.  In a positive way. I want to help all as a group to be the best we can and will do everything I can to help us get there.  I ask a lot of questions because I think by learning from people who know better then I do I can be of more use to everyone, to the guild.<br>
<br>
So what I have to offer to you today is the same as I did 2 months ago, (albeit I am 4 levels higher and a dozen of aa's higher have some more hp and some better weapons, and a bucnh of flags) but the MOST valuable thing that has not changed from that day 2 months ago  and I shall offer to all of you one more time today is something else.  I offer to you someone who will work hard together with you, who will never betray you or turn you down in anyway, who is loyal and will say things as he sees them. A friend to some, a good warrior to others...that is what I offer.<br>
<br>
Whatever the outcome of the vote is thank you Atsuko, Tohde, Vans, Malio for believeing in me enough to sponsor me.<br>
<br>
Thx all of my friends for being cool to me. Later guys.<br>

Although over half the guild has not voted yet as to my recruitement status and I have a chance to be able to continue, I feel that an acceptance with 51 vs 49 type vote is the same as a rejection to me.<br>
<br>
I like to believe in what I do and give 110% of myself and I can only do that when I feel were all on the same team.  Knowing that half of the people around me dont feel this way will prevent me from being all I can for the guild.<br>
<br>
AD lost a very loyal and hardworking potential member today, and a good friend.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks to most AD recruits who are a GREAT bunch of people for not making me fell guildless when I was.  Thanks to my 4 sponsors for believing in me.  <br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>

If nothing else perserverance in the face of this would be a tremendous demonstration of your character, and would probably serve to remove some of the doubts a few people have about you.<br>
<br>
It is very rarely too late to do something right, or redo something you care about, correctly.<br>

<br>
I am late in posting this (sorry Razz)..<br>
<br>
I have heard countless comments about how hard it is to be a recruit for AD, the suffering, the pain, the hardship....<br>
<br>
My view on this may be a little &quot;warped&quot;, however, I haven't found being a &quot;recruit&quot; difficult.  I have found, getting VT/EMP keys, catching up gear wise, exp wise, aa wise difficult.   I have found being a new cleric to the awesome rank of clerics &quot;trying&quot; at times.  There are times that I have just walked away from the computer a to prevent my mouth from overloading my butt...<br>
<br>
I don't know Razz from before being a recruit...I guess being from a different server sort of gives me an advantage in that I don't have pre-formed opinions on anyone - it gives me the opportunity to either like or dislike based on the &quot;person&quot; not the past guilds/actions.<br>
<br>
Razzinel, tries very hard.  Maybe times too hard (I think we (recruits) all do at some point.)   Has there been times where he has gotten &quot;pushy&quot;, I would say yes.  But in his defense, or as I have viewed it is - he is a &quot;warrior&quot; and by thier very nature are or can be pushy people - they have to be.  I think throughout the whole process we all (recruits) do stuff to cause folks to doubt or wonder about us.  And as a recruit - we look at each other - examine the people we call fellow recruits and recognize that these folks are potential guildmates.  I know I am just a recruit - but I feel I must step forward because being a recruit with Razz has fostered a friendship, and well...I don't want to see him go away.  Like I said, I don't know his past, I just know him currently.<br>
<br>
Best of luck on the vote Razz...and I whole heartedly agree with Theis, stick it out.  If nothing else, you didn't quit.<br>
<br>

<br>
I don't think that AD and Razzinel are ready for each other just yet.  Maybe some day in the future we can try this again with the new knowledge and wisdom gained from this past recruitment trial period. Time heals wounds, and has a nice way of forgetting small details and only retaining the good, important stuff. Who knows? Only time will tell.<br>
<br>
I would appreciate it moderators if you can lock this thread, so that the Durja's of the world don't clutter it with stupidity and filth.<br>
