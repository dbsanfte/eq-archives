Most of my hits are in the high 20s and low 30s unbuffed. I do brawls for anywhere from 50 to 160(rare). I was fairly happy with my character until an enforcer I group with got 2 very nice swords. He now hits for anywhere from 60 to 130 regularly. He is within 2 levels of me and he does twice the damage. How can MA's compete with this? Enforcers have more HP's and with the right equipment do much more damage. With very average swords enforcers do as much or a little less damage then MA's at this level. This leads me to believe one of two things. We are basically a broken class and just plain suck as long as enforcers and other professions keep up on they're gear OR we become usefull and powerful later on. I believe its the first one because enforcers and the like will continue to get good weapons as they move on and we will be stuck with fists. The only possibilities of becoming half usefull seem to be either starting to use weapons or just changing professions. I realize its early in the game and I am early in the game so I am not going to quit MA. I was just hoping someone on this board would say &quot;I played a ma in beta 3 to level 183 and your wrong&quot; so all of you experienced players please reply here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=byteme>byteme</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#660000>(7/6/01 2:43:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Problems with MA's</span><hr size=1> No answer for you from me, just wanted to respond with &quot;that sounds really sucky.&quot; Hope we turn out better then.

<br>
I'm not here to troll, but are you that concerned about how much damage you do compared to another class already?<br>
<br>
I played an enforcer in beta, and I can tell you, they don't get Dimach (unless they forgo ALOT of IP).<br>
<br>
Just wanting to take a look at how &quot;sucky&quot; this really is from an overal outlook.  Didn't seem like all things where taken into consideration.<br>
<br>
I was wondering one more thing.  How do you do soloing etc.?  I mean, if you suck you suck.  Regardless of how badarse someone else near your level becomes through other means.  Do you feel like you contribute to your groups?<br>
<br>
I guess my point is, instead of letting what the guy next to you is doing determine how sucky or badarse you feel, just play and let your own experiences dictate.<br>
<br>
Best of luck, <p><html>

<br>
As a Solitus MA, I hit regularly in the 20's to 30's with Brawl in the 40's to 60's at level 14. (Highest Dimach is 194 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Due to some of the nice 1hs weapons at higher levels I dump extra points (like from IP rings) into the appropriate skills. Which means I will have a high MM skill. Not entirely sure, but from what I hear, when you get the MM skill to the req level of the weapon, you hit with fists and sword (and there is no speed penalty in offhand) so I will be sticking a 1hs in my offhand ~ a 1hs that has brawl and dimach of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Also, there really is no need to have riposte imo. Go with Parry (since it is innate). Seems that riposte will only return a small percentage of the damage recieved (14 dmg recieved, 2 dmg with riposte, and it is maxed out for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>

I dont think we are that far away from them ,,but there's one other thing we are very good at which IMO makes us very worthwhile ,is our Healing abilities ,,apparently second only to a Doctor.<br>

<br>
   Grasshopers. What some of us fail to recall is that the martial arts description say... &quot;It can do alot of damage at the high levels.&quot;  I will repeat. High levels. Don't take this the wrong way, but 25th level out of 200 is still pretty small. <br>
When I decided to become a martial arts. I had a guess that at some point weapons would catch up, or out damage my combat ability. Why did I choose the MA? Simple. Bright greens in every single dodge skill. <br>
<br>
    We are hard to hit. Also consider we are working at 100%<br>
effiency every level with bare hands. The plus of that is we don't need ammo (unless your REALLY like the bow). The minus is we can't upgrade. So in damage output terms. We will probably be short next to weapons. That's ok. We have other advantages to take use of. A) Our defense. It is the best hands down, all other combat classes have light blue, we have light green. B) Dual weild has chance to hit penalties. Thus we forsake tons of damage per hit, for much more accurate hits. C) Our nano skills. We aren't far behind in our choices of casting ablities. We aren't far behind in our ability to heal. D) Run speed. We are one of THE fastest professions, and we are faster than the other 2 combat classes. <br>
<br>
     Those are just a few I can think of. If you thought that the MA would out damage all your friends from level 1 to level 200. You picked the wrong class. The soldiers are a combat class entirely focused on range combat. The enforcer is focused on upclose fun. We the Martial artist, are a sort of jack of all trades in the combat area. We have ranged capablity that the enforcer doesn't, but isn't as fast as the soldier. We have melee ability the soldier doesn't but in cases might not be as good as a well equiped enforcer. <br>
<br>
    This is my perception of the profession. So far I like. I can solo things due to my buffs, and heals. I can also fill a nice niche in groups. Good profession if you under stand it's place in the cycle of life.<br>

<br>
He hits as fast as I do, if not faster. I usually feel usefull to my groups but next to him I don't feel useful at all.<br>
<br>
With my regular buffs up I usually hit for about 40 each time, brawl for 80s mostly and dimach for 360 usually or around that.<br>
<br>
I can solo fairly well but compared to my friend Its pretty sad. Like I said I wasn't expecting to be a tank or to do tons more damage then other classes. What I did expect was to be able to at least deal damage with the best of them and at the moment that is not the case. <br>
<br>
I did overlook our healing skills. Thats true we can heal during combat and that helps us out a lot. I am going to stick with it of course and hope that later on we will be the best melee damage dealers hands down. If thats not the case I am still not going to quit because I have fun with the game and thats what it all comes down to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usyldin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Syldin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#660000>(7/6/01 9:28:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Problems with MA's</span><hr size=1> What swords are these ?<br>
<br>
Quality 33 edgeless e-blade does 4-56 not 60-130, and you would need to be level 29 to equip it without buffs or implants.<br>
<br>
Even a quality 89 1hs that takes 417 melee energy only does 3-109.<br>
<br>
In fact, the only weapon I have seen that does over 110 in the high 20s is a sledgehammer which does 1-159 but is two handed and has a 7 second recharge time.<br>
<br>
I would be interested to find out what swords your friend is wielding and what stats they have...<br>

<br>
At level 14 and 2nd level merits, I have around 350hp, which is considerably bigger than enforcers and soldiers my level (even when I take off the merits, I am really close in HP) and the armor I use (fully in battered nomad) my ACs are above 190 (except chemical, poison, and radiation...but I don't get attacked by many enemies using that damage type). While MA's are made for damage, they can be tanks if equipped properly. That is something I am experimenting with, as I want to see how far I can get effectively by soloing (it is getting really hard, but mainly to bugs and stupid things). MA's are also the 2nd best healers (ranked between Doctor and Adventurer), and even their high level nanos are better than some fixer and engineer buffs. I think MA's are more of a support class, able to support themselves and others.<br>
<br>
Yes, a support class. That means that we are more effective in groups. And sorry to say, it is just like in EQ. Monks were support in EQ as well, but in AO, we play more of an important role than &quot;pulling&quot; and damage. I think it is a welcome change and try to use this to my advantage. As I grow in experience with the class, I will try to post a comprehensive guide to the class. <p><center>_-={[ PEXX ]}=-_<br>

<br>
1. For every one of his hits you probably hit 3 times which may not out do the dmg but would keep you at least in the range<br>
<br>
2. I really have not played an Enforcer but I like the fact that my MA can heal himself for a fare amount in a battle.<br>
<br>
3. Also, again I could be wrong but aren't we one of the best classes for the &quot;get out of death free card?&quot; Dimach my brothers and sisters, Dimach that sucker can really turn the tide of a battle. I would take a gander sometimes and fight a red.

I would take a gander sometimes and fight a &gt;red.

I know for a fact the weap's he are using are in fact level 33, they're some time of blunt executioner I believe. He hits for over 100 very often. Like I said before, I know its too early to judge MA's completely but as its going I am just trying to figure out where we stand. We should be able to do something that other professions can't. I think thats the bottom line. Thats what keeps professions from becoming obsolete isn't it? Lets just assume that enforcers will always do more damage then us and always be better tanks then us. Why would anyone want an MA when they could just get an enforcer? I am not trying to bring everyone down or pass any judgments on the profession, I am just hoping that maybe we can get somewhere by discussing this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uveldrane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Veldrane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#660000>(7/8/01 8:39:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Atrox MA</span><hr size=1> Hi<br>
<br>
I was very undecided between Atrox and Opifex MA. In beta, on the last days I had a lvl 75 MA.<br>
<br>
Opifex is a little more defensive and has better NFs, but the ATrox is just a freagin dmg machine.<br>

<br>
when these were taken I had approximately 40% of all my available IPs still left over for Nanos and other Misc skills, because I had no clue which ones I would need.<br>
<br>
When I hit the guard I upped the Dimach a little from what it is on the screenie, my Dimach skill was around 230.<br>
<br>
Also, I ran like the wind, run skill goes of off stamina, so atroxes rule here, my base dmg ranges from about 45 to 225 points. My brawl hit for 270-300 average. Opifex MAs will be a lot lower in the dmg and especially brawl department then Atroxes. Also, in the long run I think Atroxes will make better tanks and be more team oriented due to high hitpoints.<br>
<br>
My total dmg output oblitarated most agents, soldiers, enforcers, nanotechs (the only exception was full auto) and anything else that was there with me. All those classes can momentarily surpass us in dmg, but None of them can sustain it like us.<br>
<br>
You guys need to stop thinking about solo play and play your role in a team, dont become like the level 60 druids in EQ that kited to 60 and ran away during a fight. <br>
<br>
Focus on your primary team role. And you will be fine.<br>

The AC system is stated to work so they no matter the Targets AC it can't lower an attack lower than the minimum damage of the attack. <br>
Therefor connecting more doing less damage will do more in the long run because most of the high damage attacks will be soaked into the high AC. <p><img src=http://ryuk.homestead.com/files/RYU1.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=18.topic&start=21&stop=25>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showMessage?topicID=28.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showMessage?topicID=30.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=18.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.threadControl?topicID=18.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=18.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=18.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1>Main Dojo</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://www.qksrv.net/click-553273-677484" target="_blank" >
