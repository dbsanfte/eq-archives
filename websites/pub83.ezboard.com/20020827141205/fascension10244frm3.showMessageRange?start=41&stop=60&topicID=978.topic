<br>
I asked for the guild that she joined on Legends to get her Epic.  The broken golem and VS takes more than a pickup group.  If she DID use a group of manaburning wizards, just provide a few of their names so someone can check.<br>
<br>
Teralonis:  I don't think that's a hard question.  You should have this information on the tip of your toungue, since you spent so much time with these people.<br>
<br>
On a side note - the Legends character website has always been a little screwed up, but check this out:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/character_listings.jsp">legends.everquest.station...stings.jsp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Do a search for &quot;Rinien&quot;, and &quot;Ehunogor&quot;.  Those are two characters that were once on Legends and now are back on Rallos.  Notice that they're still there.  Now do a search for &quot;Teralonis&quot;.  Not there.  Hmmm..?<br>

<br>
Broken Golem:  GM event that went through cazic thule, found a plot from CT himself that needed stopping and we went to fear to kill CT, got Brokem Golem on the raid with the GM.  That was the raid where CT fell about 3 minutes before the patch, and the GM's divided the loot the next day after server came up.  The raid had 30 people on it (the GM set that limit) and was cake with the GM around.  I'll probably remember the name of the main monk soon, if I do I'll post that.<br>
<br>
VS:  with Wraith of the Lost Souls and random others in the zone, back before the guild fell apart in early May (or so) and reformed after the bad day going after Gorenaire where other guilds (Ascending was accused) were training Gorenaire over the buff spot.  The guild is now called The Wraith of Souls, reformed about the time a bunch of us started leaving Legends with our last chars.  VS isn't that hard of a mob even without MB wizards, for whoever implied that it was.  <br>
<br>
Epic:  Wizards have it easy if you find the spawns up, this is not the uber hard epics to get.  Only 1 hard fight in the lot, the rest is finding the spawn up.  A 60 wizard that is non epic would be suspicious.<br>
<br>
AAXP:  Mostly quad kiting in GD, some via AoE in Fungus by lake (a few times with some Leviathan wizard, cant remember her name though, she liked to pull first round of low resist mobs and had bard pull second)<br>
<br>
Tera was in Beyond the Portals for a short while a few months ago as well but gave it up as the guild had too random of a population.  Same reason a bunch of people left the guild.  She also talked to members from Township and quickly to one officer when she was turning 60 to join there but decided to come back to Rallos instead.  Best bet would be talking to Carminae who she had a short conversation with about 4 weeks ago and who may or may not remember (worth a shot).  <br>
<br>
And in case you dont know, given that the server population of Legends is mostly level 60 people, a pickup group there easily does huge things.   They even used to do open raids to ToV, *shiver*.  Especially since GM's lead a lot of pickup raids as events.  When I did the last fight of my monk epic, it was a pickup group that I pulled from the last people at an event where the drakes first invaded Firiona Vie.  Dont knock pickup groups, especially on Legends.  There are also a lot of scheduled pickup raids that appear on the calendar that are very well run.<br>
<br>
We went to legends hoping the maturity and morality level of the server would be higher.  Found that it wasn't and given it being a blue server you could do less to retaliate than on Rallos (although on Rallos they run if you cast first anyway).  We didn't get big into the guild scene there and spent some time going for armor, most the time exping and going to GM events whenever we found them, which was the most interesting thing on the server.<br>
<br>
About characters coming from Legends back, depends on the GM who moves them whether their character info is there still or not.  Some GM's do the move well, others do it so badly they leave peoples names blue and non-pvp-able.  It isn't consistent.  It would be handy if it was.<br>
<br>
And to the person that mentioned there is a verified level 5 Xbena around in Eurdin, let me know when someone really sees that other than...<br>

You just cooked yourself there.  My twink was in that guild, and a good friend of mine was an officer in that guild.  They rarely did events outside of KD, and only killed VS remains once or twice in the last month they were around.  (before the reform) <br>
<br>
&gt; About characters coming from Legends back, depends on the GM who moves them whether their character info is there still or not.<br>

You're correct about the blue/red character color, but GMs have nothing to do with the poor database programmers employed by Sony to do their Legends website.  Sorry.<br>

Does that make him any less observant?  Because he PKs, his opinion shouldn't be listened to?  Huh?<br>

<br>
How about you just admit that you bought Xbena, and ask that everyone leave you alone.  It's pretty obvious that you're not Bhark, and I don't think anybody would really give you that hard of a time if you would just stop lying.  I can tell you right now that if you keep this charade up, someone WILL prove that you are lying, and then you're going to be KOS to the whole server.  Just come clean..<br>

<br>
Wrong, we hunted wherever we felt like.  And not everything is a raid, if VS is up, whoever is on goes for it.  VS went down with everyone we could scrounge at the moment.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; but GMs have nothing to do with the poor database programmers<br>
<br>
We have no idea how that stupid thing works, or doesn't work as the case is a lot of the time.  The GM's trigger character updates, or the players do, who knows.  It works some times, not others.  It is very inconsistent.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Does that make him any less observant? Because he PKs, his opinion shouldn't be listened to? Huh?<br>
<br>
He has an axe to grind and only brought this up after three deaths in one day to Tera (and for the 3rd a group she was in).  That says something.  Plus seeing his guild exploit pathing in the ToFS all the time leads me to believe that they have little morality and so I trust them little.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; How about you just admit that you bought Xbena<br>
<br>
I never said I was even Tera, dont confuse who is speaking.  And I am coming clean, why dont you have real evidence for something rather than conclusions based on lack of evidence.   If I had bought Xbena, I wouldn't care if you knew or not, I think most people would be happy that he was in my hands and not a pk's.<br>
<br>
Lastly, if you are so sure Xbena is sold, why are you even concerned about the char any more?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uashlain0105sbr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ashlain0105sbr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(6/8/02 8:23:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=978.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok, that's about it.</span><hr size=1> HTML Comments are not allowed <p><img src="http://www.waccamawlandscaping.com/crit.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uruhi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruhi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 612<br> <font color=#333333>(6/8/02 8:29:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=978.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ok, that's about it.</span><hr size=1> LOL.. this is sad... stop trying to convince us and prove xbena is still on RZ...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uguznukg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GuznukG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(6/8/02 8:34:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=978.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ash</span><hr size=1> Ashlain wrote: &quot;Any newbie can cast 3 spells on someone right when they zone in.&quot;<br>

Tell me what you think:<br>
<br>
Fact:  Legends went live in the beginning of March / 2002.<br>
Fact:  The first sighting of Xbena via ralloszek.stephans.org was 2001-07-29 11:49:42.<br>
<br>
Why don't you do a FULLSCREEN screenshot of the output from /charinfo.  If your story is true, the creation date of your character should be sometime AFTER 7-29-2001, correct?<br>
<br>
I can already tell you the answer to this one:  &quot;Well, I created the character on Rallos a long time ago, and then didn't touch her for a while.  When Legends came out, I moved the existing character to Legends to level her up.&quot;<br>
<br>
Either way - the burden of proof is not on anybody here except you.  Nobody here believes you, and it's up to you to produce something that convinces us (them) otherwise.<br>

<br>
About the screenshot, sure I can ask Tera for it and you can then sit and watch 10 people post saying it is fake the minute it is posted.  That sounds produtive (and it is /played not /charinfo).<br>
<br>
In reality, Teralonis really has no one to answer to than those she works with daily and need her trust and her theirs.  Outside of Temerity she really gets nothing from any of you, other than pk attempts from Voltaic, Guznuk, Fazoli and their unmoralistic pals.  Only a few posters on this thread have ever done anything for me or my friends including Tera, so there is no debt owed or some real need to satisfy your curiousity on this matter.  I think many of us would rather all be KOS than to boost your ego especially when you approach this in a manner such as occured on this thread.  Guilty until guilty no matter what you say.<br>
<br>
Thanks Sallox, Ashlain and others that at least take a serious and reasonable look at things or know for sure this isn't Xbena.  As for the rest of you, sorry for the coincidence, but it wont be the only one you will come across in your lives.  You'll get over it as you mature, if you mature.  <br>
<br>
Many of you take Everquest and act within its domain in ways that are unacceptable anywhere in the real world, then you drag it into the message boards which causes real world grief and time outside of the game.  You'd think you'd correlate some actions to real ethics and values but it just doesn't seem you can do that.  You just dont have a sense of morality and it is one of the reasons I'll never buy a house near a high school or college.  I thought it came at a much younger age, but the game must cause you to regress or I was wrong and it comes much later.<br>
<br>
I've answered a lot of questions regardless of the abusive replies, kept a decent mannerism in those responses and it isn't worth me spending any more time out of the game where I get no pleasure, and I'm not playing EQ for grief.  Especially this meaningless.  <br>
<br>
Do what you will.<br>

telaise, heres how i read the thread since im sure youre still reading this even tho you said you werent going to post anymore. i believe that the poster telaise is really the character teralonis. i also believe that teralonis is/was xbena. <br>
<br>
but lets assume youre not. youve apparently been in contact with teralonis while posting this. since she wont defend herself why dont you get her to take the screen that josheb suggested. that would clear everything up wouldnt it? i mean based on what you said, if everything is correct that would be the one piece of evidence that would say, 'hey im not xbena.'<br>
<br>
i also believe that you care more about this issue that you try to let on. you gave me the impression in your posts that you were trying to sound like 'oh well i dont care what you do i never did.' but to mean it seems quite obvious that you do care, and quite alot since youre defending a friend rather rigorously on someone elses board when an accusation made by someone who you dont pay heed to. <br>
<br>
now the flip side to this point is that i wouldnt want to be slandered but you arent being slandered. youre not teralonis remember? but your friend, you dont want her being slandered either, then why not ask for her help in defending her. your attempt to help her clear her name is only making you lose your credibility (sp?) get the screenshot. and post it instead of saying 'well im not saying anything anymore so do what you will.'<br>
<br>
you quite clearly want to exonerate (sp?) teralonis and if you didnt care that much you wouldnt be trolling our boards. so please, if youre gonna set out to do something, do it. prove to me that teralonis isnt xbena. get the screenshot.<br>
<br>

<br>
p.s. sorry for the (sp?). i hate to make spelling mistakes but im too lazy to spell check.<br>
<br>
edit: in response to sallox - i agree. she isnt ganking, shes anti why do people question her like this? unless there is another explanation! <br>
<br>
new scenario! (please note this is just a possibility im pointing out and not what i actually believe but i do believe in presenting all possible scenarios):<br>
<br>
bhark sold xbena after pb broke up. xbena has been randoming under the control of player x! player x after amassing ALL THE FUNGI TUNICS ON THE SERVER and selling for a mixture of pp and RL $ decides that she wants to retire to the easy life of raiding/hanging with friends etc etc. so she decides to get a name change! under this scenario the character teralonis would not only be xbena, but the xbena that had been ganking peoples gear for the past couple months. interesting eh? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udosidfluffybunny.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dosid FluffyBunny</A> at: 6/9/02 1:21:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uguznukg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GuznukG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#333333>(6/9/02 1:20:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=978.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmmmmmmmm</span><hr size=1> &quot;then you drag it into the message boards which causes real world grief and time outside of the game&quot; <br>

thanks, makes sense.  I will close up shop here now.  I really hate being on the boards for more than coordinating events and the guild and getting back in game.  Thanks for the reminder of why I'm not out here and why so many others completely ignore everything but the event calendar.<br>

<br>
yep, hate seeing people treated this way, so I do care to defend strongly, but not to continually engage in a never ending hopeless arguement.  No one has built a case against, only suggestions and innuendo, so I'm not going to do all the leg work to build more of a reverse case.  I've said what I know and that is enough for me.  Else, I would keep answering the never ending scenarios such as your newest one that people seem creative enough to always come up with to move this discussion away from a conclusion.  <br>

Thankfully, not everyone is like you.  Not everyone is on the message boards as part of the game.  Not everyone has to be so foul speaking to carry their arguement (is that a performance to make you &quot;cool&quot; to your friends?).  You are just as bad outside the game as you are in.  Amazing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uavih8r.showPublicProfile?language=EN>avih8r</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#333333>(6/9/02 2:49:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=978.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ending.</span><hr size=1> &gt; About the screenshot, sure I can ask Tera for it and you can then sit and watch 10 people post saying it is fake the minute it is posted. That sounds produtive (and it is /played not /charinfo).<br>
<br>
Oops, I got /charinfo and /played confused.  My bad.  Either way:<br>
<br>
I look forward to that screenshot -- fake or not.  That's the one piece of emperical evidence that will make or break you.  I doubt you have the ability to fake a screenshot like that which will fool me (let alone the other parties interested in finding the truth).<br>
<br>
You want to know why I care about this so much?  Ok, I'll let you in on the big secret:<br>
<br>
1.  I hate liars.  I believe you to be one.<br>
2.  AD has stated in the past that they don't care about &quot;new owner&quot; situations, and they'll continue to KOS characters based on past reputations.  I love to catch these fuckers promoting double standards, so I've taken a bit more pride in  proving who you really are.<br>
<br>
Anyhoo ~ I'll look for that screenshot when your &quot;friend&quot; has the time.. <br>

Also, why is it confusing when someone says something that you don't want to here, yet it makes sense when you agree with it.  Dont they call that selective understanding?  The Fact is Teralonis is Xbena.  And you I'm guessing is Teralonis, I&quot;m not sure tho you seem to have a split personality, are you defending yourself or your friend?  <br>
<br>
This does close up shop I'd say.  It's pretty obvious you are Xbena.  So why not admit it ?

And btw Josheb is right, AD dont care about new owners. And with all respect, unless you can provide a ss with the birthdate of your char, or a series of screenshots from you leveling up i really dont see a reason to trust you...<br>
<br>
Post some screenshots where your inventory is up, so we can see your progress both on lvl and gear. <br>
