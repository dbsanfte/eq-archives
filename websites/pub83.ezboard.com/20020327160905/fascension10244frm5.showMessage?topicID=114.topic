Now as for playing your cleric, I personally think you are a disgrace, ppl talk about how you half ass in groups all the fucking time, too busy trying to lvl both characters.

Then he gets kicked out of Swarm for threatening other members about how bad he'd kick their ass(I think it was Briaar that showed up and waxed both Zoraan and Kalaron together...how you beat a warrior + cleric with 1 druid is beyond me). <br><br>I was never really a fan of Zoraan but I tolerated him in the guild. He was commonly late to raids, I estimate he spends more time on raids either afk or not paying attention then he does anything else. He enjoys playing gems during pulls in HoT, tends to play both characters during a raid(His cleric's screen is never looked at until Zoraan is low on health and needs a heal, so generally the rest of his group dies), and in terms of main tanking skills, I as a cleric could do better then he could as a main tank. He's slow, does not prox well, takes agro away from the other main tanks, and has trouble keeping mobs in walls or getting in position to have them pushed a certain way.<br><br>As a person he is not for the betterment of the group, but instead the betterment of himself.  He spent more time nagging me about loot and when we were gonna do raids for him, and when I was going to plan this to finish this quest for him, or what armor I was gonna give Kalaron, or if I could multiquest this for him. He did on occasion go help someone with somethign they were doing, but usually I ended up hearing how the person he promised to help had to help him with something later. He also spent 99% of his non-raid time exping himself instead of joining a group to help better the whole guild. Many times I saw groups lacking only a tank while Zoraan was off soloing and refused to join a group because it slowed his experience and was a waste of his time. <br><br>I could go on but I want to go play my 8bit Nintendo and play all the games from my childhood since my olympic training has been haulted tonight but a winter storm. G'nite~<br><br>Dupre<br><br>*Edit* oh ya..I almost forgot I recall Tiig coming to me in the past because Zoraan spent days harrassing Tiig to let him in AD while he was still guilded with us. So his loyalty is very questionable. Just thought I'd add that. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udupre35.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dupre35</A> at: 3/1/02 4:49:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udosidfluffybunny.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dosid FluffyBunny</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Fluffier then the rest</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#333333>(3/1/02 5:59:47 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: If I were an employer and you came to me for a reference</span><hr size=1> the only thing i can remember about this guy is him trying to scam me out of a crown of elemental mastery.<br> <p><br><center><img src="http://dosid.8m.com/dosid-sig-small.jpg"><br>Fear the Bunny</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zoraan464646>Zoraan464646</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(3/1/02 6:41:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dupre</span><hr size=1> To be honest it kind of hurts me that I get this response from you Dupre, maybe I am wrong and I am all the things you say about me but i attended every single raid when i was offline, helped my guildmates every signle time when I could.

But if id ever join AD id play whatever was needed more, but  prefer Zoraan much more, as to what you said about paying more attention, I agree you are right thats why for thelast 2 months I have tried to solo or only grp with Shadow of the Swarm.<br><br><br>Thx again<br>Zoraan <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usanitylost.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sanity Lost</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#333333>(3/2/02 12:07:27 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok</span><hr size=1> Zoraan did a lot of scamming as Kalaron before he decided to level the character up.<br><br>I remember him trying to scam me, I don't remember what item but I think it was my manastone (he told me &quot;ok give me it now, then I'll pay you as Zoraan.&quot; YES he said &quot;Zoraan&quot; specifically). Obviously I'm not that stupid, so I rejected, at which point he started harassing me EVERY DAY trying to get me to PL him or do the trade, so I had to /ignore him. To this day he still denies it was him (his excuses have ranged from &quot;it was the original owner&quot; to &quot;it was my friend just trying to ruin my rep!&quot; to even saying &quot;OMG NO WAY I'M NOT KALARON, I don't even have access to him!&quot;). I do know he also would offer to pay people for powerleveling and would never pay them (a GM actually forced Kalaron to pay a manastone to a druid I knew who powerleveled Zoraan. Btw he denies this ever happened too). And he also attempted to scam a few others including one of my guildmates's alts. At the time he did this, I was level 56 I think, Kalaron was maybe level 50 cause he was green to me (I REALLY wanted to kill the guy, i remember my lower-level guildmates killed him a lot), and Zoraan was a newb, obviously he didnt care what Zoraan's rep was; too bad it bites you in the ass at 60.<br><br>I have a very good memory of names; I assure you all of this is 100% true. Zoraan will definately deny it, though.<br><br>From an outsiders opinion, this guy is simply not worth the risk to AD; hes a lying cheat in character and i've heard from people who have grouped with him that hes a horrible cleric. Due to my wonderful experiences with Zoraan, I consider any guild that invites this guy to be desperate losers just guilding any tank they can (hi Dupre). SotS made the right move kicking him out, I might actually have to respect them now. (now don't get me wrong here, I have no idea how SotS runs and I don't really know any of their members personally, they could be the coolest people on Earth for all I know, but when someone guilds Zoraan that destroys my respect for them)<br><br>So yeah, thats my opinion, if it matters any.<br><br>-Morb<br>60 Hierophant<br>Retired<br><br>edit: grammar, a little content <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usanitylost.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sanity Lost</A> at: 3/2/02 12:25:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zoraan464646>Zoraan464646</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(3/2/02 2:34:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Morb</span><hr size=1> Morb go get an amy of necro from sweetypie you f dirtbag <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=114.topic&start=21&stop=25>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=114.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=114.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.threadControl?topicID=114.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=114.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=114.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Paladins<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5>Recruitment Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
