I find that amusing considering BD was put on kos because I was rude to Moffon.  Well actually it was because I interferred and healed a pker but when that didn't stick, lets pull rude out of our ass <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Big guild = AD, small guild = BD...you did the math quite nicely Moffon.  Still smarting over BD smacking you around when you were IE?  I guess it's nice to finally have a guild do your work for you &lt;shrugs&gt;.<br>
<br>
I have real life friends in BD, friends I have played online with for so many years now....friends who are being attacked because I was &quot;rude&quot; to someone.  You know Moffon, if you were anything but a wuss, you would have come after me, just once, or any of AD.  But no, you attacked single players off on their own who had done nothing to AD.  <br>
<br>
My hat is off to you AD, big guild is going to kos the small guild because big guild got feelings hurt.  Wow, AD really wasn't what it used to be is it? <br>
<br>
My friends won't tell me to post an apology, then know you are all full of shit too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But there is a silence now where there used to be friends laughing and playing together.  I love my friends too much to cause them any trouble in building, in playing EQ because someone in big guild has a stick up their ass.<br>
<br>
You win in this way Moffon.  Yenya is out of BD, not kicked out by her friends, but with most of the guild leaving what choice do I really have.  Big guild = AD, BD is just rebounding trying to rebuild and have some fun.  If it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, then pat yourself on the back, you won.<br>
<br>
Just don't forget me Moffon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Never underestimate the power of ebayed manaburn wizards :P  Better run your ass off <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Maybe you guys would have learned after the first time:  When you interfere in someone else's guildwar or PVP battle, you're going to get KOS'd.  Nobody cares what size you are, and no amount of incessant whining is going to change that.<br>

LOL Yenya...seems like we've heard this story from BD before.  Almost exactly one year ago today BD thought they'd play tough guys and war Fearful Symmetry.  You were the &quot;big guild&quot; you're now whining about.  FS was a very small guild yet BD got owned.  And owned hard.  Why?  Cuz you asscheeses were rude and mouthed us (sound familiar?) in Fear.  What was your exuses then?<br>
<br>
BD embarassed themselves quite nicely with a display of some of the shittiest PVP I've witnessed on Rallos Zek to date.  You can peruse the gallery at the FS site if you'd like to recall just how bad you got owned.  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://fs.wsmake.org">fs.wsmake.org</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Not only has BD always suck at PVP, you've also had no trouble taking known PK's as members.  Jaydee, Icee, Slurpee, Blahck..all known PK'ers/gank-gimps.  Hell, you even had the idiot Salorf in BD for a while.  And let's not forget Lugoj!  A proud member of BD now as well.  So don't come here crying we're the bullies.  You obviously MORE than asked for it.  Perhaps you should have thought about your &quot;friends&quot; before you got them all in hot water...you only NOW think of your &quot;friends&quot; because you're forced to.<br>
<br>
Anyway Yenya, I'd like to welcome you to KOS!  You've gotten BD off the hook, but you have fun on that ebay manaburn wizzie, k?  That's about the best you can hope for at this point. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
When Sabbat broke up I joined AD in hopes of following friends and continuing large scale raiding. When Sabbat split I had friends on both sides and I had hoped to keep it that way but alas it was not to be so I left AD because at the core I am definitely not PvP (I know, should have started on blue server).<br>
<br>
I still have friends in AD and if you are letting folks in AD that use you to settle their old grudges then you are not what I remember. Sure Moffon has cut and pasted comments. They are out of context and put together to twist a pathetic plot. Did you log the whole chat Moffon? Because if you did then it would show how &quot;rude&quot; and insulting you were but why show that?  How many times did BD kill you when they were at war with IE? How many? Getting into AD and using them to solve some sort of revenge against BD with a very flimsy excuse of Yenya was &quot;rude&quot; to me is pathetic.<br>
<br>
A cleric sees a person sitting in a town almost dead and she heals him… SITTING in a TOWN…. Did she ask him… Are you a pk? Have you been pking today and that is why are you almost dead?  No and why should she? She saw someone in need and helped them. And when you went to your guild with  the tale of her healing him mid battle didn’t fly then the BEST you could come up with was she was &quot;rude.&quot; Did you post how rude you were to her? No because that doesn’t serve your purpose.<br>
<br>
No you went crying to your guild… help me someone was rude to me… What are you a 12 year old pimply kid with nothing better to do?<br>
<br>
Anyone that knows me knows that I am definitely not a PvP’er and the only reason I started on Rallos was to play with my sister and her friends. When Legends came up I left because I am more suited for a blue server. I make no apologies at all for that.<br>
<br>
Since Moffon has had AD declare BD KOS has he done anything to &quot;settle&quot; his score? No, he has let others do that for him. People like you Moffon are giving AD a bad rep and if they let this continue then I guess it will be well  deserved.<br>
<br>
I used to occasionally check out the AD board to see what you all have killed and your accomplishments but as of this incident anything I felt for AD as a whole is definitely gone and I am very saddened.<br>
<br>
Some of you may read this and say who are you and who gives a sh## what you think. Well Yenya is my sister and she loves playing EQ and wanted to stay on Rallos but because Muffin’s pathetic act he has ruined EQ for her.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents worth…<br>

<br>
A)  That's the entire conversation, nothing was left out.  If you don't believe me, I don't care.  There's not really much I can do otherwise to prove to you it is, but the people that know me will know it is.  No matter how bad a picture of me you try to paint at the end of the day you don't know me, Yenya doesn't even know me, and the people that do know I don't make shit up just to pick on little guilds.<br>
<br>
B) BD never killed me once during the IE/BD war.  Not once.  There was no grudge against BD, although it's funny you make one up in order to give a reason why Yenya is KOS.  <br>
<br>
C) I told my guild exactly what happened, that Yenya healed a PK in the bazaar.  Specifically, that she healed Timon who a lot of AD happen to dislike.  She knew he was a PK, and later told me she only healed him so he would let her inspect him.  You want to know what's funny?  I asked AD if I could attack just Yenya and Ging on site for her disrespect.  After hearing the story many AD wanted to kill BD for their disrespect.  Do not try to claim that I whined to AD to get them to kill BD, AD is a democracy and if the guild hadn't wanted to kill BD we wouldn't be killing BD.<br>
<br>
P.S. Yenya ruined EQ for herself, not me.  I told her I would accept just an apology and we could move on.  Did she tell you that?  She was rude to me and I wanted an apology.  Awww but she took the proud road and decided to post more threats to me.  Also, even manaburn wizards don't scare me.<br>

<br>
And about the apology. She spoke with representatives from your guild on several occasions and said she would apologize but was told you would not accept her apology. So then who was prideful there? Certainly not her.<br>
<br>
So according to you, folks can now be KOS because they are rude to AD... doesn't matter if you (AD) started out being rude first which if you had posted the whole conversation it would show.<br>

<br>
&quot;If that was the whole conversation then where is the part where you tell her to meet you in the arena in Bazaar to settle the matter?&quot; <br>
<br>
You're right it didn't serve my purpose.  After she said &quot;do something or shut up&quot; I said &quot;Well let's mosey on over to the arena and do something about it right now&quot;  Which I thought was the proper responce.  Had she I wouldn't have requested her KOS and instead of me being annoyed and posting on our private board it would have been me posting a SS of her dead and laughing about it.  But none of that had to do with why she was KOS, notice I didn't post anything she said after I said lets goto the arena?<br>
<br>
Oh and for the record I also left out 2 tells I sent to some officer of BD that was an enc with a name that started with an O, because he never responded to me so it really had no meaning.  It was after these tells that she sent me the &quot;you got a problem with BD&quot; tells because I guess the officer said something in guild about how I was makin a fuss over it and then yenya sent me more tells.  I still have them screenshotted if you want me to post them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Or, where she tells you excatly what happened... she wanted to inspect someone saw he was almost dead and healed him. Or, where she tells you she didn't know he was a pker. Post any of that? No, wouldn't serve your purpose.&quot;<br>
<br>
She didn't tell this to me until a after we had declared her KOS a few days later and I sent her a tell saying how I was doing something about it instead of shutting up.  <br>
<br>
&quot;And about the apology. She spoke with representatives from your guild on several occasions and said she would apologize but was told you would not accept her apology. So then who was prideful there? Certainly not her.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't really believe that, I never told anyone I wouldn't accept an apology from her.<br>
<br>
You see, none of what you say really matters because Yenya said &quot;do something about it or shut up&quot;.  She invited us to KOS her, and now she's being KOS'd.  Yenya has nobody to blame but Yenya.  If she hadn't taunted me like that nothing would have been done.

Not that im complaining mind you, im simply pointing out some history.<br>
<br>
All Yenya did was heal someone in the Bazaar. A zone where you cant PvP at all. So im curious, is everyone who has ever healed or perhaps traded buffs with an evil PK in the bazaar also KOS? Or is it only Yenya?<br>
<br>
Im compiling a list as we speak of *EVIL* non-pk Druids who gave me SoW while sitting in the bazaar. When finished ill forward it to you guys so you can properly bully, errrr kill the evildoers at your discretion. Hey, im on your side in this!<br>

Look at my first two tells to Yenya, they were informing her Timon was a PK.  She said &quot;so&quot;, I went higher in the chain of command to complain.  Anything wrong with complaining?  I don't think so, I'd bitch at any AD I saw healing/buffing a pk.  That's not the point.  It turned into a me vs. Yenya thing when she showed obvious disrespect, but it wasn't even that.  It was the &quot;do something or shut up&quot; part that really pissed me off.  That's a direct challenge, and I won't be bullied around.  I could post the full screenshots to show you all of them were scrolled up to screenshot because I had no intention of makin anything of it until she told me that shit.  That's why she's KOS.  I don't know how many times I gotta post about that part, she's KOS because she invited me to KOS her, and obviously my guild backs me up.<br>
