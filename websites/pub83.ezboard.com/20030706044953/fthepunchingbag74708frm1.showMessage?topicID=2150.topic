<br>
What I am wondering is, has anyone been playing MA on test? Just exactly how did our attacks change? <br>
They admit to changing all attacks for the better, except for Shen. Shen they say has always been overpowered and not working as intended. I thought BwT was in the same boat but all they ever changed about BwT was the stacking, I think... Also, I am worried about what they think the definition of &quot;for the better&quot; since they think shen is overpowered and obviously don't understand us MA's at all.<br>
Don't get me wrong, many of these attacks have been broken and unchanged since release. It's great they finally took a good look at them. I am interested to know what new options we have open to us after the patch. It seems bows got another makeover too, becoming more viable than ever for an MA or anyone for that matter. Any info would be greatly appreciated.<br>
If no one is playing on test, maybe someone should. Also is anyone playing on the Notum Wars beta? Some incite there could be helpful too. I am willing to take one of the assignments, I think I will go sign up for Notum Wars now.<br>
<br>
&quot;Could it be that Anarchy is the best environment for evolution?&quot;<br>

However, after doing some digging in <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://v020u46eff.maximumasp.com/AODB">Jayde's database</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, I found some interesting differences.  (NB: None of this has been verified in-game, so please don't take this as &quot;gospel&quot;...this analysis is done solely based upon examining database item details, and could thus be wholly or partially inaccurate.)<br>
<br>
All MA special attacks now scale up to Q300 instead of just Q200, but until Shadowlands, most MAs will be unable to use most special attacks over QL200-220 or so due to skill restrictions.  Also, none of the lowest QL attack have changed as far as I can tell...which means that Q1 snake, Q10 Bird, Q30 BBCS, Q35 Angel, and Q55 BwT, etc., remain identical in the database. This may be 1) an error in Jayde's DB, or it may be 2) an error by FunCom by not remaking the lowest level versions, or it may mean 3) the game still uses the old low-level attacks when scaling up to the high level ones.  Dunno.  If #3, it means that NONE of the special effects of the attacks have changed at all...only the range of values for dmg/debuff/skill locks have been modified.  This will all need to be verified.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Attack of the Snake:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The skill lock for this seems unchanged at 10-15 seconds depending on QL.  Damage has been increased dramatically: The &quot;old&quot; Q200 attack did 1-250 and cost the MA 20 nano. The new Q300 attack does 1-900 and costs the MA 200 nano. If it scales in a linear manner, that would mean that a Q200 snake would do 1-600 and take about 133 nano points.  However, due to the crappy minimum damage of 1, this attack will STILL be mostly useless for anyone over level 10 since a) Bird of Prey is better dmg/time and b) it will nearly always do minimum damage (1pt) against red mobs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Verdict</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li>Still pretty useless</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bird of Prey</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The skill lock remains unchanged at 20-30 seconds depending on QL.  Damage has been modified significantly.  &quot;Old&quot; Q200 used to do 50-600 I believe.  New Q300 does 50-3500, so new Q200 might do 50-2340 or so.  Still has a 10%-30% chance to stun the target (% increases with QL).  Still seems to be an all-around better option than snake, especially for low level MAs until they can use BwT.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Verdict:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li>Still functional at low levels</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Bright, Blue, Cloudless Sky</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Still seems to lock the MA skill for 180 seconds.  Damage has been increased significantly: Old Q200 did 450-650. New Q300 does 250-1950. New Q200 might now be 200-1400ish?  Still hits the target with a ~4 second stun/root effect, and delivers a nice taunt effect (draws aggro to you).  Also still debuffs the target's Inits by -30 to -550 (based on QL) for 40 seconds.  Interestingly, the Init debuff max is still -550 for both the old Q200 and the new Q300, so the &quot;new&quot; Q200 init debuff may now be lower if it scales.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Verdict:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li> Dmg over time is crap, but still functional in rare circumstances (if a brief stun is needed)</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Angel of Night</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
It used to lock skill for 450s (7min30sec) for all Q levels.  Now seems to scale from 450s down to 250s (4min10sec)...however, they may all be 250s (again, it depends on whether FunCom is still using the lowest Q level to determine all of the starting values).  Debuffs the target's Agil and Sense and all 4 Inits for 2 minutes by -10 to -80.  Does Area of Effect damage of 450-2000 at Q300.  (No taunt value, however.)  So a Q200 will do ~300-1400 dmg. Compare this to Q200 Fixer cluster bullets which do area damage of 100-800, but only have a skill lock of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>20 seconds</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  So fixers get to do their special attack over 12 times for our 1.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Verdict:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li> Dmg over time is crap</li><li> Debuffing mobs is useless in PvM</li><li>4+ minute skill lock also makes this pretty useless in PvP</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Blessed with Thunder</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Seems mostly unchanged.  Still a very reasonable 40s skill lock.  Dmg seems about 25% higher.  DoT seems pretty much the same with 6 hits every 10 seconds for 950-1250 at Q300, so about 650pts or so at Q200 (instead of what used to be about 450-550).  Also has the 20s melee reflect shield of 20-80pts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Verdict:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li> Dmg over time is excellent</li><li>With the nerf to Shen this is now the clear choice for dmg in PvP (and PvM)</li><li>Melee reflect shield is still a nice bonus</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Flower of Life</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Used to be broken except for EXACTLY Q60 and Q200.  Q200 FoL was pretty much the hands-down PvP winner with it's 400-500 dmg on the target and 2500pt heal on the MA.  I smell a small nerf here...it no longer damages the opponent.  Still a 5 minute skill lock.  It does still appear to debuff the victim in two ways for 10s, however, with -50 to -550 to their run speed and -50 to -550 to their DMS.  Not sure if it always did that or not.  Will be a Martial Artist <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>must-have</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> if all Q levels are finally working now.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Verdict:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li>Can save your bacon in PvP and PvM</li><li>A clear winner for PvP now that Shen is crap</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Shen</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Ouch.  Skill lock may have dropped from 1000s (~17 minutes) to 500s (~8 minutes), but the DoT damage will be significantly smaller since they fixed the bug that made us actually dangerous in PvP.  Primary dmg range seems slightly lowered as well: Old Q100 did 500 (unchanged), old Q200 did 1200 dmg, new Q300 does only 1500, so a &quot;new&quot; Q200 would appear to only do 1000.  Also, the -Nano DoT seems lowered in the same way: -20 (Q100) to -100 (Q300).  New DoT dmg seems to be 1pt/QL, so 100pts to 300pts...this means BwT does over 3 TIMES the DoT damage of Shen, and can be used every 40 seconds.  Shen does debuff the victim's Inits and run speed of -25 to -500 for 40s, however.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Verdict:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE LIST START--><ul><li>If you don't need any healing in PvP, this is still an &quot;option&quot; for more dmg, but there's still a nasty 8 minute skill lock.  </li><li>BwT is now pretty much the hands down winner for damage in PvP, IMHO.</li></ul><!--EZCODE LIST END--><br>
There you have it.  Would love to see some info on what parts of assessment are correct.<br>

I am hearing alot of grumbling from MA's who could use certain attacks before patch and can't now. They seem to MA's of higher levels L100ish plus. <br>
I can still use my BwT, buts its all I have been useing for lots of levels. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/character/bio/d/1/name/viirruss">Viirruss</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crimhawk>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Martial, Baby, MARTIAL.</span><br>  Posts: 443<br> <font color=#660000>(11/6/02 11:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2150.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shen, BwT, all other attacks</span><hr size=1> ql 120 AOS: dmg 1-301 MA from 543, -13 NP<br>

<br>
Not sure whether or not they keep all of their special stuff (like debuffs or stuns) as I didn't test them, but seems Dimach plays an important role in about 3 of the attacks. Worth it? I'd say ppl will keep getting up with BWT (or whatever they decide to name it) and leave the rest of that crap behind. Yes, the dmg was raised on the specials, but so was the reqs and many won't be able to contend with that unless they were already set up for it. <br>
<br>
We didn't get killed, but we got our nose bloodied.<br>
