<br>
Sensei:  The one misconception you have about all this is that Sion wants to be a journalist.  He does not, and stated as such in this thread.  (I do, however, remember some Basher folk claiming journalism during an interview with Funcom, don't remember but don't think it was Sion, since he is vehemently claiming that he never said such a thing).  So maybe this wasn't in regard to Sion, but rather whoever from Basher that claimed they were a journalist.  So that would imply, that you, Sion, were probably the wrong one to argue this claim.  That should be the end of it.<br>
<br>
Sion:  You said:<br>
<br>
&quot;We are hosted for free, Funcom hosts us and we do tend to sometimes show them a little more love, if they ask us nicely.&quot;<br>
<br>
Simple enough, I think that was Sensei's point (feel free to correct me if I am wrong).  He respects (and rightly so, as he was/is one) &quot;pure&quot; journalist tendencies.  He sees a conflict of interest situation.  He calls you on it.  What's wrong with that?  From the quote above, it is obvious it exists.  Even if you didn't say what you did above, it would be obvious to the thinking man that it would exist, whether it was purposeful or not.  FUNCOM hosts your website.  Why wouldn't you give them extra lovin' if they asked nicely?  You'd be stupid not to.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think much of this battle came down to ego.  Sensei came from the superior jounalist standpoint, and well, he is (for reference, cite education and experience resume in his posts).  Sion obvously isn't, as stated by himslef, and from some obvious unprofessional textual lashes in response to well thought out comments/concerns.  Many of the arguements you make, Sensei, assumes Sion wants to become a jounalist, or any semblance of one.  He obviously does not.<br>
<br>
Sion's ego comes from the fact that he works on a website that gets quite a few hits from AO fans.  In Sion's mind, everyone wants to have what he has, which is hosting by FUNCOM and a large set of AO players that visit the site he works on.  Sion: Sensei does not want to be hosted by FUNCOM, in fact quite the opposite, considering some of his posts on conflicts of interest.  He also doesn't care about becoming the most popular news site in AO in number of hits.  He has stated that his goal is to create a website that gives information to MA's out there (again, correcty me if I am wrong, but I think that I am not).<br>
<br>
So there you go, the whole argument.  In my view, most of what went down here is Sion looking down his nose at a smaller fan base website because he thinks other people measure self worth as he does, by how many people visit your site.<br>
<br>
What can I say, I call them as I see them.<br>
