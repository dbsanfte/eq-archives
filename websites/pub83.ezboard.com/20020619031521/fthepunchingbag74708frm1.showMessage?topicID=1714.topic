I now do ALOT less MA crits (ok for 300 more damage but they are sooo rare now). 1k brawl crits. and 115 min damage alot more than before.<br>

I wouldnt trust these FC jerks to fix a toilet. they have proven time and time again that they dont have a bloody clue. Roll on SWG. <br>

Ok i only have 125 imps. and only 2x11 melee rings. and only a 120 token board. and onlu a +5 scope. But surely that should be ok. Should i have tp have ql200 imp andarmour just to be able to make enough exp to level my toon? I think not.

So while fighting veteran mobs my lvl 120 MA now instead of doing 139, 139, 139, 139, 139, 139, etc<br>

<br>
I have no reason for lvling. cant cast UVC pre lvl 190 due to skill caps. there are no weapons i desire to use. still rookie after 4 months of tryin. i could lvl 2 more times and get all my evades maxed cept nano resist..cuz it dont work...woo hoo. <br>

shoot..even barbeegirl lvl 192 MA cant pvp worth a sh!t. she plays a crat now. <br>

decided to lvl my apprentice trader. cant seem to get novice on him as there arent any apprentices or rookies that will ever fight me so decided to lvl. if they nerf traders ill quit AO alltogether probably. <br>
<br>
liked playing my fixer..but they are near as gimped as MAs. <br>
<br>
they did NOT fix the weapon bugs (not that i care cuz all MA weapons suck a$$ from what i have seen). My lvl 76 now trader can crit up to 3k and with the same lma or uvc he crits about 2 times as much as my MA. <br>
<br>
from what i have read..they lowered MA dmg..raised max dmg some...seems like it everages out. How about having my attacks parried 5 times in a row on a mob..yet i have yet to parry anything. getttin owned by near every proffession out there in pvp. <br>

Other than one enforcer I cremated everything I fought. <br>
<br>
Then I fought a 147 doc, qwert1 in the arena. It was in in fun. I know he kicks ass, and he's a doc. I just wanted to test our controlled damage vs his muscle debuffs. So anyway, it doesnt break them. Big surprise. Then he let me give it all I have for about 10 min straight. He didnt heal himself at all. I hit him with shen, and the kitchen sink. He never got below 3/4. He wasn't even healing himself. 10 minutes of hitting him, didnt get him below 3/4 and he wasn't healing. Now, I realize he's 147 to my 116. I have 823 MA skill however, and should be able to kill a doc who's just standing there. NOPE. CANNOT KILL HIM. It's that simple. I can't do it. Tell me that's not fubar. Then he attacked back and I was dead in 20 seconds. His crit (he had no crit buffs) was 923 or something like that, and he critted a LOT.  Using a 14% lowlight he just owned me. It was actually pretty amusing. <br>
<br>
Then I went hunting for katanas. I'd heard there was some buff salesman somewhere that was selling them. I immediately ran to the area behind the junkyard in agean and checked all the buff salesman NPCs. NO dice. <br>
<br>
Back in the junkyard i noticed an NPC (mini junkbot) named nuts and bolts. I said hi and he said, something like &quot;this conversation is turning lethal.&quot; ala trash king.  I attacked him as he was orange, dimaching for 2500 and shening. He hit back for 595 on almost every hit. I must have done about 8000 damage to him and he was at 3/4. I figure he has about 30k HP. I died of course, and then he poofed. <br>
<br>
Went back but all I found was the omni leader of the junkbots. He wouldnt tell me anything. Killed hima couple of times, barely, and with the help of a 133 advent. No loot. <br>
<br>
On the bright side, he killed the advent the second time, as the advent attacked unexpectedly while I was trying to hit any quest phrases and got agro. He hits for 495 every hit. No variation. So at least we're a little better off than the advent in standing toe to toe with big hitters. Of course advents kill us, because they have damage shields so we take our own damage in addition to theirs. It's like attacking ourselves almost, but I've ranted about that one enough elsewhere.<br>
<br>
My impression of this patch is, it is nice for lowbie MAs. GREAT!!! THEY SO NEEDED TO BE BETTER!! We all know low level MA's rock. I had had hopes that this would be linear, but my 116 MA is still a complete and utter icon of gimpdom. This patch sucks more ass than I can express, for two reasons. One: it broke a lot of other classes and introduced bugs. Two: it's our &quot;love&quot; patch. Gee great. FC won't ever acknowledge that they have any idea of how sucky we are as a supposed melee class. They either don't know, don't care, or don't have the ability to deal with it. <br>
<br>
No MA 2HE weapons sucks. <br>
<br>
No MA SA's while weilding a weapon sucks as well. Yay we can zone now, and this is nice. It removes a lot of hassle, however, MA's had been dealing with this forever. We were adept at dealing with it, actually. It was a pain, but doable. I'm glad this bug is gone, but the core problem remains: our damage output is subpar with our own fists, and MA weapons do crap damage. <br>
<br>
Our damage sucks, and here's how. We are DESIGNED to do consistent medium damage over time with big crits. We do low damage with medium crits, and have NO time to do it in! Our evade skills should theoretically (intuitively, common sense would dictate) allow us to hang in there and AVOID big damage. Thus the high agility opifex model. Enforcers are tuned toward absorbtion.  (e.g. great armor wearing abilities, buffs to soak damage, thorn sheilds, and HP buffs that heal)<br>
We are meant to avoid damage, but do we?? Hell no we don't. We take the same damage as any other class, with no exceptions. In short, we have low staying power, so never get to rock our opponents. Our heals are nifty and all, but cannot even compete with high damage with their recharge rate. We suck at high levels. This patch did shit to fix that. I'm sorry I may have been optimistic in my test posts or worse made anyone else optimistic.<br>
<br>
We can do 60% missions solo, but it takes more time than is fun, and that's what the game is all about. With the limited variety of things to do, (read as the same tired- missions) we just blow as far as fun goes. We're combat nurses, FC won't or can't fix it, and I'm about to cancel my account and wait for the next game. The only thing holding me here is my love of the sci-fi genre and the untold potential of the engine. <br>
<br>
We &quot;could&quot; be a fun class to play. Many of us have written volumes on what needs to be done to make this so, but until they get taken seriously we're a lame class, and it's quite sad given our potential. All they need to do is tweak the database, and make our fists do 25% more damage- OR even better IMO make us dodge and parry! If I could go toe to toe in PvP dodging those crits and have time to hurt my opponent I'd love this class. I proved it tonight against that doc, we simply don't have the tools. What's more frustrating than having the game knowledge and skill to know HOW to do something, and not being able? Who can blame the high level MA's for jumping ship? They've held out hoping, and for nada. <br>
<br>
The MA class IMO is special in that it attracts people interested in MA, a real life art, and thus it's all the more dishertening to see it murdered as in AO. The tuning of body and mind through dedicated study and conditioning is a fascinating thing. Using crude weapons rather than dependance on technology, and mastering complicated forms is art. It, along with other bodily expressions of focused discipline (e.g. some sports, dance, acrobatics, gymnastics, even ballet) are the ultimate testament to the power of our natural bodies. The reality; the real world existence of MA, IMO is what makes the MA class (in games) attract a tight community of dedicated folks, and makes for the best message boards. (moreso than say, a wizard or fantasy based class) To be gimped as we are in AO is nothing short of blasphemy, and even if we sometimes take it all too seriously, it's just sad. <br>

<br>
Tried a ql90 last night (level 93). These used to be a walk in the park.<br>
<br>
The green mobs are just in the way, they are too easy to kill now. From yellow and up it is way harder. Used to cast Greater heal maybe once when fighting a yellow before. Now I need at least 2-3 heals in order to survive. All because my DoT is so much lower. What ever happened to my crits (MA 655, using VS + 5 scope)?<br>
<br>
I guess that I averaged somewhere 200-300/hit before patch (just using fists and brawls). Now it seems that I average 150-200/hit. <br>
<br>
Getting 4 tokens instead of 1 is not enough to compensate for this. Also the NPCs chain cast a lot more now, wasn’t it supposed to be the other way around?<br>

Then again I only play for like 15 hours a week so I think it's still cool. And it's lucky that I have friend's that take me under their wings and help me out.<br>
I hope I don't do as my better half in life and quit AO. (did me good as I nikked the account - hi hi)<br>
<br>
Well anyways, As said, I still think AO is the mmporg that rules the crib, so I'll be staying here - collecting tokens - doing min dam for now - in my rosegarden ....<br>

<br>
This is of course to fix the other classes whos punching is interferring with their shooting - a bug in yesterdays patch.<br>
<br>
Only weps with MA skill req as the primary will allow punching. Cz wouldnt say if we are getting new MA 2HE/B or Bows. He said stuff is in the pipeline. Previous experience dictates that its a fucking long pipe, mainly clogged with shite. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usandzibar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sandzibar</A> at: 2/28/02 9:13:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umingz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mingz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Martial, Baby, MARTIAL.</span><br>  Posts: 542<br> <font color=#660000>(2/28/02 9:34:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1714.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Oh well at least I never even got my hands on one of those new katanas.
