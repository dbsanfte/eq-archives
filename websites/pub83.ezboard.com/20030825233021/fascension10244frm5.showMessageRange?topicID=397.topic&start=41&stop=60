That's hilarious. About a year ago I went KoS to IE and was kicked out of OM by Vantaris because of helping my friend against the above mentioned monk in SS. As I recall, dispute started with Excess killing a druid pk who Tavyl was grouped with. Not saying that Tavil had connections with pks or anything(I think he didn't give a shit who was right or wrong and just wanted to continue farming), just pointing out that that monk was in his 40s quite a while ago. Not even sure if IE and MiM were merged at that time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tavilrz>TavilRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#333333>(3/3/03 1:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Email me foo ;p</span><hr size=1> Actually, Tyval was my second character (created before Tavil) and was level 43.

He stopped lvling it when we started doing raids with TB because they had one.  Then when he joined MiM (I'm assuming) he started again b/c they needed it.  <br>
<br>
Most of ya'll's arguements involve nothing more than your guessing at why Tavil did what he did.  He switched his main, officers of MiM have posted saying they needed a monk...Cilla said he lost out on loot because of it.  Who wants to lose loot over something if they care so much about loot?  He looted Aten kneck after not being at much of the raid?  Tavil already said the earlier days were when he couldn't raid.  Your own loot council awarded him it, don't blame Tavil.  So that leaves him looting and leaving MiM a week later.  You guess at his reasons, and that's all you have.  You'll never know if he planned on leaving before he looted Aten kneck, so that leaves the people who know him best (his friends) to say whether they thought he planned it or not.  I doubt seriously Tavil planned on leaving before he left.  Offer some evidence that says otherwise, because I believe Tavil had a lot more to gain by staying in MiM and being a top looter (and your own people said Officers get lewt bias) to coming to AD, where he will spend at least a month as a recruit and then start at the botom.  MiM ain't that far behind us, by the time Tavil gets into AD and starts getting phat lewt MiM will probably be much closer if not where we are.  I just don't buy Tavil looted and left on purpose.<br>

Most seem to think that I am an officer of AD, im not, thought in the past (thankfully not anymore) I have shouldered a few of the responsibilities affiliated with being an officer. And Jesus Fucking Christ - anyone that can do that should be given a fucking medal, seriously. For a guild the size of Mim or AD, its a huge acomplishment. Just responding to random_tells is a full time job that drove me insane, thus my reasons for never wanting the position. Tavil - according to many other the posters in this thread has been an officer for quite some time. Good on him - he's taken a somewhat fun game and made it a huge fucking chore so that you people can enjoy it. Dont turn against him just because you didnt get a loot god knows how long ago. People are so quick to remember the bad times - but never remember the good.<br>
<br>
Anyone that has stayed on their ench and not made a twink in the last few years is on crack. Until Pop was released, they were the most completely ass class that has ever been created. I cant think of one person actually that doesnt have an alt that is an ench (cant think of one for aloura and needra now that I think on it). So even if it wasnt for &quot;the guilds benefit&quot; that he made that monk - he's damn well entitled to do what ever he likes. Tavil was, and will always be his main - if he chose to take a break and play a fun character then that's his choice. He was in no way neglecting the guild from what I can see.. in fact quite to the contrary, he was your only puller?<br>
<br>
Sometimes this game is not fun - im watching guild members fade away and try other things, this game is slowly drawing to an end, with the new generation mass online games drawing near - SB and SWG, you are definately going to see more and more making their way to the door permanently. Dont be bitter that people are taking the chance to enjoy themselves in the final year or so...<br>
<br>
tavil has made no effort to bash Mim or its reputation - he has clearly left on good terms (appart from maybe a few personal grudges with people). He appears to be all class and I look forward to him attending as a recruit. <p>Neckros Dundee<br>

<br>
unfortunatly they do not.  only chanter i ever saw do this was wazzawhizzle and while others might do it for their freinds i have never heard of one do it jsut for a recruit or a guildmate.<br>
<br>
people in this day and age jsut want XP the fastests whay possible  I have been told by sveral people in several guilds sorry somthor this zone is not for warriors.  &quot;you bring nothing to the table&quot;<br>
<br>
If tavil was doing this for MiM's otherwise orphaned Mele classes then kudos to him.<br>
<br>
personaly I have great difficulty finding a exp group and notice monks and other warriors saying the same.<br>
<br>
I wouldnt blame him for going back to a chanter <p>vita non est vivere sed valere vita est<br>

During Synergy, I found Tavil to be always a friendly and helpful person.  A very good person in general.  After the break up of Synergy and the subsequent merge of IE and MiM, I found that Tavil always conducted himself with a respectful and fair attitude, even to his enemies.  Although we were on opposing sides, I could always give Tavil a tell and say hello in a friendly way.  That never changed throughout, although many of his guildmembers did not follow his lead.  He's a class act and that's the bottom line.  He's not immature, childish, or finding the need to resort to insults.  He controls his emotion and leaves it on the battlefield.  That's a guy that I would always want on my side. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=81&stop=94>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=397.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=397.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.threadControl?topicID=397.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=397.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=397.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Gimp's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5>Recruitment Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
