Level four was populated entirely by Aces.<br><br>The 5th level was one room, with a boss and two cronies. The boss was a huge disappointment, it was just some ordinary, run-of-the-mill Fixer mob in the usual mix of pink and lettuce-puke-green leather armor. Nothing out of the ordinary at all.<br><br>The boss did have 5 fairly nice items on him, some Q200 armor, but it was like Tech and Titan, nothing really exciting as far as types.<br><br>We each got 7 tokens.<br><br>The chest loot and body loot along the way, on the first four levels, was pretty good. Some of my companions found some nice things, and I got 3 bags of assorted crap. To be honest, the loot reminded me of what you get in Steps of Madness, just at a higher Q. It was the same mixture of the ridiculous and the interesting.<br><br>In total we spent 5 hours doing the one mission. Yes, five hours. No, I'm not exaggerating. It was an ordeal.<br><br>Personally, I found the whole thing, especially the boss, to be a disappointment. Maybe I played too much Quake and DOOM and Duke 3D, but when they said &quot;Boss Mob&quot;, I was expecting something a bit more impressive.<br><br>And 7 tokens, when Hilde would get 6 from an ordinary 1-level mission, is a fucking insult. We earned at least 25 tokens apiece. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=keldrys>Keldrys</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#660000>(4/11/02 11:31:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1875.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re:</span><hr size=1> What I've found so far is that the size of the team missions are proportional to the size of the normal solo missions in that area.  The ones I did were in BS.  The first one we did had the counter-top in the front room, meaning that it was potentially a large mission, and it was.  The second and third ones we did had an empty main room and a row of thingies on the left, which indicate small to medium size missions, which they were.  So I'd recommend doing team missions in places you know are small to medium sizes when doing it solo.  I wouldn't recommend, say, the absolutely monstrous brown cave Mort outpost missions for team missions.<br><br>As for boss mobs...yeah they're kinda plain and can be a pain in the butt but they do drop some really kool stuff.  In my 3 missions we only found lotsa armor (200 elite, flowers, tech, omni-pol, graft, etc.) but I know at least one person in another group found nullity II.  And that was just the first day =p  Our second boss took like 10 minutes to kill because he had a neleb-style MK shield (i.e. 95% dmg blocked, 128 crits for me, yes 128 at lvl 171). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uhideo2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hideo2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#660000>(4/11/02 11:37:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1875.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> HUGE is definately the operative word here.<br>My &quot;usual team&quot;, mix of 110-130s, tried out an &quot;easy&quot; team mission (ql156, whereas we normally do 185-200 old-style missions).<br>It was...INTERMINABLY LONG. Started to think the damned thing would never end. The mobs were perhaps a hair stronger than in an old-style 156 mission, until we got to the end. The boss-mob room was too much for us to handle, _very_ disproportionate to the rest of the place. (Having our crowd-control person die first was what did us in...it's horrible that there's no way to all enter at the same time...luck of the draw, she appeared in the top level before the rest of us, drew all the aggro and got squashed). If we can find a way to handle that issue, then the boss-mob room won't be too tough. The boss did seem to have ungodly health, but didn't hit particularly hard.<br><br>Loot was pretty good...we found one of those &quot;Illegal Weapon Container&quot; things, which I've never seen before, didn't think they were in-game yet.<br><br>So, our general impression was: we'll use these missions as XP fests (no more 30 mins travel time for a 3-mob cave fiascos <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , but probably never bother to actually complete them.

We left the difficulty at 50% since it was our first.  Ran out to Wailing Wastes from Avalon, zone into a green robot.  The entire first floor was filled with green-con robots, but they would sometimes come 3-4 at a time so it was interesting but not real dangerous.  Second floor had green/yellow notum worm thingies and other critters.  The third floor had human types, Soft OT Felons and the like, mostly yellow.  And that is as far as we got in the two hours we had to play, so we never did get to see the boss or anything.  But we did get a level (34) and some armor and such that I haven't had a chance to check out. <br><br>However if we would have put the difficulty any higher, I think the mission would have been deadly with all the social behavior.  3-4 greens beating on me is one thing, 3-4 orange/reds is entirely different.  :-)<br><br>-Shkie, 34 Clan Martial Artist of RK1<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1875.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1875.topic&index=8><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=1875.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.threadControl?topicID=1875.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1875.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1875.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm10">Polling Corner<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market - Rubi-Ka 1<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm9">The Market - Rubi-Ka 2<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm8">Past Humor Links<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1>Main Dojo</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://www.thepunchingbag.net">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.7.1<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
