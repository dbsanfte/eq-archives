if u want to turn the other cheek for more abuse go ahead the rest of humanity is quite happy to say STOP IT&quot;<br>
<br>
HAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHHA yeah this is a real setback for humanity, whining about how your bugs in AO aren't getting fixed IMMEDIATLY like you want them to. Not getting bugs fixed is abuse, I see clearly now.<br>
<br>
Saying &quot;goddamnit that hurts stop slapping me&quot; is whining too, if you wanted to have something stop, TAKE ACTION not cry. So, as I said before, maybe you should become and ARK and TAKE SOME ACTION. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrimhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#660000>(9/18/01 3:37:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Death of this game?</span><hr size=1> Again I say...It's not so much WHAT you guys are saying, but HOW.

I know an ARK that has dialup and gets disconnected all the time, and I know guys that have cable that both do and don't. Depends on the provider, that shouldn't be an excuse. WE ALL KNOW AO HAS PROBLEMS, and we all have them, not just you or me. So why whine and stress the things we can't change? BECOME AN ARK AND CHANGE THEM if you're &quot;so tired of the worlds abuse&quot; or fed up with AO, or simply don't play. Noone will cater to YOU in the real world, so don't expect it in a game for 13$ a month either. If you want that get a maid or a butler to nod and smile at everything you say all day. Otherwise shut up and deal with it, whining on message boards doesn't help one thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bitingdust>bitingdust</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#660000>(9/19/01 12:35:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Death of this game?</span><hr size=1> ARK's are a fucking joke they dont have any power anyways even Com admitted that in their latest dev chat......if u read it they say that arks dont have any of their freatures implemented and cant do jack fucking shit (ok not verbatum now was it?) and i paid 15$ so i have the right to complain if i want to.....wtf is it 2 u......i consider your spineless com kissing worse then any of my griping <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucountchokula.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Count Chokula</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#660000>(9/19/01 2:26:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Death of this game?</span><hr size=1> Yeah Clotxx, whining helps nothing, but your posts are just oh so useful aren't they?.

If you don't like whiners, learn to fucking read. My post title was clear you cock smoking piece of shit. Clear as day. Whoever posted that clearly was not happy with the game. Yet you, you pig ignorant little fucker, even after 20 posts on the subject have to wade in with your even MORE useless bullshit to express just how much of a fuckwit you are. That's all your post expresses, nothing else. <br>

What is worse than whiners? Bitches who seek them out, only to then whine that they don't like whining. You fucking moron, your family didn't climb down from the tree's all that long ago did they?. <br>

waaaWAAAAAAA noone cares? Like I said, become an ARK. They have the power to forward an important petition to a GM that DOES have the power to help you, so quit acting like you know the game like the back of your hand.

If you would take your own advise for one second and read my post above you would have seen the part where I had stated &quot;Like I said, become an ARK. They have the power to forward an important petition to a GM that DOES have the power to help you, so quit acting like you know the game like the back of your hand.&quot;<br>
<br>
ARKs have the power to forward an important petition that merits fixing to a GM, who has the power to fix it. They may be limited, but they have to answer petitions or they get kicked out of the ARK program, its that simple. So don't think because they aren't dedicating their time to YOU and YOU only, that they sit around and do nothing all day.<br>

Again, take your own advise and &quot;stop getting bitch slapped&quot; by taking some action.

<br>
Ok then. Ever had a girlfriend? Ever had one who you really really like, yet she just manages to piss you off at times, little things, annoying things. You still love her, but boy can she get you angry when she does whatever it is she does?. Did you just drop the bitch flat and tell her to get out of your life, or did you try to talk to her, work things out, come to an understanding where you're both happy? because hey, you care about her, you want to be with her but some things are just not right for you.. Did you ever talk to your friends about it, seek guidance and help from those around you?. I'm guessing not, in your case but hey I could be wrong.<br>
<br>
Ok. Now, think this over slowly. Which of these two examples better applies to Anarchy Online?. A place where you can go to get a bite to eat and if it's not good you can easily find some place better. Or someone special in your life that’s not working out right?. Now Anarchy isn't that special to me, but it is something you could make a long term commitment to, even if it's not great and I never said I expected it to be magic from the beginning. There are not that many MMORPG's out there, especially sci fi ones. I had, and in some ways still have high hopes for the future of AO. <br>
<br>
Your little example was a poor one, and easily countered without any real effort so try again if you want, this time think about it.  As for being a bigot. Well I directed my comment at your family who must, in theory share some traits with you rather than any general racial group, but hey, whatever floats your boat pal.<br>

<br>
Yes, to answer your question. But I learned to live and love the little things she did that annoyed me instead of bitching and whining about them and saying she needs to change HER life to make ME more happier.<br>
<br>
So your little example, Count Fuckula was pretty fucking dumb then, are you going to start to learn to love the annoying things about AO? Or are you going to cry a river about it. It's sad to see men whine like little school girls when they don't get their way.<br>
<br>
I like how you talk with the mentality that you are above me, that really makes my day. People in the real world do that to me a lot too, and them, like you, are the ones who are whining, crying, bitching and moaning about how everything is wrong with what they don't like, but will take no action to fix it.<br>

No, they do not communicate with them as far as tells. They do however forward petitions with importance up to that level, hence communicating. Ever mailed someone a letter, or even simpler, an e-mail? Is that not considered communication? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bitingdust>bitingdust</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#660000>(9/20/01 7:06:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Death of this game?</span><hr size=1> HHAAHAHAHHAHAHA u just suggested i EMAIL FUNCOME HAHAHA ROTFL I HAVENT HAD SUCH A GOOD LAUGH ALL NIGHT ROTFL<br>

No, I was asking a question. Have you ever mailed a letter or e-mailed anyone? ARKs forward petitions to GMs, which is considered communication, which you said does not currently happen. It doesn't in forms of /tells and direct communication with instant feedback, but it DOES happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucountchokula.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Count Chokula</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#660000>(9/20/01 8:07:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Death of this game?</span><hr size=1> I don't know man, I still think my example fits much better than yours does.

<br>
So, anyone still reading this shit thread, which example fits better? I'm curious to see if other, more rational people think I'm way off base here.<br>
<br>
And I'm glad you think I'm better than you from the way I post, really, I hadn't expected such blantant honesty out of you man, well done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usithean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sithean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#660000>(9/21/01 5:18:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Death of this game?</span><hr size=1> I personally don't have a clue anymore.

For the record, I sympathize and tend to agree with Chok, but I can understand Stiv's point of view as well. <br>
