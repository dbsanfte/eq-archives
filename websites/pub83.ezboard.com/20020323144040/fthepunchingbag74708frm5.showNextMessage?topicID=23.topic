According to my guide to the wonderfull creatures of Rubi-Ka, the big black cat was called Black Death.  I was then running to the closest bridge so I could jump into the water to save my little ol life. Well the nice black death looked very hungry and as I was about to jump off the bidge to the safety below, it caught me mid air and grabed me in its mouth and bit me in half.  Once I was cloned and transported back where I last saved myself. I told my story to a bunch of people that seemed to have recently been killed.  And after my story was complete, not one person said anything to me. How rude can you get.  Atleast saying that was the stuipedist thing I have ever heard would of been better then saying nothing.  Seeing how I was unwelcome there I decided to go into supended animation and hope that when I reawaken that someone will atleast talk to me.<br>

Hell, my second week in EQ I already had permanent running partners, I am a member of a cool guild (non Uber), and I have actually met a couple of my guildmates in RL. I see none of that going on in AO. BUt I solo alot too, so maybe Im one of those assholes. Although I am free with my buffs, advice, and conversation if someone so desires, I find that it is not reciprocated very much. Heh, maybe 30,000 years in the future is not so different from the present?<br>

No one knows how long they're going to be able to play before the server crashes, they crash, or they randomly disconnect.<br>

Traveling takes forever.  And I always stop to talk to or help out a person on the road or in the middle of no where, on my way to my next mission. Its just something I have to do or I'll die of boredom.  You all know the trick where you can keep going forward to your mission area without being at your computer right?

Its the lack of names over peoples heads. It promotes anonymity, and all the anti-social aspects of the game. I seriously doubt people would be exploiting half as much if everyone could see their names. With no /who available, and no way to see who or what classes are in a gathering area, the game just loses out on that whole social aspect.<br>
<br>
In EQ I can look at a 100 people gathered and tell you what 90 of them are, and what level they are. I know who is an asshole, and who I like and dislike, and I dont need them on my friends list to recognize them.<br>
<br>
Having to target someone, and then ID them just to tell their level and profession just blows. <br>
<br>
There is no sense of community in AO as there was in EQ. Part of that is because its easy to solo. Part is how quickly you can level or be out leveled by others you play with. In EQ we were all newbies forever in the same area(s), no one outleveled anyone else for the most part, and the community formed. 4 months into Everquest I knew 75% of the players on my server or more. In AO I doubt I will ever know more than 1%. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uyusukefromathens.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yusuke From Athens</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#660000>(8/30/01 7:08:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nailed it Nazu</span><hr size=1> Just a reminder : ctrl (or shift) + tab will target friends around you, so it's not that difficult to get names (unless there are 15+ peeps around <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

I think that the lack of socialisation comes from the lack of wide chat channels.  No OOC or zone wide shout = harder to find groups, no chatting with whoever is around while you run/hunt/etc... and more.  And Funcom's argument not to put them in seems to be &quot; it will hinder roleplay&quot;...<br>

<br>
When there are only two or three of you around a mission terminal, and someone runs up and says &quot;Wow!  Ever meet a Black Death?&quot;  There is a good chance someone will respond.  We saw him just run up, and therefore we know he is not talking to someone specific.  We can hit &lt;tab&gt; and find him to verify that he isn't on the edge of our hearing, talking to some other group.<br>
<br>
But when there are 10-20 people around the terminal, with many others passing by, we will NOT see his approach.  We will not be able to easily find him with the &lt;tab&gt; key.  He could very easily be talking to someone specific, or to another group in hearing range.  Now it just becomes a hassle to respond.<br>
<br>
But I have noticed that there is a distinct lack of interest to 'help' people in this game.  When someone asks directions, I try to always type up a quick response &quot;go here...take whompah to there, go west to here, turn north...there'.   But I've pretty much given up asking, myself.<br>

<br>
Well, imagine this...<br>
<br>
Walking around Rome, not only do you see no names above peoples heads (interesting aspect of roleplaying, indeed) but you also can't find any information on them, no matter what buttons you press, in any order. This is in fact the ideal of true 'role playing'- you shouldnt be able to do anything that decreases the realism of an infinite world. <br>
<br>
/Shouting across an entire 'playfield' is impossible as the great Funcom would point out, because it is not realistical; so instead, they set some other unrealistical /shout distance and claim that it is closer to the actual ability of /shouting. If this holds true, then someone please explain to me their belief on /tell... Is it magical? Wait, let me guess. Thanks to the Notum in the air, we are able to communicate with those we already know and are friends with, but not those that are all the way across the playfield, even though those people that are all the way across the playfield may be in fact, closer than our friends that we are /telling?

<br>
I'm all for helping someone, if I see a question I know the answer too, and it didn't have and of tH4t r34lLy 4/V/n0yiNg crap in it, I'll send the person a /tell.<br>
<br>
Personally though, I'd rather not talk to anyone I meet in a city if I can help it. I hate the cities. I'd much rather get in and out in the shortest time possible. Why? Beggers mainly. I hated them in EQ, and I hate them even more in AO. At least in EQ you could say &quot;Duel me, and I'll give you 50plat for each hit you manage to lay on me&quot; and kill them on a Riposte. Or take them out into the middle of nowhere and dump 50000 copper pieces on them so they either stay there, or loose it trying to escape. You can't be so cruel in AO. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
But I own a plane, and in my attempt to move around the city quickly, newbies see you. I might aswell walk around /shout'ing &quot;BEG OFF ME PLEASE&quot;. Curiousness I don't mind, but there'll always be some annoying git who does the old &quot;Any credits I can have?&quot; or &quot;Can i hav som money m8???&quot; and then has the audacity to mouth off at you when you give a less than curtious reply.<br>
<br>
*Minding my own business on my way out of the city*<br>
<br>
&quot;Can I have some creditz???&quot;<br>
<br>
*Ignore it*<br>
<br>
&quot;Well... can I have some money???&quot;<br>
<br>
*Get annoyed, rant*<br>
<br>
&quot;WTF crawled up ur ass and died?!?!&quot;<br>
<br>
That was pretty much exactly what the last guy who begged off me said.<br>
<br>
You can crash the zones, rollback my character, eat my IP, nerf my skills... but if you REALLY want to get me riled... beg off me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.btinternet.com/~jrawling/sigani.gif"></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usayraao.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sayra AO</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#660000>(8/30/01 9:12:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: </span><hr size=1>      Well one thing that I've noticed is it seems hard to know who you're talking to/ being talked at it the game.

<br>
     One other problem I've noticed, and I'm not sure how many OTHER people suffer from, is that now and again I lose the ability to talk in Vicinity. I can still give tells, and talk in a group. But the vicinity chat, and the extra channels in the city will be gone.... A couple of times I've tried to talk to people.... and then realized that I'm typing, but nothing gets said. <br>

<br>
In EQ you had (at least when I played) a server with a smallish community and limited number of places to hunt at the various levels.  For instance, before the expansions, post-40 you were pretty much either in L-Guk or Sol-B or the planes.  You saw the same people pretty much everywhere you went.  Sure the name thing helped but eventually you'd pick that up anyway.<br>
<br>
In AO, you have 50k people on 2 servers and there are an infinite number of places you can level up, PLUS you can solo viably for all the classes.  So there's a very individual feeling because unlike EQ, where you cannot solo and there aren't a lot of options of places to go, you actually have a choice.<br>
<br>
Funny thing is I see people bitch about this a lot, and it confirms my suspicion (which the gaming companies all have hammered into their heads) that you just can't please everyone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Personally I love that fact in AO ... I like soloing, I like being able to log in for 10 minutes and play and then log out or getting a group and blasting the exp bar for a few hours.<br>
<br>
Then again I'm anti-social in gaming, so go figure.<br>

When I group I usually make a friend (or an enemy).  I also have quite a bit of friends in my guild.  As far as it goes with not meeting people in the city, I never really did that in EQ either.  I went in to sell my stuff and get out as quickly as possible.<br>

As far as not having anyone respond, maybe he thought you were talking to someone else.

Well one thing that I've noticed is it seems hard to know who you're talking to/ being talked at it the game. Without names over your head... it's just a bunch of people. Plus the helmets that ALL look the same don't seem to help matters. It never ceases to amaze me that AO gives us DOZENS of potential faxes to choose from, and then people go around with their helmets on 24/7. I've gotten to the point where I only where mine either in a fight, or while running a mission, otherwise it just adds to the &quot;impersonality&quot; of the game.<br>
----------<br>
<br>
My latest character is a opifex martial artist (which is why I'm reading posts on this board) and I decided I wouldn't try and make her &quot;uber&quot; like the others I've played. As a result, her appearance is very important...<br>
<br>
no helm<br>
low-tech gloves<br>
kevlar vest<br>
black/red pants when I can find some (or some plasteel)<br>
forgot what boots, but they go with the outfit :).<br>
<br>
So far it's made her very distinctive. Her Armor Class suffers a lot, but at this point (she's not even 20th yet) it doesn't really matter. I always pushed for the best armor with my other characters, to the point that they seemed to have about three times as much armor as they really needed. This will be my test to see if we can be distinctive and still fight mobs (players are a different issue...). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ubrodicius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brodicius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#660000>(8/30/01 12:17:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=24.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Armor making characters distinctive</span><hr size=1> I would have to agree that the Helmets on everyone makes the game anti social.  Whenever I get to a city, though I won't stay long I always take off my helmet.  I do keep a robe on though since I think most of the armor is ugly.  <br>
<br>
I do like the aspect of the game that you can solo very easily.  I am usually only online for an hour or maybe two at a time so soloing is optimal for me.  When playing EQ I would spend an hour lfg and then finally get in one just to say &quot;Sorry gtg&quot;.<br>
<br>
I did try to group once in the game started in Newland zoned out lost one person.  Lost another going through the first zone, lost two more changing to the desert.  With two of us left the dumbass attacked this camel looking thingy that grabbed about 5 of his buddies and took us out.  I love chatting with other people but when it comes to fighting I trust in myself, and a cable connection.<br>

I played eq for quite a while and this was a good thing IMHO.  <br>
Although not seeing the names above the head,  makes it seem a bit more like real life. Or at least realistic, in a certain sense. It is to me, allowing me to be whatever or whoever I choose to be, in the game somewhat. Im a very sociable person when I go out, so when Im in a social environment, if I see someone I know, I speak to them. If I want to find someone to do something mutual, I get up the nerve to ask them. But when its time for me to do things on my own, Im usually pretty introverted. e.g. solo mission...<br>
This allows you to make the game what you want out of it. I didnt like to be forced to group in eq, yet Id never give up my monk for a dr00d ( no offense to all the good druids out there, all two of you). <br>
<br>
Anyways, I suppose a switch wouldnt hurt, and definately the /find being back in the game. Although I personally would keep the names off. <br>

And those guns are no different from the ones you can buy in shops. So, it takes a lot of the challenge of having that rare 'pHa7 LeWtZ' that stresses individuality if visible.
