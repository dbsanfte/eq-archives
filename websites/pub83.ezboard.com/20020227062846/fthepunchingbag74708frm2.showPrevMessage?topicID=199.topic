<br>
With the recent fix to the surgery clinics (and assuming they'll fix the portable treatment labs soon), the difficulty of purchasing, building and installing implants just increased. You'll now need a nano programmer to build them. Then you'll need a doctor to help install them. We can all immediately pull out the pitchforks and storm Funcom, or we can think about why it is this way. <br>
<br>
Imagine trying to balance a game. Imagine trying to balance a game while the players are buffed. Imagine trying to balance a game while they are unbuffed. Imagine trying to balance a game with players killing other players. How do you do it? You can water everyone down so that every class is basically the same so that no one class is more powerful than another. You can take away the ability for players to improve themselves. You can basically have one heck of a boring game. So, you make different classes with different strengths and weaknesses. You give the players the independence to adjust themselves to make them better at what they do and fit more into their playstyle. You give options. Now that you've done that...how do you balance it? Do you balance it according to a non buffed player? Now everyone who has buffed is blowing through the levels and mobs because they out-power everything you intended. Do you balance it according to the buffed players? Well, now the unbuffed players are screaming at you because they aren't as powerful and the buffed players are bitching because they HAD to buff in order to play. Or do you balance on a middle ground and try to keep the buffing to a minimum while at the same time making it available to everyone? A very tricky thing to do.<br>
<br>
With implants being the way they are where you have to rely on others to get it done, they have effectively slowed you down. Is this bad? Maybe, but it helps them with making sure you don't get too powerful too quick. Now, this does hurt those that didn't get in on the exploits fast enough. That's a given. This happens with every nerf/fix/patch/etc. etc. It's an unfortunate down side to MMORPG's, but it's also a necessity for game play.<br>
<br>
I don't like the fact that others were able to use the surgery clinic exploit to use implants that Funcom didn't intend for people to use. I don't like the fact that they didn't fix the portable clinic first before taking away the exploit. I do kind of like the idea of having one person being an expert at building an implant and another being an expert at installing. <br>

I think that its important to build up communities within and without the game and one of the ways to do this is to have classes depend on one another for certain things.  In this case tradeskills.  People end up making friends with people they may not ever have before, because they need a Doctor to help install something or a NP to make implants or an Engineer to make a weapon.  This is a good thing.<br>
<br>
I also agree with this system adding a sort of bottleneck and slowing down people so they don't get too powerful too quickly.  You can't just do everything on your own and too easily or the game would just become too boring way too quickly.<br>
<br>
The only place I disagree is that putting these implants in was in any way shape or form an exploit.  (and this is not just because I was able to do this with a few implants).  If you look at the requirements on a QL70 implant, for example, you will see that the Ability skill requirement is 144.  This means that you would need 144 Strength or Stamina or Agility, etc.  to wear the implant.  At level 48, I easily can match that requirement and therefor wear QL70 implants.  The only thing that would prevent that is the Treatment requirement which is something like 335 or so.<br>
<br>
Under normal circumstances, this requirement would also be easily met at my level.  I would find a Doctor who had the Treatment skill I needed, pay them for their services and have them use a Surgery Clinic on me, then I could put the implant in.  No exploit needed.  This is how it's meant to be.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, since beta this has not worked as it was &quot;meant to be&quot;.  Portable clinics have been broken, Tutoring was broken and I think still is, im not sure.  Therefor, there was no way to install higher QL implants past a certain QL.  So, people found out that if you used the Machines in shops multiple times you could stack the Treatment buff and therefor install implants.  This was a workaround that people figured out and it continued to be used, by everyone who needed to install higher Quality implants, day after day.  Eventually, people started believeing that this was in fact the intended way.  Funcom never stated it wasn't and nobody was ever told not to use it.  It was accepted because it was the only way for these implants to be installed.  And now, that workaround is no longer there and the proper way to do it is not there, so implants past a certain QL cant be installed.<br>
<br>
That's the only real disagreement I have.  Where you say that Funcom didn't intend for us to wear these implants.  They did intend for us to wear them, its just that the system they intended us to use to wear them never worked.  So, the players were able to find another way.  Call this an exploit, but in reality its a workaround to a bug.<br>
<br>
It's a shame really, because if the system worked as intended, Doctors would have a trade skill that they could make money from.  Which would then finance their group hunting and let them avoid having to run solo missions.  Not to mention, people would be more prone to make friends or form guilds with the people who had the skills in these trades.  As is stands now, its just turned everything into a big ole cluster****. <p>Nurrplex, lvl 48 Opi MA (Omni)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=alianna>Alianna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 132<br> <font color=#660000>(8/23/01 5:01:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The dilemna with Implants</span><hr size=1> For myself, I look at it like this: If you could do everything yourself, you're playing a single-player game.<br>
<br>
I chose to be a class that destroyed, not created. I don't mind one bit having other players &quot;help me out&quot; (not like I'm not paying them) with the skills they have that I need.<br>
<br>
One hand washes the other--because the next time I get into a group, who's going to be tanking? Different situations require different skill sets. I don't begrudge their need for me to block and aggro mobs, and they don't begrudge my need to have them put that cluster in this implant.<br>
<br>
Is that an answer? :)<br>

Eating pizza and trying to act smart don't mix. They were obviously intended to be worn at your level according to the stat req's. And a Doctor was not able to fulfill the treatment level you required. So, the only fix here is to .. well, fix the Doctor's ability to use the portable surgery clinics so that things work (/shudder) as intended. I think I brought all this up so that those who will complain that they have to find a doctor now to get their treatment up (once again, assuming they fix the portable labs asap), will understand what I think Funcom had in mind when it came to implants. And to discuss this aspect of the game. Or, it was to pass the time with a lot of rhetoric while I waited for the bloody server to come back up. Either or. Whatever. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I tested this two days ago and it worked, so I imagine it is still working.<br>
<br>
Target self and activate surgery clinic.  Target other player and continue to activate surgery clinic as much as needed.  I don't know if you can activate it more than once while targetting the same person as I never have needed more than two boosts.  If so, just try targetting a third person, or try switching between yourself and the other person each activation of the surgery clinic.  One is bound to work.<br>
<br>
Normally I wouldn't condone work arounds such as this, but in the light that the proper ways to have this done are not quite working and they haven't mentioned this as an exploit, I don't see any major problems with it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uthormael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thormael</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#660000>(8/31/01 5:39:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=193.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The dilemna with Implants</span><hr size=1> Aren't you locking other people's treatment skills doing this? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><hr><b>Thormael</b> - opifex Male, <u>Martial Artist 36</u> Clan - R.I.OT.<br><b>Twentynine</b> - opifex Male, <u>Enforcer 33</u> Clan<br><b>Powtragh</b> - solitus Male, <u>Enforcer 26</u> Clan - R.I.OT.<br><b>Ixiblat</b> - nanomage Male, <u>Meta-Physicist 6</u>, Omni</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uthesensei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Sensei</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=" http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The MAN.

I thought the need to find a blacksmith or a jeweler in EQ was one of the few things that made the game really intriguing, and I believe UO had similar things.  I think they should add in ammo creation, special weapon  / armor creation and a lot more -- you shouldn't be able to jack-of-all-trades your character to such an extent in one of these that you never need anyone else, imho.<br>
