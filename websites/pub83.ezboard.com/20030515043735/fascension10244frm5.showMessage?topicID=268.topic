Alot of you know me, alot of you dont.  I've got a good heart and a razor sharp wit.  I'm the original owner as well as a r/l friend of the Beanyo.  Looking for some good times with good people.  I dont have great gear, but I'm not looking for loot..  Just a raid or event to attend with friends for a good time.  I've just recently returned from a long break I needed stemming from the transfer of leadership within MiM.  Alot of my dear old friends have joined AD, and I am looking to play alongside them again.   Eq isnt what it once was, and I miss it.<br>
<br>
I believe you'll find me a wonderful addition to any party, try me and see.<br>

Heaven forbid I could only raid once or twice a week. I stopped going when everyone started getting retarded.  It was a big dickwaving contest and I wanted none of it.  I still have some spendable syn hours left too.<br>
<br>
Ruhi your memory fails you.  In caterva I went to 5 hate raids for every 1 fear raid I could attend.  That was PRE-2nd level mobs, and we all know how much loot was available for rangers in hate back then.  On top of that, Fear/Hate was all there was to do, so its all we could do, and I got sick of it.  You were all better geared and higher level than I, yet piss and moan when I dont attend so I can EXP.<br>
<br>
Please, look at my gear and tell me I am a loot whore.  Then we can all have a good laugh and how silly it sounds.<br>
<br>
And yes, while warring people I did flame them often and repeatedly.. But believe you me I was only defending my guild and my friends.  Like I've seen you all do a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> thousand</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> times before.  Why is it so much worse coming from my mouth?  Shall I go surfing through all the old message boards and throw up some links showing how much you have also been &quot;a troublemaker&quot;?  I never instigated a war.. war had already beset us, and I was just a soldier.<br>
<br>
I can understand that some of you are angry with me.. you've never been on my team, on my side of the battle.  Hence you've always been my enemy and you truly know nothing about me or my real personality.  There are plenty out there who can vouche for me, I just hope they get here soon.  =P<br>

Why?   I only replied logically to people defaming my character.  I am here with no attitude, whatever you speak of is construed purely in your mind only.  I a refuse to let you bait me into a flame war.<br>
<br>
You say you arent ashamed of anything you said or did during that war.  When then should I?   For some reason it was okay for you to flame on, but everyone else should have been respectful and let you rant and rave with no objection?  You sir think fairly highly of yourself, to put yourself above everyone else.  I felt that I said what was needed to be said, in response to your attacks on my guildmembers.  It was a war, remember?<br>
<br>
Let me say this... I do not care why you hate me, I apologize for it.  Whatever it was that I said or did, I am sorry.  You'll find me a great ally, and on your side I will attempt to do great things.   This chip you carry does not rest on my shoulder.  Bygones be bygones.  If you still wish to hold this age old grudge, theres nothing I can do about it.  But this hatred you hold is from a war long gone, in a guild you are no longer in.  Interesting, no?<br>
<br>
And before you give people the wrong idea Ruhi, let me just throw this out there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The only thing Caterva ever gave me was Thorny Vine Greaves, and the Rat Whip from hate.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Know why I got them?  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> They were going to decay.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
So I showed up for Fear and Hate raids because I got what I &quot;needed&quot;. Apparently all I needed was a pair of pants and a whip.  Wow, I'm easy!<br>
<br>
Ruhi stop being so mean.  The past is in the past, I think I've shown people that I put in more effort then I get in dues.. and if I was an ass to you it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> during a war and you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> flaming on our message boards.  Now your messing up my chances to hang out with my old friends again for spite..  If we want to point fingers on the troublemakers it can go in some other direction thanks.<br>
<br>
Beanyo, Gilthad, thank you. I just wish more of my friends were about, this thread is starting to make me look stupid.<br>

And you're right the lootwhore accusation isn't completely accurate. However your attendance in Synergy was spotty at best and most notable when we did Fear. <br>
<br>
And personally I didn't find you a &quot;great ally.&quot; I found you to be childish, absurdly condescending, and embarrasingly immature; though I think I told you this once. Your insults during wars were over the top and baseless, and you repeatedly insisted on telling people exactly how things were despite the fact that you weren't around enough to ever see them for yourself.<br>
<br>
That said I don't despise you as much as people seemed to think. I do think you're a fool, and I don't think you're capable of interacting with other people without insulting them. However I'm not always right. No matter what you seem to think though, attacking Ruhi's opinions like that isn't going to change them. You might find, as per Ruhi's suggestion, working your problems out with people in private is more effective. I'd say you've got along way to go if you really want to convince people you're someone they'd want to have around. I will wish you luck in that endeavor though.<br>

I have no tolerance for people getting in my way, and I am completely relentless until any threats or opposition are removed. I try to be down-to-earth, but something always seems to get in the way. <A HREF="http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A><br>

Two things I remember about Lyssa:<br>
<br>
1)  She came to Fear.  A lot.  I don't remember a 5 to 1 ratio.  I do remember people commenting about this that's why I remember. That's not that big of a deal tho.<br>
<br>
2)  During the MiM/FS Lyssa openly supported Kaaq and Aenia on the message boards and never once focused on his/her actions which led to the war.  Supporting your guild is fine, but blindly supporting a true fuckwad like kaaq/astarial and a dumb cunt like Aenia, when they were CLEARLY in the wrong is where I draw the line.  I found it ironic Aenia wanted &quot;no part of this war&quot; soon after and quit MiM, and Kaaq quit soon after.  Lyssa happily continued to talk shit.<br>
<br>
Don't like fair-weather friends and I don't like people who openly support shit-stains.  No thanks.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I can understand that some of you are angry with me.. you've never been on my team, on my side of the battle. Hence you've always been my enemy and you truly know nothing about me or my real personality. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Fair enough.  So why are you applying?<br>

I consider Lyssa to be a friend.  Not the kind that hugs ya when you stand near em.  But the kinda friend that will drop what they are doing and help you in a pinch.  If I see Lyssa fighting someone I don't know, I will help her (him, it, whatever) kill whomever that is because she has done the same for me in the past.  Unfortunately, among her faults is being a very vocal presence on the MBs.  I know of quite a few others that can be accused of the same thing.<br>
<br>
Ruhi, Gsam et al:  I have a basic understanding of your opinion of Lyssa through my conversations with Praxx.  I am certainly not in a position to refute your arguements.  I have stated my opinion of Lyssa previously and will leave it at that.  Your own experience may differ from mine.<br>
<br>
Lyssa:  I consider you a friend and as such I would suggest the following things.  I have a motto that hasn't failed me yet:  Never miss a good opportunity to shut the hell up.  If your digging a hole for yourself and someone hands you a shovel, it's not necessarily in your best interest to use it.<br>
