<br>
1st) Sabryna was the enchanter that I &quot;randomly&quot; pked in VL about a week ago. Nurp and I were pvping LV in GD when Sabryna ported in and asked me the simple question &quot; weren't you in DB?&quot;. I responded &quot;yes&quot;. Then commenced a 15 minute barrage of criticism and the like shit talking which I sat and watched until I couldn't take anymore of it. I told her to end the harassing tells which she replied with 2 comments. &quot;You will always be a random pk , you will never be able to escape your random pk ways&quot; and &quot; Come to VL and kill me Pker if you have the guts, but oh wait Druids can't pk cause they suck&quot;. sooooo anyway........ Tekas went to VL and found Sabryna at the SH with Untocar , another WoM. I admit I attacked and killed her with both of them on me, then gated and explained why to Untocar. This led to me finding out that Sabryna is Untocar's RL wife. ttt . Now I explained the reason precisely to Unto why I attacked her, and if she really is his &quot;wife&quot; or whatever then perhaps she should learn some manners? WoM, pissed that Sabryna was killed decided to war DoS for this said reason and have not heard from them since other than shit talk in /ooc or /tell . Now, Unto- I'm sorry for Killing your wife but the threats and tells got a lot to handle <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and I really didn't have much patience that day. It wasn't a pk attempt, due to the fact that I didn't even try to loot her and could have easily. DoS does not want to war anyone unless we are attacked, or sufficient reason is proposed for us to lead ourselves into war. This was explained to Untocar many times, and yet he says that WoM will own DoS. I don't quite understand what he means by this since he controls 3 of the 5 people in his guild, but gl if you want to keep warring over your wife's big mouth /shrug. When you want to talk and be reasonable send me or Rhyden a tell in game and this pointless fighting can end as soon as it began. Again the attack made on Sabyrna was made not as a &quot;random&quot; pk attempt, but merely to have some peace in my tell window box.<br>
<br>
2) Now lets discuss Eisen. While we were still at war with Fusion, it came to my knowledge from someone in the guild ( I dont remember exactly who ) that Ektar was un-anon in Fear plane. Now I interpreted this as a taunt for someone to go up, seek and attack him so I ported up and found that he was apparently MiM's guest on a CT raid. No biggy . I went far away from the raid group as to not look like I was going to attack during the killing process and sat down to wait until all mobs were dead. I was then attacked by Eisen for no apparent reason and without warning. I highly doubt that Eisen was acting on an order given to him by a MiM officer by attacking me, I gated out of PoF to fight Fusion shortly after CT was dead. After about 15 mins of fighting Fusion in GD, a party of DoS were medding in front of VL (me included) when Eisen, Amax and Laterian come up, and attack me for no reason, and without warning. Since I gave the order for no DoS to help me I took the death and spoke to an MiM officer. I was then informed that the said reason Eisen and crew attacked me was because I said &quot;MiM sux&quot;. I never said this, or anything to the like. I personally have no problem with MiM and its members save Eisen. As far as this &quot;bullying' people goes Eisen, was it not what You were doing using your guild's name to back you? I find your way of posting and defending your spas actions most hypocritical <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
3rd) Lets talk finally about my involvement in DB. To tell you the truth, DB was extremely well organized as far as a guild went. They had a great board, a good loot system and most of the members had a good attitude about this game. For the short time I was in DB, yes I pked Anti-whatever guild you were in. Didn't matter much to me however since I joined DB to provide myself with as many pvp targets I could. Most of the reason I joined DB was due to the fact that I was greatly into PvP back then, and there were really no good wars <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (If I would have only known about msg board wars /sigh) Tekas was a pk when and only when he was in DB for that short amount of time. As far as people calling me &quot;once a pk always a pk&quot;... well , I don't really know how to approach it. I can say that I haven't PKed, or helped pkers, and fought along side with AD, MiM, OM, Wudan, and such Anti guilds for around.. a year if not more. For the people who call me still a random, or once a random always a random, or yada yada etc, have you asked yourself why is it that you care? I am willing to bet 100% that during the short time I was in DB, I never once attacked any of you personally. Now I understand with the bad rep that follows once being in DB, but seriously guys, I am leader of a guild that has 30  members lvl 56 and above, trying to settle KS, KoS, and alike issues daily, trying to keep my woman happy, thinking all the time Eisen is mad cool, .. basically I just have better things to be doing than talking BS about how I am still a random pk. Don't you guys too?<br>
<br>
Well I'm sure glad my friend brought this thread to my attention cause I had fun with this post. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am not a random pk, nor will I be for the rest of my eq days. I have fought alongside many of you against PB when they were still around and would like to start seeing actions speaking louder than words. Back to EQ now later.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;So Fusion steals the VS spawn from Fusion or something and the two guilds end up at war. Right? Good! Go RZ!&quot; -Eisen<br>
<br>
.... hmm ok I guess. Does anyone else see what is wrong with this? I believe this is from someone who knows 100% of the facts and deserves the attention of the people reading....<br>

Edit: Btw before Tekas joined (made?) DoS, I talked to him a lot and he's a good guy. Like all guildleaders he's an asshole to most people outside his guild. I don't blame him, I'm the same way.

You will not kill Sabryna at random and expect me not to war your guild.  If you cant control your temper that is something you will have to live with.  Sabryna is my real life wife and I was sitting right there when you attacked her in the safehall of VL.  And I asked you why did you just randomly kill my guild?  And you answered she was talking mad shit.  All she asked you was didnt you used to be in Darkenbane? and something in your head just triggered and you went off the handle.  So you can tell your guild why they are being killed and maybe next time you wont let your temper write checks you cant cash.  And another thing I dont feel is right for a leader to do is call the members of DOS we do kill the losers of DOS.  I am sure they dont know your calling them such names. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utekas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tekas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(10/12/02 9:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=64.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Untocar</span><hr size=1> Yes Untocar, like I said, I'm sorry for attacking your wife in SH. But warring over her big mouth, is stupid. Sorry it came to this, but when I came to her I /d with no response other than more shit talking. So consider the death as a duel death and nothing more. This could also be why I didn't even go near her to loot and gated without fighting you.....<br>

FYI. <br>
<br>
&quot;You will not kill Sabryna at random and expect me not to war your guild.&quot; - Untocar <br>
<br>
She knew what she was saying to begin with. If you were &quot;sitting&quot; right next to her through this whole thing, maybe you were the one getting her to taunt me and push my over the edge. True Sab and I could have both settled it in a more professional manner, but since we didn't and it cost her and you a little pride, lets chalk it up to that and call it even? or do you think we need to continue fighting over your wife's potty mouth......<br>
