palestine does not belong to israel, no matter how hard certain factions of israeli opinion wish it. Palestine is currently occupied by israel and has been since 1967. Palestine belongs to the palestinians.<br>

You are stating obvious things that don't really further your argument.  The Iraqi people may die as collateral damage in this war, or die under Saddam's brutal regime.  The people may slowly die of food and thirst now, or die slowly of malnutrition and thirst under Saddam.<br>
<br>
&quot;UNICEF figures show that over 1 in 5 Iraqi children remain malnourished.&quot;<br>
<br>
Deaths are an expected part of war.  An unfortunate reality.  If your going to harp on every death to try and play the sympathy card, then I can see why France gave up so easliy to the Germans. <br>
<br>
Liberation has always come with a price.  WWI and WWII were won with innocent deaths, sacrifices by our troops, and a resolve to win.  In this age of instant war coverage, the media in it's need for constant news gives us what we want.  In WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Korea, etc, it took weeks for news to be gathered and reported.  <br>
<br>
But I am certain innocent deaths took place in the opening days of those wars, yet the war continued.  If fact, every war throughout history has involved countless deaths of innocents, destruction, loss of lives.<br>
<br>
The threat of terrorism against the US has always been there.  It's not going away if the US stops the attack against Iraq.  As Taranna is fond of saying, US policy in the Middle East is the reason for terrorism against the US.  Add the Israeli/Palestinian issue to the mex, I believe invading Iraq is nothing. <br>
<br>
The UN, the great savior, responsible for millions of deaths in the name of doing good.  Even this nobel institution has blood on it's hands.  But perhaps the way they deal in death is more acceptable.<br>
<br>
Former Yugoslavia:<br>
In a rare move, the United Nations has taken itself to task in a report on its performance before and during a massacre which claimed the lives of thousands during the Bosnian war. The report is a frank and harsh account of the U.N.'s response to the killings in 1994 at Srebrenica. <br>
<br>
So far, at least 2,500 bodies have been recovered from Srebrenica and thousands of Muslims are still missing. They are believed to have been killed after Serb forces overran what was said by the U.N. to be a safe haven. <br>
 <br>
Rwanda:<br>
Some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered by Hutu extremists between April and June 1994. The UN had 2,000 peacekeepers in Rwanda before the genocide but it started to withdraw them as the killing began. When the scale of the slaughter became clear, the UN authorised more troops to be sent to Rwanda, but they did not arrive in time to prevent the massacres. <br>
<br>
East Timor:<br>
In late August 1999, the UN and now Secretary General Annan, called for elections on the small island country of East Timor despite disturbing evidence that hard line elements in the Indonesian military were preparing to cause wide spread public disorder so as to disrupt the elections. The UN failed to provide adequate protection for the civilian population. Dili was burnt to the ground and East Timor was engulfed in violence. After weeks of killing and millions of dollars of damage, the Australian government sent in ground troops to restore order to East Timor; but by then, it was too late to save East Timor from UN bungling.<br>
<br>
Support in Iraq:<br>
You say the civilian population in Iraq hate the US and dont' want to be liberated.  Well I disagree.  The Kurds to the North are more than willing to fight, as resistance in the South is slowing gaining ground.  The population is more cautious in it's support due to the betrayal they felt in the first Gulf War. So regaining that support will be a slow process.  (poor kurds, they probably gonna get shafted again)  Did you read about the Iraqi troops firing on it's own population with mortars to keep them from leaving Basra for aid?  And the Human Shields?  Real love for Iraqis there.<br>
<br>
Basiclly your stating broad feelings on how bad war is and trying to play the sympathy card with one sided stories in your last post.  Nothing new gleamed, nothing new learned, same one sided presentation.<br>
<br>
PNAC quote:<br>
This is not a yes or no type of question.  America is a democratic based country where we elect representatives who we feel will act in our best interest.  These representatives will then make decisions based on their own beliefs, opinions of fellow law makers, interest of supporters back home, or to lobbyists.  The leaders, aka President, leaders of congress, leaders of the senate, will then make policy and enforce it.  <br>
<br>
Yes I agree that leaders can bring the population around to their way of thinking, because it's the people who elect the multiple officials who put them into office.  If a policy is wrong, then the people will voice their disapproval at the polls for new leaders.  The new leaders then make new policy, and the process repeats itself.  Time is the determining factor for which policy shall be judged as success or not.<br>

Hussein In Power<br>
by The Heritage Foundation Web Memo #217<br>
February 28, 2003<br>
<br>
France<br>
<br>
a. According to the CIA World Factbook, France controls over 22.5 percent of Iraq's imports.[1] French total trade with Iraq under the oil-for-food program is the third largest, totaling $3.1 billion since 1996, according to the United Nations.[2] In 2001 France became Iraq's largest European trading partner.<br>
<br>
b. Roughly 60 French companies do an estimated $1.5 billion in trade with Baghdad annually under the U.N. oil-for-food program.[3]<br>
<br>
c. France's largest oil company, Total Fina Elf, has negotiated a deal to develop the Majnoon field in western Iraq. The Majnoon field purportedly contains up to 30 billion barrels of oil.[4]<br>
<br>
d. Total Fina Elf also negotiated a deal for future oil exploration in Iraq's Nahr Umar field. Both the Majnoon and Nahr Umar fields are estimated to contain as much as 25 percent of the country's reserves.[5]<br>
<br>
e. France's Alcatel company, a major telecom firm, is negotiating a $76 million contract to rehabilitate Iraq's telephone system.[6]<br>
<br>
f. From 1981 to 2001, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), France was responsible for over 13 percent of Iraq's arms imports.[7]<br>
<br>
<br>
Germany<br>
<br>
a. Direct trade between Germany and Iraq amounts to about $350 million annually, and another $1 billion is reportedly sold through third parties.[8]<br>
<br>
b. It has recently been reported that Saddam Hussein has ordered Iraqi domestic businesses to show preference to German companies as a reward for Germany's &quot;firm positive stand in rejecting the launching of a military attack against Iraq.&quot; It was also reported that over 101 German companies were present at the Baghdad Annual exposition.[9]<br>
<br>
c. During the 35th Annual Baghdad International Fair in November 2002, a German company signed a contract for $80 million for 5,000 cars and spare parts.[1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
d. In 2002, DaimlerChrysler was awarded over $13 million in contracts for German trucks and spare parts.[11]<br>
<br>
e. German officials are investigating a German corporation accused of illegally channeling weapons to Iraq via Jordan. The equipment in question is used for boring the barrels of large cannons and is allegedly intended for Saddam Hussein's Al Fao Supercannon project.[12]<br>
<br>
<br>
Russia<br>
<br>
a. According to the CIA World Factbook, Russia controls roughly 5.8 percent of Iraq's annual imports.[13] Under the U.N. oil-for-food program, Russia's total trade with Iraq was somewhere between $530 million and $1 billion for the six months ending in December of 2001.[14]<br>
<br>
b. According to the Russian Ambassador to Iraq, Vladimir Titorenko, new contracts worth another $200 million under the U.N. oil-for-food program are to be signed over the next three months.[15]<br>
<br>
c. Soviet-era debt of $7 billion through $8 billion was generated by arms sales to Iraq during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.<br>
<br>
d. Russia's LUKoil negotiated a $4 billion, 23-year contract in 1997 to rehabilitate the 15 billion-barrel West Qurna field in southern Iraq. Work on the oil field was expected to commence upon cancellation of U.N. sanctions on Iraq. The deal is currently on hold.[16]<br>
<br>
e. In October 2001, Salvneft, a Russian-Belarus company, negotiated a $52 million service contract to drill at the Tuba field in Southern Iraq.[17]<br>
<br>
f. In April 2001, Russia's Zaruezhneft Company received a service contract to drill in the Saddam, Kirkuk, and Bai Hassan fields to rehabilitate the fields and reduce water incursion.<br>
<br>
g. A future $40 billion Iraqi-Russian economic agreement, reportedly signed in 2002, would allow for extensive oil exploration opportunities throughout western Iraq.[18] The proposal calls for 67 new projects, over a 10-year time frame, to explore and further develop fields in southern Iraq and the Western Desert, including the Suba, Luhais, West Qurna, and Rumaila projects. Additional projects added to the deal include second-phase construction of a pipeline running from southern to northern Iraq, and extensive drilling and gas projects. Work on these projects would commence upon cancellation of sanctions.[19]<br>
<br>
h. Russia's Gazprom company over the past few years has signed contracts worth $18 million to repair gas stations in Iraq.[2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
i. The former Soviet Union was the premier supplier of Iraqi arms. From 1981 to 2001, Russia supplied Iraq with 50 percent of its arms.[21]<br>
<br>
<br>
China<br>
<br>
a. According to the CIA World Factbook, China controls roughly 5.8 percent of Iraq's annual imports.[22] b. China National Oil Company, partnered with China North Industries Corp., negotiated a 22-year-long deal for future oil exploration in the Al Ahdab field in southern Iraq.[23]<br>
<br>
c. In recent years, the Chinese Aero-Technology Import-Export Company<br>
(CATIC) has<br>
been contracted to sell &quot;meteorological satellite&quot; and &quot;surface observation&quot; equipment to Iraq. This contract was approved by the U.N. oil-for-food program.[24]<br>
<br>
d. CATIC also won approval from the U.N. in July 2000 to sell $2 million worth of fiber optic cables. This and similar contracts approved were disguised as telecommunications gear. These cables can be used for secure data and communications links between national command and control centers and long-range search radar, targeting radar, and missile-launch units, according to U.S. officials. In addition, China National Electric Wire &amp; Cable and China National Technical Import Telecommunications Equipment Company are believed to have sold Iraq $6 million and $15.5 million worth of communications equipment and other unspecified supplies, respectively.[25]<br>
<br>
e. According to a report from SIPRI, from 1981 to 2001, China was the second largest supplier of weapons and arms to Iraq, supplying over 18 percent of Iraq's weapons imports.[26]<br>

The essence of the first part of your post was that French companies currently do 1.5 billion of business with Iraq under oil for food, and that up to rougly $5 billion dollars of business in total is planned.  For a start the oil for food programme numbers are nonsense because oil for food is ongoing and will continue to be so regardless of the war.  As for the rest...  I'm not sure how much you know about economic figures Kad, but that's quite frankly peanuts.  It's less than a tenth of the US's budget for this war, less than a fifth of the UK's budget for the war.  <br>
<br>
Out of France's GDP of 1.2 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>trillion</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dollars, potentially 3.5 billion, a little more than 1/1000th of the French economy might be lost because of the war.  OH NOES!  I mean, France's economic growth of 0.3% in 2001 was disastrous, but even assuming a repeat of that, 3/1000ths of economic growth easily absorbs the loss of 1/1000, they'll barely notice.  Saying France opposed the war for economic reasons is utterly thick, they could reinvest the money at the drop of a hat in any number of other oil ventures.  Not least of which is British North Sea oil, which as trade within the EU is tax-free and less cost to transport.<br>
<br>
The same is true of the Germans, an economy of 1.85 trillion isn't even going to flinch if a few million in trade goes astray, it'll just find other markets in Europe.  Lower transport costs, 0 tax on goods crossing EU borders and funding incentives from the EU for trading with a European partner.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>c. Soviet-era debt of $7 billion through $8 billion was generated by arms sales to Iraq during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
HAHAHA, you're joking right?  The US and UK sold a combined worth of 250 billion dollars of arms to Saddam prior to and during the first two years of the Iran-Iraq war.  We completely crowded those pesky Ruskies out of the market and rightly so!  After all, our weapons are that much more lethal, particularly chemical agents as those Kurds found out in Hallabja.  Reagan was still smiling though, so it was all good I suppose.  Even more hilarious was the sight of Donald Rumsfeld, the man who sold Saddam billions of dollars worth of weaponry, and gave him millions more in credit to buy weapons...telling Syria to stop selling Iraq weapons!  What's good for the goose is certainly good for the gander I suppose eh?  After all, if the US has peddled weapons to Iraq, why shouldn't the Syrians?<br>
<br>
Russia certainly does have more to lose than France, but that's not saying much.  Their GDP is 320 billion, but their economy grew by 29% last year, so a minor loss of trade will hardly hurt such a bullish economy.  Most nations suffered horribly in 2001 trade-wise, Russia was one of the brightest spots around the globe in that regard.<br>
<br>
As for China...lol.  Without including Hong Kong, their GDP is 1.1 trillion US dollars, their trade with Iraq is a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot compared to their open trade with North Korea and Pakistan.  Those 25 F-16s the US sold to the military dictarship currently ruling Pakistan are worth more than the sum of China's trade with Iraq since 1990.  Citing economic reasons for these nations being involved is irrelevant, these nations would barely be affected.  A link listing GDPs:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.e-edge.org/special/GDP.htm">www.e-edge.org/special/GDP.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Saying these nations oppose a war because of oil/trade is as laughable as saying the US is supporting this war for oil/trade.  That may seem to be a theme of the protesters marching in the US Kad, but you don't see it here in Europe.  Most people here oppose the war because they think we'll all suffer as a result- people aren't stupid enough to think that even Rumsfeld would send American troops to die for a few oil companies.  Nor should people in the US be stupid enough to think France opposed this war because they risked losing a thousandth of their economy.  Opposing the US is a huge political risk at the best of times- on a point of war it'd take a hell of a lot more than that meagre trade relationship to sway the diplomacy of a nation like France.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, on to lurkers arguments, if they can be called that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What's in this war against Iraq? You are stating obvious things that don't really further your argument. The Iraqi people may die as collateral damage in this war, or die under Saddam's brutal regime<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not at all a statement of the obvious- my point was that where sanctions backed mainly by the US have pushed Iraq into a humanitarian crisis, this war has turned it into a disaster area.  60% of Iraqis depend on the oil for food programme to survive, and as a result of the war the aid isn't getting through.  The RFAV <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sir Galahad</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is carrying 200 tonnes of aid to the people of Southern Iraq, it's true.  But guess what, you would need 80 such shipments <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>a day</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to even break even with the oil for food programme.  Never mind the people who were suffering in spite of that.<br>
<br>
In Basra we've seen water and power facilities attacked and deliberately disrupted, in that city of 2 million people, nearly 400,000 children have been deemed to be at risk of death due to thirst or malnourishment.  Speaking of which:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;UNICEF figures show that over 1 in 5 Iraqi children remain malnourished.&quot;<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If you think that constitutes your case for going to war you're far more naive than I thought.  Here's a little eye-opener:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.unicefusa.org/ssc/global.html">www.unicefusa.org/ssc/global.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
That's right lurker!  The global malnourishment level for children is almost 1 in 3.  So in fact, as brutal as the Iraqi regime is, they're doing a better job at feeding their children than North Korea, China, or Pakistan.  China has a huge population problem- but North Korea?  2/3 children in North Korea go hungry to bed at night lurker.  Pakistan is a dictatorship, a brutal regime, with far worse humanitarian difficulties as a result of a military government that cares nothing for its people.  Are you advocating the US invade them too lurker?  Those damn nick-nacks obviously can't govern themselves so you'll bomb the shite out of them and show them how right?  Wrong.  <br>
<br>
Both nations are nuclear-capable, so despite the fact they are far more brutal regimes than Saddam's you're happy to do nothing there I take it.  All your talk of bravery, death and sacrifice for liberty sounds hollow if you consider the US position towards these far more destructive regimes.  The policy as usual seems to be- &quot;support the dictators we like or are too afraid of, bomb the shite out of the ones we don't like/daren't touch&quot;  Except that none of those bombs have touched Saddam- like the sanctions your government trumpeted, it is the Iraqi people who are being made victims of this &quot;solution&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Liberation has always come with a price. WWI and WWII were won with innocent deaths, sacrifices by our troops, and a resolve to win.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If you truly believe the situations can be compared, you either haven't been reading my posts/the news, or you're truly thick.  Those wars were a matter of national survival you imbecile, nations were fighting across borders against an expansionist power which had overwhelming military force.  Saddam is neither expansionist (Kuwait was always historically the 19th province of Iraq) nor is in possession of overwhelming mlitary force.  And Iraq does not threaten our national survival- so where is the need for this war again?  Nowhere in your post have you given a good reason for it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The threat of terrorism against the US has always been there. It's not going away if the US stops the attack against Iraq.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Did I ever say it would?  I said it would get worse, and every security expert consulted agrees with me.  Who's misdirecting now lurker?<br>
<br>
Regarding Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo- those were situations where internal genocide occured within a nation.  Where's the genocide in Iraq lurker?  And if you're going to pull out the long and bloody record of the Iraqi regime....firstly that's not genocide.  In fact it's a good deal less bloody than Pakistan, Saudi Arabia or Israel- more Palestinians have died at Israeli hands since 1967 than innocent Iraqis have under Saddam Hussein.  All those nations I mention are your allies lurker- why aren't you invading them?  Heck, why are you allies? :P  Another thing you conveniently ignore is that while the UN was involved late in those scenarios because of its unwillingness to involve itself in civil wars within a nation-state, it did ultimately get involved.  <br>
<br>
Not because the US lead the way, but because France did.  Yes, the now hated French were the co-submitters of the resolutions authorising military force in Bosnia and in Rwanda- the US wasn't.  In fact, the US was opposed to involvement in Rwanda, whether by itself or the UN- a similar veto threat killed two resolutions pre-dating UN involvement in Rwanda.  And it is UN mandates that are now successfully putting these nations back together lurker, not a retired US general administering a protectorate.<br>
<br>
Regarding East Timor- you have absolutly no idea what you're talking about.  ASEAN sent a regional coalition of forces to act as peace-keepers long before Australian troops were committed to the area.  What's more, it was a UN mandate that allowed for the legal rights of Timor Timur as a self-determined area, on the road to nationhood.  Foreign troops may have helped (under a UN mandate) to resolve a civil conflict, but they were asked in, they didn't invade.  And they didn't hang about either, most of them withdrew after the conflict, which lasted all of 2 weeks.  The more you look at East Timor, the more you'd realize that it was pretty well an unqualified success from the moment the UN was involved.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The population is more cautious in it's support due to the betrayal they felt in the first Gulf War. So regaining that support will be a slow process<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If that was true, then why are 40-50,000 Iraqi exiles in Jordan getting on buses and heading back into Iraq to fight?  Swapping a relatively cushy life in Jordan for a war-torn nation uncertain of its future is an act of patriotism, not uncertainty.  While I agree that a good many in the south of Iraq are mistrustful- central and northern Iraqi tribes, particularly the Tikriti and Basvani tribes will support Saddam to the end.  These aren't fanatical Fedayeen or regular forces- just ordinary citizens prepared to resist any foreign occupation.  They look at the plight of the Palestinians and think to themselves &quot;I don't want to live like that, I don't want my life to be lived at the sufferance of a foreign power&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Basiclly your stating broad feelings on how bad war is <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You really don't understand my argument at all.  My point is not that war is bad, but that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>this</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> war is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>unecessary</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and always was.  Not only that, but I argued that if war had to come, it should have international backing.  This isn't a nation acting in self-defence, nor acting to help another nation defending itself.  This is aggression, plain and simple- and for wars that deal with the internal affairs of a sovreign state you need overwhelming international support for the peace to be won afterwards.  <br>
<br>
With a UN mandate and an Arab coalition, the Iraqi regime were forced to back down and surrender in 1991- the region was against them, the will of the international community was against them.  The Saddam regime will fight to the bitter end as long as they are convinced the Arab world and their people support them.  That is why international support was crucial, why any war would have been far less bloody with the peace more certain if consensus was honestly sought.  It wasn't, and the consequences are as I've stated.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes I agree that leaders can bring the population around to their way of thinking, because it's the people who elect the multiple officials who put them into office.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
How very interesting.  What I didn't tell you lurker, was that although that quote did indeed come from Donald Rumsfeld speaking to the PNAC, he was quoting someone else:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://pic5.picturetrail.com/VOL81/616617/969437/21919042.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
That's right- Rumsfeld was quoting Reichsmarshall Herman Goering, the commander of the Nazi Luftwaffe.  There's a chilling amount of truth in those words, especially in the way the Bush administration has sold this war.  The Nazis were not a democratic government, yet they had huge, massive overwhelming popular support.  Such was their support that nearly half a dozen countries under the Nazi glove had thousands willing to fight for the Reich, even the SS- two SS brigades were Czech for example.  They didn't call it a coalition of the willing at the time, but there certainly is resonance with the &quot;you're either with us or against us&quot; part of the Bush &amp; Nazi doctrines.  Support them, and you get a kind word and a say in the way conquered territories are administered and profited from.  Speak against them- and you face either terrible military force, or isolation (Sweden &amp; Switzerland had their borders closed to trade)<br>
<br>
I'm not making a direct comparison of governments, just of particular points of policy- it's no less chilling, even with that qualification I make.  How easily people are persuaded to support, even fight for wrongful, sometimes evil policies doesn't seem to have changed much in the US lurker.  One of the main reasons Germany and France are so vehemently against this war is that they well remember how easily so many people were willing to die for or passively support a wrongful cause.  They don't want to be caught on the wrong side again, they want international institutes to work.  And it'll take more than Freedom Fries and people not buying wine to sway that position of principle.  Bush is burning his bridges with these countries and using what's left to fan the flames of terror that will surely threaten us ever increasingly as this war goes on.  You have argued that terrorists can be deterred by this war lurker.  I'll end my post with this question:  How do you propose to deter a hateful fanatic who cares nothing for his own life, if even the Israelis can't?  That question would trouble any intelligent leader's sleep.  Guess Dubyah's ok though!<br>

<br>
Interviewer:<br>
If you read the media reports, there were allegedly atrocities committed by the Northern Alliance against captured Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners. Were you exposed to any of that? <br>
<br>
Mark, Capt. <br>
No member of this detachment ever witnessed any atrocities being committed. We talked extensively with all of the Northern Alliance commanders about respecting basic human rights. At no time did they plan or, that we're aware of, attempt to conduct any of these atrocities. <br>
<br>
Now on to the fun stuff:<br>
<br>
Interviewer:<br>
You said earlier that Dostum thought you had a death ray. What can you tell me about that? <br>
<br>
Mark, Capt. <br>
Due to the altitude that the aircraft was flying with the laser-guided munitions, when it dropped its ordinance the bomb was falling for a minute and half to two minutes. If you timed it just right, as the laser target designator is engaging and [targeting the] enemy position, you let your Northern Alliance commander take a look through the laser target designator. He sees it going, but he doesn't see the bombs fly into the target. He hears that chirping noise from the laser target designator and then the enemy position explodes. They believe that we have the death ray, and this was a myth that we were willing to perpetuate. Every one of us on our rifles carried a smaller laser. We let the Northern Alliance guys look through our night vision goggles. ... I think Will has summed it up best. This whole situation is like the Flintstones meet the Jetsons. And those guys could not fathom that we have some sort of aiming device that would allow us to hit a target at night on the first round. <br>
<br>
Will, Sgt. <br>
I think something that's key in all this is that both Northern Alliance and enemy communications were, for the most part, CB radios. They would be arguing with each other in the heat of battle. The Taliban would be saying, &quot;nanny, nanny, boo, boo&quot; and the Northern Alliance would be saying, &quot;hey, we're coming to get you.&quot; They would also tell the Taliban about this death ray. At Kunduz, we were negotiating back and forth to try to get these guys to surrender. They were saying, &quot;We'll surrender, we'll march into your camp, but we want to keep our guns.&quot; Dostum finally said, &quot;Put your guns down, take your jackets off, march in here or we're turning the Americans onto you with the death ray.&quot; Instantly you could see the guys bend over. They put their guns down, they took their cloaks off and they started marching in, in single file right up into the middle of our perimeter, because they knew that it was over if that death ray was coming out. <br>
<br>
Mark, Capt. <br>
This was also perpetuated by the presence of the AC 130 Spectra gunship. They had a female fire support officer that was on the radio. Dostum heard her voice and he brought Mohammed Fazal, who's the former Taliban chief of staff. He's trying to delay this surrender in Kunduz while his forces are attempting to recapture Mazar-e-Sharif. Dostum brings Fazal near the radio so that he can hear this female voice. Fazal hears her voice as it's being explained to him, through the translators, that we have the angel of death overhead, from the AC 130 gunship. Dostum explains to him that we have the angel of death overhead and that we possess the death ray. If they don't surrender now all of their troops will burn in hell. Fazal jumped on the radio and his men were surrendering within minutes. <br>

<br>
Note though, in the report the soldiers said that no special forces soldier &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ever witnessed any atrocities committed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;.  Doran's film, in interviewing the people associated with the massacre shows that US Special forces handed over most of these prisoners over to Northern Alliance control knowing full well what would happen to them.  Did the SS generals sitting behind desks have to witness the concentration camp Stalags in order to be guilty of war-crimes?  Of course not.  Handing someone over to be executed is to be complicit in the act of execution, that is a fundamental principle in law.<br>
<br>
The way that the Captain worded his statement carefully reminds me of Reichensturmfuhrer Hermann Reugen when he said at the Nuremberg trials:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> &quot;I never saw any such camps, nor did I hear my colleagues in the Schultzstaffel speak of them except in passing.  I assumed they were normal prison camps.  You ask me if I could have prevented some of the deaths if I tried to find out about what happened at the camps.  Well perhaps I could if I had aggressively pursued it.  But the fate of undesirables was a political decision not a military one.  Making a nuisance in this way was no way for a soldier to behave, particularly not a soldier who wants to remain in his government's good graces&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
It's clear to me that the fate of Taliban soldiers captured was pre-determined by political figures in the Bush administration, Camp X-Ray and the beating to death of two prisoners at Bagram air-base (linked in the PoW thread) demonstrates that clearly enough.  Individual soldiers distancing themselves from what happened isn't good enough- it's understandable, but unacceptable.  Looking the other way was never a defence against war-crimes- but this and other incidents in Afghanistan certainly must have contributed to the firmness of the Bush administration's stance about refusing to ratify the international criminal court (ICC).<br>
<br>
The Newsweek reporter following up on Doran's film had some interesting things to say.  Here it is, from the link lurker provided:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Barry tells FRONTLINE that it is unclear whether the Special Forces soldiers knew about this incident. However he says, &quot;It is clear from the beginning of this year the Defense Department and officials elsewhere in the administration knew, first of all, that there were allegations of mass slaughter of the prisoners from Kunduz; and secondly that there was a mass grave outside the prison.&quot; He remarked, &quot;I'm reminded of the old proverb, there is none so blind as them who will not see.&quot;<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
No matter, the question stands- why would any of these nations risk their future trade with the US over the tiny portion of their trade with Iraq?  You may not like the answer to that question Kad, you may want them to have opposed it for purely economic interests.  But then again, I want a lot of things to be true too, like an America that cares about its role, how it's perceived and how that role &amp; perception affects world affairs.  Wishful thinking eh?

&quot;Patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels.&quot; <br>
--Samuel Johnson <br>
<br>
&quot;Patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons.&quot; <br>
--Bertrand Russell <br>
<br>
&quot;Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all other countries because you were born in it&quot; <br>
--George Bernard Shaw <br>
<br>
&quot;You're not to be so blind with patriotism that you can't face reality. Wrong is wrong, no matter who does it or says it.&quot;<br>
Malcolm X (1925 - 1965)<br>
<br>
&quot;My country, right or wrong,&quot; is a thing that no patriot would think of saying except in a desperate case. It is like saying, &quot;My mother, drunk or sober.&quot;<br>
G. K. Chesterton (1874 - 1936)<br>
<br>
As regards going to Manchester, they have 3 footie teams, only one of them's any good.  Doesn't matter though, because the Arsenal are going to repeat the double, and the Mancs are going out of the Champion's league.  Oh, and they drink bitter in Manchester, stout in Liverpool.  Although I'll admit Boddington's is frothy for a bitter~<br>

Each man must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong, which course is patriotic and which isn't. You cannot shirk this and be a man.

Brief sporting aside- England clinched their first Grand slam in the 6-nations since 1995 in style by a full-scale demolition of Ireland at Lansdowne road of all places.  Taking Ireland to the cleaners in their own back yard is never easy- especially not with world-class runners like O'Driscoll &amp; Geordan Murphy.  Ireland were a joy to watch at times, forcing players off for blood treatment with bruising tackles, but 1-15 England were unstoppable.  For anyone with no idea what I'm talking about...it's rugby foo's!  <br>

Bayern Munich are the premier Bundesliga(German) club, Benfica are one of the leading sides in the Portugese league.  Man Utd are widely...well I wouldn't say hated, but quietly despised <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Mainly because most people in and outside the UK who know very little about football pick them as a team to support because of their marketing value overseas.  It should also be noted that 89% of Manchester's population supports Man City the local Premiership team, not Utd.  <br>
<br>
Not that it bothers me of course, because my local team Arsenal are currently league and cup double champions, and we're on course to repeat both successes.  If we do, it'd be historic, never before would a team have defended the double in the 115 year history of the English FA.  The key to preserving our 2-point lead over Man Utd is our home fixture against them on the 16th.  Highbury will be packed to the rafters, myself and friends have secured tickets to the decisive game of the season which I believe we'll win.  I advise any footie lover with the means to watch this game to do so.  Gwan you Gunners!<br>

i haven't really read all of your posts taranna...they are to long and there are to many links...but the impression i get is that you feel your political views are the correct views, because everytime someone challenges your opinions, you take about 2 hours to look up tons of different links to show why you are correct and they are wrong.<br>
<br>
i'm not big into politics like you, nor do i have the desire to spend hours looking for links that disagree with yours, but for every link and opinion you throw at everyone on this board, THERE ARE links/opinions that will challenge the correctness and creditibilty of yours. <br>
<br>
suggestion: if you are big into debates, go find a board...or some classes or something where that is the sole topic, and all of ya can spend hours discussing it. im sure there are many of ya out there, but posting here tara is selling yourself short!!<br>

and im sure he'd be more then happy to make a board dedicated to heavy political debates.<br>
<br>
with that i'd like to say im thankful for being able to live where i want, wear what i want, screw who i want, marry who i want, become who i want, etc etc...and if the day came when i fought a war on my land, i wouldnt need to sit by the tv set wondering..what my leader would want me to do, nor would i need to be fearful of my own people, my own neigbors! nor would my leader or my husband tell me my children must go stand in the frontline to protect the troops! i pity anyone that lives a life like that, because without freedom and the ability to think for yourself, act for yourself, i just don't see the purpose in living, other then the hope that someday i could gain these freedoms.<br>

With respect, the longest of my posts are a few hundred words.  The average newspaper article is longer- if peoples' patience doesn't stretch to a newspaper article, then I wonder how they can even hope to hold a constructed political view.  As always, if people don't care or don't want to read something, they're free to do that.  But to be critical without bothering to read it?  I find that hard to comprehend.<br>
<br>
I don't take &quot;2 hours&quot; to write my posts, most of them take no more than 5 minutes, the links are all mainstream British newspapers and are easy to find.  There might well be links and opinions that challenge my opinions- but one thing that is being overlooked is this.  At one extreme of the spectrum you have Fox News, Rush Limbaugh et al.  At the other extreme end of the spectrum you have Al-Jazeera, Al-Fahds, the Socialist Worker, Der Spiegel, Le Figaro, etc.  <br>
<br>
British opinion and mainstream public opinion in Europe lies right in the middle of those two extremes, and that was the reasoning behind my choice of mainstream UK papers- since extremist views help no one.  I might well be &quot;selling myself short&quot; by posting here- but I don't agree that this isn't the best place for a discussion.  People discuss such issues on the train, in a pub, anywhere really.  And why not?  These are issues that affect us all- there is no &quot;inappropriate place&quot; in my opinion.  If you think differently, that's your right- and no one's forcing you to read anything, or listen to two people discussing it in a pub or cafe.  If I overheard two people discussing boy bands in a library, I may think it's the &quot;inappropriate&quot; place, but I wouldn't go up to them and tell them to their face it was inappropriate.  After all, why should they censor their behaviour because of what I think?<br>
<br>
 Yes, living your life in a free and open society is the greatest gift.  Democracy however, is an act of empowerment, you can't export it like cigarettes, nor impose it with armoured battalions.  I have Iraqi friends and colleagues at work Justi- they may have fled an oppressive regime, but they have no love for foreign armies occupying their soil.  They look at other Arab dictatorships in the region with US troops on their soil, they look at the plight of the Palestinians...and that is the source of their mistrust.  Having terrified relatives on the phone from Baghdad to Basra doesn't help, nor are reports that their nephews and nieces haven't eaten in 10 days of conflict.  <br>
<br>
One of my clinical staff has resigned from his post to go back to Iraq in order to attend the funeral of his sister, shot at a checkpoint yesterday.  He may have fled his country because of the regime there, but I can't imagine he'll be feeling any joy at being &quot;liberated&quot;.  Call these sob stories if you will, diminish them in the bigger picture if you will.  I won't- even if Salem wasn't someone I'd worked with for 5 years, shared a pint and a laugh with, I'd still have the human decency not to turn his loss into a statistic. <p>Taranna Dhossarim<br>
