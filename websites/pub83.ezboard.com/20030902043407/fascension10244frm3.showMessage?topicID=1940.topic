I saw those pictures of POWs on the news and I felt for them.  I know we have soldiers in my guild. I know that one of them at least left for the gulf a few months ago. I don't want any harm to come to him. I think that one thing that everyone can agree upon is that they hope (or pray if they are religious) that those soldiers paraded on TV are ok. And i would suspect that pro and anti war people would also agree that those pictures are too much, too far, by the Iraqis.<br>
<br>
Where I suspect I will disagree with some of you is the hypocrisy and double standards surrounding the use of footage of POWs.<br>
These soldiers are professionals, and they are patriots. Their country has called upon them to do a job, and they are risking their lives to do it. Some may or may not agree with the policy aims of their leaders, but they are putting themselves in danger to carry out those aims. They run the risk of death in combat. But, there are some things they should not be exposed to. Primarily, they must be accorded the minimum accepted respect under the laws of war, under specifically the Geneva Conventions.<br>
Whilst i have been writing this paragraph, no doubt you will be agreeing and thinking of US/Uk servicemen. But it applies equally to Iraqis too.<br>
This is were the double standards come in. And i will list two specific examples.<br>
The day before the US POWs were put on public display, i was watching BBC news. I saw footage, with my own eyes of iraqi POWs. Close ups of their hands bound with those plastic handcuffs. A long line up of barefooted men. The caption on the footage said &quot;Ministry of Defence video&quot;. I thought to myself, this is a bit much.  I don't get to see much US TV, but i have read reports of iraqi POWs being &quot;interviewed&quot; on US TV. Perhaps you can fill in the details of this for me.<br>
The hypocrisy is apparent here. When Iraqi POWs are paraded on tv, no comment is passed. When US ones are paraded, it is a war crime. Why? What is the difference? They are all soldiers doing a tough job, both risking their lives for what they believe.  Does the US soldier have more rights than his iraqi counterpart? Do war crimes not count if either (a) it is your own side committing them, or (b) if you are the winner?<br>
<br>
Specific example 2 of hypocrisy. Taliban POWs in Camp X ray. Humiliation and degradation. Religious men shorn of their beards. A complete disregard for the Geneva Conventions. The argument, that geneva doesn't apply to these people.  We all saw the pictures of public humiliation of those particular prisoners. It seems gross hypocrisy to deride Iraq for breaching the laws of war when the US continues to breach those same rules of war in Guantanomo Bay. I note iraq using the same false arguments as the us in cuba &quot;these aren't pows. they are illegal combatants, however, we will give them geneva convention rights anyway&quot;<br>
<br>
Side note to varmarrz. Sorry, i got the name wrong, i don't have your name up here. you said, in connection with camp x ray <br>
&quot; I'm sure if they were innocent of any wrong doing they wouldn't be detained.&quot;  <br>
Your faith in your armed forces and military intelligence is admirable to the extent of being blind. Quite apart from the fact that this completely reverses the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence (two great aspects of the american legal system) and that is illogical, it is quite simply wrong. I remember watching a report about 3 months ago about a Pakistani who was released after a year from camp x ray when the authorities finally decided that he was innocent and had done nothing wrong. Your philosophy turns the fact of arrest into the proof of crime.<br>
<br>
Final point, if only there was some way to independently verify this things. Some judicial process separate from the two warring sides who can only be expected to support their own.<br>
But wait, there is, it is the international criminal court.<br>
It entered into force on the 1st of July 2002 and has 139 signatories and 89 parties. (meaning that 139 states signed up to it, but only 89 so far have ratified the treaty in their domestic law).<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://untreaty.un.org/ENGLISH/bible/englishinternetbible/partI/chapterXVIII/treaty10.asp#N6">untreaty.un.org/ENGLISH/b...y10.asp#N6</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
is where you can read up on the treaty.<br>
<br>
The Uk has ratified it, as has france and israel. russia has signed but not rafied. iraq has neither signed nor ratified. the US did sign up to it, but subsequently sent the following note:<br>
<br>
In a communication received on 6 May 2002, the Government of the United States of America informed the Secretary-General of the following:<br>
<br>
&quot;This is to inform you, in connection with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court adopted on July 17, 1998, that the United States does not intend to become a party to the treaty. Accordingly, the United States has no legal obligations arising from its signature on December 31, 2000. The United States requests that its intention not to become a party, as expressed in this letter, be reflected in the depositary's status lists relating to this treaty.&quot;<br>
<br>
Cries to international law would have alot more force if the US engaged with the rest of the world, or even obeyed it themselves.<br>
<br>
Of course, the ones doing the suffering on the ground are the ordinary soldiers, iraqi and american. the fact that their leaders choose to play fast and loose with truth and international law should not be an excuse to maltreat any pow be they american or iraqi.<br>

They were near starvation and significantly undernourished....guess who brought them food and provisions....the US/UK troops who captured them. <br>
<br>
I really dont give a damn what you think but when you try and portray a one sided story I will say something. If you are going to make an &quot;attempt&quot; at the truth try and give the whole picture not just your bleeding heart for the Iraqi PoWs you saw paraded barefoot and shaven. Personally I think we shouldnt take any PoW after the shit they pulled the other day with the white flag.....oh wait lemme guess you forgot about that one? <br>

Edit: Xorthar corrected me. Regardless I still wouldnt mind seeing a couple hundred public executions of Taliban members and good ol Osama bringing up the rear as the last one wasted. Anyone who harbors someone a sick and twisted as that guy deserves a sidewinder missle shot thru their front door.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jimmayjam>Jimmay Jam</A> at: 3/25/03 10:19:45 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=relgbladestormrz>RelgBladestorm RZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#333333>(3/25/03 7:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1940.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: er ?</span><hr size=1> Need to keep news crews and reporters out of Wars, it causes protests, and I hate Hippies!<br>

Do you all remember back when Time magazine published a photo of an American GI's body being drug thru a village in Somolia a few years back?  I believe it was also showed on a few networks.  As a member of the U.S. military that pissed me off to the T.   There's a difference between showing a PoW on TV and showing one of my dead comrades on TV for some kinda propaganda bullshit.  We have to remember that the Iraq and Coalition forces are performing a duty for their respective countries.  Although our countries are at odds with one another that gives nobody a right...to totally disrespect someone that has devoted their life to serving their country...honorably.  That was taken from them.   What Iraq TV and various newsfeeds around the world have done...just totally leaves me at a lost for words and pisses me the fuck off.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=428385"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.celestialbloodline.com/rev/laneyavatar.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Here's a great article written today by the political writer,  Visiting Fellow at Green College Oxford, and Guardian correspondent George Monbiot.  It describes the legal and political implications of actions taken by both countries as regards prisoners of war.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,921411,00.html">www.guardian.co.uk/Column...11,00.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
It's worth noting that US governments in general have a poor overall record in terms of preserving the civil rights of detainees and PoWs.  In fact, one of the less famous findings of the Nuremberg proceedings was that Nazi commanders, particularly the Luftwaffe adhered far more closely to the rules of war regarding captured soldiers than their US, or even British counterparts.  The US was then condemned for its shabby treatment of civilian authorities arrested without charge after the occupation of Berlin and its aggressive interrment without charge of Japanese Americans.  Naturally the proceedings were overshadowed by far more pressing and brutal crimes of war- but let us not forget about them.<br>
<br>
Camp X-Ray simply signals to me, a continuation of American administrations sacrificing civil rights for a false sense of security.  The stateless limbo of &quot;unlawful combatants&quot; in Cuba (lacking all constitutional protection) created by the current US administration is not just in technical breach of the Geneva Convention- it is also under the ICC's provisions...a war crime.  <br>
<br>
Unsuprising then perhaps, as Monbiot says, that the Bush administration is entirely unwilling to place the instruments of this barbaric dehumanizing policy at risk of international prosecution.  Holding so many people without recourse to legal advice, without <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>any</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> basic right to be charged or held to account by judicial review is not the act of a democracy.  It is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>very thing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> we denounce dictators for- the circumvention of judicial process to serve a political end- and it's happening in what purports to be the freest of all nations, at least in principle.  <br>
<br>
The Bush administration talks of defending freedom- try telling that to the thousands of prisoners held without charge or trial- what freedoms do they enjoy?  Many of them are aid workers, teachers and local professionals- how is holding them without evidence or trial in any way defending freedom?  <br>
<br>
It's up to every one of us to ask these questions- if we fail to confront basic acts of evil at home, how can we have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>any</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> credibility in confronting them overseas?  As many point out, we have the right to speak up against brutal and barbaric acts in a democracy.  But how are we any more empowered than the oppressed people of Iraq if we censor ourselves into silence, fearful that standing up for the freedom of the oppressed is unpatriotic just because they &quot;might be terrorists&quot;?  Everything I know about America and Americans before 9/11 tells me that they are a fair people, (often duped by cynical and callous politicans with the aid of a pliable media)- but basically a fair and humane people.  The question many abroad ask is this- how can you let your government get away with this basic betrayal of the fundamental principles that makes America great?<br>
<br>
9/11 was a tragedy, a terrible and brutal reminder of what we all face.  Americans have a choice- to trust a government, many of whom helped train terrorist elements that now threaten us all- to trust such people to do the right thing.  I have submitted before all of you in more than one thread that the majority of the current administration cares only about their short-term political survival, not for a lasting resolution.  Their short-sighted policies in the very recent past contain far more solid links to terrorism than Saddam Hussein ever did- terorrism that not only killed 3,000 innocents in New York, but still threatens the world.  <br>
<br>
  But the other, more sensible choice is to aggressively question the wisdom of policies that create terrorists- to mediate disputes, not take sides and trigger conflict.  History points the way, yet these men in power will not follow- violent problems can almost never ultimately have violent solutions in a modern and complex world.  Israel/Palestine, India/Pakistan, North/South Korea- all the world's existing flashpoints are sad continuous tales of violence begetting violence, suspicion and mistrust replacing the facts.  Cyprus, Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka- these are our models, where violence has been met not with more violence- but by a willingness to compromise for peace.  I fear very much that a large percentage of the American public is willing to give the men who armed bin Laden a blank cheque to flex their muscle as they choose- and that is the fear of many around the world.  But we can only fear and hope- it is up to the American people to make the right choice for them, and for the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>lasting</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> peace and stability of the international order- it's up to you.<br>

 I'm not totally sure on this but I think that the Taliban people that are being held at camp X-Ray are most likely being milked for all the intellegence they are worth.  Not sure on this also but didn't the UN pass something that says 'The people that harbor terrorists, will be viewed as terrorists themselves.'?  I don't think it's cool that they have been held for so long without trial to prove/disprove their innocence.

The cold war is a major cause for allot of what is going on in that region at this time.  The Russians invading Afghanistan, the US supplying them and then ultimately leaving them out to dry.  That practice(leaving people out to dry) is the same reason that allot of the Iraqi people don't trust coalition forces that are trying to 'liberate' them now.  <br>

Brilliant point- the fear now is that they will continue to be mistrustful of those coalition forces or lose collective confidence in the force's ability to keep them safe.  That is precisely why a UN mandate was so crucial- as long as the international community was seen to support it, in particular if Syria could have been persuaded to vote for the resolution or abstain- there would be far more chance of them taking us at our word when we say &quot;liberation not occupation&quot;.  The fact that the international community laughed the idea of hasty pre-emptive war out of the Security Council means that Iraqis will be a hundred times more suspicious of the motives of this conflict.<br>

<br>
Not strictly speaking true- the issue isn't a religious one, but a sectarian one.  On the point of language/culture- Gaelige and English couldn't be more different tongues, and there are differences between cultural influences on political thought.  The gun had a powerful place in Irish politics for almost a century for example, some would argue that it still does for several paramilitary organizations.  And there aren't just two sides to the dispute, it's a multifaceted problem.  <br>
<br>
Unionists, Nationalists and Republicans are the broad divisions, but a myriad of political parties and interest groups are peppered with different views, political solutions and institutional reform.  Only recently, when the British government was prepared to compromise its long-standing principle of &quot;devolving power to terrorists&quot;- was a resolution on the table.  Fraught with difficulties I grant you- but far more acceptable than civilian loss of life and steady losses to the RUC and British security forces, bleeding them at a steady but no less attritional rate.  The Stormont Assembly is not a perfect organ of devolved government, but it is far more palatable than British soldiers returning in body bags year upon year and fringe groups like the RIRA/ULPG perpetrating terrorist acts on the British and Irish mainlands.  The Omagh bomb was a stark wake-up call to the realities and choices staring us in the face.  History will not say that we blinked first- rather that we took the brave political step of laying a stiff and belligerent government doctrine on the altar of peace.  <br>
<br>
The Israel-Palestine problem on paper is a lot easier to resolve.  Far from having to assemble a myriad of political parties and interest groups into a devolved government, you are dealing with two sides, a far more classical diplomatic dispute.  One of these sides is an elected representative government- so dealing with them is simple in practical terms <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>assuming they wish to sue for peace</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  The same obviously applies on the Palestinian side.  At present, neither side seems interested in compromising entrenched political views in favour of peace.  Sharon for selfish political reasons is happy to exploit violence to cement his position.  The Palestinian Authority has made some reforms- the formation of the Prime Minister's cabinet will tell us if these are a genuine drive for change, or merely a token effort.  <br>
<br>
I strongly suspect that latter- hardline elements will be foricbly bullied out of the future cabinet of Palestine- creating resentment and popular opposition.  We need all concerns represented fairly and democratically- until that happens there is no reason the many on the Israeli side feel they need to deal with the PA.  And on the other side of the coin- many in the PA see it futile to negotiate with Israel whilst under occupation- they are demanding a neutral platform.  It is hard to sound credible as a Palestinian negotiater if the future national infrastructure you're banking on to help form a nation-state is daily ripped to shreds by the Israeli army.  On the other hand, Palestinian terrorism only serves to strengthen the Israeli negotiating position- Sharon knows this and is so unwilling to make the sacrifices needed for peace.  <br>
<br>
Yes there are difficulties- I suspect Sharon and Arafat will both have to go before serious negotiation has any chance of success.  And let's not kid ourselves- such negotiation is crucial to the peace of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>entire region</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Look at the text of Saddam's speeches- his closing words are always &quot;Long live Iraq, long live Palestine&quot;.  The political exploitation allows Saddam and other dictators in the region (mostly US/UK allies or surrogates) to cement their position in power.  Without the rancid double-standards- offering half a billion dollars of aid to starving Iraqis while giving 1 billion to Israel (plus 9 billion in loan write-offs) is just one example of this.<br>
<br>
Without a fair and even hand in the region we can never hope to achieve peace.  If that fair and even hand is used (and every indication is that the Bush administration isn't interested in dealing even-handedly)- if it is used, then there is genuine hope for leadershp change on both sides and a realistic path to peace.  The final solution is universally agreed upon in principle- Resolution 230 will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>finally</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be implemented, creating a viable Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders.  Israel will be recognized fully by this state, border work will be shared and indeed citizenship will be shared until organs of government are constructed.  <br>
<br>
Our government will play a major role in that construction- but we too cannot be taken seriously until we cease our unconditional support for brutal suppressions of human rights undertaken by a democracy.  Camp X-Ray brought it home to all of us that democracies under threat can be just as savage and uncaring as the vilest regimes on the planet.  The fact that Israel is a democracy does not excuse its forces from the gross human rights abuses it perpetrates.  Indeed it is even more important that democratic forces are held accountable.<br>
<br>
That is a reasonably detailed preamble to any peace deal- and for all our sakes- I hope it would deal a lethal blow to the spectres of both the brutal state repression of Israel, and more importantly to terrorism which threatens us all.  These are difficult and unstable times weighing upon us, we have set aside this crucial goal in favour of creating additional instability elsewhere.  If we truly want peace in the region and on our doorstep- this would be firmly at the top of the priority list.  <br>
<br>
Sadly the Bush administration isn't big on vision beyond their immediate objectives- and that has the potential to harm us all.  As long as terrorists leaders can link their struggle with the Palestinian freedom struggle- their recruitment targets will certainly always be met.  We need to engage with the mind of a would-be terrorist- resolution of this conflict would settle a lot of grievances for a lot of people.  If that chance presents itself to us- we and the parties concerned have a sacred duty to grab it with both hands. <p>Taranna Dhossarim<br>

I totally agree with what you said about the Palestinian/Israeli situation.  I find it totally astounding that the UN as a peace keeping body could ignore the importance of that situation.  I mean even if Iraq is made into a democratic nation it all seems for nothing until an agreement can be made to slow and eventually stop tensions over such a small(but historically important) piece of territory(Gaza ect).  <br>
<br>
Israel is not helping it's case though with it's aggressive settler policy.  You can't just stumble onto a piece of land these days and call it your own.  Do you think that the new Palestinian PM is basically a paper position? To try and sway popular opinion with it's people and the world community as a whole?  To me it seems as if they want to do the right thing(I bet that Arafat being almost snuffed out had something to do with it) but as long as Arafat is in power the terroristic policy he has privately supported may not stop as long as he is in power.  Not that I think that he should be removed from power.  Let's face it he is a popular leader of the Palestinian people.  Although I think that Palestine has extended a longer olive branch recently that it has since I can remember.  It's really sad that the UN can call for peace between the two people, but it will sit back and watch these people tear each other apart.  The situation is not going to fix itself and I think that the US/UK should not 'feel sorry' for the Israeli government because of past events.  Like I've said in previous posts noone can shape the past, but hope that they can learn from past mistakes to help shape the future(Not exactly that, but I'm drunk p).  I know that Israel privately supports this coalition.  But isn't it about time they let old resentments rest and try and make the future into a safer and more trustful tomorrow?<br>

<br>
On the contrary- prisoners and suspects have actually been beaten to death by US soldiers.  Details here of two men bludgeoned to death at Bagram airbase:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,909294,00.html">www.guardian.co.uk/afghan...94,00.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Before anyone leaps to the defence of these soldiers, bear in mind that they are professionals, and trained to be honourable citizens as well as fighters.  Making war on prisoners or wounded men has never been excused by any decent or honourable military- it's a sad sign of the changing times for me that high-ranking US officials are for the first time- shrugging their shoulders rather than clamping down on war-crimes.<br>
<br>
A more personal view of this attitude from the point of view of an innocent British citizen (a teacher) abducted from Pakistan and interrogated at Bagram airbase in Afghanistan, hundreds of miles away:<br>
<br>
People in the UK weren't happy with Camp X-Ray, and neither were a good many government officials:<br>

And you can see why:  <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,865454,00.html">www.guardian.co.uk/afghan...54,00.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
After reading those articles, it's easy to see why uniformed US servicemen risk being humiliated on Iraqi television.  Brutal recent actions by the US administration have made it all the more acceptable for the Iraqis to reciprocate.<br>
<br>
On a personal note, I find all of this abhorrent and disgusting.  US media sources showing pictures of Iraqi soldiers KIA, the Iraqis doing the same to US <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> UK forces- imagine what the bereaved families are feeling watching their sons' mutilated bodies on television- on both sides.  <br>
<br>
There was particular anger from British troops today after dead British soldiers were shown on Iraqi state television.  One of my friends, an officer in the Royal Marines, 42 Commando was nearly in tears as he angrily told me on the phone:  &quot;If the Americans hadn't set up that Camp X-ray, if they hadn't beaten people to death at Bagram, then maybe I wouldn't have to see Barry's body being spit on by Iraqi soldiers&quot;.  Maybe it would have happened anyway, but my friend had a reason for the tears- Lance Corporal Barry Stephen of the Black Watch was his 6-month year old son's godfather- his body was shown on Iraqi TV being dragged through the streets and spit on by Iraqi soldiers.  Nothing will ever excuse that in my mind, but giving any excuse for other countries to treat our soldiers in this way- we shouldn't be suprised when it happens.  I'm seething with fury, but how can I take the moral high-ground in this when I've seen our closest ally treat PoWs just as shabbily?  My entire moral basis of argument has been destroyed by a heavy-handed and paranoid attitude towards largely innocent men.<br>
<br>
The families of these soldiers have anguish enough without seeing these pictures- families of the innocent imprisoned at Camp X-ray deserve far better than what they have been forced to endure.  We only serve to create a haven of future suffering for ourselves in other conflicts if we act as barborously as the regime we're now trying to remove.  We will do nothing by imprisoning innocent men except alienate the Arab and Muslim communities <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>whose help we need to fight terrorism</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Humiliating these prisoners at Camp X-Ray no doubt plays well on American TV and with the US public- I wonder how many of them realize how many terrorists it's likely to create, how many alienated communites will shelter terrorists as a result.<br>
