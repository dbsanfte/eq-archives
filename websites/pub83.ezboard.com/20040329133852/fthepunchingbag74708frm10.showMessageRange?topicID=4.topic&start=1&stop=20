I put &quot;Yes with some reservations.&quot;  I was disgusted with the CS policies that Verant used when I played EQ, which I got to see as a player, a webmaster and a Guide.  I've noticed so far the the 'Com has dealt with problems in a way I would never have expected Verant to deal with.<br>
<br>
Then again, the 'Com is guilty of releasing a pretty buggy game and one thing that disturbs me is the tendency to nerf (which is going to happen, and sometimes should) but do so BEFORE other issues are dealt with.  Personally I'd rather see a focus on game-stability issues and exploits before minor class tweaks and balance issues (unless a class is bugged, like the MA's).<br>
<br>
A good example of this is the surgery nerf in 12.52.  Previously you could click multiple times on this to boost your treatment skill +100 each time, allowing a player to put in implants that were vastly higher than what they arguably should be allowed to obtain.  The concept fix for this is that a doctor or class with a higher treatment skill would be able to use an item to transfer some treatment skill points to the target ... however this feature is busted still, and the surgery machine nerf went in anyways.<br>
<br>
Verant did this to us constantly as monks and with other classes as well -- nerf, THEN support, rather than the other way around.  I've always thought it was an utterly piss-poor way of dealing with balance issues and does nothing but alienate the playerbase.<br>
<br>
All in all, though, I think Funcom is on the right track, and assuming they stay the course they are on (and brush up a tad on oeffectively communicating with us) I think (and hope) good things will come, because AO really is a great game.<br>
<br>

<br>
In EQ, when you typed /petition at minimum you got an answer most of the time.  You might not like the answer you got, but you'd get an answer.  If you asked the &quot;guide&quot;:  &quot;Please escalate this to a paid Verrant GM &amp; have them contact me directly&quot;, they did most of the time.  <br>
<br>
In AO, your petition will only be answered if you are persistant and re-petition every 30 minutes.  Then, only if you are lucky.  In AO, if you ask for esacalation, you'll be told (like I was) &quot;they'll just tell you the same thing I am&quot;.  <br>
<br>
In EQ, *if* you lost money/items to a bug or zone crash, you had a chance of getting re-imbursed.  It was a small chance, but a chance none the less.<br>
<br>
In AO, if you lose money/items to a bug or zone crash, you are out of luck.<br>
<br>
Verrant pre-announced *most* patch days, Funcom pre-announces very few.<br>
<br>
I enjoy the game play in AO, but frankly, their version of customer service is pathetic.  I played EQ from beta 2 thru the release of AO.  By the time AO came out, I was pretty bored with EQ.  Like 99% of Norrath, I avoided Verrant GM's like the plague also.<br>

But in the real world, no one gives a fuck about how hard you work. All they care about is, end of the day, what you got done. And for that, C-.<br>
<br>
It's been two months now. Why are we still getting zone crashes? Why is there still that heinous memory leak? Why are the servers so goddamned unstable (and they're runnin on LINUX for chrissakes so you can't blame the OS)? Yeah, I know, I know, makin a game is hard and whatnot, and they're trying stuff No One Has Tried Before and blah blah bliddity blah. It's one thing to be ambitious; it's another to not fix shit after two months.<br>
<br>
It's another to blow PR sunshine up my ass every day and tell me everything's milk and honey when I can't yet zone with confidence. I wonder how long it'll be before I don't look at a zone line with fear and loathing.<br>
<br>
So... yeah, they do listen, and yeah, they do seem to respond to issues well, but no, their execution of same is not even nearly up to par, and no, their PR speak doesn't alleviate the pain. <br>
<br>
And remember, it's only been two months. They haven't had the time to become as jaded and bitter as Verant. At the start, Verant wasn't as bad as they are now.

About the petition thing. I think alot of the problem is people petitioning stupid stuff. I can imagine the logs full of hundreds of /petition so and so killed me while I lagged can I get my xp back, type stuff so the important stuff of getting caught outside a zone, or in a building or having a debuff last an hour gets lost. <p><font color="#D713EC" face="Trebuchet MS">Yuzhan Vong, Disciple of the Lost Circle<br>

I suppose it depends on your definition of what &quot;a better game administration company&quot; is.<br>
<br>
Certainly I disagree with many of the policies and decisions made by VI.  In that respect, my own views of what a MMORPG should be seem much closer to those of Funcom:  reduced downtime, making all classes viable, doing away with camping, and so on.  Don't waste my time.  And it seems as if Funcom does care about those issues (and many others).  For those things that aren't working quite right (technical, balance, gameplay and otherwise), I have been led to believe that Funcom will address these and the outcome will be something I agree with.  So far, so good.  I should vote for Funcom, you would think.<br>
<br>
But then there is the reality of the game.  On the technical side, there are complaints from those who even now cannot start the game (though that works for me) or for whom the game is too slow (my 1 GHz CPU, 1 gigabyte of RAM and GF3 video card seem barely adequate).  There are problems with a &quot;memory leak&quot;, lag, zoning.  I have lost items, credits and experience due to bugs.  There are many balance issues (my MA is fine this week, ask me again next week).  There have been and continue to be exploits, and though we are told that exploiters are being handled, the behavior I see in game indicates they are being ignored.  There are griefers running around but they too are ignored despite being reported.  My attempts to contact customer service have been fruitless; I've had more luck in forums such as this one.<br>
<br>
I don't know if Funcom is even aware of the problems in their game.  There are so many of them that only the biggest problems receive official attention in the public forums.  Given the slow pace at which things get fixed, I get the feeling today's little problems will still be there a year from now.  There is no sign that Funcom even attempted to playtest some parts of the game (such as gameplay and balance at level 100+).  Things that get fixed in one patch might be broken with the next patch.  There are serious communications issues (such as the &quot;magic patch&quot; expected the day billing started and the massive exploit that was reported but went live with the 12.5 patch).<br>
<br>
I give Funcom an &quot;A&quot; for PR, &quot;D&quot; for what I actually see.  With VI, at least I knew what I was getting into.  With AO, things might work if I wait long enough.  I disagreed with VI, but at least they had my respect as a &quot;game administration company&quot;.  I think I agree with Funcom (or at least with Funcom's PR), but I no longer respect them.<br>
<br>
For me, it's no longer a question of whether AO is worth paying $10 a month for (I prepaid for 6 months).  The new question is whether AO is worth playing at all (even if it were free).  Part of this is based on how I see Funcom as the game administrator (see above), and another part deals with those things I see as failures in AO's design (which deals more with Funcom as the game developer and would be another long rant).<br>
<br>
FYI, I played EQ for about a year and a half, and quit (twice - came back when Velious was released).  Among my reasons for quitting was a loathing of VI's &quot;vision&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uteffama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TeffaMA</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#660000>(8/27/01 1:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sensei's 08.27.01 Poll.</span><hr size=1> Sensei, target someone in the shop and click the clinic , it will raise your skill <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucreode.showPublicProfile?language=EN>creode</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#660000>(8/27/01 1:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sensei's 08.27.01 Poll.</span><hr size=1> **Yes, with some reservations about the future**<br>

<br>
Eq did have customer service but the outcomes were usually a total joke. I can remember /petition to only have a gm tell me too bad. Escalation to a higher Gm was an utter pain in the ass and seemed to never happen. <br>
<br>
Just watching them through 50 levels made Gm's a total joke in my eyes. <br>
1. Seeing how &quot;uberguilds&quot; were actually able to bias gm's.<br>
2. Watching personal favors done by gm's. <br>
3. Knowing a gm irl who flat out stated that during gm events he had a ball because he could finally take out all the stress he had from all the players bitching by killing them. <br>
<br>
Hands down Verant had stability and had a much more playable game. <br>
<br>
That just isnt enough. <br>
<br>
I have seen drastic improvements in ao and honestly feel that the game is going to pick up quick. If they keep on their trend I think that things will be a hell of alot better.  I feel that the things they are trying to accomplish are unique in many ways and deserve the slack. <br>
<br>
Also on a side note if I could ever meet Abasor in an ally with a large red nerf bat (at least one with the sturdy plastic core) i could finally scratch it off my: &quot;To do in life accomplishments&quot;.<br>

So did AC and UO.  I think that they have done a great job of getting it working.  I know it's not bugless and that it still has its problems but remember what it was when it first went live.<br>
<br>
They also seem to listen more and are more open to suggestions.  Instead of forcing the game style down your throat (vision) they seem to be more flexible and willing to change things to make it work better as well as reverse changes they have made (concealment).<br>
<br>
As far as being able to get items and money back in EQ, remember that untill a couple months ago they didnt have a way to accurately log if a character had an item or not.  It was policy to assume the player was lying and not give the item back.  Even now that they have the loging, 90% of the time your still screwed.  No drop trading was around for about a year as well.<br>

Not to put too fine a point on it, but the lesser of two evils is still evil. Personally? I don't need or want happyspeak every damned day. I don't know why this industry is so different from any other, but man... don't try to be my friend, okay? I'm a customer. I want to play the product. Fix it and let me know when it's fixed, and if/when I have a problem, fix that.<br>

Maybe it's just me, but the best customer service in the world is the kind you don't think about.

I despise Verant and the Uber guilds in EQ. In fact, Planetside and Star Wars (even though cool concepts) will never pass through my door because of Verant's name on the box. And it's not only Verant that made me hate Eq, but also the swelled headed, egotistical parasites called players. God, the fucking childishness that went on due to 50+ assholes thinking they ruled the friggan earth. Unfortunately, I see alot of that horeshit in AO (just read the main Funcom forums), and many of the whining, mewling pieces of shits that post there are EQ rejects. [PARAGRAPH]<br>
<br>
So, I vote hands down better than Verant, not because it is a superior game, but because they (Funcom offcials) don't go out of thier way to try and make it's players feel small and insignificant. And yes, CS is slow and unweildy, but I was there from the beginning with Verant too, and it was the same way. IF they ever fix the technical issues (Mem leaks, crashes) and finallly get around to tweaking the game play and implement the story then this game is gonna rock ass. They are not Saints or Angels by any means, and they have a long way to go, but I'll take my chances with them rather than go back to the cesspool that is EQ.<br>

<br>
I voted &quot;No, VI does a better job&quot; for one simple reason -- not because I think Verant was any great shakes at public relations or because I miss playing EQ.  I don't.  I haven't touched my EQ account since the day AO went public (except for 5 minutes once to make some enchanter spells for a friend :-) ).  That simple reason is because Verant did what they said they would do -- we may not always have agreed with their decisions, but they started out on Day One saying they would proactively prosecute exploiters.  They did that.  They said they would proactively chase down and ban (if required) grief players.  I personally saw that happen more than once.  What's more, the times I petitioned in EQ, be it to report exploiters or ask for help, I *always* got help.  Right after release my body was stuck in the tunnels under Highpass for 3 days, but eventually I did get a guide who not only retrieved my body but then summoned my puny 10th level butt out of the place :-)  The petitions after that were always answered within an hour or so.<br>
<br>
To date, I have not seen Funcom do diddly against exploiters except nerf one of the main combat classes in the game -- a solution that I don't think was the best available in a game where there is NO faction and the insurance terminals can remove all risks to the players.  Their approach to exploiters is to talk sternly in public and then slap them on the wrist.  That will not end exploiting. I have yet to have one single petition answered.<br>
<br>
I worked for a time on the Sony board as a sysop and I got to deal directly with McQuaid, Geoff Z., Brian Hooks and the lot.  They may come across as arrogant idiots to the general player population but they weren't, they just had some strange ideas about how to deal with the player community.  I eventually quit that position over a situation where their lack of communicative skills left me as a scapegoat, but the fault lies in their methods, not their willingness or their intent.<br>
<br>
I see Funcom enduring some of the same faltering mistakes in the early going.  The player community requires firm leadership from the game designers and it requires absolute honesty, but most of all it requires communication.  Without that, the whole thing is going to collapse on its face.  I'm waiting to see if things improve.  If nothing else, at least Funcom keeps us informed on server status -- one thing it took Verant 2 years to figure out had any value.<br>
