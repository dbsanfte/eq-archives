<br>
I know people like to rag on the CS of EQ. They're not exactly the best people out there. But at least they're there. AO has the worst CS of anything I've ever paid money for. I don't like my fries at McDonalds? They give me new fries. But not on AO. You don't like something on there, that's your problem.<br>
<br>
My character's been bugged for about 4 days now. The first thing to stop working was my MA special attacks. I press the button, or click it to activate it and it does charge me the mana (more than is listed on the attack). It does lock my MA skill. But it does no damage (no message even appears), tested it on mobs and friends. And after 10 seconds or so, it tells me my MA skill is available. Whoopee. I've tried everything I can to fix it myself, everything. But nothing works, even buying new, different MA attacks doesn't help. I just can't do them.<br>
<br>
Ok so that's annoying. After 2 days of petitioning I get an ARK who tells me 'uh, nothing I can do.' Then later her tells me 'it'll be fixed in the next patch.'. 2 server patches later, it's still fucked so I'm guessing he means client patch. I have to wait for a client patch to fix something wrong with my character, yet my friends MA's are all fine. Joy. But I live with that. Then, for no apparent reason, the game will not recognize that I have corrosive fists cast upon myself. It just happened mid fight. I was hitting for min damage 46 over and over and over again with the odd crit thrown in. The very next fight, no buffs cast or debuffs cast on me. I'm hitting the same level and kind of mob for 37 over and over again, and I know what my min damage is with and with out it, experience has taught me that. So I rebuff, try it again and still, refuses to accept I have corrosive fists cast on me. <br>
<br>
Ok. So that’s annoying. /petitions go unanswered. Nothing new there. Then a couple of days ago something new starts happening. The game, which had been really quite stable for me, starts booting me more often. Especially while in missions. And behold, when I log back in, the entire mission has respawned exactly where they where with me in the middle of them. I've still got the loot I took, I've still got the money. But I don't have the xp. And they really are exactly the same, I had an inventory full of 2 of everything I'd picked up. So that's annoying. Yesterday though, was the final straw. I go into a mission,1 tough orange, a yellow and a green in the opening room. I pull them back to the start zone so I'm right near the door. I'm hitting restore essence as I fight, doing ok, only the orange is hitting me hard, then I notice when I'm at half health, I'm not healing, tells me nanobots are recharging. (I check afterwards, that's all it ever said, no healing). So with over 500hp left, I step back and into the zone. Straightaway I get the you are changing zones message and become helpless and sit there, listening for about 10-12 seconds to my character fighting them. I mean you expect to take a few shots when you zone, that’s the danger of it. But I stood there and fought them till they killed me, then instantly zoned to the reclaim terminal.<br>
<br>
I've been petitioning ever since. Not 1 reply to my petitions. AO has simply the worst CS department of all time. How could you be a member of their team and not hate yourself for just how useless you are?. I've tried to be patient, I understand the game is just out, it's got problems but really, I'm paying for this now, my free month was up some time ago and it's getting beyond a joke. I want my fries :P.<br>

I couldn't log in for a week once because I crashed everytime I tried to log on one character. Took funcom a week to fix my account. I've been time warped and lost tons of xp, sometimes during gameplay AO will just freeze up and I'll return to find myself dead(lost 620k xp the other night), I've had all kinds of problems and us as the paying customers shouldn't have to put up with it BUT - there are a few things you should know.<br>
<br>
The Advisors(volunteers) have VERY limited power right now, which will change eventually. The only people who can fix a lot of problems are GM's and there just aren't enough of them.<br>
For a game of this size and popularity we shouldn't have to put up with this, I agree with that. However, and this isn't really directed to you count since it sounds like your quitting, if you don't like it, don't play it.<br>
<br>
I've said it before and I'll say it again, I'm tired of hearing people bitch and moan all day about how screwed up AO is. Its severely screwed up, I know that, you know that, but complaining about it isn't going to do anything. I've been through the same things you have and its very frustrating, but all people do is complain, complain, complain and I am sick of it. <br>
<br>
If all you do is dispise the game and bitch about it then quit. If its that horrible then stop playing. You want your money back? Go file a lawsuit or whatever you have to do, I don't care, but if you don't like the game then why play it? Does it make sense to do something that is in no way benefiting you or someone your helping when all it does is frustrate you?<br>
<br>
I'll probably get flamed for this and thats fine but Funcom knows what the problems are and they are going to fix it whenever they feel like it, so if you hate the game that much and you can't put up with the problems then stop playing.<br>

<br>
Let me share some with you: <br>
<br>
Don't read these posts. It's obviously annoying you enough to get motivated to tell people 'don't play it if you don't like it'. Just, ignore them. People who dish out advice yet are not clever enough to follow the moral of their own sagacious lectures seem double the fool. My topic wasn't ambigious, if you clicked on that you knew you were going to read about someone who was unhappy, yet you know it pisses you off.<br>
<br>
Don't take that the wrong way, this isn't me flaming you, just trying as you did, to give some friendly advice. <br>

As a paying customer of a game that doesn't work as it was touted to then yes, I have the right to bitch, moan, complain, cry, scream, and any other emotion that shows displeasure. I also agree with the Count, if you know that a thread is just a bitch session (his wasn't), and that pisses you off.....oh damn, I was about to tell you not to read it but that's the same tired ass, no imaginitive horeshit that you were using, so I'll just have to come up with something else. Well ok, what the hell....DON&quot;T READ AND RESPOND TO IT!!!!!!! He had valid points of why he was displeased and I agree with him. This game is a technical horror story sometimes, and if people want to bitch about then let them by God. Damn, ruined my day.<br>

I'm never in a rage over something that happens on the computer because thats just a waste of time. Sure I get frustrated but nothing that happens over a computer could ruin my day or make me seriously angry. I know some people get extremely angry over the computer and I don't because if something made me that angry on the computer I wouldn't be on it in the first place.<br>
<br>
I'm gonna quote you Crimhawk &quot;Well ok, what the hell....DON&quot;T READ AND RESPOND TO IT!!!!!!! &quot;. I think we have very similar oppinions with that comment said. You think I shouldn't reply to things if I don't have something YOU would consider appropriate to say and I think you shouldn't play a game you hate.<br>
<br>
Honestly, whats the problem here? I am severely confused, why do people play something thats suppose to be fun if its not fun at all for them? Can you answer me that? If you hate the game so much WHY WHY WHY do you continue to play it? Just to have the right to complain?<br>
<br>
The only thing that is a little frustrating is this - Some Advisors work petitions for 8 hours straight sometimes. These people are volunteers, they are players like everyone else who devote they're free time to help us and they get nothing in return. They answer petitions the best they can for long periods of times and all they do is get put down when they don't do things for people that are IMPOSSIBLE for them to do. They can't reimburse xp or items, they can't fix your account, all they can do is forward petitions and provide a possible fix for problems. They do the absolute best they can(WITH NOTHING IN RETURN) and we just dismiss them as lazy.<br>
<br>
Gonna quote you again Crimhawk <br>
&quot;I just get tired of hearing that same old tired, shit that you people who have nothing to say use. If we don't like it don't play? Come on hoss, you do better than that. At least make it creative when you say it. &quot;<br>
<br>
Alright so I have nothing to say. You consider complaining endlessly and pointlessly about the same tired things as being important? I have nothing to say when I tell complainers to use logic and don't do something they don't like doing? Why do I need to make logic creative? <br>
Example: I don't like to play Tribes 2.<br>
Reason: I'm sure people will disagree with me, but I think its boring.<br>
Outcome: I don't play it<br>
<br>
Going to quote count now<br>
&quot;Don't read these posts. It's obviously annoying you enough to get motivated to tell people 'don't play it if you don't like it'. Just, ignore them. People who dish out advice yet are not clever enough to follow the moral of their own sagacious lectures seem double the fool.

<br>
Well as I stated way up there somewhere It really isn't bothering and it sure as hell doesn't really piss me off. Count, I answered this thread because I am enjoying debating this issue with you. If talking about this with you was not fun for me I wouldn't be doing it. Yes its tiring hearing people complain about the same things that everyone, at one time or another, has complained about but its not boring nor frustrating to discuss it with them. Somehow replying to this ruined Crimhawk's day, if threads on a message board could ruin my day I definetly wouldn't visit them very often.<br>
<br>
Theres one question that seems to go un-answered though. If you don't like it, why do you play it? Honestly I'd like to know because I can't seem to figure it out.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm all wrong here, maybe I haven't tasted the fruits of whining and having it help nothing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uarikel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arikel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#660000>(9/16/01 3:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Death of this game?</span><hr size=1> Back to the original topic... have you double checked your options menus?

If you put your complaints, suggestions or bugs out there, then it gets looked at, and 'sometimes' changed.<br>
<br>
To the original poster, thank you for voicing your concerns in a clear manner. All of us at one time or another have been frustrated due to bugs and/or shoddy CS in one game or another. <br>
<br>
I won't reiterate the thousands of posts that debate the matter one way or the other, but if you KNOW that you are releasing a game that is buggy as hell, then make it a POINT to have enough support. <br>
<br>
To come here, in this forum where, for the most part people are level-headed, and to bitch because someone has complaints is... well, ludicrous. <br>
<br>
We could all say - If you don't like hearing this, don't read the forums, Stiv. It's about as <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=asinine">asinine</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> as the previous suggestion of not playing the game, and benefits none of us in the least. <br>
<br>
At least try to be constructive. We the players of AO need to know whether certain behaviors of CS are widespread and the norm or whether certain incidents are singular and far between. <br>
I don't think that the FC CS are morons, but I do think that CS has been put on a back burner, and it's the gamers who suffer. This is my opinion, and I'm entitled to it, as is ever other person who feels the same, or even differently. <br>
We're all trying to make this game the best it can be. <br>
<br>
If you're looking for a &quot;Funcom-is-wonderful-AO-is-perfect-I- have-absolutely-no-complaints-and-if-I-did-I-wouldn't-be-stupid-enough-to-post-about-them&quot; board, then look elsewhere.   <br>

There are certain aspects of this game that rub me the wrong way, as it does others it seems. Doesn't mean to say I post my complaints on this board because I am quitting (well not yet anyway) or am anti-AO. Hell, Im just a frustrated player trying to get as much out of the game as I can. As Sithean said in the above post, if we don't voice our concerns and problems then these problems will never be brought to light.<br>
<br>
I guess what got me so irratated with your post Stiv is that I've heard it all before, many times over. It's easy for you to say &quot;If you hate the game, then don't play&quot;, but the problem here is that we don't hate the game and we want to play. LOL, we just can't sometimes due to some of the glaring technical problems that have been around since the game went live. You may even say that posting here does no good because Funcom offcials don't read this board. You are probably right (unproven though), but the Sensei does read these threads and takes questions form these threads and forwards them to someone at Funcom (I think that's who he talks to). So in essence, we are being heard.<br>
<br>
Another thing that you may not have thought of is that some of us actually LIKE hearing all of these stories/bitch sessions. It let's us know that we are not the only ones going through this, and in some cases some of these are down right funny (I try to inject some humor if I post a complaint or bitch story). So yeah, you are getting flamed to a certain point, but come on, it's not really that bad, I've seen people get flamed far worse than you are right now. Of course you have every right as a member of this board to post what you wish, but just don't be surprised when you get backlash. Oh and by the way, your post did not, in fact, ruin my day....hehe, that was my fiance bitching at me, you just happened to catch the brunt. So sorry about that).<br>

Straightaway I get the you are changing zones message and become helpless and sit there, listening for about 10-12 seconds to my character fighting them. I mean you expect to take a few shots when you zone, that’s the danger of it. But I stood there and fought them till they killed me, then instantly zoned to the reclaim terminal.&quot;<br>
<br>
That bug got me the other day, too.  Totally pissed me off, because it was like the door HELD you there.  Didn't allow me to heal.  Didn't allow me to run in a different direction.  Just forced me to stand there and get killed.  I petitioned it.  I got answered 4 hours later (after I had logged off once, then come back).  What did he say?  &quot;Please write up a bug report.  Right now we are not allowed to reimberse xp.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, that sucked.  It happened to me once, and hasn't happened since, so I am not too bothered by it.  But it still sucks that it could happen at any time.<br>

<br>
&quot;If you sit on your ass and say/do nothing, then that's exactly what gets changed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thats true, but do you think Funcom is unaware of all these problems? I doubt they're sitting there thinking &quot;This game is perfect, there are no problems here.&quot; They're working on it and with each patch I think they're gradually getting closer. Complaining here isn't going to do anything. Now, bug reporting, and using the forums here <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://r101.d1.funcom.com/forumdisplay.php?s=41b199825514e6091b163214f8cd8398&forumid=114">r101.d1.funcom.com/forumd...orumid=114</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> might get you some place and will help Funcom to better understand the bugs in the game. <br>
<br>
&quot;We could all say - If you don't like hearing this, don't read the forums, Stiv. It's about as asinine as the previous suggestion of not playing the game, and benefits none of us in the least.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think theres a difference with me telling people who don't like Anarchy-Online not to play it, and you telling me not to read the forums. Like I said before, I enjoy debating this topic, its fun for me. I am doing something I enjoy by talking about this with you, some people are doing something they do NOT enjoy by playing the game. If they enjoy the game then they mask it very well with the constant complaining and whining. Complaining on the boards benefits no one either. As I said above, bug reporting and making suggestions on the Official Forums are what benefit the game as a whole.<br>
<br>
Its comments like these &quot;How could you be a member of their team and not hate yourself for just how useless you are?. &quot; that I feel are not helpful in any way, especially when players are volunteering what little free time many of them have to make the game more enjoyable.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you're looking for a &quot;Funcom-is-wonderful-AO-is-perfect-I- have-absolutely-no-complaints-and-if-I-did-I-wouldn't-be-stupid-enough-to-post-about-them&quot; board, then look elsewhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
Obviously I don't believe any of that to be true. Read the first paragraph of my first post in this thread. I've encountered and had to deal with the same problems you have, by all means this game is far from perfect or even decent HOWEVER - Is the game not MUCH further along then it was the day it was released? Has Funcom not made progress? Getting this game to the level we all want it to be on is going to take a long time, thats apparent I think. They are working as fast as they can to fix the multiple problems the game has, complaining will not move this along any further. Bug reporting, suggesting in the right places, and helping eachother solve problems will. I obviously have problems with the game's current state, however, I bug report and I do my best to solve problems for people in game when asked. <br>
<br>
&quot;and-if-I-did-I-wouldn't-be-stupid-enough-to-post-about-them..&quot;<br>
<br>
Please don't imply that I think any of the people posting here are stupid Sithean. I never called anyone stupid and I never insulted anyone so don't try to make me the villain. I am voicing an oppinion like everyone else, although mine differs from yours, I'm not the bad guy.<br>
<br>
Ok now adressing Crimhawk<br>
<br>
I obviously judged you too soon Crimhawk and assumed too much so I appologize. I didn't realize anyone enjoyed reading these, at this point I just find them boring because it seems like I've heard a copy of the same post a million times. I don't mind getting flamed, I just can't keep up with all the flames.<br>
<br>
Cyjax I'm sorry you had to experience something like that. I'm level 86 right now and that has happened to me a million times. I've been experimenting with holding the strafe and forward button when running into a zone so I am running diagonally and it seems to make the zone go through more often. Try it out.<br>
<br>
Just don't blame the ARK's. They are working they're ASSES off for you us with 0 reward and a lot of players just basically spit in they're faces. Most of them have jobs/families/responsabilities and they give up they're free time to try and help us. So next time an ARK can't help you why not try saying &quot;Thanks for trying&quot; instead of &quot;YOU SUCK, I R0X GIMME MY XP&quot;. They do everything within they're power and its just stupid to see them get insulted for that.<br>

Fight normally. note the probelms. <br>
Ok now fight without specials/nanos. Note what happens. <br>
Are you wearing any special armor? bracers, rings etc? take those off. <br>
Try fighting a leet or something totall naked. Then start adding armor. <br>
Maybe its not you thats bugged maybe its a piece of armor or equip. <br>
<br>
If nothing else works. Ask in a firm tone to speak to a GM and not an ARK.<br>

Good luck to ya. <br>

And I never implied that you thought anyone was stupid. I tried to state outright that I felt your post was inflammatory and not helpful in the least. <br>
It came off as smug and superior. I understand many of your points of view, and never, ever did I ask you to stop reading this board. I pointed out that my suggestion, had I made it, would have been as moronic as you saying &quot;Ya don't like it! Don't play it!&quot; How is that debating? I see no discussion in that sort of comment nor attitude. As players of this fine game, we are free to (and should feel free to) post anywhere and everywhere about anything and everything that annoys us or brings us joy about this game. <br>
<br>
Why didn't he post it elsewhere? It says so in the very first line of his post. &quot;Sorry if this isn't strictly pertaining to MA's, but hey I'm one and it's happening to me, and this is about the only AO related board I've found where you can discuss stuff without being troll bait.&quot; Troll bait. Y'know, as in being able to be discussed without too much fear of being put down or flamed. He came across in a clear, calm manner, and you come back with:<br>
<br>
&quot;If all you do is dispise the game and bitch about it then quit. If its that horrible then stop playing. You want your money back? Go file a lawsuit or whatever you have to do, I don't care, but if you don't like the game then why play it?&quot;<br>
<br>
He never said he &quot;dispised&quot; (sic) the game. He never said it was that horrible. You're suggesting a lawsuit? (grin) He was pointing out valid issues. Sheesh. <br>
<br>
&quot;but Funcom knows what the problems are and they are going to fix it whenever they feel like it&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed, but gaming companies do listen to their customers, and generally, if you complain loud enough and long enough, things get changed. This board is for specifically-MA discussion. What gets posted here, over and over, eventually gets whittled down to specific, concise issues and incidents that are presented in clear manner over at other boards. <br>
<br>
In other words, he's an AO player. This is an AO board. Let him post without fear of being bitched or whined at for having the audacity to have issues with the game. No, you never said that precisely, but it came out like that. <br>
<br>
I'm not attacking a person directly. I'm attacking the notion that he's not free to post his concerns. Whether or not anyone else thinks these concerns are valid, or the posting of them a moot point, he's free to post them. <p><br>

<br>
I know that, but I think complaining on random message boards and suggesting in the appropriate places are 2 very different things. One isn't really going to do anything and the other might help something that you want changed, change faster.<br>
<br>
&quot;It came off as smug and superior&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't really care how it came off, I said what was on my mind. Instead of beating around the bush and trying to make everyone feel good about themselves I just came out with what I had to say.<br>
<br>
&quot;and never, ever did I ask you to stop reading this board&quot;<br>
<br>
I think you misunderstand what I said earlier, probably because what I wrote was badly worded. I was never accusing you of saying that, I was just saying I didn't think those 2 statements were alike in this situation.<br>
<br>
&quot;How is that debating? I see no discussion in that sort of comment nor attitude. As players of this fine game, we are free to (and should feel free to) post anywhere and everywhere about anything and everything that annoys us or brings us joy about this game. &quot;<br>
<br>
Well it obviously triggered a debate. I said exactly what was on my mind and people rebuttaled. Yes, everyone is free to post about whatever annoys them but I am equally free to reply telling them to stop crying. When people post about things they had fun with in the game or things they're happy about then I think &quot;well thats cool&quot;. When people post about how horrible this game is and insult the volunteers working for them I don't think anything, I hear the sounds of a 3 year old crying.<br>
<br>
&quot;Troll bait. Y'know, as in being able to be discussed without too much fear of being put down or flamed. He came across in a clear, calm manner, and you come back with..&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry, I refuse not to say something just because it might make someone feel bad. I HIGHLY doubt after reading my reply he felt rejected or bad about himself. If you think the way I write sounds more like an attack then a reply then I'm sorry because thats just the way I write.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;He never said he &quot;dispised&quot; (sic) the game. He never said it was that horrible. You're suggesting a lawsuit? (grin) He was pointing out valid issues. Sheesh.&quot;<br>
<br>
Perhaps I assumed too much like I did with Crimhawk. But when someone can complain so much in one post its hard for me to believe they like the game very much. I was being more sarcastic then actually suggesting that. Yes, valid issues that everyone else on the planet has pointed out. <br>
<br>
&quot;What gets posted here, over and over, eventually gets whittled down to specific, concise issues and incidents that are presented in clear manner over at other boards. &quot;<br>
<br>
Instead of posting complaints here where Funcom MAY look at them, why not send them directly to the source?<br>
<br>
&quot;In other words, he's an AO player. This is an AO board. Let him post without fear of being bitched or whined at for having the audacity to have issues with the game&quot;<br>
<br>
I never said he couldn't post whatever he pleased here. Sithean, if people disagreeing with you makes you scared then you have issues you have to work out. He is entitled to his oppinions and I am entitled to mine. He has just as much right to post complaints here as I have to make posts telling people to stop acting like babies.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, you never said that precisely, but it came out like that. &quot;<br>
<br>
If I didn't put it down in writing Sithean, then I didn't say it. If thats how your going to take it then thats how your going to take it. Nothing I can do about that.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not attacking a person directly. I'm attacking the notion that he's not free to post his concerns. Whether or not anyone else thinks these concerns are valid, or the posting of them a moot point, he's free to post them.&quot;<br>
<br>
ONCE again, these are public message boards and he can post whatever the hell he wants here. I never said he couldn't. Jesus. However, I too can post whatever I want here and thats exactly what I'm doing and will continue to do. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to reply to anymore of these types of posts in this thread because its a fruitless effort. It comes down to oppinions and no ones oppinion is more valid than the other person's just like no religion is more valid than the other. So we can anylize eachother's words all day or we can leave it at that, that everyone is entitled to an oppinion and everyone else is entitled to disagree with that oppinion.<br>

Whining helps nothing, if you have a problem report it to the Developers at www.anarchy-online.com in their message board section. If they seem to do nothing about it, apply for an ARK application and see just how easy it is to spend 10 hours minimum of your week on just answering peoples petitions, and as you are doing that make absolutely sure that each and every one isn't lieing about what they are petitioning about. Sounds easy to me, maybe you and all these other whiners can improve the quality of FREE CUSTOMER SERVICE in minutes, you seem to already know how easy it is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=bitingdust>bitingdust</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#660000>(9/18/01 12:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=19.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !</span><hr size=1> stiv there are those who take the bitch slapping and turn the other cheek for soem more pain and there are those who bitch about it and say goddamnit that hurts stop slapping me<br>
