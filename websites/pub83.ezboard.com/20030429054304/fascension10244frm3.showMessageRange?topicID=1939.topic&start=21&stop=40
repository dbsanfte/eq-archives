<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Only their interest is Money, while ours are Safety. They have billions in contracts with Iraq for oil and in many other areas of trade.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I find that statement ludicrous and presumptious Alt.  You don't suppose that the fact that 87% of the French people are against military action is the real reason for the French government position for example?  Governments are mandates of the people- with such a clear majority against the war, the French administration have done their democratic duty.  When opinion is split (55% of Americans polled yesterday support war, 37% are against it without UN backing- 74% of people polled are anxious about the war result)- when opinion is that split, it behoves the US administration to make the correct strategic decision to protect its people in the long run- it hasn't done it.  <br>
<br>
As regards your claims of &quot;French oil deals&quot;- the facts are as follows:  A small number of French companies (5 I believe, including eLF)- have pre-contract agreements to start negotiations <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>in the event sanctions are lifted</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Let's think about that for a moment.  You are saying that the French <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>government</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has based its entire foreign policy position regarding Iraq on the whim of a few French corporations?  Why in heaven's name Altaris, would the French adopt such a risky and potentially damaging stance, risking US/UK economic boycotts for the sake of a few pre-contractual agreements for a few French companies who mainly sell their oil overseas?  That's right folks!  France is a rather interesting nation energy-wise, less than an eigth of their national energy needs come from oil- and most of that is imported car petroleum from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>British Petroleum</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, a UK firm whose European export market naturally derives from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>North Sea oil</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->- <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Middle Eastern oil.  Nationally speaking France have comitted to nuclear power for energy generation since the late 1970s- not many people know that in America, so the &quot;French oil deals&quot; are an easy sell to the population there.  <br>
<br>
And let us assume for a moment Alt, that you are right, and that &quot;Money&quot; is the driving agenda here, and that it is indeed 5 oil corporations that dictate the foreign policy of France.  Why then, haven't the French <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ever</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> veto'd sanctions?  I put it to you that this would give them exactly what they want, and be a far less risky veto than even the threatened one they put to the draft resolution recently.  It wouldn't have lead the French to a position of brinkmanship facing the United States, it would certainly not have had the effect of such diplomatic dynamite.  That veto would clearly give them all the room they needed to trade with Iraq openly and at far less political risk than they now have faced.  The simple truth is that the French have supported a position of inspections, backed with containment, disarmament and the ever present <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>threat</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of force- their position is a legitimate one that supports international law and institutions- it is also the correct strategic choice.<br>
<br>
Just as a point of law by the way Altaris- the fall of the Ba'ath party in no way makes these agreements void- the agreement is between French corporations and Iraqi corporations.  Assuming any invading army doesn't seek to restructure every major business that has a contract with foreign MNCs, it's fair to say that the agreements still have a legal basis.  Moreover, there is strong legal precedent in the Common Law(Iraq uses a common law system like the UK) for binding agreement to take effect even in the event of an illegal contract- Sale of Goods Act (1965).  There are also similar precedents under Napoleonic law provisions in France- <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Guillaume contre Everschard </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->(1912).  Therefore- even in the absence of a binding contract: pre-contractual agreements to negotiate terms are still valid even before the actual sale of goods- in the interests of protecting the party pursuing agreement.  Legal nomenclature aside- in layman's terms it basically means that in the absence of a complete liquidation of Iraqi business by an invading army, the obligations of agreement would be valid, even if an Iraqi court one day pronounced them illegal.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I need to find the transcript of the speech I saw Blair giving before I came to work, it was a really good one. To bad Blair can't be our Pres. While I fully support Bush, I have always loved Blair.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I watched the PM's speech, and indeed the rest of the debate in the Commons, including the resignation statements of 3 deputy cabinet ministers- particularly the Deputy Home Secretary.  I do not doubt that our Prime Minister believes passionately in the correctness of his action- indeed, as the DHS pointed out- if passion and courage of conviction were the motion on the floor of the Commons, the Prime Minister would win every vote in the House.  But he went on to note, as did many other key (former) government ministers who had resigned, that courage of conviction and belief were not enough in themselves to commit British troops to war.  <br>
<br>
That is the issue at hand Altaris- suspicion, prevarication, unproven linkages, assertions and aggressive rhetoric cannot be allowed to bludgeon the facts and the proven doctrines of containment and deterrence.  As much as I admired the PM's speech, he said nothing that he hasn't already- and even conceded that Saddam's terrorist links were &quot;loose at best&quot; and then made an (unproven) assertion that &quot;they are hardening&quot;.  That is a poorly defined threat- in my mind the case for a pre-emptive mode of action requires a far higher standard of proof than any regular military response- and we haven't seen a shred of proof indicating such a threat.  We must act on information in hand- and in the absence of information presenting a threat we should not act.  I find it just as contradictory as Robin Cook did- that we should claim the Iraqi military structure weak enough to collapse at the mere sight of Coalition forces- and yet still somehow claim that Iraq poses a clear threat to us...is ludicrous.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No, diplomacy was NOT over when troops were deployed. Troops can be called back<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Heh, in theory- yet I ask you to consider this lurker- why were 60,000 US troops and 28,000 British troops already being deployed to the region long before Resolution 1441 was even tabled?  And why were those 28,000 British troops packing enough supplies for a force nearly twice its size at the time?  The seeds of regime change were laid long before disarmament ever hit the UNSC debating tables.  This indicates most strongly that disarmament was likely sought as a pretext for a UN rubber stamp for military action rather than the vehicle for decision-making.  <br>
<br>
You talk of troops being recalled- yet there has <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>never</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> been a climb-down of deployment when so many troops have been deployed- it has <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>never</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> happened historically- and so it has proved again.  Once those troops are deployed, it is humiliating, not to mention political suicide to even consider backing down- whether or not standing down is the right thing to do.  <br>
<br>
Why do you think the United States were committed as long as they were in Vietnam lurker- or why did the British press ahead with Suez in 1956?  It wasn't just because of the lack of an exit strategy- it was because it would have been a humilitating defeat for the United States(or the UK in the latter case) in terms of failing to defeat communism in SE Asia/Arab nationalism respectively- failure was not an option for the politicans, and millions of people paid the price.  Pulling out would have signalled the end for any administration countenancing it except in the face of overwhelming losses- I'm saddened that it took that level of bloodshed to &quot;realize&quot; that the action itself was wrong.  Politicians only give the order to withdraw if in doing so, their own political survival is assured- they will only climb down when it is politically viable to do so.  If that precious survival of theirs is threatened in any way- then even unjust wars will be engaged in and conflicts escalated to keep them firmly in their offices.  Sad, but true.<br>
<br>
Now, to Bollix's comments.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>i will give a few select quotes from Robin Cooke, a highly respected, and high up government member (he is/was Leader of the House of Commons) in the UK who resigned in protest at this war.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I cannot praise Robin Cook highly enough for his speech and action in resigning from an administration which he disagreed with in principle.  Robin Cook, for those who don't know- was the former Foreign Secretary in the last Parliament, recently Leader of the Commons and before that was a senior figure in the Shadow Cabinet for 30 odd years.  A consumate politician who spent his life at the heart of the Labour party felt the need to walk away from everything he held dear- to abaondon Tony Blair, whose election campaign he managed, to abandon some of his closest personal friends in the political sense.  I cannot imagine what courage it must have taken for the third most powerful administrative figure in the country, a talisman of the Central Labour party, to resign his position when he had everything to gain by blindly supporting the government- my hat's off to him.  Claire Short on the other hand, with her constant U-turns and eventual capitulation of stance on resignation, has utterly disgusted me with her opportunistic shift in position- I hope she gets everything she deserves politically.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Is the UK/US really going to give 2 fingers to the international community and substitute violence for laws and agreement?<br>
What next? If China decides that Taiwan is a threat, are they entitled to blow it to smithereens? If the UK decides that Ireland is harbouring terrorists can they order the Irish prime minister to leave the country or face extinction?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A brilliant point Bollix, and succintly made (wish I could learn to do that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Where the United States and Britain lead, others will see that they might well follow, backed up by the legitimacy of a precedent set by the world's two most powerful nations.  This has incalculable and disastrous consequences for peace and security all around the world.  While I find it highly unlikely that Blair will order the Taoiseach to leave Eire or face mlitary action(though it'd make London Irish's trip to Munster highly interesting <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )- I think the Taiwan example is a brilliantly spotted potential flashpoint created by a US-led pre-emptive doctrine.  A nation acting in a civilized way, mindful of its role and place in the world- cannot in all good conscience mount a pre-emptive war of aggression when a clear and proven threat has not even been established.  Outside of suspicion and personal beliefs Altaris- can you or anyone else anywhere on this thread or indeed anywhere in the world prove the veracity of a real threat?  Or how containment and deterrence have failed?  <br>
<br>
Prove to me that Iraq is a clear and imminent threat to US or UK security Altaris, and I undertake to support any military action that either of our governments take to correct this.  I pledge this unreservedly and have done so from the beginning- without a high standard of proof, pre-emptive acts of aggression can never be justified or yield wholly desirable results.  <br>
<br>
To conclude- my greatest fear in the long run has to be the far-reaching ramifications of any war, particularly for the Middle East.  Iraq is a wholly disunited nation in terms of ethnic, religious, cultural and territorial differences that exist within its borders.  I find it highly unlikely that any new government would be able to keep peace and security in a post-war Iraq.  Moreover, I feel very strongly that a semblance of a &quot;show-government&quot; Loya Jirga &amp; Afghanistan style will be the final result of any conflict.<br>
<br>
Altaris and Kadandrum- we will win the war, I have no doubt of that.  Your forces and ours are the finest in the world, and they face a de-fanged, flogged and demoralized army on the whole.  We will certainly win the war- but in the aftermath, how the devil will we win the peace with the instability of the region and the rise of extremist acts that will surely follow?  That is what will keep me up at night just as much as the thought of innocent blood being spilled daily in my name.<br>

It would seem that Americans as a nation are grown to believe that they are the 'good guys' of the world. Almost nothing can shake that ideal, it seems to be the core of American identity. There's nothing wrong with that, in fact willingness to make that true would be a strong positive force in the world. However, lately that very ideal has been turned upside down, to in effect say that since US is the good guy, everything it does must be good, right? And everyone to oppose or even disagree must be a bad guy, because only bad guys would do something like that.<br>
<br>
After the cold war and collapse of the Evil Empire, there weren't any obvious bad guys around, just slightly naughty ones. The problem with good and evil approach is that for good guys to exist, there has to be bad guys. Otherwise, there would be just... guys. The ones which are just as dead were they hit by a smart bomb while huddling in their shacks next to a power plant or shot dead defending freedom, the right way of life and apple pie. We all know who emerged as the bad guys of the 21st century, so I won't go into that. I just want to point out that I believe that one reason in the US demonising its opponents is partly because of the belief that anyone who opposes them must be somehow morally inferior, and partly because of the need to create or augment bad guys to underline their own goodness.<br>
<br>
This is what has happened to France. The position of France hasn't been fundamentally different from multitude of other countries, only more vocal and admittedly, somewhat more arrogant. Somehow it ended up as a figurehead of the anti-war movement and so it became the target. The awe-inspiring propaganda machine that is the US media kicked into action. From cartoons to talk shows, from news reports to government statements the Americans were programmed what to believe and what to think about France. Where just a couple of months ago had been indifference, was now strong opinion; built from resentment, founded on ignorance. <br>
<br>
Even the smartest person has to form his/her opinion based on the available facts. Therefore, should the facts be skewed, so would be the following assumptions. A real life example of this simple fact is that a person who by all accounts is quite sensible, believes in earnest that &quot;They are in it for money, we are in it for safety.&quot; Substitute safety for power, or control if you will, and I'll buy that. <br>
<br>
Remember that while the US isn't dependant on Middle-East oil, it is very much dependant on imported oil. The oil market is one where demand is more or less the same, while supply can change by the whim of a sheik. Who controls the supply, controls the oil price. Who controls the Middle-East, controls the oil market. If you think removing an anti-American leader sitting on the world's second largest oil resource is just a coincidence, you're in for a surprise. Does anyone even entertain the notion that the US would allow for an unfriendly leader on the throne of Iraq? Especially after it has gone great lengths to show everyone what happens from that stance. While oil might not be all of the pie, it certainly is a large piece of it.<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned they don't want France on their team. I'm afraid it's not who you want anymore, it's who you can get. 'Your team' was made public recently, and in many of those countries public opinion is against this war even if the government isn't (eg. Britain, Japan, Australia etc). Politicians are usually quick on the uptake. If the same style of 'diplomacy' continues, the next governments in those countries won't be in your team anymore. Time will tell if this war is just an isolated incident, or (believe it or not, what I don't want to see) if it will mark a decisive shift for the worse in the world opinion of the US.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>France May Help U.S. in Case of Chemical Warfare<br>
<br>
Tuesday, March 18, 2003<br>
<br>
PARIS — The French military could help the United States if Iraq uses biological or chemical weapons against U.S.-led invaders, the French Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.<br>
<br>
France has led opposition to U.S. war plans in Iraq, but the Foreign Ministry said Iraqi use of biological or chemical weapons in a war could change France's position.<br>
<br>
&quot;France would assess what measures of assistance to take in a spirit of friendship and solidarity,&quot; a ministry statement said. It gave no other details.<br>
<br>
France's ambassador to the United States made similar comments earlier on in a televised interview. Ambassador Jean-David Levitte also did not specify what kind of help France could offer, saying only, &quot;We have equipment to fight in these circumstances.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As an American, I welcome their involvement.<br>
<br>
To address Malio's thought, the conflict has, unfortunately, been redirected by dissenters to question the US and its legitimacy, authority to address foreign policy, and an inability to listen to other countries.  Well we heard you, now we are acting.  The tyrant is Hussein, a mass murderer who kills with impunity.  The enemy is not the US.<br>
<br>
PS Xorthar, no one fucking programmed me.  I dare you to say that to anyone in person, not hidden behind a computer screen.  <br>
<br>
And to say that the American media is a war propaganda machine is utterly ridicilous.  MANY Americans view the media, save for few exceptions (Limbaugh, Foxnews, etc&gt;) as too liberal.  Americans care about their troops and they become glued to these types of news reports.  It is out of their extreme interest for news that drives the media.  To suggest otherwise as you do, is showing true ignorance.  Do you really believe that 71% of Americans have been programmed to support action against Iraq?  Preposterous!<br>

<br>
From a normal citizen of the US like myself, we view this war as a war against terrorism, period.  I'm sure that oil plays a small part in our agressions, money is behind almost every political agenda you'd ever find.  The bottom line though, is that the US has intellegence that it believes is undeniable.  The potential of Sadam's WoMDs as a terrorist attack flat out pisses us off.   We saw what happened when a few people got control of a plane.  We do not want these people to ever have technology that can be used to wipe out an even larger percent of the population.<br>
<br>
That's why I am behind the war.  It may be pre-emptive.  The world may not see it as the right thing for the world...but this is the right thing for the United States.  As a side note, after the war is over, I assure you that Iraqi WoMDs will be found or either used, showing just how ineffective the pacifists in the United Nations are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xorthar>Xorthar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(3/19/03 4:02:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> Kadandrum, I didn't say in my post that media effected the opinion on the war. I (thought I) clearly limited the discussion on media to opinion of France and, even though I didn't explicitly say it, of Europe. I believe most Americans don't care enough of France, Germany or Europe to build such an enmity without a media barrage, which I know exists. By the way, I also welcome the current development where France has stepped down its hard-line anti-war policy, and the US has admitted the UN may have it's uses after all. <br>

<br>
1) Cut them damn 100 page resolutions down!  Half the argument the Americans are putting forth is there is a stack of resolutions in the UN with no decent results. (remember that we Americans take information in 15-45 second commercials and anything else shuts us down)<br>
<br>
2) Organize your thoughts with a flow or structure that can be followed, and try not to write a post that covers more than one topic.<br>
<br>
3) Don't do that annoying thing where you pull the text out of someone else's post and then respond to it.  In legal writing we are taught that technique is one of the least persuasive forms of argument.  It says to the reader &quot;don't read this, it's not important&quot;.<br>
<br>
4) And finally, make short summaries at the beginning or ending or both so we can scan the argument to see if we want to invest our time in reading it.<br>
<br>
If you keep posts short and sweet, organized, un-bastardized, and summarized, we Americans will be more receptive.<br>
<br>
There is of course, the idea that you are just writing for your own therapy.  In that case... spam on.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=everas>Everas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AD's Iksar Monk_0354</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#333333>(3/21/03 12:22:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> In other words try to appeal to those with little to no reading comprehension skill?

<br>
firstly, black and white:<br>
The US seems to be waging this war on moral absolutes, of good guys and evil guys. there is reassurance in this view that you are 100% correct. The view is widespread (axis of evil, war on terror, good guys v bad guys etc). It provides a balm to conscience if you have faith, truth, god, righteousness and justice on your side. It means you are right and can do no wrong.  However, i think it is far to simplistic a view. I am anti war in iraq at this time. That doesn't mean i love saddam hussein. I know that he is 'a bad man'. But for me, the world is alot greyer and not as stark as some would see it. I know that UK/US were happy at one stage to support him and not another, that lots of others have WMD, that war kills lots of people, that there is questionable international legitimacy for this war, that economic motives underly it, that security fears compound it, that sectarian/anti muslim feelings are part of it.<br>
I don't feel it is a simple and easy moral choice of good versus evil. And i am concerned, as should everyone, about people who are convinced they are absolutely and unshakeably right. Fundamentalism and zealotry combined with  military might are a dangerous combination wether wielded by Middle Eastern Dictators, muslim extremists or American leaders.<br>
<br>
second, if you haven't suffered / fought, don't comment.<br>
I think relg said that, unless you know what its like to be in the military and put your own life on the line fighting for freedom, then you should quiet down and stop criticising those running the risks to keep you safe. I could come from the other perspective, and say that i have seen the other side of the gun, and been part of the civilian population suffering under military occupation. my family have been locked up by the 'lawful authority' exercised by british soldiers wielding guns, a country where civilians have been murdered in cold blood by the army. <br>
However, i don't think that i, or anyone needs to have 'experienced' it before commenting on it. I haven't been subjected to racism, but i still know its a bad thing. I disagreed with apartheid even though i had never been to south africa.<br>
my point is, it should be the strenght of your argument which carries the day, what you say, not who you are. Obviously serving soldiers will bring an extra perspective though to these sorts of debates. nonetheless, everyone has a valid perspective.<br>
<br>
third, who do you call for when you are in need<br>
People generally call on the UN, not the US.  The UN is involved in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations all around the world. When did we vote for a US world police force? the legitimacy for international operations comes from the UN which is a body representative of the entire world, not just one country.<br>
<br>
fourth, who's next?<br>
afghanistan has already been invaded, iraq is in the process. who is next? iran and north korea have been mentioned, as has cuba. will the american juggernaut of war keep on rolling? why not france too? after all, if they are not 'with us' they are 'against us'.  Once america crossed the rubicon of starting a war without the UN, where will it stop? <p>Bollix Braker <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Warlord <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Officer <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Celestial Empire <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

I won't argue on or around that point at this time. However, I have just one question out of any context: Does history or reputation of being good make everything one does categorically good?<br>
<br>
I admit my posts have been perhaps too much on the provocative side and I apologize for that. Anyhow, that doesn't invalidate my points. Also, it's entirely possible I don't 'know shit' about what's going on. At the end of the day, perception is what matters. I at least hope to be adequately versed in British, liberal US and European view of things reading FT, NY Times and my national newspaper daily. You may disagree with me, you may think I'm trash, if it makes you feel better, be my guest and call me trash. Just don't block your ears and not listen to opinions dissimilar to yours. That is what has mostly been the cause of the current mess.<br>
<br>
What I do know though, is what has happened as a result of the US steamtrain approach. The UN is wounded, perhaps severely. The fragile unity of EU is shattered, the credibility of NATO damaged. A new world order of might makes right seems to be lurking around the corner. While some might think this is a good thing, I don't.<br>
<br>
I'm not used to presenting my 'credentials' before I say anything to be taken seriously or not labeled as a peace-loving hippie. While I acknowledge that the label is probably due to lack of variety in categories, I'll say that like about everyone else around here, I've served in the military. They are just called Defense Forces. I rank junior lieutenant in reserve in Naval Coast Jaeger Regiment. And that fact shouldn't have anything to do with this discussion. Likewise, I have the highest amount of respect to our war veterans, who managed to keep my country independent in the WW2.<br>
<br>
As this will be a sore subject to many who have personal stakes in the matter, I urge everyone who wants to continue the discussion with me (or direct personal attacks at me =) to use the email I provided above.<br>
<br>
For what it's worth, my best wishes to everyone finding themselves in a dire situation over the war.<br>
