Tyvenn quickly BSed me and i died. No biggie, thats what i was there for. So i go loot my corpse to find my earring missing. Its a crap earring i use for pvp, but i wanted it back nonetheless. So i ask Tyvenn, and am quickly told that he is keeping it, and calls me a bitch. What i did to deserve this i have no idea. Killed one of his PK twinks? *shrug* In 2 levels i will be within range of all of you, and if this is not resolved, i will take action. It was a garbage earring, and certainly no worth all this, but his attitude and actions leave me no choice. I am almost entirely no drop, and have nothing to lose, but i see after viewing your roster many of you have things that are not, of great value. I greatly enjoy PvP, and would like nothing more than having another guild to war with. <br>

<br>
We arent a PK guild, If everything played out as you stated it I am not sure why tyvenn would keep your earring. I will speak to tyvenn and find out what went on and why the earring wasnt returned. If we feel he was wrong we will ask him to return it. <br>
<br>
Now... you came here asking for our help to resolve a problem, yet in the same paragraph you threaten us and insult a guildmate. This leads me to believe that maybee tyvenn did have a good reason for keeping your earring. Perhaps your mouth runs out of line often. Perhaps your just frustrated.  Perhaps you should come here threatening other guilds when your *1* member in a guild with many members. I am sure the officers of blood coven wouldnt appreciate that. I would somehow be surprised if your guildmates would be as gung ho asa you are about the prospect of going to war with ascending dawn.  <br>
<br>
Anyhow... we will find out what happened and get back to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umorokdamad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>morokdamad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#333333>(3/8/02 2:50:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=604.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tyvenn</span><hr size=1> I DONT KNOW many blood coven but im sure they dont want me thining your ranks. <br>

First, off this is about some stupid 20 mana 20 hp earring that you were wearing during a duel in the arena ... now Im not for looting in duels but please learn from your mistakes here <br>
<br>
Second, he was naked when he killed u and was killed afterwards and the earring was looted off of him<br>
<br>
Third, you came to our boards with what purpose?? the purpose of resolving this by starting it with lies and ending it with threats?  Don't try out for team negotiator anytime soon is my suggestion.<br>

so if your real interrest is in resolving this rather than escalating it.. which you do well with... try talking to the people he told you to IN GAME to get the earring replaced that you LOST.<br>

Why lie when you can ask the people involved. One persons story doesnt match the other so now its time to piece together the elements that you do know are correct from both storys. An earring that wasnt really of value was looted off Krysantha's body after she got jumped by Tyven. Tyven didnt give it back and hasnt comunicated with Kry again since... perhaps because he fills he is done with the issue!? If that is the case it would seem to stand that a simple response from him here... any response! would settle this dispute!<br>
<br>
As far as her seeming to be a loot monger... and checking out your gear and such! She isnt! Plain and simple if she could have it her way she would bounce from person to person PvP'ering the whole way without ever looting! I know I have seen her do it myself and wondered why didnt she loot! Only thing I ever came up with is she is more interested in a good fight!<br>

I would somehow be surprised if your guildmates would be as gung ho asa you are about the prospect of going to war with ascending dawn. <br>

Hmm seems someone's ego is bouncing all over the place today eh Gsam?<br>
<br>
Sounds to me like the idea of her warring us came after she visited our roster. Seeing what she think is gold mine and easy pickings<br>
<br>
Not quite, Sallox.  Not even close.<br>
<br>
Yeah I know, I suck at politics...<br>
<br>
but...Krysa was and I imagine still is a little upset about the 'event'.  Not cause of the crap earring, but the way it all turned about I'm sure.<br>
<br>
As we (Blood Coven) learned a short while ago with a problem in our own house, there are often 2 sides to a story, and only the people who were there know the whole of it.  The reality usually lies somewhere in between the 2 sides, and has parts of truths from each.<br>
<br>
You want the real truth?  You'll never get it.  Sh*t happens right?<br>
<br>
My opinion?  Krysantha was stunned over what happened.  She doesn't give a darn about the earring, I'm sure of that.  Of all the people I know, she's almost as unconcerned about losing her pvp gear as I am, and I know for a fact that I don't care.  If I was afraid to lose it I'd pvp naked (and die all the time).<br>
<br>
You wanna KOS Blood Coven?  Fine go ahead.  Just remember there's people who are and will remain completely innocent, don't like PvP (I don't understand some things but I love my sisters), and will probably stop playing the game if you started hunting them.  Rarely do we hunt in the same zones, most of you have more gear, better equipment, higher resists, more help...we wouldn't stand a chance.  All this over some earring and a little name calling that someone may have done and is not admitting if he did.  <br>
<br>
bleh I gotta stay outta politicing, I suck at it.  more fun killling things in eq with ya's but if you're gonna hate me over something stoopid like this lemme know first eh?  I think we're all (well most of us) old friends from times past.  Some just level faster than I do.  OK, everyone levels faster than I do...<br>

I would somehow be surprised if your guildmates would be as gung ho asa you are about the prospect of going to war with ascending dawn. <br>
<br>
Hmm seems someone's ego is bouncing all over the place today eh Gsam?<br>
*********************************************<br>
<br>
Hrmmm I dont understand how stating something that you acknowledge to be a fact later on in your post is &quot;flaunting my ego&quot;<br>
<br>
Mriu Posted later on in same thread:<br>
**************************************<br>
You wanna KOS Blood Coven? Fine go ahead. Just remember there's people who are and will remain completely innocent, don't like PvP (I don't understand some things but I love my sisters), and will probably stop playing the game if you started hunting them. Rarely do we hunt in the same zones, most of you have more gear, better equipment, higher resists, more help...we wouldn't stand a chance. All this over some earring and a little name calling that someone may have done and is not admitting if he did. <br>
*****************************************<br>
<br>
You basically acknowledged that AD would win. So tell me again, why do I have an ego when I posted something thats basically acknowledge by both sides to be a fact.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have had no problems with blood coven in the past. One of my best friends in EQ came from your guild. Most of the BC members I ever met have been fun and nice, However you have to admit if someone came to your board and said &quot;hey person X in BC pk'd me and took my earring and if I dont get it back I am gonna have to PK all of you&quot;  (cliff notes version of her post)<br>
<br>
Anyhow, whatever<br>

<br>
She came to our boards and fed us her story... which im sure Blood Coven belives and understandably so.. but we belive our guildmates story because hes our guildmate.. and this particular one especially is known to be pretty truthful..now had she come in not wave THREATS around like flyers to pretty clearly the strongest guild on rallos this would have went about much smoother but she came here threatining to kill us as a guild? Now excuse me but I dont find that exactly full of manners ... i guarantee the earring would have been replaced and prehaps a apology of some variety even given..but you come in here with a valid issue and then threaten us... time to rethink the way you look at things because to be honest we dont take well to threats...<br>
