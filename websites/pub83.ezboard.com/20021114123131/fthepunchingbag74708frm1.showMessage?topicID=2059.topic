Things will get particlarly bad in your 40s, 80-105 or so. At 120 you will get a little breathing space and it will get better from then on. I am currently 157 and i am still out of IPs and have skills where i couldnt put a single IP into yet and need to.<br>
<br>
So here is my advice about IP:<br>
<br>
while leveling, your best setup for PvM is the following:<br>
<br>
max following skills every level, or as much as you can, in the following order<br>
<br>
MA<br>
Brawl<br>
Body Development<br>
Parry<br>
Bio Met<br>
Sens Imp<br>
Psy Mod<br>
Time &amp; Space<br>
<br>
That is your mainstay and bread and butter. Keep up your stats only in order to achieve the minimum reqs, and pick a set of 2, agi/str are good ones here, for armor.<br>
<br>
The following needs to be maxed when you have a chance and extra IP, or at least kept up reasonably high:<br>
<br>
Treatment<br>
Comp Lit<br>
Evades<br>
Agility<br>
Strength<br>
Phys Init<br>
Stamina (only if you play Atrox or Solitus)<br>
Run Speed<br>
<br>
Bring up your Nano Init to about 250-300 for insta heals.<br>
<br>
<br>
This of course changes if you want to do a lot of PvP, and later on when you get high enough level to have extra IP. Once you can cast UVC and top heals unassisted, you can switch your implants to more physical attributes and focus on that. But you have a long long way to go.<br>
<br>
Stay away from weapons. MA weapons in general are worthless, I know several MAs in their 190s-200, that are resetting their piercing skills and geting rid of the claw. The 2 reasons are that you cant use specials with them, and they very significantly bring down the attack rating, and they simply cant hit things like they do with fists.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope this helps a bit.<br>

<br>
For the most part, I agree with the folks who've posted above, but here are some considerations:<br>
<br>
If you have a doc in your regular group, body dev can lag a little.  If you have an MP in your regular group, casting skills can lag a little.  If you tend to tank, evades/body dev/phys init become a lot more important as does psy mod.<br>
<br>
There are all kinds of diferent setups that will work.  Generally though, if you:<br>
stick to fists &lt;100<br>
keep your MA/Brawl maxed<br>
keep 2 stats maxed for armor<br>
keep Int maxed for casting skills<br>
keep Treatment maxed for the best possible implants<br>
keep casting skills high enough to use reasonable buffs/heals (NOT MatCrea or MatMet...maybe &gt; 150 on those)<br>
<br>
Then you should be fine.  You can assign your own importance to Evades, Comp Lit, Parry, etc.  They are all important, but which is the 'most' important depends on your own playstyle, etc.<br>

PS.  I disagree on the claw thing, but that may be because I've been using a 200 claw.  If I were 200 using a 200 claw, the tale might be a bit different, ehhe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrimhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 342<br> <font color=#660000>(7/10/02 2:03:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2059.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hi</span><hr size=1> If you are gonna primarily solo (which is what I do), then you need to make sure you have plenty of NCU slots for buffs (I use a 5 slot belt and have 172 NCUs), good armor (if a piece of armor gets less than 10 lvls above my own lvl, then my next mission is an armor mission), and the highest lvl med/first aid kits you can use (make sure you have plenty of charges in each).<br>
<br>
My primary skills at lvl 69 are as follows:<br>
<br>
MA (524 fully buffed and ql 90 implants...abit low cause I<br>
      don't max it every lvl)<br>
Brawl (around 475)<br>
Bio Met (around 350...I use Healing Aura)<br>
Sense Imp (same as Bio Met)<br>
Phys Int (350ish)<br>
Parry (370ish)<br>
Comp Lit (260....plus I have Comp Lit Exp and multiple <br>
             switchable implants that I use to raise it when <br>
             needed)<br>
All evades except Duck Exp are about 250 (buffed)<br>
All ability skills are over 200 with the highest being str, agil,<br>
    Psy, and Int<br>
All Nano and Aiding skills are over 250 (except Mat Met which<br>
    is 110 just so I can use Muscle Stim)<br>
Vehc Air is around 250; high enough for me to use a ql 70 <br>
    Yamaha (which saves me from alot of hostile encounters<br>
     on the ground and gives nice run speed boost)<br>
Run speed around 240 buffed, 540 with plane<br>
<br>
The normal buffs I run are as follows:<br>
Greater Wooden Skin<br>
Sub Guide (of course no self respecting MA would be without <br>
   it)<br>
MA Mastery, MA Exp, and Lesser controlled Rage<br>
Brawl Exp, Dirty Fighter<br>
All +12 ability buffs<br>
Quickness, Velocity (has saved me arse many times in <br>
   missions)<br>
Break and entering Exp (only because I hate standing 5 mins <br>
   in front of a chest trying to open it)<br>
Elusive Target<br>
Sadness of the Willow<br>
Alternate general nano and aiding buffs as needed to <br>
   supplement areas where I lag<br>
<br>
<br>
Not everyone will agree with the above stats for an optimal solo MA, but I can usually take missions set at 75% on difficulty slider and that is good enough for me. Also as a rule of thumb I rarely do a mission in an area that I don't have a map uploaded...I hate not seeing what's around the corner so to speak.<br>
<br>
Well this turned out to be longer than I expected, but hope it helps put things into perspective.<br>

<br>
Phys init soesnt have to be more then 150, if you have aggro at full aggressive. You wont hit any faster anyway, since there is a limit on attacks/minute. If you use a claw (and I suggest you do) your init has to be 300 to max the attack speed of both hands and claw.<br>
<br>
MA skill should ALWAYS be maxxed out, since that is the skill that determins our attack rating and damage.<br>
<br>
Dimache is practicly worthless if you dont go pvp. The recharge is too slow to be worth the ip cost.<br>
<br>
Matter creation is also a waste since the ac buffs are more or less worthless. It will go up as you raise intelligence and that is enough.<br>
<br>
Evades are good, but you dont have to max them out until later if you are short on ip, the MA at lvl 20-60 is strong enough anyway.<br>
<br>
Critbuffs is to die for. Without crits we dont do good dmg, so max PS/SI/TS skills for the best critbuffs possible. Also try finding a Scope to use to raise the crit % more (but dont forget to keep phys init at 150).<br>
<br>
Comp lit and treatment is to be maxed always.<br>
<br>
All ip spent in Abilities are well spent. You will have to have them all maxed sooner or later anyway, so its not wasted ip. But sense and psychic can be held back some in the begiining. Strength/agility/stamina/intelligens are more important. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=blade>Blade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#660000>(7/11/02 2:17:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2059.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to spend IP!</span><hr size=1> i disagree in some points with both of you.<br>

1. yes as devil said you Must max ma skill espessially if you're soloing a lot<br>
2. forget dark blue skills at lower lvls, for example mat crea<br>
3. what the hell do you need this +str ma buff? for the whooping +1 dmg? and it dont stuck with better buffs either<br>
4. dont max comp liter, just keep it so high that you can get good ql NCU's in. for example ive got 400 base comp liter and i could get ql 200 NCU's in(ive got the 1k board)<br>
5. Are you joking? ql 70 yalm? hello? 250 points in dark blue skill? <br>
   some points about yalm. first of all they are all bugged and fly at highest game speed so 5k speed. the listet +runspeed... just think about it... do you run during flying? dont think so.<br>
get yourself the lowest ql possible (ql 30 is not so hard to find and you'll see ql 40 very often) drop the skill and get yourself an implant, for example shining eye slot.<br>

The reason I raise my Phys Int so high is to be able to reduce my aggr/defence bar to avoid being critted so much. Keep in mind that Phys Int is heavily implanted, so not all of it is IP related. I'm slowly catching up on my MA skill and it should be maxed in the next couple of levels, same with brawl. My evades are hardly maxed, and I usually only raise them 4 or 5 points a lvl anyway. I do have to look into the requirements for the next crit buff, so may spend IPs/implant as needed there. Comp Lit and Treatment are not maxed, but I have enough spare implants to usually get what I need when I need it.<br>
<br>
Blade, the Yamaha is one I picked up in a mission and I use it because I don't have spare millions to go buy another one (although I didn't know about the flying/running bug). Again my Vehc Air skill is implanted so not all skill points are IP based. I figure I can rework that skill as I level up. As Veldrane said the IPs I put into MM to raise it to 110 in order to use muscle stim are not that many, and since I have no plans to raise that skill in the immediate future, it's worth it (to me) for getting into armor and the small MA boost that I get from it. Also Nano restoration and Regeneration (that also rely on that skill) allows me to sit in front of of the reclaim booth and regain most of my health and nano while I bang my head on the keyboard without using nano kits and med kits.<br>
<br>
<br>
It all boils down to play style I guess. I don't have a time limit on reaching lvl 200, and since I usually only have enough time to do one mission in a single sitting I'm not getting there fast. That's one advantage of going primarily solo.....I don't have to keep up with the Jones'. That's why I hated EQ: you had to group (esp if you were melee) and if you were time strapped all your grouping buddies passed you by quickly. Besides, I just returned to the game and am still learning how it all works again.<br>

I'm a few levels higher and run ql110 implants, but still basically the same. I primarily solo, or duo with another MA. <br>
<br>
I run 350 phys init myself. I usually run at 80% agg/def. My evades aren't maxed (though highish) and they need all the help they can get. Additionally, I'm going claw in the next level or two and need the phys init for that particular toy. I'll keep raising it, too, as IP permits for even more def on the slider. <br>
<br>
As for vehicle air, it's ridiculously easy to implant. The shining and bright spots have little use (aside from nav, for which I have separate implants) and with ql110s I have about 170ish in air. I do have a ql32 Yalm, but made the implants before I got it. Eventually, my natural progression in air will enable me to equip my Yalm without any help, but like I said, I had no idea what I'd end up with. I got lucky. Not all are. <br>
<br>
I've said it before, and I'll say it even more bluntly: you're an idiot if you ignore mat crea. Eventually, you're going to need every single AC you can get. Mat crea allows more ACs, so it's good. Ignore at your peril. Maybe you have an engie grafted to your butt, but I don't. I wouldn't obsess over this if IP is tight, but a few dark blue skills aren't going to kill you. <br>
<br>
I'd treat mat mett in a similar vein. It's hardly a make-or-break skill, but there are some useful nanos. I've been loathe to push this one past 110 before level 100, but I'm planning to once IP frees up later on. AC is AC and Horde and Cohort look entertaining (which is what it's all about anyway). <br>
<br>
Before 100 the big one is getting Vulnerability Seeker. I've had some stat repairs to make since I switched to a new implant strategy (and found a decent claw), but this one is definately on the front burner. VS by 100...95 if I can manage it! <br>

They add + whatever to your dmg output (exp: Wind Blown Blossom adds +43 to all dmg modifiers) for a short amount of time (around a minute I think). Downside is that they lock all nano casting abilities for 15 sec (20 secs for higher lvl ones). No heals for 15 secs, which if you engage a hard hitting foe can hurt a hell of alot. Most ppl cast the nano and wait for about 5-10 secs before attacking....additionally I always use a simple nano kit to boost my nano to almost full. These nanos use Bio Met and Sense Imp for thier requirements, so if you are raising those 2 very important skills like you should be then you will always be in-line for an upgrade as your lvl permits.<br>

<br>
Early on, the controlled destruction line is extremely effective. When I first made my MA (primary), they were practically useless. I remember when I first used Crash of Thunder. Nano shutdown was hella long and about got me killed. In contrast, after the fix my nano-MA (secondary MA) would crush everything in her level teen-twenty path with it. <br>
<br>
Main problem with them later on is that they don't scale particularily well. When you're hitting for 1200, +57 isn't all that. It helps, but it's not a huge increase in damage output. It's useful on mobs that have to die as quickly as possible, but the tradeoff is the nano cost. If you have a small nano pool, they might not be worth using if it costs you 1/4 to 1/3 of your nano. You'd most likely be better off just using your heals.  <br>
<br>
You'll get them regardless if you're spending IP for heals (hint hint), so it's up to you which ones to use or even bother to buy/look for. <br>

Hawk, I'm sorry if I offended you, that was not my intention. I only meant that in my opinion you had some messed up stats, not that your character is messed up as such. I don't agree with the improtance of lowering aggro, as far as I have found out it will also lower your own crit chance, but if that is what you want, go for it. I still think that MA skill is the most improtant skill, and that you should max it at any cost.<br>
<br>
MC skill will give you some small ac buffs early on, but they dont improve very much when being raised. So before level 130 or so (until then you wil be very hard pressed for ip) dont put to much into it, there are better ways to spend ip.<br>
<br>
Dont fret over having a high lvl Yalmaha. Its not a problem.. sooner or later creds will roll in faster than you can spend them, and by then you can ip-reset the skill and get that &quot;wasted&quot; ip back. Its better to use that Yalmaha early on if you couldn't afford buying one.<br>
<br>
Again, Im sorry if I upset you... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrimhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 346<br> <font color=#660000>(7/12/02 5:07:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2059.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Controlled destruction nanos</span><hr size=1> Not offended at all my man.
