This could be solved by giving a skill at say level 40 or possibly 51. The skill would be called prayer which would go up just like meditation, this skill would increase the mana regain rate while sitting. My thoughts on the rate are 50% faster then other class meditation. Also standing meditation is also a very desirable solution for a few reasons. One reason being clerics are plate classes and as I have always known from D&amp;D and books that clerics aren't only healers but better then a mediocre combatant. The other reason would be as stated by several others not having to sit is a reward from our gods for the accomplishments and trials we have gone through, maybe a skill to be given at level 51 through training just as any other skill is.<br><br>Shamans already have a way of regaining mana faster through there cannabalize line of spells, I think druid should also have a spell or skill to regain mana, this spell I would propose would be natures harvest, very similiar to a wizards spell, but it could only be used outdoors.<br><br>2) Clerics are plate classes and justly deserve the ablilities that intail with that. Cleric defense and dodge ability is definitely capped too low. For being a plate class clerics sure do take a swift beating when otherwise a warrior or other melee class sould take a hit. I however DO NOT think that parry is a skill that should be given to clerics, if dodge and defense are capped to an appropriate level then clerics will be able to take those hits that they can't now.<br><br>Melee skills also go along with being a plate class if I am not mistaken. I think that there should be an increases cap on cleric blunt skills, they have throughout there whole careers just used blunt weapons be it one handed or two handed and there skill cap should reflect that. Adding offensive skill cap slightly may be stretching it, but when you imagine a cleric in a fight scene, do you really imagine him/her sitting down between heals. I wouldn't be. I would cast my spell and charge into battle.<br><br>Clerics have shields, why I ask. I definitely don't think for looks. Clerics are very active in stun based attacks and should not be limited to the casting of a spell, however this skill should be given to them with an increased time to re-use the skill perhaps by an added 2 or 3 second interval.<br><br>Melee skills and defensive skills are a great idea for clerics for a few reasons, smart clerics will not use them against big mobs unless they want to die. When you are traveling through an area and you are low on mana do you really think that a level 25 frog in guk should be able to kill you, thats extremely absurd. Clerics should definitely have increased skills to defend themselves from at least green mobs, if not more geared to directing there skills to me moderately helpful in a combat situation. Double attack by all means is not also a possibilty when it comes to a heavily armored defender of righteousness.<br><br>3) Cleric weapons are a joke, aside from the first one when you come across your first wisp and your FS weapon just won't cut it. Cleric weapons damage and delay as far as I recall are fine, then again I don't use them due to the lack of usefullness. To fix this problem an undead proc may be added to the weapons and/or a wisdom/mana enhancement. Cleric pets are a weapon if you will and they are a total joke, make this thing have skills equivalent to a level say 40 enchater pet, though it is level 54, maybe give the pet a shield and the bash skill or perhaps a stun spell. If the pet didn't dissapear after one fight I would even use it, this also would help clerics from getting killed by green mobs. The mana cost is way to high even if my chances were to be implimented, say perhaps 500mana component peridot to cast and it stays around, thats not that big of a deal is it? Of course this pet can't be controlled and is much like an enchanter pet, but making it low level and all the rest would make up for the abilities it could be given.<br><br>4) Many cleric hitpoint and armor class buffs at higher levels are very out of place. A group armor class buff would be nice instead of a very rarely used spell fortitude. A group Aegeolism spell is a great idea im my opinion and maybe you could make it take 2 peridots to cast to make up for the usefullness and make the spell mana efficenient. I do enjoy what I have currently, but it truly bugs me to have high level spells im my book that I can't bring myself to use do to effectiveness. The armor class buffs should reflect more ac for the amount of extra mana we put into them, so either raise the ac on these buffs or lower the mana cost.<br><br>5) A novelty on the self only cleric invis idea. Give them self only invis and call it heavenly blessing of something to that effect. Clerics go through hell trying to get to somewhere important and not having invis to get there. Some great examples are risking life and limb in the Over There trying to get to Howling Stones past the scorpions. Doing corpses recoveries in an area where anyone with invis could do the job, but not being able to because you dont have the melee skills and time to med between soloing each green to get to the corpses.<br><br>6) Every class should have a defining characteristic. Healing, no, shamans and druids have the healing capabilities of a cleric now, minus complete heal. Ressurection, no, again a great spell line has been past to another class, which for roleplaying is a great idea. would standing and still getting to med be a good enough example of the ability the gods give to a cleric, if it is not too overpowering and meets the roleplaying experience like many believe then this could define a cleric. Because of the casting time of there DD's this skill would not be abusive. This skill would also change the the clerics overall view of combat, they could essentially be partially effective in melee as well as still regaining the mana they need to keep the group alive.<br><br>7) Clerics are supposed to be fighting undead when they are encountered not just healing there party, and up until a certain point clerics do nuke with there undead DD'd, but at a higher point past 49 it is virtually ineffective to use those spells, I think clerics should have a spell similar to a wizards Ice Comet, but not so great, maybe something along the lines of 1,00 damage at level 56 at about the casting cost of say 325 or 350.<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  An idea of a group resistant buff or possible self only stackable with other resistance. This buff could give say 15 sv all, and have self only or a group buff, would make for a great spell, this though may be a good spell to look into giving all priest classes.<br><br>9) Divine Aura line of spells is helpful, however the roleplaying aspect of it is supposed ot make it so you can get out of harms way correct me if I'm wrong, healing spells should effect you while under this divine aura, whether by others or yourself, or perhaps even let the gate command be used during this time period, you can still get bashed or stunned while in this mode and it should'nt make it unbalancing.<br><br>10) I appreciate the time you guys put into this, and any feedback would be loved. Keep up the good work and I really hope to see other people submit ideas, that they would think to enhance roleplaying and the 'fun factor' and not just trying to get there class more powerful then others.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utyvenn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tyvenn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Baby Seal</span><br>  Posts: 493<br> <font color=#333333>(5/3/02 3:48:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=872.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.broadpark.no/~bsvenhe/tyvimg.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Written by triple A.</span><hr size=1> I dont think anyone will read all of that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=71015"><img src="http://www.aladaria.com/Tyvennsig.jpg"></a><BR><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/urealbollix.showPublicProfile?language=EN>realbollix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(5/3/02 4:22:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=872.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Written by triple A.</span><hr size=1> i read up to the bit where it said that clerics had basically the same healing power as shaman and druids, and that clerics should get better atk weapons, and they should be out hitting things, not sitting on their buts medding.<br>Here is my response to any clerics that do that ...<br>/disband <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ukwaij.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kwaij</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 183<br> <font color=#333333>(5/3/02 9:14:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=872.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Written by triple A.</span><hr size=1> Heh i kinda skimmed over it, general ide seems to let the cleric be a warrior/tank/wizard vs undeads at least, wtf have this guy been smokeing? shm/dru get the same healing? lol<br><br>-Kwaij <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ualvereoftunare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alvere of Tunare</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://communities.msn.com/Alvere/shoebox.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&PhotoID=48" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(5/3/02 10:17:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=872.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Written by triple A.</span><hr size=1> it ties in together u just have to sit here and read it. not that i agree with it i just said i'd post it =p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utaranna.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taranna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(5/3/02 11:29:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=872.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Written by triple A.</span><hr size=1> 1) It's fine as is...we get Blessed Armor + the option of mental clarity, any other changes will break the balance of the game.  Shamans do get canni + torpor, but this is balanced by their not being a plate class, and not being able to use that mana to heal as efficiently as a cleric.  Not to mention that the majority of the best cleric spells are vendor-bought, and shamans have to hunt for their best ones a fair old bit.<br><br>2) We already have two of the best emergency spells in game, DA and DB- that plus being a plate class is more than enough imho.  Even if melee caps for 1hB were increased I don't think you'd find many clerics meleeing, it's more efficient to just root/nuke.  Or use our superefficient dot vs. undead.<br><br>3)  As for undead proc, that weapon exists, it's called the dawnfire, nice toy for playing in crypt in OS or in HS for example.  Pets for clerics are a joke, but clerics are not meant to be damage dealers.<br><br>4) This was obviously written before Blessing of Aego came into the game, a good change which moved clerics away from the tedium of buffing that shamans still suffer.<br><br>5) We have numerous items that we can use to invis- larrikan's mask, potions, gnomish invis devices.  And if invis breaks, just DB /ooc the train and run it.  Casters get invis because they're more fragile, druids &amp; shamans don't get itu.  With improved itu, a cleric is often a great corpse-dragger in deadside of lguk for example- not to mention that most keyed dungeons are largely full of see-invis mobs.  Also, there is an overwhelming perception by many that clerics are the best healers for every situation, everyone wants one even when we aren't really needed.<br><br>6)  CH is arguably the most powerful spell in game.  It's true that shamans are more valuable in xp areas, because of slow, canni, torpor, debuffs etc.  But in challenging areas where mobs cannot be slowed, harmtouch etc, a cleric is almost essential.  Not to mention that in terms of raids, clerics often make or break a raid's success.<br><br>7)  We have an amazing undead-only dot, and judgement, and can actually solo half-decently in the right areas.  <br><br>8 ) Druids have seasons, shamans have shadoo, and we get individual buffs for all resists- mages have elemental blankets they can summon, chanters have GMR.  Every spell-class has some form of resist buff, that seems fine.<br><br>9) Heh, any idea how unbalanced this would be in pvp?  Versus anything but manaburn it makes it impossible to kill a cleric, it's hard enough as it is.  <br><br>Other classes being able to heal/rez is intentional- VI want to encourage grouping, but don't want to give one class a set of abilities that makes them indispensable.  If you only gave clerics rezzes, if you gave only them the best small heals, that would make them indispensable in certain areas, just as if you only gave slow to shamans.  As it is, clerics are the only choice for primary healer in an AE group for example, WoV/WoR plus remedy/elixir make having one essential.  <br><br>I'm sure whoever wrote that meant well, but those changes would by in large break the class.  Not to say there aren't things that can be improved (/wave CH bug, /wave crap AA abilities), but overall there isn't a whole lot to gripe about that is class-specific. <p>Taranna Dhossarim60th Cleric</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=872.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showNextMessage?topicID=872.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=872.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.threadControl?topicID=872.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=872.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=872.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Paladins<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Gimp's Gallery</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3>Public Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
