With respect to grouping this is definitely the way to lvl horribly fast. I made three lvls in one day! The way I play is to group for about three or four lvls then do missions for about 2 lvls. That way my loot ie: credits and armour keep up with my lvl  or so to speak... Works for me! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=konami>Konami</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#660000>(7/10/01 11:04:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lucky you.</span><hr size=1> God I'm sick and tired of hearing how people can play for hours on end.
