Like Trox need an extra boost to damage ability... fuck'n-A do these pricks at FC only play certain breeds?!   I'd be pissed it was 'frocer only, but it would have made sense, but limiting to trox?!? jesus christ.... so a Trox MA can now not only just plain muscle more damage they get an extra beny in the form another special that takes NOTHING&lt; no ammo, no nano, no NOTHING &gt; to use ever 5 seconds.... now lets think a ql 50 is highly equipable, so... trox of all professions need an extra 1500 damage per minute... cause obviously they just suck so bad. <br><br>The thing that pisses me off most about this, it's aimed primarily at enforcers.   THE class that has the LEAST issues, THE class that occording to FC GM's can solo the longest.  THey need this WHY!?

Not changed, not reworked. REmoved.<br><br>Why? I don't see any other breed more spoiled by FC's favoratism than the Atrox. Why not just tell the other enforcers that DO bother to spend the points to actually hold Agg to just jump of a cliff and reroll?<br><br>Da Taunter is OVER balanced, it has the range of a rifle does ql in damage, requires next to now psychology to use ( like 36 for a ql 122 ), and uses a NANO skill that ALL enforcers carry any way. So doing one that's near your level is very doable, let's consider this a moment, are you at FC saying that ATROX and atrox only, should be entitled to 200 points of nano free damage with rifle ranges every 5 seconds just because they are atrox? This is extreme yes, not every atrox is 200, and thank god for it, be a boring world.<br><br>At level 100, that is approximately 3000 more damage a minute. As a MA, the supposed damage masters of damage over time, I'm disgusted by this. This takes no nano, my special attacks to. This uses a VERY hard to abate damage type ( radiation ), my special attacks don't. This item requires no extra skills to use, as bio met is carried by the magority of professions. My speciall attacks take HUGE ip in skills rarely used for any other reason.<br><br>I fail to see why a trox MA is entitled to do 3k more per minute then me.<br><br><br>Thanks for the time. Please will guys stop and think prior to putting this stuff in game?<br><br>Trox have more hit point's, they hit harder in melee due to stats, and now they get an even bigger edge??????<br><br>This is stupid, did any of you consider what happens when this item isn't used ONLY by enforecers? for that matter ALL enforcers pay the SAME skill points for EVEYRTHING but stats, so why are trox being given an even bigger edge of every other breed of enforcer who all pay the same cost for a psychology skill??<br><br><br><br><br>In Reponse to some saying that the damage from the item is trivial ( a drop in the bucket ):<br><br>Facts about your drop in the bucket:<br>1) Blessed with Thunder - Martial Artist Special attack, best attack of MA specials for damage over time.<br><br>ql 125 does ~ 3100 hps per min +/- 290 hps based on player timing ( sometimes you can stack the DoT sometimes you can't ). Adds a melee only damage sheild that goes from 0 to 20 points ( it doesn't always trigger )<br><br>2) Da Taunter - ql 125 does 1500 hps per min ( edit! bad math on the original post thanks Bg for the catch on that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>3) BwT - as a MA attack requires no weapon be equiped to use it, even &quot;MA&quot; weapons, No Drop &amp; Unique, Over Equiping is not possible for the attack or weapon usage if you intend to use this attack.<br><br>4) Da Taunter - normal item, no restrictions on drops status, or on number of item in inventory. Overequiping weapons is a none issue with this item, they do not interact. Must have skill to use the item of use as with BwT.<br><br>5) BwT - nano requirement ~ every 40 seconds ( slightly less if stacking ) to keep it's damage going<br><br>6) Da Taunter - No Nano Req.<br><br>7) BwT - Range 1 meter<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Da Taunter - Range 80 meters ( max range )<br><br>9) BwT - requires two skills at high levels ( in this expample about 500 in both skills ) Brawl and Parry. Parry is of dubious use and generally only raised to use this specific attack.<br><br>10) Da Taunter - requires 2 skills, one at default levels ( ie no need to spend IP in the skill at all ), and one at about 500. Psychology ( requirement is stupidly low if you don't have it from base stats you can get it with prof or expert in psych. ), and Bio Met, a commonly needed skill for professions nano's. Certainly not something you have to go out of your way to attain.<br><br>11) BwT - FC has stated that this attack is over powered and WILL be nerfed at some point on 2 sperate occasions, once on the boards and once in an up coming patch message ( it is my sincere hope they have reconsidered ).<br><br>12) Da Taunter - Does 50% of the damage BwT does over time, is limited to 1 breed ( not to profession ), and was implamented in the 13.6 patch.<br><br>Note: BwT and Da Taunter CAN be used togather.<br><br>Result? In PvE Atrox are being give an attack ( yes it's an attack, so generates agg, that has no bearing on the damage it does ) that does about 50% of the damage of the the best PvE MA special attack. In PvP Atrox are being given the equal to 50% of the second best PvP MA special attack, and with a damage type ( radiation ) that's harder to defend against.<br><br>Now let's consider profession / breed balance: something that does MORE damage the the MA's best damage over time Special just got given to every Atrox. It got given to Atrox MA's too. This throws game balance out the window. ( No i do not include Shen in this because for damage over time BwT does more damage over time in the long run with Shen's 15 minute recycle timer, Shen is a PvP attack or a pull your fat ouf the fire, it's not usefull for steady consistant damage ).<br><br>FACT: Da Taunter is over powered. It gives a superior damage ability to every Atrox profession in AO that is unmatched by any other breed. I Realize that to pet using nuking classes it may not seem to be the case, but when you look at this from the non-pet using, non-nuking side of the game this item is highly unbalanced.<br><br><br>The only way to balance this item: Auto Doc: heals 1 hps per 2 ql ever 5 seconds, treatment ( the high skill ) &amp; psych ( the low default score ). Breeds: all but atrox.<br><br>Alternately... Da Taunter needs to be removed from game.<br><br><br><br>Fighting the Fight to beat sense into FC ( a company apparently run by Atrox ).<br><br>Cheetarr<br>CheeChee reseach institute, RK, with branch offices on RK-2!<br>&quot;If it's research and it doesn't say CheeChee... it probably says 'checked by Nutbar' &quot;<br> <p><BR>Tigerwhite<BR>"Tigerwhite burning bright"</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uautumndawnfire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Autumn Dawnfire</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.melanierawn.com/images/bunnie.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/12/02 10:42:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uviirruss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Viirruss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#660000>(2/11/02 5:33:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1645.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bitch Session: Da Taunter.</span><hr size=1> BUMP^ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uautumndawnfire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Autumn Dawnfire</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.melanierawn.com/images/bunnie.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#660000>(2/12/02 10:40:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1645.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bitch Session: Da Taunter.</span><hr size=1> reissuing the statment's in my calm post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  my math was off, so i've corrected to reflect that. <p><http://www.anarchy-online.com/character/photos/40240.jpg><BR>Tigerwhite<BR>"Tigerwhite burning bright"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uviirruss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Viirruss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#660000>(2/13/02 10:28:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1645.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bitch Session: Da Taunter.</span><hr size=1> I am wondering if this device really works as it claims it does, the one I saw today said it took: Utils3 Deck1 Deck2 Deck4 Deck5.
