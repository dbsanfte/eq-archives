<br>
I was in Everswarm.  I think after and during everswarm I led a raid sect called Reverant.  I made Shadow of the Swarm which was mostly a guild version of Reverant.  I left Shadow of the Swarm and then I quit for a few months due to burnout, and real life issues, and things.  I think in this time SC came about?  When I came back from my break the first thing I did was app to MiM because I had alot of old friends there.  After about a month I was approached by many old Sots to reform the guild, so I did.  I wasnt looking to lead  but was asked too so I did.  Rev didn't work out for many reasons, mostly my burnout.  After that I played Planetside exclusively, for maybe a month and I came back to EQ and inquired to my friends how to app to AD, then I talked to people first to see if I could have people's blessings and then app'd.   I think this is over like 2 years?  So my timeline might be out of order.  It was my thought that SC turned into Eximos? didn't it? and Eximos turned into DoZ?  I hope this answers your question.   I may be wrong though, but I never lead any sort of coup, I have never had too I have always had people who would be willing to follow me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ghouldanrz>GhouldanRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#333333>(7/11/03 8:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=519.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: no more liqour</span><hr size=1> EverSwarm member 2000-02-22 23:24:39 <br>
I went to Adept's site and I got confused Shadow of the Swarm and Swarm of Fear.  Apparently I was in SC for a bit I don't really remeber it.  I made Sots afterwards.  I don't think I did a coup... Aaaron lead SC, if I couped it I dont think he would have been on good enough terms to join SotS.  I am sure when I made Sots that people left SC for sots like old Swarm of Fear.  I wouldn't say thats a coup, I would say thats just loyality.   SC existed after sots.  And SC evolved into Eximos didn't it?<br>

Appearanty the &quot;no more liqour(sp)&quot; subject heading should be directed at you, not Edagon.  Remember much?<br>
<br>
Anyways, I'll put in my impression of Ghouldan from the limited dealings I had with him.  Just as Edagon said, he seems to be a GREAT guy if you are in his inner circle.  If you are not, go to hell.  When I first moved over to RZ, Ghouldan and friends were kind enough to invite me on a few raids to pick up some rotting loots.  I was even offered a couple of Skyshrine MQs.  However, when Ghouldan learned I was an AD applicant, I was told the MQs had been sold or something and I was no longer asked along on raids EXCEPT when they had no DPS.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my next point.  I can't remember when it was or who it was, but we (a few AD and a few peeps from some other guild I can't remember the name of) were killing Vindi when some Reverant gave me a tell saying that we should not be helping that guild cause they should not get Vindi loots if they can't handle it themselves.  I shrugged it off.  The next day, I get a tell from Ghouldan AND the very same person who had given me a tell the day before asking if I would help them with the Cursed cause they were low on DPS.  Hypocrisy anyone?<br>
<br>
To sum up my impressions: Ghouldan is the greatest guy in the world ... if you are in his inner circle of friends.  He will work VERY hard and get you loot ... if you are in his inner circle.  His hard work and dertermination reward him with the highest loyalty ... if you are in his inner circle.  If you are not in that inner circle, kindly get the fuck out of my sight.<br>

<br>
Ghouldan is a very good at playing his class and leading raids, and perhaps one of the best SK pullers on RZ, and his dedication to his guild is unquestionable.<br>
<br>
When it came to dealing with Ghouldan as an officer in a guild 'competing' for the same content, I had more headaches than I care to remember - and we had each other on ignore for a very long time.<br>
<br>
He had huge issues with SoD receiving help from friends, but would have no problem receiving critical help from his own friends - and I think Rehoboam is pretty spot on, Ghouldan is a good guy as long as you are working alongside him.<br>
<br>
I do think the way he acted though was in what he considered 'his guilds' best interest, but all the same it was very very frustrating to be on the end of, because while looking out for the best for his guild, he had no qualms about stepping on everyone who got in his way.<br>
<br>
That said - me and Ghouldan butted heads forvery long time, and I think the fact that we were doing the same mobs Rev was doing with outside help infuriated Ghouldan and as such my assesment is pretty biased, but I tried to be as objective as I could.<br>

<br>
I was just reading over some of these comments, and it looks like the only criticism posted is regarding Ghouldan's leadership.  (I doubt my word accounts for much, but I personally thought he was a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>great</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> leader). His leadership facets aren't really relevant imo anyway because he's applying for &quot;membership&quot;, and even those who criticized his &quot;leadership&quot; abilities agreed that he's a very skilled player.<br>

<br>
(Sarcasm on)<br>
 <br>
Ghouldan hooked me up with loot in ToV - not knowing me or having anything to gain.  Not part of any &quot;inner circle&quot; just a nice hell of a guy that was helping me with nothing to gain.<br>
<br>
Ghouldan came to learn that I could get loot easily through channels broader than him (AD) and wanted to make sure the stuff went to people that would likely need to use the stuff, rather than give *more* of it to a guy who would improve those loots tenfold in the next 3-5 months in lieu of people who could and would legitimately use that longer term.<br>
<br>
I still got loot since I server transferred naked and Ghouldan helped me a lot to initially gear myself with nothing to gain.<br>
<br>
I was asked to respect guild's mob tier capabilities and not participate in farming items from guild's that then encroached on other guild's higher tier capabilities.  I realize that Ghouldan was representing his guild's interests here; this is about a leader not an individual player.  I have no point.  Actually, in retrospect, this wasn't even Ghouldan saying this.  This was Dupre or someone else.  But I will imply it was Ghouldan - it adds drama.<br>
<br>
Ghouldan, knowing I was upset my free loot train was cut off (hi, ToV) decided to allow me to help him on Cursed to make me feel better.  Since I was upset I could no longer get ToV loot, at least offering to let me help on *improved* loot (hi, Cursed) should make things better for me right?  I declined (hi, hypocrisy) though.  I mean on one hand I am upset I no longer get ToV stuff; so having a chance at Cursed should be wonderful since that is better, right?  (hi, damned if you do, damned if you don't).<br>
<br>
<br>
To sum up my impressions, he hooked me up even though I am out of his &quot;inner circle&quot;, tried to make sure loot went to really the neediest people, and still offered to let me help on other stuff (Cursed) to further improve my gear.  Oh yeah, some people in his guild asked me to not help lower tier guilds compete on their interests but I will tag that to be his words since he needs to be responsible for 75 people's comments to the server via tells, even after the dissolution of his guild.<br>
<br>
(Sarcasm off)<br>
<br>
I fail to see how this information is relevant to his application as an individual simply asking for a chance to prove himself - his attitude, talents, skill, personality, and dedication.  I see this as some salt in the drama stew.  Please, let's focus on his benefit or detriment to AD as a recruit.  My thoughts on not liking that he has a cat instead of a dog or he eats oatmeal instead of cereal is really irrelevant.<br>
<br>
How was his skill on the raid?  Was he a good puller?  Did he stay focused on the raid?  Did he seem knowledgeable on the zone and tactics?  Did he have a positive attitude?  Was the raid well organized?  Did he contribute to the raid success?<br>
<br>
Much better stuff to feedback on regarding his ability to be a successful recruit huh?<br>
<br>

I'll summarize this in 2 sentences...<br>
<br>
&quot;Ghouldan is damn good at playing his class. But he's a dipshit to anyone outside his inner circle of friends/guildmates.&quot;<br>
<br>
What's &quot;inner circle&quot; mean? I remember a time I brought up the topic of Reverant in the AD recruit channel and the only people who had <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> good to say about them were ex-Reverant. That's &quot;inner circle.&quot;<br>

In a way, I'm insulted that someone who treated my old guild like such shit is now attempting to join another guild of which I'm now a member. It's a big conflict for me, personally, because if he becomes an AD recruit I'll become one of his &quot;inner circle&quot; as Rehoboam refers to and he'll be nice to me...<br>
<br>
...The question is, do I *want* to be a member of his &quot;inner circle&quot; nice guy facade? I don't know the answer to that question, but you can guess which way I'm leaning. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 7/11/03 1:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=laney7>Laney7</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.coasterforce.f2s.com/phpBB/images/croft1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#333333>(7/11/03 3:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=519.topic&index=31>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.coasterforce.f2s.com/phpBB/images/croft1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My thoughts</span><hr size=1> I'm sure the majority of guilds have members that were once at odds with each other because at one point at time they were competing against each other for mobs/loots etc...but now they're on the same side. <br>
<br>
Everyone is so quick to judge when a former guildleader apps for a new guild.  Ghouldan is a very determined individual and as gl for Reverant, he only wanted the best for his guild...and for Rev to succeed.  Just like you w/ Revered, Morb.  I don't see the relevance of his leadership attributes and/or public relations with other guilds as the &quot;leader&quot; of Reverant and his application for &quot;membership&quot; to AD.  It's like comparing apples to oranges.<br>
<br>
Ghouldan is a damn good puller, raid leader, pvpr, tank...you name it.  As for this *inner circle* that everyone seems to be talking about.  I've been guilded with Ghouldan a few times.  Yes, Ghouldan has his circle of close friends...just like any of us do...but he was always fair across the board.  From what I had seen anyways.<br>
<br>
I hope you all do give Ghouldan a fair shake on his application and can put the past behind you.  Just like I'm sure you have done with some of the members you're currently guilded with now.  Look at his qualities as a potential member of AD...not as a former guildleader of Reverant.<br>
<br>

Morb, I don't know what your problem is, but you do not OWN AD.  You're lucky they took you as a member.  While I wouldn't wanna be in a guild that would allow someone who badmouthed Reverant so much in, I don't blame Ghouldan for wanting in.  He's 10x the man you'll ever be (I've never seen him on message boards badmouthng a guild only AFTER it broke up), and AD will gain a lot more from his experience than anything you can contribute.<br>
<br>
As for this inner circle shit...when I joined Reverant, I'm pretty sure Ghouldan didn't like me a bit.  But I worked, and proved my value to the guild, and we've ended up being friends.  Ghouldan is one of the people I owe the most to in this game, so don't even TRY to say he doesn't give people a chance. <p>Gnome &gt; all<br>

I personally could go either way with this app but I suggest keeping your attitude consistent as I thought you were a cool guy once then hated you the very next week.

That's &quot;inner circle.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
A better and more simple term would be &quot;friend(s)&quot;.<br>
Yes I have friends, and yes I treat them well and I am extremely loyal to them.  my &quot;inner circle&quot; that is in AD I think would have 0 to benefit from saying anything nice to them.  Since I am not thier leader and am not the ones providing them loots or guiding them to kill mobs, there is no way to compell or force them to say anything they wouldn't want to say.  Thats not inner circle thats friendship.  It's something beyond guildtags and loots from mobs.  <br>
<br>
&quot;inner circle&quot; nice guy facade&lt;-- Facade?<br>
Morb in with all due respect, how do you come off thinking that my friendship is some sort of elaborate facade.  I have known  and stayed in contact with many of these people for 3+ years,  guilded with them or not.  My friendship  is real, I can assure you that, so can any of my inner circle/friends.<br>
<br>
I'm insulted that someone who treated my old guild like such shit is now attempting to join another guild of which I'm now a member. <br>
<br>
I am not sure what to say here Morb.  I dont think you always had this opinion of me.  No, revered certainly expressed no qualms with me when I flagged many for PoV, or when many got thier bot keys in PoS with Reverant, and many got many needed parts.  I don't know at what point I became this evil guy to revered.  Our guilds seemed to get along great with each other, atleast me Qued and Leh did.  I think relationships went bad when Luvvy, Chapelsoth, and Dinliich joined us.  To say that the tensions escalated because of me is false and unfair.  Both sides did thier part to stir the bitterness between both guilds in that mess.<br>

I have been a very loyal member of this guild and any guild I've been in wether it was for short period or not (referring to time spent helping others not myself).  <br>
<br>
There are people that don't want you in this guild bro, should we disband them to let you in?  No.  At least we MAY consider your application and let you prove yourself.  I was not given this kind of treatment from you.  As a matter of fact I never officially even applied to your guild so I didn't give you that chance to deny me you just pretty much made it clear I was not welcome there because 1 person that joined 3 days prior didn't like me?  fuk that tremor is a pos whiny suck mage that never logged in ever in Aurora Borealis so he wouldn't know what I was like and makes rude assumptions like that?  Eisen and I spoke before I left and agreed that he didn't think the guild was gonna get off the ground, so I left.  So did tremor/dmorg.  talk about calling the kettle black...<br>
<br>
all i can hope for with you is that you have changed your attitude since not being a biased leader.  You hurt people when you turn your back on them like that.  I thought you were a friend...<br>
