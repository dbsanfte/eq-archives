Color me shocked.  This is your full reply to the thread hammering TPB on AO Basher, for reference:<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sion, I come to this page a lot because I like the upfront style of the page. Maybe if you wrote just two or three words about each new piece of information you get Sensei would not have a problem. Because you do a good job and truly put a lot of effort into it I think that some might rationalize your talent as some type of conspiracy because they cannot keep up. <br><br>I will continue to visit your page and some whiny little wanker can continue to lob shots at you undeservedly. <br><br>Varzadium ---TheBlackHand (TBA),<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I'll get to that in a second.  After my reply, you posted this:<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Ummmm...it's going to get ugly? I'm not sure why I should go on your message board? <br><br>I wasn't necssarily flaming you Senei, just the situation. Actually, I have never been to your site and don't plan on it. Thanks for your concern for my welfare.....<br><br>I know you love me... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>Actually, Varz, you were necessarily flaming me, not the situation.  I can tell this from a few things:<br><br>(a) You're psycophant-esque kissing Sion's ass without having any clue about the *real* story, which you might have comprehended had you actually bothered reading our site instead of just taking Sion's quote out of context;<br><br>(b) Thought about the issue for a second, in which case you, like most people, would have realized I was flaming Funcom, not Sion or AO Basher, and <br><br>(c) What shot did I lob?  And how the hell would you know, since it was obviously vastly too much effort, before you decided to weigh in with your opinion (which really adds so much enlightenment to the situation) without EVEN GOING TO SEE WHAT THE HELL SION WAS TALKING ABOUT.<br><br>(d) called me a &quot;little wanker,&quot; which is really just pathetic.<br><br>So for the record, let me set you straight about a few things.  One, AO Basher is about as up-front and in-your face as VH-1.  Two, kiss-ass, you flamed me and you obviously know it, so don't play innocent here.  You know as well as I do that you posted that note just to kiss some Basher butt, and believe me, that's how it comes across to everyone else.  <br><br>Three, CBRH was a typo, it's supposed to say &quot;CBRW&quot; and as I promised to explain to you that's short for &quot;cum-burping road-whore,&quot; which is about the grand sum total value of what I think of someone so unbelivably superglued to someone else's ass that they'd stick up for them without knowing (1) them, (2) the facts of the situation and worst of all (3) not really caring that they are an uninformed butt-kissing sheep in a herd of the same.<br><br>Don't just be ignorant, be proud of it, right?!  Varzadium, Holy Defender of the Uninformed But Doesn't Really Care. But you were wrong about the love part, V ... I don't love you, I pity you, for the 5 seconds of my day that you've crossed my mind.  Just like I pity any other blind follower.<br> <br>Love ya, mean it,<br><br>- Sensei<br><br>PS: E, as excited as you usually get at the game, the beer's usually on me no matter what.  You guys have no ideal how cool it is to find a woman who loves hockey.  And defends Sensei Jr. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uthesensei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Sensei</A> at: 12/10/01 2:02:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uvarzadium.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Varzadium</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#660000>(12/10/01 2:06:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=44.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Bestest news journalist ever?....</span><hr size=1> Well, while I didn't quite insinuate that Sion is the best news journalist ever, I did go a bit overboard in my comment.
