Zone outages are different.  I was talking about the main server outages, like the stunt they pulled with the last patch.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, a major part of customer service is delivering a quality product.  I may despise EQ's game model and have little respect for Brad McQ, but at least Verant delivered a quality product within 2 months of release.<br>
<br>
At this point there are so many major bugs in AO that I would be lying if I said it was a quality product.  It's not about &quot;potential&quot;.  Ultima 9 had potential.  BC3000 had potential.  Potential counts for zip when you're dealing with your customers -- customers pay for delivered product.  <br>
<br>
We paid for the whole thing and only 70% has been delivered.<br>
<br>
If that.<br>
<br>
That's crappy customer service.<br>

This is for several reasons:<br>
-/petition is non existent it seems<br>
-their fixes seem to come slow and be poorly planed<br>
-they don't seem have a clear idea of where to go with the game (one could speculate on why) <br>
-they released a game before it was ready, why, $ I would think<br>
All things said, I'm playing more AO then EQ, for now...<br>

<br>
anyone ever read into the Conquest fiasco?  verant sure showed some wise customer service there.  they ban 2 players, suspend the rest and disband the guild BEFORE even parsing the logs to see if they exploited or not.  verant  did a good job in blaming the players for verants uncompleted zone.  <br>
<br>
anyone been following star wars online for the last 6 months?  at first no one could be empire. and there would be multiple planets with a few zones each.  &quot;EQ the wookie years&quot; comes to mind.  now all of a sudden they are changing the game completly and copying AO's formula of rebel and empire and pvp etc etc.  <br>
<br>
irregardless how bugged the game is, the concept is changing the mmorpg world.  <br>
<br>
comparing the bugs in AO now, to EQ now, is an unfair judgement.  EQ is still working on class balance and bugs 2-3 years after initial launch.  sure the servers are stable, but how stable were they in the first month? the second month?  so many people bitch about zoning and disconnects it amazes me, then they list there system specs and its a fucking beast of a comp but they crash every 10 mins while i play for 8 hours on end with my 466 celeron voodoo 3 and 256 megs of ram with a 56k isp connection.  sure the framerate isnt that great in omni e but its a huge difference than it was on june 27th.  <br>
<br>
ive petitioned someone named &quot;Cumbath&quot; and got a response in 20 mins saying they had already changed his name and warned him about name policy etc.  ive petitioned about timewarps and recieved a response within an hour saying we are very sorry, and the team is working hard on fixing this etc.  <br>
<br>
the fact that funcom is willing to listen to players and un-nerf concealment (to some extent) was a welcome suprise.  can you name one time where verant listened to the customers and reversed a nerf or action?  ........hell even AO lets players bitch and moan on the official boards.  on the other hand verant lets you submit a post, then if they think its good enough to be posted (i.e. you have to say things like, Absor will you have my baby, i love you so much, i love the way you fucked my class in the ass post 50, verant is so gooooood to me *huggles and kisses*-- stardreamer ), they will post it.  <br>
<br>
comparing AO and EQ is really apples and oranges.  two different games, two different styles, two different companys.  <br>
<br>
personally i choose to play AO because it doesnt require mass time to do anything (raids in eq were a fucking nightmare)  all classes can solo in AO if they choose to.  (how many of you wizards and druids still shout for hours in seb for a group ?)  pvp aspect of AO gets the adrenaline going once in awhile.  eq had completly un balanced duels.  fair enough tho, soldiers and agents need to be toned down pvp wise (3k+ snipes and full autos insta kill is not right).  but eq's pvp is still unblanced after 2-3 years.  <br>

<br>
On one hand I utterly hated Verant's nazi tendencies toward class issues and balancing. It took them months and months of the player base begging for issues to be looked at before they would finally break down and look at things which needed to be addressed. Their egoism was astounding especially the first year the game was out (pets certainly *do* dual wield, we've tested it extensively... we all remember that don't we?). On the other hand, their strict anti-cheating/exploiting policies were something which I really appreciated especially as a casual gamer who wanted to stay relatively close to the curve.<br>
<br>
Funcom seems to have the reverse problem - they are anxious and ready to listen to the player base about balance issues and class bugs but they seem a bit too lenient on the exploitation and cheating aspects of the game.<br>
<br>
Hopefully they will toughen up on the latter and continue their progress on the former so they can become the company everyone loves to love instead of just another company everyone loves to hate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ufarania.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Farania</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#660000>(8/29/01 1:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sensei's 08.27.01 Poll.</span><hr size=1> I voted definatly NO!<br>

Do you guys ever saw a GM in game ?? I did one time and he talked with the guy in /say. Honestly, a GM who talks in /say has no f** clue about secrets. I dont want that half of the zone can hear my problems. Either you can´t see wich GM is online. This isn´t service at all.<br>
<br>
I can´t understand why peeps still flaming eq/stuff etc. Those guys are doing theire best. I dont care about and so does eq about individuals. I petitioned 2 times in AO and NEVER got a respones. Petition in eq and you´ll get in appr. 30 min a reply. Anyone who tells something different - lies!<br>

I petitioned and NEVER heard from a GM.  NEVER!  A friendly rogue managed to sneak down and retrieve it for me after much fidgeting around for just the right angle, but without his help, I'd have had to flush a lot of time down the drain.  Considering I was piss-poor at making money in EQ, I'd have been set back massively by losing what I'd managed to scrape together and the little bit of banded (I was level 10, don't laugh) I'd bought with some cash another player had given me.  So what little experience I had with VI's customer service didn't exactly thrill me.  What I've heard about the service on the official boards wasn't any better.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, AO seems to be pretty bad about GM response times too.  By all reports, support email is also slow as molasses in January.  They at least try to keep players up to date on what's going on, but they have so far had mixed success with it.  The biggest points for Funcom's customer service is that they WILL respond to players.  When every MA there was started screaming about minimum damage, Funcom looked at it and fixed it, at least for a lot of people.  The jury is still out on how effectively they fixed it, but they're making steps in the right direction, and that's worth something.  I'm willing to cut them some slack for being new to the MMORPG business as long as they learn from their screwups.  Thus I voted &quot;Yes, with reservations for the future&quot; <p>~Jaqrabbit<br>

Death is a big part of this type of games and there should be consequences (like CR... which can be fun... time consuming, but still fun), but loosing XP, and not being able to do anything about it just plain sucks.<br>

In plane of growth the server burps; router or something bumps off 3/4 of the population of about 15-20 servers. Of course it means certain death for me and my guild, pogs spawn within a half an hour and w can't coordinate our logging in because we are all having problems getting past the log in screen. So I go to our website, post for everyone to keep trying to log in. I finally get in.. and I die. I petition. A GM was there resing the entire zone and killed the pogs for me until we had a full group there to handle them. We got 100% cutomer service reses. no 96% cleric reses.<br>
<br>
At level 9 (WAY back inthe day) I died and I had the incredible poofing corpse bug.. I petitioned, an an hour later I had a GM respond, issuing me no drop uber leather (this was when NO one had banded yet, and traveiling to Freeport was an adventure, no porters yet either)<br>
<br>
One time my wizard lost an item due a charm bug in the Beholder zone; I petitioned and after a a while a guide came. He gave me an email address and the next day I had a GM checking the logs for my item. Sure enough he issued me a new jewled skull.<br>
<br>
Had the servers go down during a Vox raid; we petitioned and a GM came and moved the corpses to the king room.<br>
<br>
Had a problem with a monk; she petitiond me saying I was Ksing. I was pulling from the kobold areas in Sol B; pulling singles for a bard friend. GM came; asked what was wrong. The monk of course was just pissy because I was lvl 58 hlping a frind out.. GM takes my side. GM leaves. Monk trains me with beetles and imps; I live. I was about to repitition when I get a tell asking me if I was ok. it was the gm. I say sure, did you c that? GM summons asshol monk to qynos catacombs, I don't see the monk for a week.<br>

Both companies have CS issues, however I don't feel like waiting 6 months to a year for FC to get their act together.

<br>
I play EQ at  release and imo AO is already a more stable product at the same time live then EQ was.  Yes, AO still has some issues to work out, EQ does too.  EQ just never actually fixed them before adding more, and players got used to having a shitty game where lazy programming that any player noted and took advantage of was punished ( and still is... even in cases where it's just good tactics ).<br>
<br>
FunCom has attempted to actually fix problems and to only release patches once actually tested, vs the VI procedure of half finished patches being made live at the last minute.   In AO's history at this point i can count the number of emergency patches on one hand, this far into the live release of EQ..... i doubt i could have counted the number patches that resulted in emergency patches on all my fingers and toes.<br>
<br>
The only blemish on FunCom's record in my mind was the roll back they did.  Personally,  I think that should have been handled differently, rolling back every character because of the actions of a few just isn't acceptable.<br>
<br>
Then again neither is allowing crappy pathing to exist for 3 + years post release and telling players that if they use it to their advantage it's a bannable offense because the company ( VI ) won't get off their asses and fix the probelm.<br>
<br>
<br>
Along the those lines.... FunCom really seems to care about the experience their &gt;&gt; Customers &lt;&lt; come away with, challenging sure, at times, but not designed to be demoralizing.  VI on the other hand gives  a rats ass about the &gt;&gt; player &lt;&lt; ( note that difference there? ),  EQ attempts to force you into doing things VI's way.  It can be said of EQ that there is only one &quot;best&quot; way to progress a give class, that can't be said for AO, I have seen multiple play styles for the different professions, from heavily based in stats to use higher QL gear to heavily based in combat skills or heavily based in Nano skills, and they have all be vaild ways to play the game.  AND something EQ didn't have.... if you want to role play your character in AO, no one is going to bitch at you about causing lag for going to a night club for an evening and mingling.<br>
<br>
AO isn't trying to tell me how to play their game, I'm not forced to HAVE to group, i can if i want, and there sure some nice benies if i do exp wise.  EQ never allowed that, past a certain point you simply can't do anything worth while without 23 of your closest guild mates there dying with you.  Now I was still soloing my Monk at 54th... but past that?<br>
<br>
VI &quot;You in OUR world&quot;<br>
FC &quot;Welcome to Rudi-Ka&quot;<br>
<br>
hmmmm okay I haven't actually seen a &quot;official&quot; slogan from FC, but hey that works.  VI is like the pen and paper gamemaster that has it in for his players and intends to brutalize them some before he kills them for good.<br>
<br>
FC really seems to be there to give you the chance to have a good time imo.<br>
<br>
<br>
The unfortunate thing for AO is that they are still using zone based architecture in the game, until MMORPG's get away from that, they will never be able to live up to their full potential for things like honest to god player held wars where 500 + people are there with a score to settle.<br>
<br>
Every time i have gotten a response from a FC guide it's been resonable, there where dam few VI guides i can say there for, but then again they had their hands tied behind their backs.<br>
<br>
<br>
FC would have to work at it to piss me off at this point, I'm VERY pleased.  Three years of dealing with VI's bull sheeeet has left me with the decision that I don't care what they ever put on the market from this point or how great it sounds, if VI is involved, I won't be buying it.<br>
<br>
In reguards to in game customer service, they have been adding guides in AO, and honestly EQ was a game that would have been better off with NO in game GM's period.  ANd those people sighting having item restores in EQ?  VI's new policy is you if get reimbursed by a GM, YOU can be banned for convincing the GM to reimburse you.   There is also a HUGE difference in loosing all your thing in AO and losing all your stuff in EQ, in EQ 1 item could represent 300 + hours of WORK to get the item, in AO.... go run a few low white missions.  You won't get the best stuff, but you will get something, and once you have something you can start taking harder missions.   I did lose everything on my character ( armor wise ) in a Lush zone crash, it was recoverable.  In EQ, I'd still be camping items.  ( though i don't change clothes in Lush any more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I saw that bit in EQ with the GM or whoever totally frying several players and all the other complaints, about d00ds and such, and eventually decided to give EQ a pass. I've played MUDs for years and the thought of CR again just doesn't interest me either. ^_^;; Anyhow, I tried AO, because of its theme and the specifics of how it was different from the other MMORPGs. Until this latest patch (12.6), I didn't have a problem with the game's glitches. I put up with Daggerfall's quirkiness, so AO's minor league compared to that. I only ever petitioned once, and that was because a machine in the Newland General Store (the car machine) said there was an error and to petition a gm about it. The only zone problems I've had were zoning in and out of a mission. It's just when they broke the game so bad that any kind of playing was nearly impossible that I gave up. I'd already heard enough to know not to petition for any kind of resolution and I had been fine with that (I prefer solo'ing and sorting things out by myself) but when nothing hits and you can't do anything but stand in front of Fair Trade in Tir and kvetch, it's time to call it quits. I still am not really interested in EQ, nor in any of the other MMORPGs, with the possible exception of City of Heroes (a superhero one ^_^).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udragonflyao.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dragonfly AO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#660000>(9/28/01 9:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sensei's 08.27.01 Poll.</span><hr size=1> i said yes with some reservations. i like the way funcom listens to their players about balance issues and game features etc. my reservations however are all those unanswerd petitions i get with ao. i ll take funcom over VI tho cuz i played a mage in EQ to lv 60 and well if u played a lv 60 mage u know what im talkin bout. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usepulus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sepulus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 395<br> <font color=#660000>(10/2/01 9:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sensei's 08.27.01 Poll.</span><hr size=1> heh, would be interesting to do this poll again now that some things have changed.

I vote verant! Even tho I dont play EQ anymore...<br>
After 2 years I had my fill and had a great time playing. Its just time to move on. <br>
<br>
Funcom sucks and they have a long way to go before they realize what they need to do to make it right for the customer.  They can definitly take some pointers from Verant if ya ask me!<br>
<br>
Just cant wait to see how DAOC does, bet it takes alot of peeps away from AO! <br>
