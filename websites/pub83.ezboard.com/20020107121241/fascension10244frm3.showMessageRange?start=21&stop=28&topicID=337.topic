And I dont think you would want me to be a complete ass and piss off AD, or would you?? I am interested in AD, but what pisses me off are all the high levels w/ their politics and such---I JUST wanna have fun---I deal w/ enough shyt in real life---I sure dont need it in a game I love. What makes a great guild at first is great leadership, and that is one thing I am not seeing~~and second is members trusting each other, that is one thing I am not seeing also.<br>
          To make a great guild, first of all, you need great leadership, second of all you need trustworthy members who will not disband at the epitome of the guilds failures, THEN once all that is covered, you need to have THINGS TO DO WITH THE GUILD, and in the past 2 weeks I have heard of at least 15 OM members leaving, even officers, do you call that trust?do you call that faith? I sure as hell dont, that is why I am losing faith, because the ones that I once saw w/ nothing but the greatest  amount of respect, and the ones that wanted to be there the most, are disbanding, I really do wish I had that much faith in OM, I am sure I can learn to also, but put quite blatantly, I am losing trust in the guild, because most of the people who have disbanded that I have talked to said that &quot;Those asses didnt help me when I needed it,&quot;~~Considering I gave up my winning roll on bioluminescent orb and on COCW to join OM, I think that shows that I didnt join for uber loot, and considering I am still using a flowing black silk sash as my haste item next to my epic, I think that shows I care more about my guildmates than I care for myself.<br>
           Another time, I was dragging corpses from the arena in KD, because the whole groups go wiped out because some dumbass cleric(not in our group) was dragging a kos corpse from the guardians of rallos zek--I died 3times dragging corpses(2 of wish I didnt get rezzes for)--and I did get most of the corpses--another time when we went on the nagefen raid--and everyoen got wiped out---I spent 2extra hours at the mall until I could go home---thus 3hours late for my curfew at home--since it was a school night---and I knew for a fact that I would be punished(and I was--no eq for 2weeks--and my car was taken away) I had to ride the bus into school as a senior in highschool. I did that for the other people that were on the naggy raid. I ask you all every day when I sign on, anyone need me anywhere?? noone responds. Thats probably why i go on more epic raids for other guild than I do for OM, because put simply &quot;NOONE ASKS&quot;. And I am sorry if I have repeated myself a couple times, but noone should EVER say &quot; I dont even know why your in this Guild&quot; I give my all to the guilds I am in, and I am sorry if this sounds vain but I dont ask much from my guilds that I do care for, even if my love for a guild is fading.<br>
           Right now I am doing somthing for myself, harvesting money for a cowl of mortality--from HG's. Yet I still ask if anyone needs me. unless its stupid like if somone wants me to camp the ac ring for them( I have been asked that multiple times) I HATE CAMPING ac--I have camped it for all my alts--all my friends chars so in total about 15 ac rings I have camped--that I wont do for anyone!EVER AGAIN! I am usually calm about things, but I have had a bad day today, so most definitely today was a bad day to critique me. I wish everyone good luck, but I dont need any shyt from anyone!<br>

I rarely scold people out publicly, especially a guildmember.  Seros (EX-member who we deguilded) was the first.  You'll be the second.  You have no right to make comments about the guild because you have not been much of a member.  You are very new, and were invited without a vote during a very chaotic period.  Additionally, you have not even made the effort to find out about our message board.  It's a damn requirement, and yet it has passed you by so many times.  If you are online so often and with the guild so often, then why is it that you are basically the only member that doesn't even know about it?  You bash the guild that you have not given a chance, a guild that honestly should not have given you a chance.  Your boot-licking with AD will probably not go very far either.  Adell and I have not always seen eye to eye on everything, but she knows that I'm not a liar.  When Kesh left the guild, I was not bitter.  I told her the honest truth about him and he joined AD.  From what I understand, he was a good member for them until he quit EQ.  You, on the other hand, would be a poor member for any guild.  I would not recommend you to anyone.  I saw you online tonight.  There was a raid tonight.  I didn't see you there.  You have an odd way of showing your &quot;friendship&quot;.  After your insults, I really don't know what other course of action to take.  Goodbye.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ufaronor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faronor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(12/18/01 6:40:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Corraz</span><hr size=1> Well spoken Talthan  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uhakatri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hakatri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(12/18/01 10:47:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Corraz</span><hr size=1> /sigh <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uhakatri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hakatri</A> at: 12/18/01 10:52:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucorrazkittykycker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Corraz KittyKycker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#333333>(12/19/01 9:56:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ~~~</span><hr size=1> I give up on trying to argue my point~~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uezik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ezik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#333333>(12/19/01 6:39:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cascia~~~sorry~~~</span><hr size=1> I pk him for u cas !<br>
