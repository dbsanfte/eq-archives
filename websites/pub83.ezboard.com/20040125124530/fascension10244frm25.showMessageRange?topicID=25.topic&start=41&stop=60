<br>
The way I see it, if you think that's a viable PVP tactic, you're just a piece of shit that deserves to be kos. Your attempt at an apology or resolution to this is lackluster at best. Especially the part where you try to justify training and say stupid shit like &quot;who wouldn't&quot;. <br>
<br>
I've been playing on Rallos Zek from the very start (3 years approx, now). I've been trained on numerous occasions. Have I ever intentionally trained someone? PVP or otherwise? Hell no. You've got problems man, and it goes farther than any of this shit being discussed in this thread.<br>
<br>
If you're just going to lay down and die, why are you on this server? Maybe a move to Stormhammer would be the right avenue for you.  <p><b>Kilyin, <a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><br>

Ok, I'm about to lose my temper again, this'll be my last post for a while.<br>
<br>
You say my apology is lackluster, I'm not apologizing for the train.  Your people attacked me first, en masse, while I had mobs on me, FIRST.<br>
<br>
Your people attacked me FIRST.<br>
<br>

<br>
Your people attacked me FIRST.<br>
<br>
Your people attacked me FIRST.<br>
<br>
Your people attacked me FIRST.<br>
<br>
And all you can say about that is, &quot;well you trained.&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;shrug&gt;<br>
<br>
Since this event started, your people continue to attack me FIRST.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, you trained a while back...&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah, I've also tried to help a few AD hunt down more &quot;worth while&quot; PK's like some LV.  I helped corpse camp various opponents.  I've alerted AD, currently in the act of PK'ing me, about elysian armor rots.  I've apologized for my harsh words.<br>
<br>
Now you're all bent on the fact that I used an illegal tactic.  Let's look at the NUMBER ONE rule on the EverQuest Rules of Conduct:<br>
<br>
&quot;1. You may not harass or threaten other players.&quot;<br>
<br>
This also corresponds to rule NUMBER 5 of the PnP:<br>
<br>
&quot;5. You may not harass others.<br>
<br>
Harassment is defined as specifically targeting another player or group of players to harm or inconvenience them. As harassment can take many forms, the EQCSR involved will make a determination as to whether or not a &quot;reasonable person&quot; would feel harassed and act accordingly.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stop harrasing me, now.<br>
<br>
Let's look at the NUMBER ONE rule of the PnP:<br>
<br>
&quot;1. You may not steal kills.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission.<br>
<br>
The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy. <br>
<br>
Now we have two issues here, your people can claim that they were &quot;prepared to engage&quot; the mob.  However they weren't in the front, and no where to be seen when I engaged the mob.<br>
<br>
So, technically your people are still at fault.  According to the GM's I spoke with in chat, to be &quot;prepared to engage&quot; a mob, you have to be within direct line of sight.<br>
<br>
Your people weren't.<br>
<br>
I had the mob engaged, it was my mob.  Your people KS'd me.<br>
<br>
To be &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;balanced&quot; I broke rule Number TWO of the rules of conduct:<br>
<br>
&quot;2. You may not use any sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive language.&quot;<br>
<br>
Which also corresponds to rule NUMBER 4 of the PnP:<br>
<br>
&quot;4. Foul language is not permitted, in any language.<br>
<br>
Excessive use of foul language in an inappropriate context, including swear words, real-world racial slurs, and other language that is not consistent with the fantasy environment and designed to hurt, will be considered a disruption. The existence of the filter (/filter) is not a license to be profane.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fine, I apologize for this.<br>
<br>
Now, no where on this list do I see that &quot;training&quot; is an illegal tactic, other than using training to cause an exp loss, this is from Verant's site.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp">eqlive.station.sony.com/s...onduct.jsp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
No one lost exp from the train, all you guys had to do was zone, and by zoning, stop attacking me.<br>
<br>
We're both at fault.<br>
<br>
If you continue with this &quot;perma-KoS&quot; crap, I WILL report your guild.<br>
<br>
I tried being reasonable, I tried talking it out, but some of you continue to just say, &quot;You trained...&quot;, never acknowledging that your people attacked me first.<br>
<br>
Your people attacked me FIRST.<br>
<br>
Your people attacked me FIRST.<br>
<br>
Your people attacked me FIRST.<br>
<br>
Your people attacked me FIRST.<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
It would seem that certain members of AD want me to kiss their rears, beg, pay some sort of monies or whatever.  I'm not sure, I actually haven't seen anything from anyone on &quot;how to make this right&quot;, other than a heresay /tell stating that Adell says I'm &quot;perma-KOS.&quot;<br>
<br>
If I've missed the &quot;how to make it right&quot; instructions, please restate them.  I'll read them the next time I have the patience for this.<br>
<br>
Leave me be.<br>

You are going to have a stroke if you don't calm down.<br>
<br>
Let me make this simple for you. You've stated you engaged the mob first. I don't believe you. I believe my guildmates when they say they were camping the area and YOU are the one who came along and tried to steal the named spawn.<br>
<br>
I might even concede that the AD who attacked you may have acted hastily, but you in turn trained them, INTENTIONALLY.  This is where your logic is flawed. In PVP accidental trains may occur, but you can't do it on purpose. Your options without breaking the rules (and two wrongs dont make a right, even if I took your word that you engaged the mob first) were..<br>
<br>
a) run<br>
<br>
b) gate<br>
<br>
c) die<br>
<br>
<br>
You chose to break the rules of the server, YOU decided to fight AD dirty. You taunted them in ooc / tells. It backfired and you died. You refused to apologize to Cascia. Even after he offered to res you.<br>
<br>
You came here and went off on a tangent, comparing us to PB, saying we 'zerged' you. Dude, I'll bet you 20k platinum any one of the people there could have killed you, alone. But that's beside the point. You didn't come here with an apologetic attitude. You came here with a chip on your shoulder, occasionally mentioning you were remorseful about what happened, but then backpedaling by insulting us.<br>
<br>
You sir, are a fucking mental case. Take a look at the shit you just spewed all over this board. Now you're going to threaten to REPORT us? Man, did you transfer here from the Furcadia server? Hunting you down and sending you to your bind point, is not harassment.  Maintaining a KOS list is not against the rules. Corpse camping you isn't even illegal now, if we were so inclined. It's not against the rules to KILL YOU on Rallos Zek, especially considering you're someone that can't just eat a piece of humble pie and say they're sorry and shut the fuck up.<br>
<br>
You are just making this worse, trust me on that. Wanna know what you could have done? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &quot;I'm sorry about what happened guys. It was a misunderstanding. I want to resolve this problem.&quot; </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Then you could have signed your name and been on your merry way. If I were you (and at this point, I'm overfuckingjoyed I wasn't given that curse to bear) that's what I'd have done. Instead, you came here and poured gasoline on the fire, and now you are having what I can only deem a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; on a message board.<br>
<br>
If you want to run your mouth, train people, yap about play nice policies, threaten to &quot;report&quot; us for killing you, and suffer no repercussions, then you need to consider a server transfer.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ukilyinrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KilyinRZ</A> at: 8/31/02 3:59:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ukilyinrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KilyinRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#333333>(8/31/02 4:23 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/kilyin/hartman.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: About training</span><hr size=1> Oh, and one last thing, you clueless blunder...<br>

Play Nice Policies dont apply on Rallos Zek, UNLESS the dispute is between characters who aren't in level range of one another and thus are unable to settle the dispute with PVP. Unfortunately for you, all of AD is within your level range. <br>

Let's go for MULTIPLE wrongs, kiddies</span><hr size=1> <br>
While the general PnP rules may not apply on Rallos Zek, and I don't see anything stating specifically those rules do not, the Player Conduct rules DO apply.<br>
<br>
There is no exception made to those rules at all, anywhere.<br>
<br>
Here's the rule I believe that applies to both of us in this situation, from the Rallos Zek PnP policy:<br>
<br>
&quot;On Rallos Zek, PvP-related Play Nice Policy situations are expected to be resolved using PvP solutions. However, Non PvP-related Play Nice Policy issues, such as training, causing intentional experience loss, bind point, zone, and portal camping, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;as well as other various forms of harassment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, are not permitted in the PvP environment.&quot;<br>
<br>
So both the player conduct rules, and the Rallos Zek rules say NO HARASSMENT.<br>
<br>
Leave me alone.<br>
<br>
Yes, it says no training, fine.  Ok, I'm wrong, I'm sorry I trained.<br>
<br>
Leave me the hell alone.<br>
<br>
Let's count up the &quot;wrongs&quot; so far kiddies:<br>
<br>
1.  Dimento didn't ask all the AD who happened to be in the zone if they owned a named mob they were NOT in sight of.  <br>
<br>
2.  AD KS's Dimento.<br>
<br>
3.  AD ignores Dimento's initial attempts at communication:  &quot;/say I pulled that mob, back of please.&quot;<br>
<br>
4.  Dimento got angry and cursed at the KS'ing AD.<br>
<br>
5.  AD Attacked Dimento.<br>
<br>
6.  Dimento Trained.<br>
<br>
7.  AD Exp killed Dimento.<br>
<br>
8.  Dimento and AD had smart alec comments and harsh words for each other.<br>
<br>
9.  AD &quot;accidentally&quot; gets Dimento's corpse stuck under the world.<br>
<br>
10.  AD attacks Dimento.<br>
<br>
11.  AD mana burns Dimento.<br>
<br>
12.  Dimento loses his temper and speaks harshly to AD making stupid threats.<br>
<br>
13.  AD attacks Dimento while AFK (yet another favorite PB trick)<br>
<br>
14.  AD attacks Dimento.<br>
<br>
15.  AD attacks Dimento.<br>
<br>
16.  AD attacks Dimento, causes a train, intentional or not, a train was caused it resulted in the death of a third party.  AD refused to send a cleric to res the third party, as far as I know have yet to apologize to the third party.  Dimento arranged for the res for the third party.<br>
<br>
So, counting everything up, what do we have:<br>
<br>
5 Wrongs from Dimento, 11 from AD.<br>
<br>
Leave me alone now.  You haven't even come up with a reason that's fun for me to be KoS, at this point it appears you want to KoS me because you think it's funny.<br>
<br>
Now for the direct replies - <br>
<br>
Kilyin:<br>
&gt;&gt;Let me make this simple for you. You've stated you engaged the mob first. I don't believe you. <br>
<br>
Well too bad, it's true.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I believe my guildmates when they say they were camping the area and YOU are the one who came along and tried to steal the named spawn.<br>
<br>
They weren't even within sight of the mob, I saw no one on the 2 sides I could see (3 if you count long distance view of the back as I was running up to the temple), so it &quot;appeared&quot; that the temple wasn't camped.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you don't believe me.  But at this point I don't care.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;I might even concede that the AD who attacked you may have acted hastily, <br>
<br>
That's just OH SO magnanomous at this point.  Gee, thank you.  Of course it's ONLY &quot;acted hastily&quot;, see this has been my ENTIRE problem with AD.  You're so quick to minimize your own fault in the situation.  You barely acknowledge the fact.  This has what's pissed me off about this whole thing.<br>
<br>
By your actions, your tone, and your dealings with other people many of you imply that you're the only important ones on this server and that the server actually is owned by AD.<br>
<br>
Well, I in my stubbornness, am going to make darn well sure you realize it isn't.  No one should just automaticall assume that just becase AD is in a zone means that they are camping a named they don't have anyone within direct line of sight of.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;but you in turn trained them, INTENTIONALLY. This is where your logic is flawed. In PVP accidental trains may occur, but you can't do <br>
&gt;&gt;it on purpose. Your options without breaking the rules (and two wrongs dont make a right, even if I took your word that you engaged <br>
&gt;&gt;the mob first) were..<br>
<br>
Fine, your people should have reported me.  I see no notification that AD has been appointed the Rallos Zek &quot;Train Police.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;a) run<br>
<br>
&gt;b) gate<br>
<br>
&gt;c) die<br>
<br>
Ohhhh, I'm not allowed to defend myself here.  I have to leave the zone or let your people kill me.<br>
<br>
Anyone else not affiliated with me or AD reading this have a comment on that?  Does this not directly imply that we NON-AD are not allowed to defend ourselves at all?<br>
<br>
It sure seems that way, I've come here defending myself so that I just don't get dumped with ALL the blame in this matter, AD doesn't seem to want to concede that they had some part in this little cluster...  All I've met with is AD repeating the fact that I trained.<br>
<br>
Had I not been attacked this would not have happened.<br>
And yes, even after THAT sentance, I again, apologize for the train.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You chose to break the rules of the server, YOU decided to fight AD dirty. <br>
<br>
AD started fighting dirty first.  Acknowledge that.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You taunted them in ooc / tells. <br>
<br>
You call it taunting, I call it responding to a smart ass remark letting them more were to come if they didn't leave.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;It backfired and you died. <br>
<br>
I got exp killed, btw.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You refused to apologize to Cascia. Even after he offered to res you.<br>
<br>
Damn right I did.  Cascia wanted an apology?  Should have res'd me and then asked for it.  Because saying, &quot;Apologize and I'll rez you.&quot; looks to me like he's trying to blackmail an apology out of me.  This is a view shared by most reasonable people.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You came here and went off on a tangent, comparing us to PB, saying we 'zerged' you. <br>
<br>
At least 5 of you, 1 of me, what the hell would you call it?<br>
<br>
&gt;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=">D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ude, I'll bet you 20k platinum any one of the people there could have killed you, alone. <br>
<br>
Sure.  I've been killed by AD 3 times since this incident:<br>
<br>
1. Manaburn<br>
2. Caught once while AFK<br>
3. 2 AD attacked me at the same time.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;But that's beside the point. You didn't come here with an apologetic attitude. <br>
<br>
No, I didn't, I came with an attitude of let's talk this out and acknowledge BOTH parties guilt.<br>
<br>
AD doesn't want to hear about their own culpability in this matter.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You came here with a chip on your shoulder, occasionally mentioning you were remorseful about what happened, but <br>
&gt;&gt;then backpedaling by insulting us.<br>
<br>
I've received pretty much nothing but insults, smart ass remarks, and the like from your guild so far.  A few people have worked to resolve this, and I thank them.<br>
<br>
The rest of you?  At this point if an LV and an certain AD each were battling and each only had one HP left, I'd cast an AE and walk off whistling.<br>
<br>
If I've insulted you, I apologize, but you people sure haven't tried treating me very nice either.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You sir, are a fucking mental case. <br>
<br>
Is that your professional opinion?  Just because I defend myself, don't agree with all your statements?<br>
<br>
Whatever...<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Now you're going to threaten to REPORT us? <br>
<br>
Yep.  It appears I can from the Rules of Conduct, which do apply to Rallos.  Show me the exception for Rallos Zek and I'll shut up about it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Man, did you transfer here from the Furcadia server? <br>
<br>
Nope, been on Rallos since phase 3.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Hunting you down and sending you to your bind point, is not harassment. <br>
<br>
It is when I can't play the game.  How many AD are there, not counting alts?  Every appropriately leveled zone I go to has AD in it.<br>
<br>
Now I can either ignore them and hope they leave me alone (they don't), or I can attack them, and prove your point, or go elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I've been elsewhere, there's no place I can play you people haven't been except the planes, and I can't solo in the planes.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Maintaining a KOS list is not against the rules. <br>
<br>
It is when it delves into harassment.  I don't see any exceptions to this in the rules.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Corpse camping you isn't even illegal now, if we were so inclined. It's not against the rules to KILL YOU on Rallos Zek, <br>
&gt;&gt;pecially considering you're someone that can't just eat a piece of humble pie and say they're sorry and shut the fuck up.<br>
<br>
Apparently AD can't admit when they are wrong, and if they happen to see that they are wrong they just blow it off as, &quot;Oh, it's unintentional.&quot;, &quot;Oh they just acted hastily.&quot;<br>
<br>
No one else on the server but AD appear to be afforded the same consideration.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;You are just making this worse, trust me on that. Wanna know what you could have done? <br>
<br>
Yeah, right, you go read the posts from AD up to the point I posted again, and I mean, REALLY READ them, and see what you would think in my place.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Then you could have signed your name and been on your merry way. <br>
<br>
Yeah, right, I've been told IN GAME that I was &quot;permaKOS&quot; to AD.  Doesn't sound like I had ANY chance of doing ANYTHING that would appease you folks.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;If I were you (and at this point, I'm overfuckingjoyed I wasn't given that curse to bear) that's what I'd have done. <br>
&gt;&gt;Instead, you came here and poured gasoline on the fire, and now you are having what I can only deem a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; <br>
&gt;&gt;on a message board.<br>
<br>
Whatever, I am vociferously defending myself.  Why does AD think that defendings oneself is insane?<br>
<br>
That would seem to indicate a level of megalomania that should be professionaly treated.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;If you want to run your mouth, train people, yap about play nice policies, threaten to &quot;report&quot; us for killing you, and suffer no <br>
&gt;&gt;repercussions, then you need to consider a server transfer. <br>
<br>
I see, I'm not allowed to play on AD's server anymore, is that it?<br>
<br>
AD &quot;owns&quot; the server?  Is that it?<br>
<br>
Let's review again:  The very first rule I quote is from the Rules of Conduct, NOT the PnP.  The PnP for Rallos Zek ALSO states no harassment but I don't think it has been read yet by many people.<br>
<br>
Leave me alone.<br>
<br>
Yzzt:<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;ooops sry I missed that.. all Ive seen is pointing fingers at AD.<br>
<br>
I've pointed at what I did wrong and I pointed where I feel AD was wrong.<br>
<br>
I've tried showing what I believe to be both sides.  I've tried considering both sides.<br>
<br>
You people haven't.<br>
<br>
Altaris:<br>
&gt;&gt;No one asked him to kiss our ass. <br>
<br>
Yeah, I've seen how other people have gotten off your KOS list.  By paying your guild, by having to accept all the blame in a situation.<br>
<br>
I'm not completely at fault here.<br>
<br>
I've apologized for the harsh words and stupid threats.<br>
<br>
I've even apologized for the trains.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to apologize for defending myself here on your message board, nor the manner in which I do it.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;People kill each other Everysingle day over disputed spawns and other misunderstandings, and you know what happens? <br>
&gt;&gt;Most of those people talk to each other after the other one runs/dies to figure out what happened, they make amends and <br>
&gt;&gt;are fine the next day. <br>
<br>
LOL, yeah right.  It's a happy flowery world on Rallos Zek.  Everyone holds hands after the day is done and sings Koombyyah.<br>
<br>
That's not the Rallos I play on.<br>
<br>
If it were, there'd be no such thing as &quot;permaKOS&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;PVP is part of our server, just because someone kills you once does not mean the end of the world, and does not mean they <br>
&gt;&gt;forever hate you. <br>
<br>
Yeah, well so far it's been 1 exp death.  1 mana burn, 1 necro attack while AFK, 2 people attacking and killing me, and several attempts, 1 of which AD trains and kills an innocent bystander.<br>
<br>
All during this process I'm told that Adell says I'm &quot;permaKOS&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'm taking &quot;perma&quot; as in &quot;permanent&quot; and I take &quot;permanent&quot; as in &quot;forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;We are not asking him or anyone to come beg for forgivness, just to talk about it. <br>
<br>
I thought that's what I was doing here.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;Instead he ran his mouth, threatened, and Tried to intentionally train people, <br>
<br>
The train is what is supposed to have started this.  Not one train has been started by me since this event.  AD can't say the same.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;then came here yelling about how bad we were and how we started it. <br>
<br>
You did start it.  With your people's &quot;hasty&quot; actions.<br>
<br>
Anyway, again, leave me alone.<br>
<br>
I will report your guild if you continue harassing me.<br>

Some times it does result in full scale war, but most of the time it is resolved and no one cares that much after that....I never said they hold hand and love each other, I just said they work their problems out like adults.<br>
<br>
You obviously have no clue why people pay to get off kos.  All of those are ex-pb, or ex-full time random pks.  They have done Many many many things to AD and to the rest of the server or a Long period of time...just look at other guilds like MiM and IE for example...they make those same people pay as well if they want to finally stop it.  Name 1 person that has only had one incident with AD and has been forced to pay to get off kos?<br>
<br>
All your other points make no sense at all.<br>
You say that you have said sorry for the stuff you did.  Well just leave it that then, and agree to disagree.  If I did some bad stuff and you did some bad stuff and I came to you and said, &quot;I'm sorry.....but you're still a stupid lying piece of shit, and so is your whole asshole guild, you started it anyway, so fuck you&quot;.....you would be pissed too, and most likely say, ok skrew it, I will continue to attack you.  This is bacially what you are doing here to us, and by some strange reason don't seem to understand that.  If you want to appologize, then do so, and leave it at that.  If you don't want to fine, but what you are doing now is the worst possible thing you could do if you actually want to be left alone.<br>

And heres another newsflash for you, we can kill you whenever we please and for as long as we decide. No GM's going to come rescue you from your own stupidity here.
