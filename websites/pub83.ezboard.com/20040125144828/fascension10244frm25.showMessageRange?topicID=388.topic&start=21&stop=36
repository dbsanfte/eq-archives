This is a stupid arguement to have droppable gear would ruin the economy.<br>
<br>
Back in the day, we even had weapon looting. Pks would just make casters since they dont use weapons and go in packs and and get easy weps for whatever.<br>
<br>
In short, item rewards do not work, there is always some cheesey half-ass way to scam the system.<br>
<br>
You want a reward for killing someone go for what really hurts guilds... Stop them from pve'ing. If you cant do that, shrug, give up...go to sullon.<br>
<br>
For some ppl, the reward of pvp is having a non-pvp class and actually being good or able to hold your own. Salaain, you have a wonderful class to pvp with, find another way to make your pvp enjoyable, cuz seeing you whine that you get no rewards is utter retardedness.<br>
<br>
you lil fag, the more I think about this poll and the unspoken pussy moaning you put into it, i laugh. Had you more balls, try a class that isnt so easy to pvp with...<br>
<br>
Shit, i bet you are one of those assbags that would join the sullon evil team and complain how easy it is.<br>
<br>
In short dumbass, you can make it harder or more riskier, or more rewarding... In short, you are too much of a pussy to do so, instead you choose to post a stupid poll with biased answers.<br>

I gave you a fucking penalty, read it. I said ruin them PVE.. That is penalty.. they dont get to play the game the way they want. <br>

There is ZERO reason for item loot to this very day. You can do ldon for monies to buy pumices. You can find ways to make money...Find a reason and offer a valid solution to the naked 6 grouped caster grouped gankers. <br>
<br>
You have yet to offer a good enuff reason for having item loot. You look like one of those morons who wants to get items for PA. Why would you even suggest items as a viable solution to pvp death penalty?<br>

AD sks are un killible i think... Id sit on somthor a better than average geared warrior with full buffs and go toe to toe and die with a 10-to 5% damage done<br>

<br>
As an example to their utter cluelessness, in the first three months of play on Rallos if you died to a mob, anyone could come by and loot you afterwards. You didn't have to kill someone to steal items, you just had to wait for them to blunder into the brownie camp in lfey, and then loot them. I remember people tricking other people into walking into bad mobs, and then looting them when they died. Such a stupid stupid thing, that never should have gone live.<br>
<br>
Can anyone honestly say that Manaburn when it came out, was a balanced and reasonable ability in pvp? How long did it take for them to add the 85 percent spell damage nerf to it? Almost 2 years!<br>
<br>
Yay! safe zones that let you run in and pk for a min, then run right back out and laugh from safety are a good thing?<br>
<br>
So many changes that are fine for pve, that were never given a thought as to how they'd effect the pvp environment. We're sort of a test region, that nobody cares about. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Players are no better than Verant, they will abuse every little quirk and flaw with the system to their advantage. Just as everyone else said, everytime you ported or zoned into somewhere you would run the risk of 6 naked casters trying to kill you. They have no penalty to dying, they're naked looking for the loot score. As Castin once put it, doesn't matter if he dies 155 times in a day if he gets a Fungi from someone.<br>
 <br>
I have played on Rallos since they put it up in Beta 4, three weeks before all servers going live. My main was rolled up on March 17, 1999 which I think is about as early as you can get.<br>
<br>
In all that time, none of the small pvp battles standout in my memory as being tremendously entertaining, or making playing on Rallos so much better than a blue server. <br>
<br>
What did, was the huge sect/guild wars. The 50 or 60 Mim/Ad fighting the same number of Fu/Bok/PB outside of Fear to prevent them from stealing Cazic Thule, in an epic 3 or 4 hour battle. That was without a doubt the most entertaining pvp I have experienced in Everquest.<br>
<br>
I wonder if you all went the non gank route and got into guild wars, if you'd have a more enjoyable time.<br>

All your guild does is run around and attack people who are busy fighting pve or outnumbered.  And to boot with that your guild often still cant muster up an advantage so you bring more mobs to the fight.<br>

Even if PvP were made balanced there are still many issues to consider that your poll doesnt even attempt to address.<br>
<br>
It takes alot of playtime hours and the effort of 72+ people in a guild to get things accomplished in PoP. Why should someone who doesnt put the effort into the flagging process be able to acquire an item for merely playing perhaps an hour.<br>
<br>
Lets suppose for a second that pvp were balanced. No matter what actions were taken to balance pvp can prevent a lynch mob of 10 people from taking your loots.<br>
<br>
Suppose again that we do have one loot drop from a pvp death. Seems to me that all you pks in Cursed would have a hard time deciding who that loot should goto. Would more than likely create problems in your guild, since everyone wants to get some time gear. God forbid one of your members auctioning time lewts in Bazaar when several of your members would have wanted it for their own inventory.<br>
<br>
Personally, i believe it would be hella more fun for guilds to create a castle or some kind of headquarters with a battle field surrounding it, and have all out guild warfare for platinum and points. What you suggest is just a means of ruining the efforts people put into their characters. Gives PvP a dirty name, and doesnt make it fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ezzrz>EZZRZ</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://ringbearer.i-55.com/albums/Characters/ajc.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#333333>(11/21/03 4:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=388.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Should all equipment be droppable?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>guilds to create a castle or some kind of headquarters with a battle field surrounding it<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Not to mention can you honestly see them coding a system that changes item stats on one server to drop, redoing all the quests that require no drop items, when it took them two years to make a minor change to one lousy aa ability (MB)?<br>
<br>
Sounds like such a great plan otherwise, every 35 min or so when ht refreshes, you would get a nice piece of gear.

That's really where the differences lie.   You're a pk ganker.  Ganking got very old for me, very fast.  Especially with lame near insta-kill abilities aka HT, manaburn, lifeburn.   Guild battles are really where any type of 'true pvp' can be had, but again even Sony fucks that up with too many non-PVP zones, requiring 'guild bloat' for PVE so that quantity over quality wins, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
You're not the first person to make this argument, but if it were up to me, the only penalty in PVP would be if you died, you could not swing a sword or cast a spell for 15 minutes.  Lots of stuff needs to happen before 'oh nos, no fungi on this guy boo hoo'...eliminating insta-death spells/abilities, eliminating most/all of the non-pvp zones, getting rid of horses in PVP, just to name a few.<br>
<br>
None of that is going to happen, however, as Sony's focus isn't on EQ any longer (going on 2 years now), they're working on their next money making scheme like &quot;buy LOE and u can be in Beta!&quot; or &quot;xfer to any server with gear for $75!).   The chance for PVP to be 'fixed' has log past.  Don't expect any dramatic changes in PVP in EQ ever again.<br>

Read my first post.. I said that inorder for this to work they would need to do a few things. And on Firiona Vie Server everything is droppable, it can't be that hard. I've played a Sk for a couple years, ever since I came to Rz..so stop acting like I made the class of the month once they got HT.<br>

As it stands right now, I would have to say no.  <p><img border=0 src="http://home.villagephotos.com/2003-7/16252/Sigs/Coltrane2.jpg"/>
