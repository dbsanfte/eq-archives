My little MA is rocking. Yes I know low level MA's do that, but I've levelled enough of them through the golden levels to know relative increases in power when I see them. I'm talking about killing stuff  my fixer on live (very very very twinked with liz vector that crits for 1250 at level 37) has trouble with. My MA on test was also 37 in that example. Mind you- this is with a self made MA with ZERO outside buffs, and mission implants. My fixer is twinked to the gills and get gargantua on him for chrissakes. Also it's looking like controlled D nano's are breaking offensive init/movement nano's. Gotta LOVE that. &quot;Hello Mr. NT rooting me in PvP, oh what? it terminated instantly like I had rage on? Too bad, you die now.&quot;<br><br>Let's see what the masses think. There's no better testing than on live anyway with hundreds of MA's instead of 4 or 5. For the most part, let me just say that from my observations on test, we're much better. We were VERY bad, so take that statement in context. If they make SA's work with weapons equipped at this point, I'd say we're back on even ground with enforcers. That's what I see as the big stopper. We still can't overequip. We can at least zone/get debuffed now however. It's very nice when fighting traders! ALso bear in mind that that bow SA is untested due to lack of arrow parts in shop terms. If that is as good as it looks like it might be, what a great way to start a PvP. Hit them with a nice arrow poison DoT on top of the forthcoming shen!! Even if we're talking about using a QL 90 bow at level 160 it's still added damage for them to deal with at no cost to us.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udevinlonehawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Devin Lonehawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#660000>(2/27/02 7:52:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1708.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I quit the MA class</span><hr size=1> It would be a shame if you were to the put Celistiness in storage.  After having endured so much from FC's form of luvin, there is now a sliver of hope for the MA class.  I just hope that this patch is the beginning of many down the line that will ultimately address the many issues of our chosen prof.<br><br>I for one have had the benefit of Cel's pointers, help and consideration in teams multiple times.  We up and coming MAs need all the MAs up there to look up to.<br><br>But, I do hope you reconsider.  There are some good things stated on the 13.8 patch notes.  But then again, the  MA community is holding its collective breath.  The 'break root' while engaged in battle is disturbing.  Cel, or all of your toons for that matter, as an avid PvP no doubt frown on this issue.<br><br>What I did last night was tested the MA blades just to get a baseline pre 13.8.  The first thing I'll do post 13.8 patch is to play with the same blades and make comparisons.  These were ql30s Taichis.  If they pan out, I'll invest IPs in the necessary skills for higher QLs.<br><br>Will be looking out for Cel and company on the friends list.  Will be more than happy to apply MA buffs to your other toons. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udevinlonehawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Devin Lonehawk</A> at: 2/27/02 8:06:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tofumasta>tofumasta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#660000>(2/27/02 10:07:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1708.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I quit the MA class</span><hr size=1> everyone is whining and quiting why? the ma class is not that bad. if i was able to beat bagdar &quot;lvl169 soldier at the time&quot; in a duel while i was  lvl 159 there is no reason mas suck. you have to get your dodge up and F%$ stupid extra brawl clusters and ma wepons. with capped skills at lvl 161 and maxed dodge with ri and imps mas dodge rating is higher then most profs attack unless they are lvl 190 plus. evades evades evades. and dont worry about having acs since they dont do jack!!!! i tested acs on vet mobs 5k acs then 0 acs. i took 280 damage with 5k i took 400ish with 0 acs. i think the evades speak for themselves.
