Publius, at lvl 61 dimach is still fairly effective, but as you get higher, NTs can nuke for just as much as your dimach, and it barely scratches most MOBs.  If its purpose is just as an emergency bail-out I think that the damage should scale better at higher levels.  This still wouldn't affect PvP because of the 40% cap rule, but it would make the dimach much for useful against MOBs.  So basically, instead of a straight linear increase, it should be a little more exponential. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udharkaronavenger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DharkaronAvenger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#660000>(12/13/01 8:09:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1474.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nano discussion #4: confusing nano lines</span><hr size=1> Just wanted to throw in my two creds here...<br>
For reference, I'm a 97 MA on RK1, and I shape my character for PvP above all.<br>
<br>
First, if you're an Atrox, go reroll right now.<br>
<br>
Second, I agree that Dimach is relatively useless as it applies to PvM, let alone PvP. I would raise it enough to use Shen at level 100ish if you're lucky (I haven't been), but I wouldn't spend any more IPs on the skill than necessary.<br>
<br>
Third, there are some general conceptions about MAs that I don't agree with. The most popular are probably 1) run speed should be maxed, 2) we should keep Duck skill high, and 3) Abilities (Sta, Agi, etc.) should be implanted. <br>
<br>
I don't think Run Speed is all that important to most MAs. Mine is around 145 unbuffed, but even before I bought a plane it didn't bother me much to take a little extra time running to missions if it meant I wouldbe more deadly when I arrived. Run Speed could be useful in PvP, but I'd feel guilty about running around like that in a fight, and to maximize the effectiveness of the tactic you would also need a Movement Predictor of fairly high QL.<br>
<br>
I don't keep Duck high because the only players I need it against are Traders and some Enforcers. I don't really stand a snowball's chance in hell against Enforcers, and if I can't kill the Trader outright I'm never going to anyway, so why delay the inevitable by reducing his crits?<br>
<br>
Finally, although I doubt most MAs keep permanent implants in to raise Abilities, I strongly recommend against it. The implant slots could usually be used for much more valuable clusters. Make some secondary implants to raise your Agility, and use them only temporarily to equip new armor.<br>
<br>
With the IPs I save on those skills, I managed even before my title skill caps to keep Nano Pool and Body Dev maxed every level, as well as keeping nano skills very high (Bio Met, Sense Imp, and Psy Mod are currently all maxed, Bio Met at over 500 skill, and T&amp;S will be maxed in three levels or less). I began casting VS at level 80 or 81, Greater Healing Touch at 91, and Fists of the Polar Star at 92 or 93.<br>

I agree that you shouldn't keep it maxed, but 145?.......In my book run speed = exp, and the reason why is very simple.  Have you ever been in a group where your puller grabbed too many and the whole group got slaughtered, yourself included?  Keep your run speed high enough and you can outrun them and not lose however much exp you would have.  For example, now that we've all graduated to medusas, it's not fun if you die and lose 2 million exp because of a bad pull.  My run speed has saved my ass many times, whereas if I had 145 run speed I would have died for sure.<br>
Now if dying isn't such a big deal to you, then by all means forget I said anything =p  I guess I'm like this because I used to play D2 Hardcore, where if you died, you DIED, period, character gone, equipment gone, months of work gone.  Anyone ever PvP in D2 Hardcore?  Now those were the biggest rushes I've ever gotten from a game.  PvP in AO is child's play by comparison.  The most important things for survival in hardcore were #1: HP #2: Speed.  Anyways, I'm going way off topic so I'll stop. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ustorminsao.showPublicProfile?language=EN>StorminSAO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#660000>(12/14/01 2:10:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1474.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nano discussion #4: confusing nano lines</span><hr size=1> &gt;Ok putting my shen SS back up. <br>

(And the wonderful give line lol) but what about cohort and horde (The team MA nano buffs) or have those been removed?<br>
<br>
Personally, I agree, it's not worth raising mat met...I *might do it at level 150ish (whenever my stats max out, that way i spend the least amount of ip possible on a skill that has limited uses) But I have always wondered about the horde and cohort skills...like if it's a stackable effect with normal buffs. (Like team heals, you can use them solo, just seems to take 2-3 seconds longer for it to acknowledge the extra heal). So maybe the buffs *would be worth it, if it stacks with our normal(mastery/lesser controlled) one...<br>
<br>
Overall tho, Mat Met is still more useful than mat crea in the long run lol.<br>
<br>
BTW, where the hell is the nano GREATER controlled rage? You know, the one that adds 40 to ma, and 50 to phys init AND stacks with mastery....<br>

<br>
For some reason i did a Atrox MA, sure if i could choose today i would go solitus. But it's not that bad. I'm able to cast VS at level 81 too.<br>
  The main problem is that you loose some extra heals if you are an atrox and you have dark blue Int. I sure as hell won't reroll because of it =)<br>

<br>
I said at the beginning of my post that my character is shaped exclusively for PvP. I almost never put IPs into anything that isn't useful to me in PvP, and Run Speed falls into that category. I can accept a higher risk of death and exp loss as long as the IPs I save make me more effective in combat.<br>
<br>
I seldom fight anyone using a shotgun. Those that I do fight are exclusively Traders, and my chances against a decent Trader are laughably slim anyway, so I don't bother working up Duck. <br>

----------------------<br>
the transfer lines are junk, someone was one some reeaaally good chit when they thought those up.<br>
The str. buffs are minor damage boosts.  Post 90 i'm seeing an increase in damage based on str but it was a 10 point per hit increase going from a 263 str to a 300 str ( buffed in both cases ),  assuming you aren't hitting for min damage any way.  This increase moved my MA skill a whopping 4 points buffed, and imo that doesn't account for the increase proportionate to the 567 ma skill I run with. <br>
<br>
That said, I will not be going for muscle boost any time in the near future, the points are better spent directly into the stat then into a nano skill that isn't realistically used for anythign else.<br>
----------------------<br>
Okay, as to the usefullness of a Fast Attack, it's there.  I doubt most MA's have played around with Flurry of Blows, and I'm not recommending dumping 5k ip into the skill or anything, but, Flurry of Blows does NOT work as the description described it.  Near as my enforcer partner and myself have been able to figure out, here's the skinny:  1)  it does increase melee init by a nice chunk for those of you that use a weapon  2) It appears your chance to Crit.  I say appears because I can only go off personal conviction here, i don't have a log parner for AO.  <br>
<br>
That's the only possible connection i can see to hand to hand skills is the Flurry of Blows connection  crit increase.  I do use a low level Flurry of Blows and it has come in handy on many many occasions.<br>

<br>
As reference i'm a 92 'fex MA on RK2.  I disagree pretty strongly on str and sta not being important to MA's.  With brawl taking both and ma and brawl using strength in the long run yeah, these are important, not to mention hit point max's.  I also think the advice to restart if your an Atrox MA is pretty bad advice, not all breeds play the same but professional skill wise, there is very little difference under 100 for any breed, yes the int is dark blue, much like Sta is dark blue for opifex, in neither case is this dibilitating, and if you want to base a decision to reroll on that and the ability to use programs we should all be Nano breed.  Especially with the consideration that some don't think str and sta matters to the profession <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Given the way that evasion skills work, it's questionable as to the value of sense ( god knows the sense /  agi armors have wholes out can drive a cargo through in the protections ).<br>

I keep my Strength and Stamina fairly near max, and in fact due to implants my Strength is at about 360 right now. The main reason I would reroll an Atrox is that they get less nano for their IPs.
