<br>
That works just fine, actually. And in theory, I can understand where you're coming from. But in practice, the bulk of powergers do not adhere to rule 2, and there is no way--in code--to prevent them from doing so. In fact, most, if not all, of these games are built around the predication that these folks will be doing exactly that, and instead of addressing the problem, they cater to it. If you want examples, I can give you plenty, but I'm pretty sure you know what I refer to.<br>
<br>
As for #1, again, it's due to developer response and the company's self-imposed &quot;customer service&quot; limitations.<br>
<br>
So yes, in theory, I agree it should be like you say. In practice, and in reality, it's anything but.<br>
<br>
And with that, I'm gettin some sleep. :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrimhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 320<br> <font color=#660000>(10/4/01 8:00:55 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> An example of what I'm talking about....</span><hr size=1> This is an EQ example so bear with me. My old EQ guild (still get spam mail from them) is a small to mid-size guild so doing planar raids always takes the help of another small to mid-size guild. An alliance was formed, friendships made, and a reoccuring bi-weekly/monthly day to raid Fear was established on the Server Raid calender. It has been going on for months now. Most guilds respect the raid calender and it pretty cut and dried who raids what and when. Until patch day.<br>
<br>
The Uber guilds have declared that on patch day they in essence do away with the raid calender to take out the bigger boss mobs like Casiz Thule and the other Planes baddies. My old guild has been screwed twice this way because Weds is their normal raid day for Fear. So, everyone who has signed up for their Fear raid (sorry if you have never played EQ, but this is the most appropriate example that's on my mind at the moment) basically either sits around out side the portal waiting for scraps from the larger guild or goes and does something else even though the raid has been scheduled long before the patch was announced. This is what I'm talking about when I say PGs can ruin the fun and play of other ppl in the game.<br>
<br>
All of the ppl in the Uber guilds have been 60 for months, have just about every item from most of the big hard dungeons, and basically have done it all. THe lower mobs in the Planes mean nothing to them as they have raped them many, many times for loot in the past. Their argument is that it takes too long for the smaller/lower guilds to clear their way to CT, so they find it easier to just rape the zone until they can get to the big boy. Verant (even if they wanted to) can do nothing about it because it is a player designed raid system, so petitions fall on deaf ears. Now is this &quot;fair&quot;? Of course not. Can the lower level and smaller guilds do anything about it? Nope, not a thing. <br>
<br>
Basically Verant screwed up when buffing the head bosses and letting them drop much desired &quot;uber&quot; gear that 55+ players could use. THat was their fault. The fault of the PGs is to assume that they deserve that loot at the expense of other ppls. It is that reason why I left that game and fear that this game will soon follow with the advent of &quot;uber&quot; loot. <br>
Can anyone justify the actions of the PGs? If you can, please let me know so that I can understanf it, because I think it is 100% horeshit. Sorry about the EQ example, but I think it gets my point across nicely.<br>

<br>
As far as power gamers go, I dont really see a huge problem as long as teh dungeons will &quot;spawn&quot; new copies of themselves.  If one is overcamped or some high level is farming you can just leave and come into another dungeon.<br>
<br>
yea I was exagerating a bit about how I go through SP games.  About one every week or two.  Basically after I feel that I have the game down very well.  MP games last much longer like Q3A, UT, Mech4.  Pure single player games dont last that long.  For a year and a half though, I didnt buy a new game because EQ was enough.

A huge friggan problem! My point is that just because a group of ppl spends countless hours online building up, leveling up, doing all the &quot;uber&quot; shit that they do, that does NOT give them the right to go and do as they please. Especially at the expense of other ppls who spend the exact same amount of money for the &quot;service&quot; that they do. And yes, EQ saved me some money in games, as has AO, but I'm finding out that I'd rather pay for single player games than go through all of the political horeshit that tends to get generated with MMORPGs.<br>

It's just a game, but when you have such a large amount of people playing it, things from teh real world start coming in.  If you think the political bullshit only happens in MMORPG's you are wrong.  Any guild/clan/faction of most any online game has some sort of politicial structure.  The larger that is and the larger the clan is, the more people that will get steped on.  Uber guilds are like large corporations, there isnt much you can do against them unless the blatently break the rules (and then sometimes they just get their wrist slaped).<br>

Lets say that they drop &quot;Uber&quot; loot into the game.  In specific dungeons on specific mobs.<br>
<br>
Lets say Uber guild A beats your group to the dungeon and gets 90 people into it via creative grouping to make it easy for them.   So you and your buds jum in in a team.

And end up in an COMPLETELY NEW AND FRESH DUNGEON.. with the SAME mobs and the SAME LOOT. Therby eleminating almost completely the theory of &quot;Uber&quot; loot.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hm. The way I read it, static dungeons would support &quot;X&quot; number of people at a time, and until that &quot;X&quot; was reached, you'd only have one instance of it, regardless of teams and whatnot. So... uber-groups would split into teams of just-enough-to-0wn-the-solo-spawn. This means they'd have the instance, they'd own the spawn, and no new ones would spawn until and unless a team got big enough or powerful enough to spawn a new instance. I'd imagine it'd determine population by maybe counting team members on the inbound.<br>
<br>
The thing is, Grim, whatever system Funcom puts in place to make it work, these types of people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> find holes in it to use that won't get them banned, and use it over and over. And since powergamers spend far more time online than non-, it will be simple for them to post &quot;Access Denied&quot; signs on the door of every static spawn in the game, should they choose.<br>
<br>
Just like Everquest.<br>
<br>
&quot;How? Because as long as new dungeons keep spawning there is no cause for alarm. Becaus that same &quot;Uber&quot; loot will also keep spawning. It is more of a token reward for completeing a dungeon that a Piece of UBErNESS.&quot;<br>
<br>
And again, it can't be just a token reward or it won't be worth getting, and the powergamers will wail to the high heavens, and Funcom will try to placate them--as they've done in the past. No reason to suspect that dynamic will change. And see above: new dungeons won't keep spawning, because they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> figure out how to manage it so they don't.<br>
<br>
And I know lots of people won't believe me, which is more than fine. Bookmark this thread. If you stay in the game more than 3 months after these places are put in, come back and re-read this. :)<br>
<br>
(For myself, I don't believe the 'Com has the management, coding, or design skills to make any new content changes even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> functional</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in a 90-day span, but that's an entirely different thread.)<br>

What I meant when I said Verant screwed up was that by changing the top mobs in the Planes to drop &quot;uber&quot; loot, it brought the &quot;uber&quot; guilds back to planes when most of them had already gone in lieu of bigger and better things. I mean hell, they got an entire expansion to play around with, why tempt them back into an already overcrowded venue where they would disrupt a system that was trucking along fine without them? The smartest thing Verant ever did was put level caps on the two Dragons from the original game, and implement the no-loot rule for mobs that were green in the Warrens. That helped keep some of the higher lvl farmers away from areas where they really had no business.<br>
<br>
Ok, enough about EQ and it's problems. All I wanted to do is show a correlation between Powergamers out of control and casual gamers who suffered because of it. We got way off base from the Sensei's original topic. I think the static dungeon idea where once it reached a certain number of ppl switches over to a &quot;fresh&quot; dungeon is a good idea and a step in the right direction. All the other stuff is just my opinion on the whole sorted mess.<br>

It's easier than you think, Publius. Here's how I did it:<br>

1. Yank the internet connection out; RJ45 if you're DSL, phone line if you're modem.<br>

2. Load up any recent single player game; for me it was Mechwarrior 4.<br>
<br>
3. Play it for a day or two.<br>
<br>
4. Then go play AO. Or try. Compare/contrast what it's like to play a fun, worry-free functional game as opposed to a fun, frustrating, broken game.<br>
<br>
Then ask yourself if it's worth it. For myself, I loaded up AC again last night and played around for a couple of hours, and that is the most fun I have had playing an MMOG in three months. No crashes. No timewarps. No broken functionality. No disconnects. No graphics lag. No server lag. Just a clean, fun, working game. It's not as pretty, and it doesn't have as many features (can't tell you how many times I right-clicked to wear something, only to have the ID screen pop up), and it doesn't let me set my fists on fire... but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> everything works like it's supposed to, and I didn't crash <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> once</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
I hadn't realized how much I missed playing a functional, worry-free game. And I'll never be suckered in by pretty graphics again... though I will certainly miss them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ujaqrabbit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaqrabbit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#660000>(10/6/01 11:03:16 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/mcallahan/icons/punisher5.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ROFL, Alianna</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2.

I finally finished Deus Ex!  Cool ending, although the final cutscene was a bit shorter than I'd anticipated.  Oh well, got two more endings to find.<br>
<br>
And I'll concur with this basic strategy.  I played the Max Payne demo for just an hour or two and decided to cancel my AO account. That's all it took for me to realize that the fun per second rate can be a hell of a lot higher than it is in AO.  And I really don't have the time to waste doing something I don't enjoy, particularly not when I could be doing something ELSE that I'll enjoy MORE. <p>~Jaqrabbit<br>
