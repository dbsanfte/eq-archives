The guy who owned the char decided he was quiting EQ and wanted to give his char to me (said he didn't want to sell to anyone.)<br>
<br>
He passed me the acct information and said the cd's would follow in a few days via email.  Assuming Dezyr was now mine I playd him for a few days and even trasnferred some items onto him to relieve my other char of weight and space in inventory.  Among those things was a tantors tusk (worth about 8-13 k.)<br>
<br>
The real owner of Dezyr logged on another acct and asked me to give him the new pass since he wanted to say last goodbyes to some of his friends in EQ.  I did that, and told him to mail Cd's only when he was really ready to say goodbye.  (I forgot about the Tantors Tusk in his inventory maybe thinking that I was getting the char back soon anyways.)<br>
<br>
A week passed and no cd's, no email, nothing.  Finally I saw Dezyr online and sent him a tell to find out it was a NEW owner.  (The original owner I guess decided to go back on his word and that he indeed wante some dolars fo his char, so he sold it.) The new owner claimed to have a char on a blue server and a few lowbies on RZ.  I told him who I was explained all this and asked if I can have the Tantors back.  He told me to go take a hike basically as he had asked the original owner about the tantors and was told it was his to have.  I asked him to talk to the original owner again Im sure he would clarify I should have my item back, but the new guy said nope Im sorry and I heard he sold it in the bazaar.<br>
<br>
<br>
So the char Dezyr is now my personal KOS untill he pays 10 k or returns a TT back to me.  Some of my friends have decided to back me up on this KOS and will also be wiping the floor with him in upcoming days.  I want everyone to know this story, if you think I was wronged and want to back me up please do so, I think chances are Ill get the TT back if more ppl help out.<br>

<br>
Razzinel.  I let you use my account yes.  did you enjoy playing it.  you didnt care at all when you thought you ewre getting it for free.  <br>
<br>
Now lets move onto when i told my brother he could have it and do whatever he wanted with it.  I talk to some people on MSN and they tell me to come read this.  <br>
<br>
Sure I quit EQ.  You left something on my char when my brother got it back.  Then complain about not having it.  All I can ask you is why did you leave it on a cleric when your warrior uses it in the first place?<br>
<br>
KOS'ing someone for yeour own personal reasons is total BS and you would never let any of us do it in the guild.  Now you turning and doing it yourself makes you look ridiculous.<br>
<br>
KOS my old char all you want man.  You want to make this game un-enjoyable for another person suit yourself. maybe they'll quit too.<br>
<br>
My point of this whole post was to show you how rediculous you sound.  KOS a char that doesnt know whats going on.  Tell ppl about stuff that I supposidly said to you in order to gain there side.  I can see Razzinel going downhill fast.<br>
<br>
But hey.  Do whatever you can to make people like you huh.  This is what I have always seen.  <br>
<br>
I will come back and post to clarify any mis-understandings anyone has.  But in my eyes Razzinel wants to pick on someone he can.  Hell I think he kinda always wanted to random PK ppl.  He likes PVP enough.<br>

return the item that doesn't belong to you or &quot;your little brother&quot; <br>

since it was once your character i assume there is no doubt that the item in question doesnt belong to you<br>

<br>
don't make me, make you look ridiculous infront of the entire EQ community...I suggest you stop posting BS lies because with you're next post that is as ignorant as the last one Ill post ...your e-mails to me plus what all ex-ood members saw on your goodbye letter from EQ.  Namely you GAVE me Dezyr's account.  You made it 100% clear to everyone Razzinel will be Dezyr's new owner.  That is the reason why when I transferred Tantors onto Dezyr It didn't even cross my mind this could happen, I kinda trusted your word about this account. My bad for thinking it was beneath you to lie like that.  <br>
<br>
I only use the Tantors in PVP jousting it is one of the heaviest items I have in my inventory, I was dual boxing Razzinel (my char) plus Dezyr (who I though was now my other char.)  Razzinel was in the RED carrying more in inventory then he had a weight capacity for so I shifted some items of MINE from my char to another char I thought was mine, knowing I can shift back after banking at any time later on.  A Dezyr who has now quit EQ and has said to all ex OOD plus me I am leaving my acct to Razzinel ,contacts me in game (hours after I moved items) asking me for the new pass so he can still say his last goodbyes to some friends in EQ...character SOLD.  I gave it to you offcourse, never even crossed my mind you were planing on taking it back without telling me anything.  For crying out loud man, if you had told me I changed my mind, I  wanna sell my acct instead of giving it to you or I wanna give it to my brother.....&quot; Razz give me my char back/pass etc,&quot; I would have taken my TT back and gave you the pass back anyways.  You are such a BS artist man.<br>
<br>
Seriously unless you enjoy public humiliation do yourself a favor and don't post anymore BS.<br>
<br>
The (new owner) of the account is KOS for having an item not belonging to him, and knowingly not returning it back to its rightfull owner.  Its HIS choice.  I asked him for the Tantors back while he still had it, asked him to clarify with the person he bought the acct from that the TT was not his, he laughed and said no way. He can get of that KOS very easily by giving me the item or an equivalent amount of pp for the item back at any time.  Simple as that.<br>
