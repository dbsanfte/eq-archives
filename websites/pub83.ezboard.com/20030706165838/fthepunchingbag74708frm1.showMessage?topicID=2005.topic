Last night another MA friend sent me a /tell asking if I'd seen any BoPs in the shops since the patch.  Scratching my head, I didn't remember seeing a single one.  I've seen some Attacks of Snake, some Angels of Night, but not one single Bird of Prey or Blessed With Thunder.   I even looted a Bright Blue Cloudless Sky in a chest (not that it does me any good, I'll stick with my BWT, thankya).<br>
<br>
But I thought I'd take a quick, informal poll and see if anyone else has had the same experience.  Maybe it was just a bad night for him -- he visited every store in Omni Trade, Entertainment, and Rome and came up empty.<br>

I talked lenghtly with a GM and in the end, I reported it as a bug and they logged it like this. I haven't seen a single BoP higher then QL 47 on sale anywhere after the patch. I got mine (QL 48 one) from a Basic General Shop before the patch. I have never seen any BwT's on sale, but I didn't check them before the patch as I was then too low lvl. At least I don't recall any such attack on sale in Basic shop.<br>
<br>
So I guess this is another &quot;feature&quot;, I reported it and they registered it as a bug as well, after some investigation. If more people report this, maybe it can be pushed so far that these items will be on sale soon again.<br>
<br>
As for other attacks - anyone really uses Angel of Night? This is pathetic attack really - while it sure does deliver a nice smack (unless it get's parried), it locks the MA skill down for WAY too long time. I had once 3 missions and I used AoN at the end of the first mission, and after that, my MA skill was locked out during the time I spent on the next 2 missions with the travelling time included. Just as I killed the last NPC in the last mission, I got the message &quot;MA skill available&quot;. I stashed my AoN away from that moment on, and haven't used it since. It's especially weird seeing that the AoN requires Martial Arts and Riposte as skills, while - for example - BoP uses MA and Dimach. Riposte as such does recycle almost 2 times as fast as Dimach.. So OK, since AoN sure delives a punch, it can have some longer delay, but not as long as it is now, as it's really worthless as it is now. I gave my examples to that GM too and he forwarded this to dev team as well, for checking. Maybe the recycle delay is too long for AoN, sure aint worth using it atm...<br>
<br>
But yes, I haven't seen a single BoP (QL 47+) after the patch on sale, neither have my friends. On missions I haven't got any MA attacks ever, and have never seen BwT anywhere either... Tricky.<br>

do you really wanna tell me that you completed 2 missions in 7 minutes? (recharge time of AoN is 450 seconds...) yeah sure and i can 1hit kill a lvl 200 atrox-enforcer.<br>
try to use dimach and riposte at the same time... do you still sure that riposte recharge twice as fast as dimach? <br>

But it does recycle faster. I have used Dimach, then Riposte (in that order) and after some time, I got Riposte back and Dimach was unavailable for quite some more time. Maybe not twice, my bad, but for a longer time indeed.<br>
<br>
I used AoN when I got ganked by 2 mobs at the end of the area (&quot;kill&quot; NPC and his goon). I had rather high QL one, it took literally all my nano. I hit one - toughest one - for 240 (which was very good damage for that level), but other NPC who was around and &quot;in range&quot; for MA attack (judging by the look) didn't get a single point of damage. At least the first one was almost dead from that hit.. I finished that mission, moved on to next ones, which weren't too big, but definately bigger then &quot;couple of rooms&quot;. I still had no MA skill available until the end. I did these missions fast, yes, but not too fast, as my 20 minute nano buffs dropped shortly after those missions. I buffed with them before the first mission, and ran through missions with the same buffs (missions were in Tir, in Old Subway was one and others were within some 100 meters from it).<br>
<br>
Sure, maybe it was me jinxed somehow, I don't know. It had no AoE effect when I used it, and it sure was &quot;blacked&quot; out for quite some time. Note that I was at that time low level - lvl 20'ish or even tad below - so I didn't spend on mob even quarter the time to kill it then I spend now on them. They died then fast - few hits, couple of Brawls and down they went. I asked the GM if such a long delay on my AoN attack was normal, and he said it wasn't. I haven't used it since, but guess I need to try it again, based on your post, maybe it was something with my game, which made it screw up like this..<br>
<br>
But still, I haven't seen a single BwT in any missions I have done by now, and I have done them a lot now. Not as a loot, not as a reward. Neither any higher QL BoP then QL 47 ones either. Those missions have been single player ones, though. Maybe the luck is better in Team Missions.<br>
