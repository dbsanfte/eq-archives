<br>
L65 Wizard with 250 AA<br>
Internet Connection: DSL<br>
Timezone: PST<br>
Played for: Alittle over 2 years<br>
<br>
Play Times: As much as possible~ <br>
<br>
History : I started out on Luclin server and played in some high end guilds there (Velious stuff back in the day).  I was friends with Insidious Blood (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.insidiousblood.net">www.insidiousblood.net</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> ) on that server, oh and i left in good standing with everyone...if you need to talk to people over there send a tell to Chopasuey, Malifor, Malitress, Skrilla, Fistanyght etc etc.I got bored with blue servers so i decided to server xfer over to a PvP.<br>
<br>
Less than a year ago i came to this server and was naked and friendless.  I joined ES and was a distinguished member up until this point.  I deguilded because of the drama with Orraden, didnt want my guild (in a weakened state) being messed with.  Basically what happened is I was in Halls of Honor trying to get Yueyenie a rez from a MM cleric.  A pet was sent on me so i nuked him back to zero.  After that i apologized and he responded with KoS...not too big but i dont have anything to hide.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I AM NOT TRYING TO GET ORRADEN KoS TO AD.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Just dont want people thinking thats why im apping.<br>
<br>
Reasons for wanting to Join:  Basically ES cant raid anymore and thats what i like to do most in this game.  I want to hang out with my friends and kill big mobs.  I've always wanted to join AD but ive always felt a moral obligation to ES to stick it out since they were the ones that took me in when I was naked and no one would talk to me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=819353">www.magelo.com/eq_view_pr...num=819353</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I know my gear is alittle lacking but after server xfering i had gotten my epic (again) and full ToV/Ssra gear but it ended up rotting on my corpse because i had to spend some time in the hospital.  I dont want sympathy so im not gonna even go into that,feel free to send me a tell in game if you really need to know.<br>
<br>
Feel free to post any other questions as i have more answers. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->         <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=povverx@ascension10244>povverx</A> at: 10/2/03 10:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=carnagexx>Carnagexx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#333333>(10/2/03 12:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=574.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: povverx Wiz app</span><hr size=1> povverx is one of my best friends from ES...he is also great friends with yueyenie...he essentially came from a bluebie server naked about 1 year ago or so and i have been guilded with him for 9 months in ES.  He is a great guy and very unselfish guildee always willing to help...he has mega high playtime as he has amassed most of his aa while in es as i remember him coming to the server with about as many aa as myself when he came.  he outleveled me by like 100aa since then.  I cant say enough great things about him other then i would trust him with anything.  He is extremely loyal as he has stayed with ES thru everything.  He is very quiet but determined and i know you guys will enjoy having him as a guildee someday.<br>

I have known him in game for about a year when I meant him quading in ME, after he transfered onto this server from a blue server.  At the time I was in ES and help recuit him in.  Since then I have nothing be good things to say about him.  High play time, alot of exp, also on for raids, and helping other members.  Also a first class wizard player on RZ.  He was only guilded in ES, I know he was in a first class guild on the blue server, but I dont know which one.<br>
<br>
As far as the incident with Orraden.  I was in HoH with povverx, we where kiting mult mobs trying to exp faster and I died.  Well 2 MIM zone in and one was a clr.  So Povverx ask the Clr to ress me, immediately following Orraden zone in and started fighting then.  Been impatient I just ran back and zoned in.  No help was given to anyone during the fight but it seems the Orraden attack Povverx with his pet.  I do have a SS of these and can proved it if nessaccessy.   After MIM killed Orraden, Povverx message Gloriya, asked why he was attacked, she replied it was an accident.  But when he messaged Orraden, Orraden said he was KOS he didnt care if he attack him first or not.  I spoke with Gloryia who was trying to straighten it all out, but Orraden refused to speak to her afterwards.<br>
<br>
I knew Povverx was planning on appling to AD, was just waiting to get a few more AAs and more playtime, before he posted.  Povverx was worried about the KoS affecting his post for recuitment.  I explained to Povverx that if he wanted to apply from recuitment to AD he would first need to deguild, which is what he did, and not attack any DoZ, but try to work out the KoS.  I told him to be honest about it in his application and continue to try to resolve it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malio1>Malio1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mr. Hotkey</span><br>  Posts: 2120<br> <font color=#333333>(10/2/03 3:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=574.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.nuvox.net/~on.malhavok/maliosm.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: povverx Wiz app</span><hr size=1> <br>
Not a very good app.  <br>
<br>
How about some background.  Why did you leave ES?  What are your play times?  List a Magelo, etc. etc.   Don't really care about the Orraden drama at this point, tell us about you.  K thnx!<br>

<br>
Here's what happened: Orraden's pet ended up on Povverx. I really don't care how that happened. Wether it was result of beneficial spell casted on MiM member (yes Invisibility and see invisible or DS are considered beneficial spells and are available to Wizard), or if he dispelled/rooted pet (hard to prove who did it) or Orraden mistargeted (shit happends) but instead of &quot;hey dude, mind calling your pet off?&quot;, Povverx manaburned and got Yuenyue to use his AD recruit status to threaten Orraden.<br>
<br>
I absolutely do NOT mind solving problems and issues in PvP. I absolutely dont mind using manaburn in pvp as last (or rather first and only) resort. What I do mind is when people start shit and then try to get others involved against people they dislike.<br>
<br>
I have little doubt in my mind that all of this was started as a provocation. Eximos war with us started much in the same way (Tekas buffing MiM in BoT, pet aggroing because of beneficial spells, Tekas attacking Orraden and demanding apologies from US for pet attacking). Entire thing was provocation by Tekas, Eximos and few other dickheads. This seems to be going exactly same way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sighkoxblumpkin>Sighkox Blumpkin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#333333>(10/4/03 4:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=574.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: MiM killed Orraden?</span><hr size=1> Funny....my brother who doesnt even play a rogue killed Orraden solo with this gnome. <p>Gnome &gt; all<br>

The reason why you dont care how the pet got on povverx is because u cant explain it other then to push it off on &quot;o orraden is an angel and he would never do that&quot;  Either way his pet was on povverx and povverx defend himself...it shouldnt have been on povverx in the first place since he was not showing any aggression to orraden.  No more drama on this app with this issue please.<br>

At no time did I ever theaten anyone in your guild.  I was asked by Gloriya what happened and tried to resolve the issue by talking, not PvPing, but Orraden refused to speak to her about it, and she later said the Povverx might be KoS.  I simply informed her, he was applying to AD and if he was KoS to post his KoS on his recuitment form to let an AD officer handle the matter as they saw fit.  <br>
<br>
At no time did I ever try to have any of you guys put on KoS.  I have only use dipliamatic reasourses to try to resolve the KoS, instead of just PvP.<br>
<br>
Example : I said to povverx not attack any DoZ, but try to work out the KoS.<br>

Think we already get that picture clear you guys solve all your problems with PvP, instead of trying to talk, find out what really happened and fix the situation first.<br>
<br>
I think you should go back and retalk to Orraden again, get the story clear, as you wherent even in the zone when it happened.  No one has said anything about KoSing any of you guys or demanding apologies from you guys for pet attacking.  <br>
<br>
This is an application thread not and verdict of war order.  Povverx is only asking for a dipliamatic solution to resolve a KoS matter that wasnt even his fault.<br>

<br>
Spoken like a true hippocrite. Didn't your own guild (ES) started your ill fated war against doz because I allegedly charmed elementals on your raid in BoT? Didn't you refuse us any chance to talk or/and explain ourself during 4 days when we didn't fight back against you per our guildleaders orders?<br>
<br>
I am not sure what kind of diplomatic solution you tried. As far as I am concerned Gloryia was not at that time an officer of DoZ, I was online at that point and have not recieved a single tell from neither you nor Povverx.<br>
<br>
This is an attempt to simply slander our guild and once again get other people to fight your fight. This has happened several times in past and your responce here is nothing more than a further attempt to do it.<br>
<br>
Do you know who are officers of DoZ? Not many of us, its me. Tempra is a guildleader. Have you spoken to either me or Tempra to resolve this? Answer is NO. What have you done after you and your friend interfered in our guildwar? You havent said a word to either me or tempra, you went on AD board and tried to instigate something.<br>
<br>
Do you know how DoZ handles similar situation? If someone assists in pvp, I send direct tell to an officer of that persons guild. If a person involved interfered because he or she didn't know, we ask that person stops interfering and we let it go. Completely! We forget it ever happened.<br>
<br>
Have either of you even ATTEMPTED to resolve this with DoZ, this post would never happen. Instead, you manaburn Orraden and come to AD board accusing us of being borderline Curse. I bet 10k if Curse has a choice whom to disc. HT me or you, it would be me. So keep your accusations to yourself.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is, you and your friend have not even attempted to resolve this with DoZ diplomatically. You have not even attempted to talk, you manaburned our member involved in pvp (yes I take his word over yours) and went straight to AD recruitment board claiming you were somehow wronged. I don't know what you talked about with Gloryia, but this attitude quite frankly scares me. If every single AD recruit starts manaburning people for any reason (if they look wrong) and then try to get AD involved because he can, why would we need Curse?<br>
<br>
I remember you and Povverx from our 3 wars with ES. I quite frankly remember your manaburns, manaburns, manaburns and more manaburns. If Carnagex was fun to fight with, you both pvped once every 2.5 hours, as soon as manaburn pops. It seems you solve all of your problems with click of a button and complaints on the board.<br>
<br>
I cannot stress this enough, neither Yuen or Povverx EVER attempted to talk to any DoZ officer. They manaburned a member engaged against 2 opponents and went straight to AD board to resolve it. I find their conduct cowardly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=carnagexx>Carnagexx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#333333>(10/4/03 10:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=574.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uhh huh.</span><hr size=1> sadko... povverx has the screenshot of orraden dead and MB is still up so stfu and move along to the commonwealth alliance k?

To be honest i didnt think the incident was such a big deal that it required dragging officers and drama into the situation.  I havent used my Manaburn in about 7 months.  I have screenshots if they are needed.<br>
<br>
The only reason this was even mentioned on my app was because i wanted to be totally honest with the members.  I never once claimed to have been &quot;wronged&quot; all i did was say what happened.  Have you ever seen me go to the DoZ website and even raise an issue out of this? or claim Orradan is a PKer?<br>
<br>
Basically i dont see why this is an issue at all.  Please keep this off of my application as the 2 things have nothing to do with each other.<br>

ps.
