Those of you that remember the incident should by now know that it was simply a miss understanding and not an act of a pker or revenge.<br>
I have a couple good friends in AD and would like to raid with them and  you guys and just maybe  you might get to know me and might even like me.  I was told that some of you have had issues with Polgra   if that is so I would like to know what those issues are,  I cant fix  the problem if  people don't tell me what they are. I know and those who know me well that I have helped more people in EQ then the few that I have upset, ask Seaclearra she knows. I have never ben a pker and  I am not about to start I have played EQ I think I know a little bit about how to play my wizard.  I didn't earn 160 AA's and level 65  by purchasing a twink.  Hope to from you guys and especially from those of you in AD that  have a bone to pick with me!

First off, I would like to say that your subject is in poor taste.  If you're trying to get on anyones good side, that is not the way of going about it mate.  Secondly, if you are applying again might I refer you to the standard application format located in a sticky at the top of the recruit board.<br>
<br>
As an answer to your question, yes I personally do remember the incident in question, and whethor or not it was a misunderstanding, I do think the right course of action was taken, not only from the sources, but your attitude given to those who questioned you.  To be nice I wont comment on your competancy to play a wizard, only give you a tip that if you want to make friends and clear up any bad history... and even gain maybe the minute possibility to be applicant, I would change my tone and choose my words carefully.<br>

but i do remember it was more than simply the chardok incident with kringe that was a problem.  For those people in AD who have problems with polgra please post or talk to her in game and let her know what they are/how to resolve if possible please.<br>
<br>
From what I recall of that situation it was an accident and handled poorly on most people's parts but then resolved.<br>

I was there that day when polgra MB kringe. <br>
It was a misunderstanding. Kringe sent polgra a tell asking for a TL to bind. Polgra told him ok. he zoned in and started attacking polgra.  Polgra took a step back becuause He didnt know why this guy was attacking him.  Then Kringe took that step forward and started attacking somemore,  Polgra MB kringe at that point. <br>
I know for a fact that not one thing was said in guild chat anything about corpsing people to drag them up there to do the King. I was under the impression we were going to fight our way up.<br>
And when I got corpsed someone sent me a tell saying that I was getting corpsed and dragged. Polgra did not receive that information. <br>
I tried to Iron it out with kringe, I told him why he was MB he said that he understood but I'm sure he was getting spam from guildmates and Tekas about the incident<br>
I've know Polgra a long time. Back when I used to play my warrior  Walamani in Shadow Gypsies  that is where I met Polgra. when I started playing my cleric  I saw polgra helping power lvl some friends of his in perma frost.  Next thing I knew polgra was powerlvling my cleric. <br>
I know that polgra hates Pk's and has never been one.<br>
I do know polgra is generous and always willing to help people camp Long boring camps for others to benefit. <br>
Polgra was in Macloudi clan during their war with reverant. as part of resolving the war Polgra had an incident of misconduct, Basically Polgra did to GHouldan what he did to him.  Anyways Polgra was removed from guild as part of peace negeotions and was made KOS to revenant. which btw Reverant wanted 50k to remove kos status. I think for the one incident that is excessive.  Really an officer told me  Ghouldan admitted to training polgra's group to his guild and said it was purely accidental. maybe it was accidental  but to kos someone who did the same thing to him and charge 50k is outrageous. I can see that polgra was thrown from a guild as a scapegoat  such a shame to let one person take the heat for the entire guild and have to pay 50k for a war/kos status I think Macloudi clan should have offered to help pay for that , after all It was their war not Polgra's<br>
matters not now. reverant has pretty much dissolved. <br>
I would like to see my friend apply and get a fair chance at recruitement. <br>

<br>
Ok since Seaclarra wasn't there, and many weren't I will clarify.  MC was at War with Rev, Rev was in Kael doing AoW.  Faypixie zoned in from WL to Kael and MC happened to be gathered there for zone camping, they killed Faypixie fast.  So I had Positive faction with Kael and I know that MC can't kill me, so I went all the way down to that zone in to kael, used harmshield, dragged Faypixie back towards the arena.  Let me stop for a second and explain some EQ game mechanics that MC seemed to be oblivious too.. If you are nonkos in a zone in Velious, and you drag a KOS person.. mobs will Aggro on you... this isnt an expliot as far as I know, if it is I apologize, but I believe that is an intended function.  So yea back to the story... Im dragging faypixie back to the arena to get a rez... guess what? giants are aggroing me left and right.. I get past the see invis guards and I FD... hey im sorry I dont want to train my raid, nor do I feel like dieing.  THE FUNNY PART:  All this time MC was following me, and they got hit by a nasty backwash.  How is this my fault? If I ghouldan MAKE a train that moves AWAY from my oppenants and they CHOOSE to follow ME, as I move AWAY from them, and then they DIE as a result.  How is that my fault?  Anyways all MC thought it sucked that they died so they said I trained.  <br>
<br>
MiM has charged Sadko what...200k to unkos? more I think? and that was over a war? is MiM unreasonable? No sadko was an ass to them during the war.  For the record I DID NOT set the price for unkos... I ASKED the guild, what they want.. we got 100k, 200k, never, 40k, most said 50k.. but for some people in the guild to be saying 200k, 100k, and never they must really dislike her.  I could say more but I wont, its not my intention to ruin her app, but if your gonna mention my name and not tell everything then I'll get into it, to clear my name, rev's name, or people who were in rev.<br>
Any number of members of rev who were members at the time can attest to this.  I have been playing this game for 5 years, no one has ever called me a lair, greedy, shaddy.. that is simply because I am not.<br>
<br>
Also, I am not here to hurt Polgra's App I havent said anything once that would imply how I feel about her personally or how she effected/dealt with the guild, I really dont like to harp on someone's app, its not my style.. I never have on this AD board once I think, and I don't want to start..But my name is brought up so I am clarifying that situation in the defense of myself and Rev, nothing else.  Please do not read into this and think I hate polgra or something, when I said she MB'd herself I only brought it up because it was a funny mistake.  Wether I dislike or hate polgra, or wether I don't, I believe is largely a non issue, and I know most will agree. But my name was brought into this thread about a situation that involved me and words like &quot;greedy&quot; and &quot;trained&quot; were used in the same sentance as &quot;Ghouldan&quot; so I think that gives me the right to reply.<br>

You sir are very honorable. I appeciate your explanation. I for one don't know what officer I spoke to but they did tell me that you said you did not mean to train them. my point was rather why so much kos money when you had just trained that guild. intentional or not, It had just happened. You yourself felt you didnt want to die so you FD. Same with polgra he didnt want to die to your train and he was there to pvp for war and he Nexus gated. In either case it looked bad.  You were at war MC, polgra was there to fight that war.  Polgra was disaplined for his actions. <br>
I will edit my public post where it implied that you were greedy I was refering to reverant wanting too much money for one said incident that reverant had just done to that same guild and person.<br>
and I remember that day Polgra MB himself.  I went in and rezzed him in pov. We both laughed about it, was hilarious. <br>

IMHO its too easy to come by pp to just buy off the people you have wronged.  I was all for kosing polgra for life after that incident.  Now I'd settle for a public apology, which with this guy's attitude I doubt we'll ever get.  And you can't say it was sour apples, half of MC joined rev after they broke up, and they were great members. /eye Kruunch!  That kind of behavior is Peacebreaker territory and we don't need that kind of stuff on our server.  If you wanna train and grief people, go to Sullon Zek.  So before you start trying to accuse Ghouldan of trying to shake down people like Jesse Jackson, find out the whole story or stay out of the discussion please, like I said 35 people had their night ruined because of this.  We play this game to have fun, so ruining that fun is the worst crime someone can commit.<br>
<br>
Heh when I was posting this Sea seems to have gotten ghouldan's explination <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Good to see we can clear this place up.  Now an apology and everyone will be happy perhaps. <p>Gnome &gt; all<br>
