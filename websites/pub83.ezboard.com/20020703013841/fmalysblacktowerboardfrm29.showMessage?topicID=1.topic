One who walks with honor is one whose words, deeds and actions bring respect and the recognition of respect shown to others. <br><br>~~~All members of Black Tower will encourage the feelings of friendship and family to all other members. <br><br>~~~All members of Black Tower will be courteous to all persons of Norrath, even those whose opinions differ from your own. <br><br>~~~All members of Black Tower will uphold the virtues of Black Tower and represent the guild in a positive way. Each and every member is a representative of Black Tower and the actions of one reflect upon the guild as a whole. <br><br>~~~As a member of the Black Tower you are prohibited from engaging in any sort of verbal war using the ooc, shout, auc channels. Any problems that may arise within a zone are to be handled in tells regardless of what the other person(s) is spamming in ooc, shout, or auc. If the problem can not be resolved using tells then you are required to contact an officer so they can assist you with the situation. If the Officer is unable to resolve the situation then they will contact Lochinvar, Malystryx, or Keifer to assist them in finding a solution. Should the problem require more attention a post shall be made on the officer forum for further evaluation.<br><br>~~~If you have a problem with a fellow guildmate of the Black Tower you are required to contact an officer to offer assistance with the situation. If the problem requires the attention of Lochinvar, Malystryx, or Keifer then the officer will post on the Officer Forum so that a resolve can be discussed.<br><br>~~~If you have a problem with an Officer of the Black Tower, which can not be resolved in tells, then you are required to contact Lochinvar, Malystryx, or Keifer. They will post the information regarding your problem on the officer forum so that a solution can be sought out.<br><br>~~~It is your responsibility to know who the Officers are in the Black Tower. A complete list of Black Tower Officers can be found at Guildmagic.com. You will show respect to them at all times in game and on the message boards. Any occurrence, no matter how great or small, of lack of respect shown to an Officer will be reported to Lochinvar, Malystrx, and Keifer. The situation will be discussed on the Officer forum in which the correct disciplinary action(s) will be arranged.<br><br>~~~As a member of the Black Tower you must be aware of the various age groups that reside within our mighty walls. There is no excuse for using sharp and/or abrasive language over guild sends. Please show common courtesy to your guildmates by altering your strong language so that it is not displayed in its true form. Example: Instead of dropping an F-Bomber you can use fark or funk or fook. Shat, shite, sheet can replace the infamous &quot;S&quot; word. Over use and abuse of harsh language will not be tolerated. We are a guild that thrives on Humor and good fun. If you think your send may offend someone in the guild then do not say it just to try and get a laugh. Should something be presented over guildsends that offends you in any way then it is your responsibility to send a tell to that person explaining how you feel. Joking about loot drops will not be tolerated as it can cause tension between guild members. Any violations of the guild send policy will be directed to the Officers and, if need be, proper disciplinary actions will be debated.<br><br>~~~As a member of the Black Tower you are required to have a map of any zones that you are involved in for a raid. It is your responsibility to be aware of where you are in the zone and what items may drop for your character. It is NOT within good raid etiquette to blurt out questions pertaining to what items the mob dropped and what the stats are on said item(s). The loot nazi on the raid will present all information pertaining to the item(s) that dropped. If you have questions then you can address the loot nazi AFTER they have presented all the information from the item(s).<br><br>~~~As a new member of the family you are required to have a profile of your character, posted under the profiles forum on the website, using the Magelo software. If you can not access a Magelo account, for whatever reason, it is your responsibility to post your current equipment so that an account can be setup by a fellow guildmate.<br><br>~~~All members of the family must have an ezboard account in order to access the Black Tower message board. If you can not create an account then you must contact another member of the Black Tower so they can assist you in setting one up.<br><br>~~~The Black Tower message board contains vital information concerning raids and current events. There is NO excuse for not being aware of what is happening within the walls of our mighty fortress. If you do not take the incentive to ask a fellow guildmate for help in creating an ezboard account then a warning will be issued by an Officer. That Officer will post on the Officer Forums in regards to the situation and who is involved. After the warning you have 1 weeks time to either create and ezboard account or contact an Officer or fellow guildmate for help. If it is a major software problem then another solution will be discussed. Failure to contact an Officer or guildmate, or to have an Ezboard account, after 7 days of the warning will result in your disbanding from the Black Tower. Slackers will not be tolerated. If you don't want to be aware of what is happening in the family then we don't want anything to do with you.<br><br>~~~As a member of the Black Tower you embody all that we represent. Everything you say or do reflects upon each and every member of the family. If it is found that you have presented yourself in a manner that is not within the code of the Black Tower then disciplinary action will be sought out within the Officer Forum.<br><br>~~~Disciplinary action within the Black Tower will be very serious and monitored. Minor offenses will warrant a discussion between the person(s) involved and an Officer. Repeated minor offenses regarding the same problem by the same person(s) will warrant another talk with the possibility of guild removal if matters do not improve soon afterwards. There will be a thread on the Officer Forum which will list any conversations in violation of the Black Tower Code of Conduct in which the Officer(s) involved will post about the conversations or problems they have had to address. Major offenses will not be tolerated and will faction immediate guild removal. It is your responsibility as a Black Tower member to learn self control and discipline. You must at ALL times maintain a cool temper and allow yourself to be open with your fellow guildmates. If you are having a bad day and feel that you can not conduct yourself in an orderly fashion then I suggest that you play an alternate character or log off for a break until you are able to regain your composure.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fmalysblacktowerboardfrm29.showPrevMessage?topicID=1.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fmalysblacktowerboardfrm29.emailToFriend?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fmalysblacktowerboardfrm29.threadControl?topicID=1.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fmalysblacktowerboardfrm29.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fmalysblacktowerboardfrm29.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="malysblacktowerboardfrm16">Public Spam!<option value="malysblacktowerboardfrm29">Black Tower's Guidelines<option value="malysblacktowerboardfrm1">Guild Spam<option value="malysblacktowerboardfrm33">V.I.P.
