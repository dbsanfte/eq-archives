<br>
Hi welcome to Rallos Zek the PVP server.<br>
fist character, Jinxxor aka erudite wizard(man wtf was i smoking), put stats into charisma and str so i could haul around huge amounts of coper and get good deals off venders.!<br>
<br>
about 5 days into my EQ career i met Adell through a friend, i was lvl 16, i did not see her until i was 20 but used to send her tells anyways since my friend list didnt exist until i was lvl 40 then someone told me about /friend, around lvl 24 or so on my first character i met another long time EQ favorite (who i rarely keep in touch with but still.) Justinea!, adell tells you Justinea is almost 29 she will have clarity! , you tell adell what the fuck is clarity? some type of armor?, 'sigh' no howewer!, nearly lvl 25 or so on my erudite i was discovering zone by zone because i could 'gate', which was elite. I then realized how suck my erudite was so i trashed him made a DE wizard named Jinxit, power lvl'd like no other to level 35 or so when i finaly caught up w/ adell's level who infact managed to gain 5 - 6 levels while i gained about 35 levels.. (lol??), i met alot of people who i know now on the way, saw DRAKUUL at lvl 20, was my #1 wizard idol who i wanted to become, nice cryo robe. Then.. i met wack, aka Botch around lvl 35, i was camping gay eye to get the lens in Runneye and for love of fucking god could not kill the fker w/out training myself or get my group to kill their way down there, so this cute little halfing comes in the zone, w/ anon off , hail [40 Druid] Botch , &quot;HEY MAN I CANT FUCKN eTc etc PLS Pull the eye for me ill give you uhh.. &quot;15 plat&quot;, (yo that was elite money back in the day), however botch refuses the money and goes pulls the eye on his first fucking try, i hate u still 4 it!, but gladly i managed to grab thy lens, bail from runneye never wanting to return and go grab me a staff of observers.. then of course i warp over to adell and give it to her since i was gettn it 4 her present a while ago.<br>
<br>
Lvl 36-37, Hail Starbright (man.. what a biaatch), i of course knew adell and starbright had the never ending cat fight and i was always  talkn mad shit about her.. so always tryn to kill starbright, by then i ran into another DC member, who could this be? nobody but Nilear himself, Sanidar the druid. Sanidar always has had my back in the days before he went awol tryn to pk me?(whats new), you told Sanidar, &quot;dude, this ho wont leave me the fuck alone at dwarfs in BB&quot;, sanidar tells you &quot;handling it atm&quot;, Sanidar tells you &quot;just scored a manastone LOL&quot;.. sweet love that fuck still, even though he  still.. drives me crazy. Next person the meet list was Kesdian, hail Kesdian and.. (i forget the female gnome he used to kite spectres with), i became to know him when we were kiting spectres none stop, then we tryed some gnome meat in Steamfront, didnt work to well they buffed those fkeres pretty fast, so we stuck to dwarfs in BB, following week : Jinxit ... oooh that was elite, first guild literaly had to keep asking botch for the /guildsay command cuz i didnt kno how to talk to my first guild. Inside DC i met alot of people including Hunsa, hunsa was the type of person silent, non-talkative but always there to help, and still. And then there was Zhao who i almost met along side of Hunsa, why? because Zhao usualy didnt leave her side, following into DC i met the entire guild but most of the AD brothers i know of now were in  (i believe), which was  actualy the biggest high lvl guild on the server at the time, they didnt like drakuul much we never got invited to their 2nd vox raid=P, but we still stuck out to watch here and there. I met Sinar (Rip -eq), Luadian (lol.. still hasnt changed), Lugoj and Inorcist, i never knew much of Lugoj until i came sided w/ him in The Sabbat, and inorcist would rarely show face , but very cool person once met. <br>
<br>
My first encounter with koss, DC/EB were waring TR at the timein EK, i gate myself Kesdian and this..(human clr i cant remember name but also oldschool but quit i believe), and i saw koss at the portal Koss  remembering hearing sinisters were pk'z in guildchat before and already see'ing Koss begins to cast a spell, i took no hesitation in nukn him along w/ kesdian and our gay clr!, then war of Sinister broke out in NK/SK zone line, which was one of the funnest wars i took apart in, Meanwhile during off pvp hours, Botch and myself were in competition of ourselves to level to 50, he was trying to get to 50 before they nerfed &quot;DOT KITING&quot;, and i was just trying to beat him, however the fuck could kite 3 troll guards at the same time while using manastone w/ chloro, while it took me to kill 1 or if lucky 2 dwarfs (if i had any int. gear lol).. I have met alot of other people on the way to 50 but these are the ones i remember, alot of members in FU i as well remember, Ehun didnt play until nearly right before Kunark came out, i have known Sanidar for a long time as well as Cyffon, who else would tell you &quot;DUDE I GOT MISTMOORE FACTION KITING THE BARD IN SK, COME TO MM AND ILL PULL PRINCESS TO ZONE&quot;, you reply 'busy xping atm', of course i was a powerlvling whore back in the day, adell can vouch that for me. Another person i soon met was Belarbrina  formaly  (before they went random, they were roleplayeres). She got lvl 45 and i offered to duel her as the lvl 39 i was, she 'smoked me', literaly i was casting stuns that didnt go thru, lol? yea i still didnt kno much about EQ then was still getting used to the interface, i just continued to level because it was easiest/best thing to do at the time.<br>
<br>
Continueing in time, i think i met Neckros, i cant remember honestly there were so many godamn high lvl druids in the game at the time because druids had the ability to powerlvl quicker than most of anyone w/ manastone. and there is 1 person who camped manastone beyong anyone i kno in the game before it was removed, prolly another but literaly farmed dozens of em, aka Hunsa. Drakuul also camped manastones for the guild at the time but like 90% of the time i spent in Lguk right when i became introduced to the zone Hunsa was always farmin them fuckers. <br>
<br>
In overall the most fun i had in the game was when the game was young, before majority of people reached 50, not because  i was some of the few  or many who hit it first, but because there was such wide virety of levels people and shit to discover, after post-kunark the game started to get less and less dim. I truely miss times like those but doubt will experience anything like that again, inorcist and nick-rz are encouraging me to try the SZ server because it fix's alot of the problems apearing on RZ, and is still young in gamelife.<br>
<br>
However EQ is no where near that fun factor anymore, everything is a pattern, its thursday so its 'pvp in kael day', im sure kos are actualy saying the same thing waiting on the other side of zone for us, nothing is really unique anymore, all this time consumption to repeat the same events over and over and over, hoping you can acheive 1 or 2 things greater newer within a month timeline is no longer appealing to myself, the last attempt of fun factor was creating, organizing and running my own sect, which now isnt very appealing to me, mayb if we were uber, but we r not!, and EQ limits continue to live on.<br>
<br>
Those oldschool players , some i did not mention because i may have forgotten at this point in time going on babbling on my post, forgive me~ my thoughts travel quicker than i can output them - Adell.<br>
<br>
btw if you have any great memories from back in the day, ss's or whatnot post em!<br>

I never realised that you had to loot your corpse when you died... I lost about 30 sets of equipment from like level 1 - 15 because I didnt realise you could even loot your corpse rofl 8(<br>
I got lost in Kelethin city for about 4 hours one night. got so angry I didnt come back and play for a week.<br>
My favourite days were xping in Sol B - listening to the &quot;uber&quot; guild DC and EB getting summoned by Nagafen and the Fire Giants. lol. Zargoon sitting in GF bank with his flaming sword and everyone spamming him with &quot;...... is looking at yoru equipment&quot; rofl... Used to think that dude was a god. And who can possibly forget the Slather + castin PK duo. rofl loved those guys too. Cept when pvp spells used to hit for full rofl.<br>
One of my favourite people in the game that I just dont see anymore is Arduin / Tarrna... I dont know ANYONE in the game that doesnt remember how nice this guy was. ALways helping where ever you wanted him - one of the best damn monks around too.<br>
I remember Nalear, ehun, and ssok with reefman, lugoj and I think xein - attacking me in Sol B because I was in shadow consortium rofl... &quot;fucking pks!&quot; hahaha. <br>
Reefman zone camping me with Waii for like 3 hours in SOl a / b. rofl rofl. Hate boran much ryan ? ;p<br>
Xanthala running around with no robe on in SOl B because she didnt want to lose it rofl.... that girl used to drop castin about 3 times an hour hahahaha. The pure awe of watching Ice comet caster... dude that spell will drop you in 1 hit! *quickly bags his gear*<br>
The first Nagafen slaying *broadcasted across the server*, I saw Nizno (omfg phear) pop up in HHK and everyone was like &quot;omg! you fought a dragon?!&quot; - at the time gauntlets of fiery might had dropped and those were GODLY back then. haha.<br>
DC setting up camp in the King room in Guk - the ENTIRE GUILD ! like 30 people there farming mithril 2 handers for their tanks. ROFL ROFL !<br>
<br>
ahh those were the times. when you could log on for 2 hours and log happy. instead of 12 hours and log furious.<br>

I remember Fyrefist.. always after Borealis! One of the first high levels I met ;p Remember xping in MM while Arduin, Staff, Boran and a few others were pulling stuff from the castle.. oh yah.. Sephirothx.. ahem.. Hirosan..<br>
<br>
Dadida omg pfff<br>
<br>
Lugoj got me my DE mask in Guk after Andysolo got his from him too. The good ol' time with Andy and Proxy in Unrest.... Lugoj also got me into my first PoF raid and I saw the almighty Hunsa at work there for the first time in a GSD haha (&lt;-- Hunsa wannabe). Later a PoF trip didnt turn out too well as Yslaath and a few others may recall ;p I prefer forgetting about that whole crap with Drakuul. Oh yeah... good ol' Botch/Winas hitting me with lvl 1 nukes around the pof portal! Thinking about it can still piss me off. But ohhhhhhhMG I was happy when that jerk pos Drakuul got his ass banned ;p<br>
<br>
Started Endy not long after that... as a PK together with my roomy Botjes (necro) who joined Sabbat for a while before quitting.. I never pked anyone though except people who were annoying at lower levels :P My first attempt to join Sabbat got wasted by Nizno... I remember this: Nizno tells you,'Be lvl 50 soon so I can keel you! =)' Hmm how did he find out it was me! I was 50 for a month already then or so ;p And I still lub all of HoX for wasting Nizno within seconds that night at Nagafen!<br>
<br>
Most enemies I made turned back into friends or cease-fires after they found out that enchanter Endymia was actually that... I had a nickname 'Ho-vaji' I think it was. Found out enchanters are widely more appreciated than paladins, except that I didnt expect that in the end enchanters would turn out to be fulltime buffbitches.. although SOME enchanters seem to have found a cure huh Winas? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  /afk No No No.. really.. secretly Botch loves to buff you! He is just in denial.<br>

He just soloed specs and guards (might have sploited specs a bit, back then it was hard not to, the way they'd get stuck in the cave), and was scared of dungeons (except for Cazic Tool, where we both spent alot of time exping pre 45). After he made 50, he pretty much quit playing. But I can say for certain he wasn't an exploiter, cause he was always at my wizard's exp spots!<br>
<br>
And I do believe my cleric beat you to 50 sir (even though he was my second char).. only clerics I remember being 50 before Kilyin were Asuka, Rift, Kasgadirgen, and maybe one or two others I'm forgetting... which is the primary reason I decided to make a cleric. Hell, you're still what, lvl 53? ;/<br>
