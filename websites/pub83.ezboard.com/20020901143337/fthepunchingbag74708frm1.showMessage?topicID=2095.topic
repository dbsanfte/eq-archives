I'm not saying max it, but raise it every few lvls to keep it &quot;beefy&quot;. The more NCUs you have, the more and better buffs you can run. For that you need the best NCU belt you can equip, as well as the best memory modules you can equip. As an example: at lvl 85 I am using a 6 slot belt with 6 34 NCU modules...212 NCUs. I normally run buffs that take up 196 NCUs and still have the 7 I need to run Sadness of the Willow plus any shrine buffs I come across. <br><br>Once you get your  base comp lit beefed up, then you can supplement with support implants (implants that you keep around and switch out to equip stuff) for over-equipping belts, modules, whatnot. Comp Lit also determines whether or not you can use certain grid nodes, and that in itself is pretty important for missions and over all traveling. Don't forget the fact that the higher Comp Lit you have, the better prices you get in the general stores (not NPC vendors, that is the psychology skill).<br><br>All in all Comp Lit is a very important skill for many reasons. Sure it's light blue and costs a fair amount of IP to keep it up, but too much rides on it to dismiss it out of hand.<br><br>Hawk <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uoradainbrotherhood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oradain Brotherhood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#660000>(8/12/02 12:15:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2095.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: doh..</span><hr size=1> I'm at L40 now.. still having fun.  <br><br>Sorry Celest.. didn't mean to freak you out there. =D<br><br>Something I've run into that I wasn't expecting was having to run around to do your &quot;shopping&quot; to find the better prices and equipment.<br><br>I recently picked up a 4 deck belt, but one shop I was in the 4 deck belt would have required me to get an implant to raise my comp lit skill, and use 2 self buffs just to wear it.<br><br>Another store I walked into, had a 4 deck belt and didn't require any buffs or implants and I was able to wear it.<br><br>I then shopped around for NCU memory modules (16-31), some had max of 17.. others I found were max of 18, and the highest I found was 20.<br><br>I went to all the adv stores in Omni-1 Trade, Omni-1 Entertainment and took a spin out to 20k and checked stores there.<br><br>It's kind of a pain to run around trying to find all the components you need, not to mention having to find equipment that you can wear.<br><br>Being able to wear 1 belt from a store and not another belt which give the same decks is kind of lame, but it's the style of the game I suppose.<br><br>After I reached L30 I burned up the last of my IP I had been saving as much as possible.

Ideally, you want the lowest ql for a given belt. That way, you can wear the belt easily (early) and just upgrade chips as comp lit--and finances--permit. No one makes these, you have to shop or mission for them.<br><br>Implants are kinda weird that way as well. Before lvl50, I wouldn't obsess too much over implants. You'll outgrow them so quickly that dropping huge amounts of cash on them is sort of a waste. Try to get ql70s at 40, then hold off until your stats can support 110s or 125s. Those should last you a while. <br><br>As for missions themselves, well, if you do too much over your level, you'll outgrow your equipment faster than you can replace it. This can lead to unwanted trips to reclaim, if you catch my drift. Try for a mix. Some high level team missions mixed with frequent solo runs for cash (and tokens). Doing a number of ~50% solo runs to a conveniant location can net some serious money. Money you'll need for new armor, implants, and eventually that shiny new Yalm.<br><br>I spend a lot of time shopping, both in shops and in shopping channels. A half hour here and and an hour there can net you some badly needed equipment. It's just part of the game, especially at the higher levels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrimhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 385<br> <font color=#660000>(8/12/02 2:15:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2095.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: doh..</span><hr size=1> <br>When making my ql 110 implants (I shudder to think it's time to make my ql 125s now), I would hit the shops in W Athens, Old Athens, Tir, Newland, Newland Desert, Borealis, and Hope trying to find the one cluster I lacked for an implant. It is frustrating as hell trying to put together your implants, and it's ALOT better than it used to be. They need to have set of 5 of a single cluster which would represent each ql augmentation.<br><br>Of course once you reach lvl 100ish, most items you need will be mission only, so get used to running missions for equip. It's better to learn at an early lvl your style of running solo missions, rather than trying the tougher and longer higher lvl missions a total mission noob.
