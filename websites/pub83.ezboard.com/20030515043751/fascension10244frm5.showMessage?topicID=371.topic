<br>
  I'd like to present myself, Beldargon Spellbinder, before the officers and members of Ascending Dawn.  Currently I am a level 65 Epic Wizard with 69 aa points.  My abilities atm include MC3, MB, SCF3,SCFM3,FOMM3 although atm I only have SCM1, I am presenting my application now, because I will literally meet that requirement in the next few days and am only trying to get this aspect of the entire process out of the way, turn in my bid basically. <br>
<br>
  As far as my equipment, suffice it to say I am well equipped. My poison/disease resistence self-buffed are 148/170 respectively, MR is at 199 and FR/CR are at 201 and 221 respectively.  I have a &quot;clicky&quot; item besides my jboots and an EB item as well.<br>
<br>
  At the moment I am an ex-member of DoS and ex-officer of Eximos.  My previous guild affiliations were as a council member of The Regulators.  I'm sure Kringe would back up the fact that the TR we both were members of are not affiliated with the small band of misfit's that use the tag for....dubious purposes.<br>
<br>
  As a player on this character and account since the very first day of final release, I can assure everyone that I am quite familiar with all &quot;travel to&quot; zones and can find my way around Butcherblock blinded. =p<br>
<br>
  I would assume guild approval remains to be seen, I'm fairly sure I have no problems with any members that couldn't be resolved over a pitcher of ale.<br>
<br>
  All I have to say as far as thick skin is, I hope you're all thick skinned enough for me! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
 <br>
  Patience, heh....if anyone here has camped Drelzna for jboots, you all know as well as I do anyone who hasn't isn't particularly the best judge of this attribute <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  As far as improving my character's class, well heh that IS a good part of why anyone plays Everquest.  I'm not satisfied until I am the best I possibly can be for the guild that chooses me to be a recruit/member, what have you....if that's what you're looking for in a perspective member, look no further.<br>
<br>
  And finally PvP.  I'm sure Kringe would vouch that pvp is certainly not a problem in my book.  I've been involved in many wars in my six years of MMORPGing and am a well qualified pvper in most respects. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  A few odds and ends I'd like to cover before I finish out this little spiel, I will be coming with Strike of Solusek, Agnarr's Thunder and of course Sunstrike and Ice Spear (coupled with imp dmg focus and iceflame of eci one of the best spells in the game btw, GO ICESPEAR!), as well as utility spells like Teleport.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Again, I'd like to thank everyone who took the time read my post.  Again I would like to stress that SCM3 is no more than a few days away for me especially now that I know thats the direction I need to go in to finish meeting the requirements for recruitment.  I can assure you not having that ability maxed out RIGHT now, is not a reason to pass up my application for a simple matter of three days tops.  As far as my active participation, I am in college atm, but I am still able to pull a minimum of 4 hours a day.  Thanks again, and hopefully I'll be seeing you all more in the future!<br>

<br>
First by letting me say you have a very nice application presented but I have some questions I need answered.<br>
<br>
I have checked Adept's database and while not all inclusive, there is a big gap in there. You were in the Regs, this I do remember. I used to be part of the TRe (The Regulator Event Group) that Trilenia and Kringe ran. But the last date shows you being in TR 3-17-01.<br>
<br>
The next time you pop up is in &quot;The Tinkers&quot; 5-18-02 (forgot to mention this one).<br>
<br>
There is a little over a year you seem to have disappeared. Now I know you were not a Reg the whole time unless you chose to stay with the vagrants and 'pk' during the later part of 2001/early 2002.<br>
<br>
Shows you in The Tinkers for just a hair over a month before going to DoS. (Which I also know The Tinkers became the Disgruntled Tinkers and went semi random 'pk' on those they could pick on).<br>
<br>
I also know DoS was dissolved and became Eximos, where it stands currently today.<br>
<br>
I am not questioning that you have 'pked' during your time. My questions come in the accounting of yourself on RZ for over a year between 3/01 to 5/02. <br>
<br>
Did you quit playing for awhile?<br>
Did you go to Legends at some point?<br>
<br>
And lastly, why are you leaving Eximos (as an officer) after literally only being in the guild 6-7 months and wanting to join AD? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=beldargonrz@ascension10244>BeldargonRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(1/19/03 6:44:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=371.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Questions answered</span><hr size=1>   It's easy to explain, simply to a check on Belialx on the adept website...thats my necromancer that I was playing during that time...other than that I had taken a break from Everquest during my first years or so of college and to get some DAoC time in on the Merlin server.<br>
<br>
  I don't really consider my time as a tinker as anything but solo exp time...I never really did anything productive with them as a guild, they never really did anything short of farm mage epics.<br>
  <br>
  As for why I'm leaving Eximos, I feel that is a more personal issue between myself and the leadership of the guild.  Bad decisions were made and the results were my withdrawl from the guild.  If more of an explanation is required, I'll be happy to talk about it privately ingame.<br>
  <br>
  At any rate. if anyone has anymore questions or concerns, feel free to talk to me ingame and of course post here, I'll be checking back regularly.<br>

As for you Ilaenu, not sure your point? Maybe you need to go read my Application here and understand it. If you want to stir some shit find me in game and we can discuss it and not hijack this thread. <br>

As a member of AD I do have a right to ask a recruit a question(s) regarding his/her application. The same that those in AD had a right to question mine when I applied.<br>
