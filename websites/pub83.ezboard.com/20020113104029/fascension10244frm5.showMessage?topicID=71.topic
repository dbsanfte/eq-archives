After taking some time off away from Eq prolly almost a month I did alots of soul searching and I realised that as far as everquest is concerned I cant have fun with the game if Im spending all night worrying about a guild or thinking what we can do or what needs to be done so I have decided to make a break from my old guild, wich I have been faithfull to for a good 3 years. Honestly I just want to be in a place where I can do my job and not be bothered with politics as far as a guild also the plain truth is that I have more friends in your guild that are Old-school revered than I got in my old guild right now. If you want me Ill make myself available but if you dont thats fine no skin off my back.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=salloxsawbones>Sallox Sawbones</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(12/12/01 2:35:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uber Chanter looking for a home</span><hr size=1> Kabobtik IS the best enchanter  I have ever seen in action!  I have had the pleasure to hunt with him  from time to time and he is ALWAYS alert and ready for any bad situation.  I have seen him  completely turn events around from a total wipe-out when everyone was preparing to die into success.  His ability as an Enchanter is AWESOME.  As for him having doubts about AD, I cant read his mind but before I joined AD he expressed dislikes for guild collectives/raid groups, but AD has done something very new on Rallos Zek and has turned a guild with the power of a raid group into a FAMILY.   I think allot of ppl didn't think such a thing was possible on this cut throat server, but through common goals and great leadership some how AD was born and has grown to be an awesome force.  Kabobtik is very loyal and wasn't ready to jump ship from revered during its times of trouble, I think that says allot about his character, but instead tried to breath life into a dying guild.  Its not my place to speak for him but I think he has looked things over and seen AD has become what most of us wish all guilds could be.  BTW I haven't spoke to Kabobtik for sometime now and he hasn't tired to solicit my views to this msg board, but I fell I would be betraying myself to not speak up for such a good guy and good player.  Unless someone has personal problems with him that cant be resolved I think he should at least be considered. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=salloxsawbones>Sallox Sawbones</A> at: 12/12/01 2:39:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=redwin>Redwin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(12/12/01 1:09:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uber Chanter looking for a home</span><hr size=1> Kabob is a great enchanter.

But just read up ahead and you will understand why. Now as far as saying I want to join the guild to become a loot whore look at the equipment im wearing and then talk to the peeps that are really close to me, and you willl find I give away more shit than I sell as far as awarding loots I feel others need things more than myself and whenever I awarded loots in revered I have always felt like this sure I was well within my rights to loot alot of things believe me being the only chanter at guild raids and attending everyone for a good 3 years I feel I have earned that right. But why do I want to join AD its not for loot, but one simple reason when I look on my friends list of friends that I have made in the 3+ years that i have been playing eq a good 80% of them are in AD. Also one more thing saying that I turned away cuz I wouldnt be accepted on my merits alone and then saying I called you guys lootwhores is very misleading cykubis. You make it sound like I said fuck AD cuz I wasnt getting special status or something but in fact the real reason I didnt join at that time is that I dont ever jump ship easily and to leave a guild that you have been in for 3 years is a hard decision. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kabobtik>Kabobtik</A> at: 12/12/01 4:25:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umoordredp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moordred P</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#333333>(12/12/01 8:53:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uber Chanter looking for a home</span><hr size=1> 2 Points I would like to make...<br>
-Kabobtik is by far one of the best Enchanter's on RZ.<br>
<br>
-When we were all in Revered, I remeber all of us struggling to survive and help each other out... These people are majority AD now. I will admit... Kabobtik took control of the guild after all of us left and was extremely bitter about us... And I also I dont blame him for being frusterated with us because we all sacraficed late nights together to benefit each other. Kabobtik has been away from the game for sometime now, and I honestly believe that Kabobtik wants to be with his friends that he has made over the years...I personally in EQ, have known Bob for around 2 years now, and he was one of the main reasons that made it so hard to leave Revered... because we all were a team in our newbie ass gear, I remeber the day we completed our first Hate armor together as a guild, the character was Cykubis, we pulled the corner mob that suposedly never dropped shit... Cyk was now full purple.<br>
Anyways, bottom line is that Bob is a great guy who will do basically anything in his power to help his friends.. I do admit Bob called ex-revered names at one time, and he is human... so Bob took a break for EQ for sometime now and he would like to be with his long time friends again.<br>

i don't think you quite understand the point i am making here..  you don't seem to understand that you flat out insulted the same guild that you are trying to join now.  no where in any of your posts do you even make the slightest hint that perhaps you were wrong in your statement; you simply play it off as being pissed and taking it out on someone else(real redeeming feature there!).  i've heard from a few people about how you've &quot;changed&quot; but i don't buy it because when have you ever displayed this?  was it when you came to our events when we cleared fear for cazic in hopes of leaching armor for your sk, then saying how revered should do events with AD because us &quot;jokers&quot; could clear it so fast?  was it when you were bragging about how you could get an invite easily based on how &quot;uber&quot; you are?  was it the other day when you were complaining to me about how long it took to get an invite and then bragging to someone else that you could get in faster?  no.  i'm sorry, but you seem to have the arrogance about you that you need to lose if you want my acceptance.  in addition, you say that i'm misleading in saying that you insulted us because of us not accepting you on your merits:  how so?  the conversation ended almost immediately when i said that i would sponcer you, but all of your other friends would need to get their own sponcers and that you nore any of them would be guaranteed in; the next day i see you trashing us by saying that we are lootwhores and that revered should all join synergy.  that's either exactly what i said it is or some amazing timing, don't you think?<br>
<br>
moordred, if this was because he called me names(i don't recall him ever calling me names unless it was in /gu after i left) i could care less; i have a problem with him having the audacity to think that it's fine to insult all of us and then expect to join without any questions asked.<br>
<br>
<br>
-side note because little errors get to me.  revered wasn't around for 3 years, i'm pretty sure eq hasn't even been around that long.  and you joined revered between 6 months to a year after it joined.  i know this because i was in revered as my paladin for several months and had time to level cykubis without any PLing to mid-40s before you joined. <p><center><img src="http://server3002.freeyellow.com/thearabianmagician/cykubisig.gif"><br>I am Yulaw!
