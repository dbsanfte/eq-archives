A few of you know me a few of you dont. A few of you hate me and a few of you are my old friends from TC days.<br>
Im not in Ad, but I thought you might want to know who your your new recruit REALLY is.........<br>
This is my log from the other night regarding my encounter w/ Seeknd.<br>
A few side bar comments here, Aerimus is BKS he deguilded w/ the consent of Juggarnaut and Jensing to hande a few personal issues. Aerimus in Rl is my companion and mate. <br>
Zennael is a pk monk from The Curse. <br>
I didnt engage Seeknd when he atked me as I was advised by &quot;certian people&quot; not to. He did loot me. He took a some plat I had he couldnt take anything else it is all no drop. I am NOT in the habit of sucking up to jerk offs like Seeknd and I have NO intention of doing so now.<br>
If you desire any further comments regarding this message plz feel free to pm me here at ezboard or reach me at EQPlayer_01@hotmail.com.<br>

<br>
[Wed Sep 24 02:24:11 2003] Seeknd tells you, 'i asked around about you, and guess what, schisum didnt have much nice to say about you'<br>
<br>
how does that &quot;threaten&quot; you? you must be fucking french.<br>
<br>
[Wed Sep 24 02:25:22 2003] You told Seeknd, 'If Tomaz or his rogue wanna pk me come on '<br>
<br>
seems you're the only one talking shit or threatening people.<br>
<br>
in conclusion, you were probably in the wrong for interferring in a guild war. i'd kill you too if i were in seeknd's shoes.<br>

I miss your old pic of the girl in the rain jacket tho!<br>
<br>
But i am glad that Desd posted this. I wish people would put themselves in my shoes before getting as upset as Desd did here. I joined a guild to support my friend that was unjustly put on permanant KoS. We have fought a guild of 200 with 10 people for 8 months. If those odds werent bad enough, we had people interfering and assisting them daily. Now i can understand when war interferes with exp groups such, but thats war. I have fought hard, outnumbered, clean, and fair since the begining. Id love to hear anyone from MIM disagree with that. But the one thing that we could not allow when fighting a war this undermanned is interference from outside. <br>
<br>
Convienently, Desd didnt add the 5 minutes before this incident with me asking her to not assist, and explaining the situation. If she has anyone to be mad at, it is the person in her group that pet her in this situation and didnt tell her to not get involved. At the top of the log you will see me ask her if shes going to interfere anymore. I think the rest speaks for itself. This gets to the heart of the reason why I am no longer with DoZ and trying to move on in EQ. I don't have any need to fight people like Desd. I have even less reason to fight MIM, since in 8 months we could come to no conclusions, half of there guild has cycled out, and everyone thats left doesnt pvp. There is nothing left, and if everyone in the situation would reflect for a minute and swallow some pride maybe an adult agreement could be reached. Anyways Ive moved on, and so should everyone else. You don't see anyone in DoZ crying about Tavil, Kattara, Cepheus, Faerluna, Koorn doing the same. Its a game, and I think throughout the rhetoric and hard feelings that was lost somewhere.<br>

Seeknd jumped on Shinton, my lifelong friend. I assisted Shinton. Shinton tells me to back off it is a /gu war. So I back off, Seeknd kills Shinton. <br>
I tell Seeknd that I didnt know he was in /gu war w/ BSK.<br>
Seekend threatens me to be Kos and Im thinking wtf? I didnt kill him? I backed out of the engagement and stated I was ill informed. He keeps running his mouth...........that's when I turned my log on. <br>
Seeknd has NO tag on during this entire time to ID him as a member of ANY guild. NONE! <br>
He keeps running his mouth about how Im gonna be KoS to him and Im like SO?????????<br>
Then he brings up Tomz/Schisum. Well Im not even gonna go there. Tomz and I had an encounter at the Stormfeather camp about what 3 or 4 mos ago? That totally pissed me off. It was NONE of his (Seeknd's) business and from MY point of view it looked like he was trying to use his &quot;influence&quot; to bring about some BS war because Tomz doesent like me. SO the fk what if some dude in EQ dont like me? Like I think his opinion of me defines me?<br>
Quite frankly Im at a point in my EQ career where I dont give a flyin fk if someone dont like me. My character is the lvl she is and geared the way she is because I dont sell out. Ive been loyal to my friends, my guild and I dont take shit from anyone. I play my char like I play my life stright up. I dont fk over my friends for gear, I fight wars stright out and clean and I dont take lip off of children. <br>
I told the BoY that I didnt know about the war......that I backed off when Shinton asked me to. Shinton has been my friend for a LONG time why the hell wouldnt I aid him when some UNTAGGED person is atking him? <br>
I found him (Seeknd) agroant and rude. I dont Do male posturing from anyone. I respect guild lines but you know what? People get tired of being pushed around and get to a point where they just dont give a shit anymore. Thats where I was w/ the Tomz situation. That's where I am now. I did what I had to do, said what I wanted to say and that was the end of it.  I have NO regrets then or now. I reported it to my /gu leader at the time and got over it. <br>
Then this guy who is untagged rude and is doing the same damm thing.........male posturing. LOL I find it so entertaining that some young boy w/ barely a hair on his balls thinks he can spout off some crap and Im supposed to what........lick his boots? NOT! If he talked to me like that in RL I'd spank his ass like his Momma should have done early on.<br>
<br>
Seeknd Im calling you a LIAR right here Right now! You never sent me a tell saying it was a /gu war. You didnt send me tells till after you killed Shinton. Maybe we should ask Shinton about all this eh? You DIDNT have ANY /GU TAG on IDing you as a member of ANY guild at the time. <br>
<br>
That's my say...... thats my mood...... thats my perogative!<br>
Y'all dont like me fk ya all......all y'all<br>

<br>
I barely know Seeknd, but your log does nothing but make you look worse. He asked you not to interfere with his KOS. You did not agree. Instead you talked shit, and spouted off about how everything was logged (as if that matters, really). All you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>had</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to do was say, &quot;ok I didn't know, I won't assist next time&quot; and he would have left you alone. He did not threaten you with KOS to AD, nor did he even indirectly imply such a thing. I think your logic centre needs some tuning.<br>
<br>
And what does Zennael have to do with anything? Yea, in the log some random guy -- <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>[Wed Sep 24 02:20:31 2003] Merkulous says, 'seeknd equals zennael'</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> -- mentions it but that doesn't prove shit. If you get some proof, please share and AD would be glad to KOS him.<br>

<br>
Are you, conversely, implying that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>we're</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sellouts? All I can say is, LOL. It takes time, energy, patience, and brains (which you appear to lack) to get into this guild.

I just wanted you to know what kind of person is applying to your guild. I never implied that ANYONE in AD was a sell out. *you have a guilty conscious or something*???<br>
Unlike some people I dont feel the need to &quot;justify&quot; my actions.  I did what I did.......said what I said and I have NO regrets about any of it. I told the guy I didnt know about the war and he continued to threaten me w/ kos and subsequently killed me. Then after the kill he continued to do the same. Sorry I dont DO male posturing or threats. Hell yea I made sure he knew it was logged. And No I wasnt going to apologize to him. I dont apologize to people who are 1) Untagged 2) Who are bullies 3) Who try to hide under the &quot;guise &quot; of who they know. If the dude would have stood up, wore a tag proudly and stopped treatening me then maybe he might have recieved some kind of countance, but as far as I see it he's a snot nosed kid who has never learned to be a man yet....take it on the chin and be responsible for his actions. <br>
Notice when my log was &quot;cleaned up&quot; that there was no mention of the fact Seeknd wasnt tagged at all?<br>
And btw Seeknd DIDNT say anything to me about his killing Shinton as being a war........SHINTON DID! Seeken is a liar about that and Im calling him on it right now!<br>
My reputation as being fair, honest and backing my guild and friends has never been in question. That's because I keep my rep clean. I take responsibility for my actions and I dont take shit off of anyone. <br>
Im bearing my own responsibility for my actions in Fusion myself, but know what? I havent hid under anyone's skirts, tried to ploy it off w/ some excuse or made light of it. Again I said what I said, did what I did and I have No regrets.   <br>
Perhaps you (meaning the collective you's not anyone in perticular) dont think that I am the most brilliant player in EQ, and so what? For all of the brilliance 1 of the you's have I can make up for that w/ heart, loyality and honesty. Im there for my friends and guild every day in every way I can be. Ive laughed w/ them, cried w/ them, shared their thriumphs and defeats and died for them. <br>
What can and do you do?<br>

If barmaley is Zennael saying that he is not seeknd then I have a few questions.  How did you find out about this post sir to comment in such a timely manner?...AND...what is ur connection to DOZ given your threat to not allow certain DOZ chars (Gloryia) to help out others?  Please define who you are and your association to DOZ and seeknd because I read your particular post as something that was written to defend seeknd.<br>
<br>
Anyways, as far as seeknd goes...he is a plus minus...he plays his char well, is good at pvp, and he seems to be a loyal guy(at least to DOZ or maybe the idea of warring i dunno).  However, he is a HUGE trash talker and I agree with desmoda on this...he also threaten to kos anyone who walks or crawls at one time or another....One of the good things about him is that he tends to do his trash talking mostly in tells and in say....<br>
<br>
Overall, I like the guy but if he would ever be a member of AD he needs some counseling on how to treat others in general.<br>
<br>
Even though I have warred DOZ off and on for a year prior to joining AD...I have come to like a few of them and respect them ie Braand, critchy.....seeknd is kinda on the fence imo<br>
