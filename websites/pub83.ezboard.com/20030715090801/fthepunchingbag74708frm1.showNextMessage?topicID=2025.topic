<br>
Looks Like a damn good patch to me. Some improvements for several character types including us. I might actually see myself kick now.  Glad to see the Fixer and Adv's get a little loving. <br>
<br>
Build Notes 14.4 <br>
<br>
Launcher changes: <br>
- The launcher will now give a warning if you don’t have enough graphics memory <br>
for the selected resolution. <br>
- If you're running 32 bit desktop and window-mode on a VooDoo3 <br>
graphics card, you will get a warning that you should change desktop to 16-bit (due to the nature of voodoo3). <br>
- Fixed a bug where the launcher would run in window mode the first time you ran Anarchy, even though window mode was not selected. <br>
<br>
Character Creation Changes: <br>
-You no longer get a new first name + last name every time you use the nickname terminal, thus making it possible to type in a nickname that matches the first name + last name you have, if you choose to do so. <br>
<br>
<br>
NPC and Monster Changes: <br>
-The Team mission bosses now have more loot. The amount is dependent on the number of players in the team when taking the mission. <br>
-The number of additional NPCs in the team mission boss room has been tweaked. The challenge should now be more in line with the size and power of the group doing the mission. In some cases you will face less monsters than today, in others more. <br>
<br>
<br>
Item Changes: <br>
-Some new static missions have been introduced. The rewards for these missions are items that behave differently than all other items currently in the game. We will leave it up to the players to figure out how! <br>
-A new type of surgery clinics is now available. They can only be used by doctors. <br>
-The price of the trade-skill components for making nano crystals has been dramatically decreased. If you have all the parts, it should now be cheaper to build nano crystals rather than buy them from shops. <br>
-Changed the description on the &quot;clan merits - blossoms of summer&quot;. <br>
-We've increased the amount of charges on some products you can make with pharmacy. These are the swim stim, the muscular stim, the restoration kit and the emergency treatment laboratory. <br>
-Ttank armour has had its AC increased slightly. <br>
-The Madam Freeze weapon incorrectly used ColdAC as an attacking skill. That skill has <br>
been removed. <br>
-Fixed a problem with the graphics of the “smelly butcher gloves”. <br>
-Fixed a problem with the requirements of the “gift of the old gargantula”. <br>
<br>
Playfield Changes: <br>
-Lush Fields: chaos minions will not spawn at the NW mine anymore. <br>
-Some monsters have established new camps in Southern Artery Valley <br>
-Different types of monsters in Andromeda have established small camps. Beware, they are being ruled by a strong leader. <br>
-Profession-specific implant departments are now available in the basic supermarkets. <br>
-Introduced some more changes to the Whom-Pah system. <br>
-The clans have built a new outpost in Varmint Woods. <br>
-Omni-Tek has reopened a base in Southern Artery Valley. <br>
-Omni-Tek now has an operational save terminal in Southern Artery Valley <br>
-Suppression gas in Belail Forest and Southern Artery Valley has been increased to monster only. <br>
-ICC has opened a Whom-Pah node to get make contact with the 2 sides and neutrals easier. As a consequence of this change a shop has been removed from the area in an attempt to avoid crowding. <br>
-Neutrals have opened a new shop in Newland Desert. <br>
-The sun will no longer set in the training grounds. Permanent daylight will make things a little easier for new players. <br>
-Fixed some shop signs in Omni-Ent and 4 Holes. They now reflect the type of store better. <br>
- Aquaan monster has been removed from Newland. They were never supposed to be in this area. <br>
<br>
Nano-Technician Changes: <br>
-Four of the humidity extractors had faulty data and was only giving you nano for the first 30 minutes of the buff, rather than for the full 60 minutes. This has now been fixed so they will continue to be effective for the full 60 minutes. The affected nanos were “Boundless Humidity Extractor”, “Personal Notum Harvester”, “Efficient Humidity Extractor” and “Superior Humidity Extractor”. <br>
<br>
Trader Changes: <br>
-Trader change: Trader health transfers have been changed in the following manner. <br>
1. When the 50% PvP damage reduction was introduced, this lowered the damage inflicted upon the trader as well. This has been fixed, and trader's heal transfer nanos will inflict the correct amount of damage on the trader. <br>
2. When using a team health transfer nano, a 15 second damage-over-time nano will be placed on the trader. During these 15 seconds, the trader will not be able to use that same team health transfer nano again, but is able to use a different team health transfer nano. For example, using “Premium Delayed Health Payment” will mean that you cannot cast that nano for another 15 seconds, but you could use “Exceptional Delayed Health Payment” during that time (which would then mean that you could not use “Exceptional Delayed Health Payment” for 15 seconds). The damage-over-time nano associated with each of the team health transfers will hit you for damage 5 times. Be aware that the damage-over-time nanos associated with each of the different team health transfers will stack with each other, so using multiple team transfers will be risky. <br>
<br>
Fixer Changes: <br>
-We are proud to introduce a new grid for the Fixers. They are the only ones able to use it, but in order to do so they must first solve a mission! <br>
-Added a new item that enables the Fixer to &quot;fix&quot; better nano skills for themselves. <br>
-Added a new line of heal-over-time nanos. These have a longer duration than your existing line (between 15 and 30 minutes), and stack with the existing line of HoT nanos. They heal less often than the existing line, but heal for more and with a tighter range. <br>
-The NCU cost on your existing HoT buffs has been decreased. <br>
-The damage penalty associated with the run speed buffs has been removed. <br>
-Added team versions of the run speed buffs. These are slightly less effective than the single-target versions. <br>
-Added a line of team NCU buffs. These go from +20 at the lowest level to +250 at the highest. Note that these buffs are level limited - both for the fixer executing the nano and the members in the team receiving the buff. <br>
-The “Minor Suppressor” line has been extended. There is now a line of SMG + burst combo buffs. They are self-only and executable only by fixers. <br>
-The items summoned with the “Smuggler's Shipment”, “Bootleg Blades'n Blunts” and “Bootlet Beamers'n Bolters” will now exist for 12 hours, rather than 2. Additionally, the credit cost of summoning these items has been lowered dramatically. <br>
<br>
Martial Artist Changes: <br>
-“Lesser Controlled Rage” now stacks with “First Strike.” <br>
-“Healing Aura” now has the correct crystal icon (blue instead of red). <br>
You must now be in a fight to use these items. <br>
-Added a minor form of crowd control, a short duration area of effect fear nano. It also operates as a taunt. <br>
-The first version of the “Shen” attack had some bogus data and was missing a damage type on the initial attack. This has been fixed and will inflict melee damage like the later versions. <br>
-The wall blade and parry stick have got their damage increased somewhat. Please notice that these weapons are meant for defensive situations (e.g. when the Martial Artist tanks for a group), hence their damage output is not supposed to be comparable to what a Martial Artist does with fists or special weapons. <br>
-“Cohort” and “Horde” have been fixed and buff MAs in the team. <br>
-Martial Artists will now use their kick animation more often. <br>
<br>
Agent Changes: <br>
-The Agent hologram items that we introduced in the last patch have been fixed. They should now work properly. <br>
- The cool down periods associated with the “Sureshot” and “Concentration” lines are no longer reset on death - you have to wait out the full duration. <br>
<br>
Adventurer Changes: <br>
-Added three new lines of nano buffs. The first buffs 1h-edged weapon skill. The second buffs pistol skill. The third buffs both multi-melee and multi-range skills. All are self-only buffs. Check out the team mission boss monsters, they may drop one of these new nanos. <br>
-A number of nanos have been added. They are only possible to execute when in polymorph form. Wolf form: a series of team auras (90sec refresh) that increase damage and evade skills. They are more effective on people also in wolf form. A series of large perception buffs (and minor evasion buffs) that can be run on others provided the target is also in wolf form. Sabre tooth form: self-only short duration damage buffs that also increase attack and defensive skills and boost agg/def. These have a cool-down period of 2 or 3 minutes. A line of self-only instant-cast heals that can be used every 30sec or so. Pit lizard: a couple of nukes. A single-target nuke that can be used every minute; an AoE nuke that can be used every 2 minutes; and an AoE DoT that can be used every 5 minutes. Note that during the cool down period of one of these nukes you cannot use another. And finally a self-only massive HP boost + Heal Over Time, that can be used every 20 minutes. <br>
-Added a series of secondary damage shield nanos. These stack with the normal damage shield nanos, increasing the amount of damage inflicted upon the attacker. You will need a damage shield of sufficient power up and running before you can run one of these damage shield upgrade nanos. Check out the boss monsters, they may drop one of these nanos. <br>
-Added a line of leet charms that are only useable when you are polymorphed into leet form. This line is purely for fun - and will allow you to charm a leet, eleet, leetas and finally a soleet. The charm is 'permanent' (it lasts 12 hours), but the leet will not zone with you. Check out the boss monsters, they may drop one of the “Leet Friend” nanos. <br>
-The night vision effect from the adventurer's wolf and pit lizard polymorph has been removed. <br>
-Fly mode has been disabled from the pit lizard polymorphs, as it isn't working properly. The primary purpose of the pit lizard polymorphs is combat, and this was stopping it from being used in combat correctly. <br>
-The adventurers have gotten new deflection shield items usable only by them, and which recycles faster than the normal ones. They have also received a &quot;Flurry of Blows&quot; look-alike item that recycle quicker. These are found in various places, and can be produced through trade-skill processes by kind friends of the Adventurer. <br>
-The adventurer now has some crowd control. It is a line of mesmerizes nanos that can only be executed on the monster when the monster is not in combat mode. There is also a single area-affect version that can only be executed when outdoors (and will only affect monsters not in combat mode). <br>
<br>
Soldier Changes: <br>
-Soldier: “Phalanx” has been fixed and is now truly an AC buff affecting all soldiers in the <br>
team. <br>
<br>
Other Changes: <br>
-Zoning while flying now preserves altitude. <br>
-The &quot;dribble down&quot; rules for ranged energy weapons have been fixed. There was a bug that let the dribble down be 50% stamina and 50% sense. This has been changed to 40% sense, 40% psychic and 10% intelligence as the description defines. <br>
-Improved text, layout, colours, links and more in regards to the new help system. <br>
-We have implemented 4 new control options: <br>
1. Auto-attack attacking monster with AGGDEF &gt; 0. (Default ON) <br>
2. Auto-target attacking monster when without target. (Default ON) <br>
3. Auto-attack attacking player with AGGDEF &gt; 0. (Default ON) <br>
4. Auto-target attacking player when without target. (Default ON) <br>
-Using the stationary surgery clinics no longer locks treatment skills since that is no longer <br>
necessary. <br>
-Implemented some minor armour trade-skill processes. <br>

<br>
we will only be able to cast healing aura in a fight, or is that for all MA heals?, either way that is seriously going to suck, means we're going to need even more IP in treatment...like we didn't have to little as is....<br>
