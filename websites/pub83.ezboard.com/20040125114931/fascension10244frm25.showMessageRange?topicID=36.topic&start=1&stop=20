<br>
**Adell**<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
I'm curious what answer it is you are waiting for<br>
<br>
You and I have discussed this matter in game and the problem was addressed in that conversation. similarly I have discussed the problem with the person play Ibinax that night.<br>
<br>
Perhaps kos us until we resolve it your satisfaction? <br>
<br>
anyhow, I'm not sure what your goal is here. If its to reduce the problems you have with AD I think you're going about it the wrong way. <br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
My reply<br>
I got the response from you I wanted Adell, you were nice and respectfull. However the rest of the people in your guild seem to share different values than you and Kaycie and the ones in AD who seem to have a controll over some extreme pent up rage.<br>
<br>
As for KoSing you...umm...Exactly what am I supposed to do? You guys kill me on site, there is no talk, no hey leave, no negotiations, what would you do in my shoes? If whenever I see one of you I attack first, or at the same time my chances for survival go up 10 fold.<br>
<br>
As for helping my case, you and several others have told me I dont have a case. Im KoS. It wont be changed. It has nothing to do with me, and its nothing personal but STFU and get off your boards. Adell take a gander at what some of your boys have said in this post. You have a EXP killing enchanter in your guild who is not being corrected, Xblade flat out lied to you about me attacking, and Im told that this action isnt acceptable by your members, yet whenever I point it out Im told it doesnt matter.<br>
<br>
Adell you seem to be a sensible person, and as I myself run a large guild (all be it in Asherons call) I know what you have to deal with on a daily basis. The tells, the compromises etc. However, my guild differs from yours in 1 extremely large way. If I say we do something we do it, if I say we dont do something we dont. Im getting mixed messages from you and the rest of your clan.<br>
<br>
#1 Frawd and Adell both claim that exp killing isnt an acceptable AD method of dealing with people they have KoS. Yet on the night of the incident I asked Lohengrin (the only AD officer on at the time) &quot;Is it acceptable for AD to corpse camp and EXP kill me?&quot; His reply &quot;Yep =)&quot;<br>
<br>
#2 I was told to get off the KoS list all I had to do was pay Lohengrin 10k, however another officer told me it was 2k, and another officer told me I had no chance. I griped about it on the board and went about my business. After talking with Lohengrin I realized you guys werent just happy to pk witch I dont mind its part of the server, but EXP kill...that I had an issue with. As you guys are larger than me and my crew, exp killing me over and over is an easy feature and after loosing a buble in 58 I decided to pay your fee...I come to your boards, and am told I had the choice originally and denied it so I am now denied, however there wasnt a choice....I was told 3 things. Also You yourself Adell told me I cant get off the KoS list because of &quot;issues that have absolutely nothing to do with you&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm.<br>
<br>
After being told by one of your members to come to the boards to discuss it with the guild, even after telling her I would get hazed I get flamed to death. I get moved to the &quot;Gimp Gallery&quot; and Im now ignored...fine...great...so be it.<br>
<br>
However there are things you and the rest of the leaders of AD need to look at Adell.<br>
<br>
#1 You have people in your guild who are EXP killers, and then justify their actions to me and others by saying no one cares, STFU, your on the KoS list, your an ebayer, you attacked first, or any of a million other excuses<br>
<br>
#2 You have people in your guild who when caught doing something un-ethical (Xblade) make up false acusations to justify his methods.<br>
<br>
#3 Any time someone trys to bring any of the above to your attention in a very nice, well spoken, non-profane way they are flamed off your boards and ignored.<br>
<br>
So whats my point?<br>
<br>
Well it looks to me like you guys have made a few compromises, and thats all fine and dandy, but at the current state and time your not an Anti guild....most wouldnt even consider you an Honor guild. Now this doesnt mean you dont have Honorable people in your ranks, I have several people in your ranks I talk to on a daily basis even helped on of them find some spells today. What it means is you have some trash in your guild witch needs to be taken care of, either punished privately or publicly, or completely removed. Your other option is to declare yourself a Honor-pk or Random-pk guild.<br>
<br>
Its all dependent on your prioritys.<br>
<br>
I await your response.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utahtuah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tahtuah</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(9/26/02 6:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=36.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Question for Adell and other AD leaders</span><hr size=1> I choose public punishment plx.<br>

There are checks and balances for everyone, Im not trying to tarnish anyones rep, All Im doing is reporting what happened and hoping someone out there will take action. If Xblades rep gets tarnished its his fault and not mine, all he did was lie...happens daily...not that big of an issue, but if you had the little issues your get a large one.<br>

I haven't exp killed you not to my knowledge, though I did kill you everytime you zoned in by pvp. Now then you said I exp killed you? Describe how I did it.. was it the time when I had a DC pet and tried to keep 3 mobs mezzed and you run by breaking it and then running away towards mobs uninvised? you expect me to let you get away from breaking my mez? no so I rooted you, not that I killed you anyhow for I saw you zone out with half your life left, thanks. Now you got a GM there, he didn't do anything to me so I assumed I didn't do anything wrong. I KNOW I didn't exp kill you, but I did kill you a few times because you called a certain friend of mine names after your first death. I don't know what kind of stunt your pulling here, but I don't believe your accusations of being exp killed not from what I saw.<br>

<br>
Think before I speak? Read over all your posts on AD's boards, then ask yourself if you sound like a 6 year old. If you come up with no, then you should seek mental assistance immidiately. If you come up with yes, then take your pansy, sheep loving, diaper wearing buttox back to the blue server you played on before Rallos Zek.<br>
<br>
I'm not following AD blindly, I fought them before. The odds were in their favor then as well. I lost, but I didnt jump up and down pointing fingers at people claiming they tried to xp loss me. I didnt come to their boards and tell them how to run their guild. <br>
<br>
You sir, are some weird form of chicken shit who is in denial. Get rid of your attitude if you want off the list. Coming to their board and whining is not going to better your situation at all. Or better yet....fuck off and get xp killed! =)<br>

<br>
You were invis, Why would you stop to re-invis when you saw my 3 mezzed mobs? You ran past uninvis so I rooted you for breaking my mez, I didn't see you die in fact I saw you zone out quite alive with half your HPS. Exactly how is that an exp death? Say what you want but if you have no proof on showing me how I exp death you don't bother posting. You might wanna ask the MiM who was raiding there if I exp killed you or the few others, I don't mind I have nothing to hide but it seems your making up endless things to get me back for killing you.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;I dont give a rats ass about you killing me over and over, that doesnt bug me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good, don't complain to me then in /ooc and bug my guild members about dying so much ok? Especially after what you said when I killed you the first time.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;Rooting and mezzng me after you aggro 3 mobs and let me die thats a major issue. And the gm that came said he saw the exp death.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you saw three mezzed mobs, would you most likely to run by or would you stop and break my mez and run away? You broke my mez therefore I sent my pet on you when I rooted you, but he died and the broken mez mob almost killed me so I had to zone, Unless you zone back outside the entrance with half of your health how did you get by?<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;And the gm that came said he saw the exp death, but as you made no verbal threat there was nothing he could do....meaning you can exp kill ALL you want as long as you dont make a threat verbally. At least thats how he explained it to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't believe in griefing and I know for a fact I didn't exp lost you,  you can say what you want but I would love to see some proof or hard facts before you coming here and further your accusations toward me some more.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;Ibinax you can say it didnt happen all you want, but I know, You know, and God knows. What goes around comes around.&quot;<br>
<br>
You know, okay. I know? I do also. God knows, obviously! Do what you want to me in game, your no threat to me. You can say whatever you feel like. I will still play and enjoy this game, you'll just be another part of it. Happy hunting!<br>

Sorry we dont play this youre way, but lets make this clear.. we dont suport charrs that are KOS... bought or not, doesnt matter.. my brother played me, It was a friend who stole passwd, it was my mother wanting some cyber.... we cant, and will not investigate this.. why, cous jerks ass portal campers can pay thaire new meal? <br>
<br>
There is tho, an easy way pointed out, to get of kos:<br>
<br>
Be calm, dont repeet _you guys started this_ , and pay the fee up front to show you want off kos and wont backstabb AD again. Damn how hard is this to understand??<br>

hmm...as many times as you guys have done what you say you dont do Im not sure if your playing your way either<br>
<br>
&quot;my brother played me, It was a friend who stole passwd, it was my mother wanting some cyber.... we cant, and will not investigate this.. why, cous jerks ass portal campers can pay thaire new meal?&quot;<br>
<br>
The hell did you just say with this? I think your saying Im lying about account transfer. There is no need to investigate I will BRING the proof to you. Jerk ass portal campers ....why are you bashing Ibinax now? she camped a zone line for 2 hours. Yzzt Im not the one you should be bitching at. Also your not hurting the guy who sold the account your hurting me. This doesnt hurt him....or can you not se that.<br>
<br>
&quot;Be calm, dont repeet _you guys started this_ , and pay the fee up front to show you want off kos and wont backstabb AD again.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was very calm I posted VERY nicely, very politely, then you guys corpse camped and exp killed me, then you called me a liar. Sorry I kinda loose my cool then...gee, my bad. PAy the fee up front, sure Im cool with that. However when you guys gave me that option you couldnt seem to work out a price. I talked to 3 leaders, and 3 leaders said 3 different things. I cant do what you guys dont tell me to do, and considering I didnt backstab AD, it would be a first.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn how hard is this to understand?&quot;<br>
<br>
! I have been trying to understand and have gotten nothing but flames. I tried to handle it in game and was directed here, I tried to handle it here and was flamed and told to go in game. Im done chasing my tail.<br>
<br>
If Im stepping on toes here I do apologize. Im just trying to rationalize what has been a very irrational 3 weeks. Soon as I understand this Ill shut up and go away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/upyrostasis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyrostasis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#333333>(9/26/02 11:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=36.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> oh and one more thing</span><hr size=1> How come your not in House of Xzzt?

Why is that interesting? ... do you even know how/why we made Ascending Dawn ?<br>
<br>
Why didnt you pay one of the leaders, say the one asking you for 2k? .. my guess is you dont want to, or you just need an excuse to quit this game.. if its over dont let us ceep you here.<br>
