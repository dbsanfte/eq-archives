<br>
You prolly cant even come up with 1 single incident prior to Silene's deguilding that was her causing drama. Silene rarely ever spoke in guildchat, attended raids and helped out when she could. Really an ideal member if you think about it. Even silene's exit from ad was silent and without drama. She didnt get guildchat in an uproar or make a scene at an event. She just silently did what she felt she had to.<br>
<br>
As far as that night in Air, I am pretty darn sure Ruhi was already elemental flagged at that point. I wasnt privy to the conversations in private between Silene and the officers who were on. I have heard both sides and what I think really doesnt matter because I cant prove any of it anyhow.  All it would be is me taking the word of my friend who hasnt yet decieved me.  Thats a moot point tho.<br>
<br>
REason I am posting is cause frankly this thread has got alot of total bullshit in it.  Silene is no drama queen, fact is more often than not people didnt even know she was on because she wasnt constantly spamming guildchat with stupid shit. she wasnt causing drama with other guilds, she wasnt bitching about loot, she wasnt hating on other members. She was having fun with the people she enjoyed in AD.<br>
<br>
All of the people in this thread that accuse silene of being drama are the very definition of drama.  I was an officer at one point and I know well how many of you were and are.  Frankly kilyin, yes you at least acknowledge that you go off the deep end alot. I can recall many times where you have disbanded or thrown tantrums over loot even as an officer. Fennin ro ring a bell?  Sure you had the nerve to come back and try to patch things up with ad and were promptly given back your officer tag. Thats just one of many.<br>
<br>
But to say Silene lacks the character or integrity to admit wrongdoing is a foundless claim. What are you basing this on? She saw the confrontation one way, the officers saw it another. Silene's priority is her family and friends. Officers priority is making shit work. 2 very different motives, 2 very different goals.  IF anything it shows amazing character and integrity to be able to stand up for something you believe in. Silene had been with AD since 1 month after its conception. Longer than even you if i recall kilyin, and much longer than you dermel. It shows conviction to be able to walk away from something you fought so hard to help make and be ok with it.<br>
<br>
oh and to dermel, respect is earned not given. Everyone should have respect for the military, some just have to work real hard to lose it. Grats.<br>
<br>
Oh and to Naerini, I would appreciate it if your gonna censor ruhi's RL comments about derm's life that perhaps censor kilyin's comments about silene being a &quot;delusional bitch&quot; <br>
<br>
this thread is prolly better off locked as nothing beneficial will come from it.<br>

As far as bringing up RL yeah I did, not to win an argument, but to show what kind of low life scumbag I think you are.<br>

What kind of military job allows the mass amount of time you have to spend in EQ?  I'd say its a pencil pushing job, maybe in the past you did more but I see you as sitting at a desk now, this is my opinion, I don't know if its the case or not.<br>

If you want to see what I do for a career, swing by Camp Pendleton.  I'll give you a tour, so that you aren't completely ignorant.  Or maybe you could learn something about the person you are tryin to talk shit about, instead of throwing random low-brow insults out?  Nah, wouldn't fit your style.<br>

And I didn't start this thread, I posted my views on Silene's recruitment thread on a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>different board</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.

If there are people in AD that care that much about my RL and that strongly, I don't care.  I don't give a fuck that YOU care that strongly about my life - merely the fact that you feel the need to cast stones, like you are somehow superior.<br>
