<br>
I hate to post this hear but there does not seem to be many good DOC web sites.  <br>
<br>
I was wondering how well a Doctor would be if he chose to use MA skills such as hands and weapons over the more normal gear like shotguns.<br>
<br>
Any advice would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thank You<br>

<br>
Thanks for the information.   After I read it, i longed for a million extra IP so I could wield one of those weapon.  But I am only a lvl 4 doctor.  So after reading this I started to put points into Aimed Shot and Rifle and hope to use the long line of rifles.  I thought of the CHS but figured I would not have enough IPs for that.  I saw a few folks selling low end (lvl 14) x-3 for 40k but thought I will outgrow that weapon in a few lvls.    So i pay that kind of money for one.<br>
<br>
I guess my strategy will be to hide and shoot.  Do you know how this hiding works in a group environment can i get an aimed shot off if my group has engaged the MOB.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
Doc's using MA skill do OK, but you're not going to be in the same league with real MAs and you're going to find soloing rough, if not impossible later on. <br>
<br>
The doc I normally play with gets to agonizing over MA vs. whatever every month or so. She also plays a real MA, so she knows what she's missing. Additionally, she gets to see the sort of damage the enforcers she normally groups with do, and wants to do more as well (though, I don't think she sees those runs of 10, 13, 30, 10, 12 that I see with my rider enforcer...&quot;Gah, losing aggro!&quot;). <br>
<br>
No good answer here. Go with what looks good to you. You can always reset later on when things get tougher (easy to reset MA/brawl and bows...hint, hint...).<br>

Max and implant your MA skill, put a fair amount of points into brawl, and you'll be fine.<br>
<br>
Of course you won't do the damage that an MA does, but it'll be at least comparable to the other 'cheap' skills for a doc (shotty/pistol I think).  Also, every level you get an upgraded weap for free =).<br>

I agree that it is a workable solution to use MA skills up 'til L100 or so and then reset.<br>
<br>
Long term, I think Shotty is the way to go. Plain old boring Vektor is hard to beat, if you don't have an old school ELLTS.<br>
I'd say Vektor and TIM scope is as good as you're going to get. Just for god's sake don't settle for one you can self-equip; figure your OE margin, and get wrangled into one you can barely use with the generic buff.<br>
<br>
Rifle is a tough row to hoe, for the same reasons as MA skill; just as MA's get buffs to make MA skill work better, Agents get Rifle buffs to make those weapons work better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ugraymouzers.showPublicProfile?language=EN>graymouzers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#660000>(9/17/02 2:49:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2126.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Doctors with MA skills</span><hr size=1> Hilde; <br>
I read your previous long post and I assumed you were trying the Custom Heavy Suppressor (CHS) or the X-3 as your new weapon. I was thinking of trying rifles that just required Aimed Shot and Rifle skill. I was assuming I would have to go into sneak mode then start the fight with an aimed shot and then switch to normal rifle mode. <br>
Well, I will take your advice and try the old shotgun. I am only lvl 4 so I did not waste too many IPs yet. <br>

<br>
Don't go rifle with the intention of squeezing off big Aimed Shots against mobs.  Using Aimed Shots vs mobs means you need to have a ridiculous Concealment skill, and even with a max conceal (which for a doc won't be much and will cost a LOT of IP), you'll end up spending 5-10 seconds before every fight trying to successfully enter sneak mode in order to use Aimed Shot.  Leave Aimed Shots for the Agents.<br>
<br>
A lot of folks talk about the great damage that rifles like the X-3 do, but (as Publius mentions) they forget that agents can get their Rifle skill MUUUUCH higher than other professions can.  Even 100 more points of attack rating makes a BIG difference in calculating final damage.  Don't get me wrong, the X-3 or a similar Rifle/Aimed req weapon is a decent choice for someone who wants a ranged attack with reasonable damage for a moderately low IP investment.  However, there are better alternatives for Docs (and other non-weapon specialist &quot;support&quot; professions).  The damage from a good shotgun coupled with a TIM scope is hard to beat for the IP.<br>
<br>
If you don't wanna be yet another shotgun-toting physician, there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> are</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> viable alternatives.  The Schuyler Bow does good damage and also requires only one skill to raise.  Add a TIM scope again to raise your Ranged Initiatives, and it dishes out damage as fast as the trusty old Vektor, and looks cooler (IMHO).<br>
<br>
Pistols now offer a few choices, as well.  My doc is currently in the 120s, and is still sporting 2 Customized IMI Desert Reet 1000 pistols pried from the cold, dead hands of the Lab Director in the Foreman's Office (Biomare) dungeon.  Since they are rare boss spawn NODROP loot, they are tough to get...but they do great minimum damage (and it's fire dmg), have fling (every 15 seconds), a really fast burst cycle (30 seconds), and do &quot;bonus&quot; fire nano damage every few seconds as well.  Add in a VERY fast rate of fire and a nice clip size and you get a pistols winner, damage-wise.  You hafta sacrifice some IP in Fling and Burst (and Multi-Ranged if you wanna dual wield them), but they shoot really fast and give you more to do than just hang back and heal, or hang back and heal and watch for a shottie crit. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The best thing about using the Customized Desert Reets (CDRs) is that there are several nice pistols in the game that add to stats, and they can really come in handy for a doc in the mid levels.  Pepper Pistols are awesome for squeezing into doctor Heal/DoT/HealthBuff nanos several levels ahead of time, and OET Jess pistols add a nice Int bonus which can help out in numerous ways.  Personally, now that my doc is post-100, I have enough Multi-ranged nowadays to equip a Q101 Pepper Pistol in my left hand, and fire away with one of the CDRs in my right.  So I get +18 to BM, MM, and MC from the Pepper Pistol as well as roughly 200pts of fire damage every second from the CDR.  I'm sure I'll switch over to a shotgun eventually, since it'll be much better for PvP...but for now I'm having fun with my pistols.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem with the pistols approach is that before the CDRs (which you can easily equip by about level 70-75 assuming you can GET one), there aren't any really good options.  Original Electronicums do decent damage, but are boss loot/rare drops and are thus very hard to acquire.  Sentinels ETE Strike Guns do fair damage (for pistols) and are readily available, but they lag behind an equivalent shotgun in damage over time.  So if you are just starting out, I recommend shotgun (or Schuyler Bow, if you wanna avoid the shotgun-doc-clone look) for the first 70 levels, then consider the Customized Desert Reets/Pepper Pistol combo.  But if doing damage with minimal IP is your thing, shotgun is very hard to beat.<br>
