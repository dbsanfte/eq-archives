Have played EQ since inception first on Innoruuk and then here on Rallos.  I left Innoruuk when most of my guild retired (The Pantheon) and went to other games, and moved here to RZ to play with RL friends.  <br>
I currently am about to enter my third tier of AA, and have modeled AD's model, except for two points spent in Critical Hits before learning your requirements.  My guild experience has been in TP, 3 years, IE (I left when IE  dissolved and became MIM to join RL friends in tB) and now with them in PN.  (see previous post under PN for details)<br>
I have participated in killing every major mob (with the exception of Kerifirm (sp) in ST...we attempted that just after FoH tried, with the same ignomious results <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , up until the release of Luclin.<br>
I currently have 7 shards for VT and all but the insignia for the emperor.<br>
I play every day but sunday, and some saturdays due to family and religious commitments.<br>

I do know a bit of how all this went down so i will give ya what i know in this case.<br>
<br>
~Oponox is a seperate person from Medivac.<br>
<br>
~Medivac does, or has in the past, played/leveld Oponox.<br>
<br>
The actual Oponox is a good guy whos been a pleasure to BS with when ive seen em around(hes a business owner so im sure thats why his time has been limited in the past). I dont know how the whole IE transition thing went down so i cant really comment, but dishar, Mach you guys dont even play anymore, why you taking a piss in his cheerios if it in no way affects you.<br>
<br>
Hope AD, as they have in the past, doesnt take some of what is said here at face value and atleasts tries to get the story from the person whos applying. Hes a nice guy and never shyed away from helping when asked.<br>

Nox wasn't playing Oponox very much.[RL stuff]. <br>
So, Cap (a veteran player from the Innoruuk server) asked if he can check it out.. He was looking to come to Rallos to play with his RL friends. (PN)<br>
There was a 2.5-3 week period that Nox and Cap were playing Oponox.. During which time, Nox didn't want Oponox unguilded.. <br>
(Oponox did not attend any events with IE nor loot any items during this time.) <br>
By the 3rd week, Nox decided he no longer could play his Twink.. <br>
Happy to be playing with Cap on Rallos, PN adopted him and began his process.. <br>
Oponox was immediately unguilded from IE, and vigorously powerleveled from 56-60.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uzeln1k.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeln1k</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(9/21/02 1:51:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=312.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Give me a break...</span><hr size=1> The only person that played Oponox in IE and TB was Rick.  I was on the phone with him when he was in IE guild chat and he stressed that he didn't want people knowing it was him playing Oponox.  He acted in the same deceptive way with Sadr, his wizard when he brought him to a fear event as a &quot;friend that needed an epic piece&quot;. (Didn't even bother trying to just ask people, he would rather take a very deceptive impersonal route)<br>
<br>
I'm sick of this entire &quot;We're adults, mature and family guys&quot; crap.  PN is out for themselves and have proven, with their romp in tB that they'll use anyone they need to use to get the things they desire in EQ.  Anyone that doesn't see that after a very neutral, non-war-type guild joins the most war oriented guild on Rallos Zek, right when we're building a new event group, only to leave when a war starts saying &quot;its not going in a direction we're happy with&quot;.  (Note PN said this as a group, not as individuals).<br>
<br>
Take PN for what they are, people who absolutely know how to play their EQ characters that won't give 2 shits about anyone they don't hang out with in real life.  It is also apparent that at least Medivac will try and attach real people to characters that he's been playing to get his entire arsenal of characters dialed in with equipment.  AD has always been a loot driven guild and a large part of what PN is fits right in.  If they join, it won't be long till you see exactly what their ex tB guild mates have been talking about.<br>
<br>
Do what you must.  Don't, for one second, talk down to people like Daish and Mach that would back you in and out of game at the drop of a dime and in spite of anything you could possibly let them loot in game.  People that haven't sold their souls for loot are a rare commodity in this community.  <br>

That character was on an account our friend owned and he played Oponox after I fucked up and got Noxule/Sighko account banned.  He leveled Oponox to 56 and raided with IE.  The 2nd Oponox told me in tells that he was Evilshadows, and I guess he didn't tell anyone in IE what was up...I don't know.  He was friendly enough to me, and was just xping him as far as I know.  He was unguilded from IE by an officer while I was on the phone with the original Noxule, who didn't know our friend had sold the account to this guy.  We had a friendly conversation nonetheless.  The owner now, apparently this guy from the Innoruuk server is probably the 3rd owner, since Evilshadows was from way back.<br>
<br>
This owner is on all the time it seems, but I've never seen him or talked to him.  I'm not offering any opinions since this isn't my business...just offering a few more facts for the consideration of people who care.<br>
<br>
Having said all that, this character kicked ass at 56 when I got to play him to fight some random gankers....you could do worse if the human on the other end isn't a bad guy. <p>Once you go gnome you'll never go back!<BR>
