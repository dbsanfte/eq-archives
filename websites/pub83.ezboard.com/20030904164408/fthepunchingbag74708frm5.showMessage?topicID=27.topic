If you can't grid or whompa into 2HO, maybe you should try something outrageous:  running there?  <br>
<br>
You said you have a Kodiak, so you probably have some decent RunSpeed.  Gridding or Whompaing straight into a 25% zone with the knowledge that &quot;grid-camping&quot; and &quot;whompa-camping&quot; is a rampant tactic is simply dumb.  Why not just get close to it, by gridding to a 75% zone, and Kodiaking the rest of the way?  In addition to avoiding any griefers, you get the chance to actually see some of the game world you paid for.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If I wanted to, definitely, I could get there somehow -- you are exactly right.  It's not like they blocked me out of the zone, and I know that.  My issue is the same one I had back in the day on Rallos in EQ when you would zone and find out 30 seconds later that there was a pack of naked wizards who nuked you before you even saw the screen.  I don't care how you spin it, it's retarded.  <br>
<br>
If I zone in and THEN someone puts a bullet in my head I wouldn't be annoyed by it.  If I'm dead before I even zone in, there's a Big Official Fucking Problem (tm).  Keep in mind you are talking to someone who thinks the entire game should be 25%.  And I mean the ENTIRE game.<br>

Call it honor, call it playing fair, call it whatever the hell you want but to me attacking someone who cannot possibly attack back in any way, shape or form is being a pussy to the Nth degree.<br>
<br>
So far I've been lucky and never have been ganked when zoning into places like 2H0 or 4Holes (yet to make it to MMD, but soon I shall).  Many times, however, I have been around these areas when Clan attacks were going on and it disgusted me to see my fellow Omni just destroying people as they Gridded in.  A few times I died because I waited for someone to Grid in completely, and you know what, them's the breaks, but at least I gave the guy a chance to fight back.<br>
<br>
I don't have my Freshman title yet, and ya know what, I'm somewhat proud of that because I could easily have gotten it if i resorted to Grid camping.  I'm glad to see in the news that this is going to be fixed.  It's just too bad that it's taken this long, this one should have been top-priority considering the focus of the game. <p>Nurrplex, lvl 58 Opi MA (Omni)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ukanonahso.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kanon Ahso</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#660000>(9/6/01 5:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm calling bullshit on today's update</span><hr size=1> Brianthe - exactly why I don't consider PvP titles worth a damn, best way to get them is by gas camping and grid camping, which shows PvP of relatively....zero.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't mind 25% zone everywhere either, actually, at least remove 75% in the god damn &quot;PvP&quot; zones like MMD. As for zoning in, a good solution might be to where you're unattackable until the first button you press. That means if it notices you changed camera view, panned around, hit enter to type, move, move the mouse, target, ANYTHING, you're fair game then. However, until you do anything, your avatar is safe.<br>
<br>
Grid campers don't bother me, I find another way in, but it'd at least make titles mean something more than they currently do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ubrianthe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brianthe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#660000>(9/6/01 7:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm calling bullshit on today's update</span><hr size=1> Yep, definitely.  I think there should be certain areas though that, out of necessity, need to be non-PvP.  Mostly newbie areas, where people just learning the game can figure things out and get situated before being thrust into it.  And perhaps some &quot;social&quot; areas where people can gather for meetings, gatherings, events or whatever just to have fun.<br>
<br>
I also agree about getting rid of those 75% areas in the Political Zones.  It is such an incredibly lame tactic to attack in 25% and then run into 75%.  If anyone read my posts last week on the Vault boards about the lamer Clanner Agent Nineball, you can understand (and no, he didn't kill me, in fact the lame-o barely scratched me, but he ran for the hills before i could finish him off).  You want a one on one duel, go to the Arena.  You want to go to a Political Zone, expect war.<br>
<br>
Oh, and finally, If you go to the Arena and agree to a duel.  Do not run when you start to get your ass kicked.  Have some fucking guts and die like a man (or woman).  It's not like you lose anything if you are in an Arena, because unless you're a complete and utter moron you'd save beforehand.  It's so pathetic to see someone running away from an Arena fight.  Hey, there's an idea.  How about institute Titles based on running away from fights...zoning, running into 75%, escaping the Arena. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Nurrplex, lvl 58 Opi MA (Omni)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ujamesstdon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JamesStDon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#660000>(9/6/01 9:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm calling bullshit on today's update</span><hr size=1> I think everything should be 0% except for cities, which should be 25%.

<br>
It was a couple months after the game's release, and the game hadn't impressed me much in it's non-pvp form, so I thought I'd try the fightin' server.<br>
<br>
It was pretty gay. I went through the intro section (because I hadn't played much in the past month or so, and I figured I should brush up on how to actually control my goddamn guy). Then I walked outside and was killed by a lvl 4 guy. Pretty soon after I ressurrected, I was killed again. <br>
<br>
So... for a new player, I'd say a 100% free for all, 25/0 zone game would be pretty fucking gay. Like one man just jamming another man on public television when everyone in the house had just sat down for a few cartoons with bowls of ice cream in their hands.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm personally a big fan of &quot;Cities&quot; wherein there can only be clan vs. omni, if any fighting at all (arenas are cool too), and wilderness areas, where other people can just hack away at each other (I guess I just played a lot of UO). I wouldn't mind AO having more territory that was dangerous, but the fact that no one seems to band together when they don't know each other would just result in my destruction. And I don't play to destroy, I play to run around in a swimsuit with a pack of supaleets chasing me, yelling &quot;Where're my pants?&quot; <br>
<br>
Just as a generalization, the anti-pks or lamer killers or whoever they want to refer to themselves as are as much of a hassle as the pkers or murderers or exploiters or lamers or useless bags of shit, or whatever they refer to themselves as. I mean, they're just as rowdy and they're pretty much doing the same thing, they just chose to attack the attackers (they don't defend anybody, I mean, I've been an anti before, and I remember saving like, 3 people over the course of a month, and just slaughtering murderers the rest of the time).<br>
<br>
No no, I think the AO fighting system has it's roots in the right place. Having 100%/75%/25%/0% zones is a good idea. It's just been implemented kinda screwy (my main complaint being grid camping, I mean, I don't get it done to me a lot, but that's because I don't -let- it. And it does slow down travel time a bit, or make me go different routes than I normally would, so... I guess it sounds like a personal greed thing, but I'd still prefer to see it taken out).<br>

One person enters then 25%. and immediatly. 15 agents all start sneaking there way towards the safeline. Its fucking pathetic and it pisses me off.<br>

Maybe they need to implement something where if you ingage in pvp battle. You can be attacked for the following hour regardless of where you go, citys, the bathroom, anywhere.<br>

As a regular reader, I know that you've got more sense than the average peekay weasel.  I certainly did identify with the spirit of your post, but I got a bit tweaked when I saw it come from your lips (fingers?  other extremities?).  I'm used to seeing that argument being used by the hardcore whiners and I don't put you in that category.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

For the record, I have mixed feelings about grid/whompa-caming.  At first blush, it is shamefully lame and pathetic.  I sympathize with those who have been killed in that manner &lt;b&gt;the first couple of times it happens&lt;/b&gt;.  After you've experienced that particular kind of peekay joy, continuing complaints about it are a sign of a very peculiar kind of masochism.  It's like I always say:  &quot;Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me and my whole entire family, including my two cats that I'd love to make slippers out of because they're my wife's cats.&quot;<br>

<br>
The code is already there in the &quot;You can't open this chest while fighting...&quot; stuff so just make it count it as a loss if you leave a 25% area or zone while under attack from a PC. Perhaps this would solve the problems in MMD.<br>
<br>
As to grid camping... Not counting a kill before someone has fully zoned in might be worth something.  Making the area around a grid exit always 75% sounds more fool-proof though =p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ugrimlakin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimlakin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#660000>(9/7/01 8:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm calling bullshit on today's update</span><hr size=1> This run away code is BS especially for the more social classes like that loving Beurocrat.

<br>
My point is grid/whompa camping is LAME.  It's like stomping and a sleeping dog's head.  Sure it may be a threat to you when it is awake.  It may be able to kill you in a stand up fight.  But because it is asleep and can't defend itself then stomping on it's head to kill it is just LAME.<br>
<br>
Or taking an ax to a bully that is takin a nap on his desk,..  blah blah blah....<br>
<br>
You get the idea.<br>
<br>
Now if they are yakin away with somoene in an 25 % zone and ya wanna gank the while they shout &quot;JUST HERE FOR A MISSION PLEASE DON'T KILL ME&quot;  then be my guest.  Effin idiot shoulda kept his/her trap shut and avoided high traffic areas. <p>Grimlakin

Gaurds/vendors could be similar EQ,  if you're KoS, they're super agro &amp; social (come to each other's aid).  Inside cities, new players *should* be able to get missions to get them to level 10 without having to deal with PvP.  Once you step outside the main gate, everything goes to 25% with degrades to 0% after you get 2-3 zones separated from any city.<br>
<br>
I can't speak for anyone else here, but it bugs me when I see an Omni all alone, deep inside clan territory and I/we can do nothing about it.  I'm willing to bet, many Omni players feel the same way when 1 of us clanners is freely roaming around Omni held territory.<br>
<br>
Grid camping is BS, but as everyone has already said, it's supposedly a war.  Anytime there is an easy way to gain anything, someone will exploit it.  Funcom needs to make a fix.  I can't see this ever happening to me, I've heard the complaints &amp; would never grid into a place like that.  Better to grid somewhere close and fly the rest of the way.<br>
<br>
Rooftops &amp; agents..  An agent is a sniper, snipers prefer to be on high ground.  Snipers use high power rifles with optical aiming devices to kill people from a long ways away with a single shot..  I expect that if an Agent catches me unaware, I will die.<br>
<br>
I've been to MMD 1 time.  I got there, looked around at the way it was *played*, thought it was silly and left.  It's a war, but only in small areas..<br>

Second, I just thought I'd speak up in defense of the grid-gankers - I love them.  I never walk to MMD - no reason to.  I buff up (including Quickness), and grid away perfectly secure in the knowledge that although people have tried to gank me in the past, they've never succeeded.  Most of them don't have speed buffs up, in my experience, and as long as my slider is at Defensive, no Aimed Shot or Burst is going to come close to taking me out, so what chance do they have?  I run off, circle back, find the ganker(s) and pick them off.  They're free kills.  People who fight that way are almost guaranteed not to be very good in a real fight, let alone when you have the jump on them.  <br>
<br>
I suppose the long and short of it is that I don't really pity people, especially MAs, who get killed by grid campers.  It's too preventable.  And I shit you not, when the first thing that comes up on my screen after I pop out of the grid is an Aimed Shot, I smile.  Moral of the story is this kids: love your grid-gankers - they're the easiest kills you'll ever find.<br>
