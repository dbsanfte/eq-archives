<br>
Funcom fixed our fist damage, and we can (properly equipped and implanted) do a good deal of the damage in fights now, as well as play critbuffers and nurses. But some MAs seem to have taken this as a cue to slack off, not getting implants when they should, and generally being weaker than they could be if they realized their potential.<br>
<br>
I play on RK-1, under the name Draist, and, admittedly, I have slacked some (at level 128, I know I could use all q200 implants if I clawed for it, but I've only got a 200 right hand and a bunch of 170s-180s with a 160 head piece), but overall, I try to stay equipped and 'with it', as a damage dealer, and as an asset to a team. Lately though, it seems like I've managed to team with MAs who either screwed up their characters royally and stuck with it, or who just aren't getting something, because a lot of them are extremely... lame.<br>
<br>
Before the fist damage fix, most MAs that you met who were above level 80 were extremely pro at their profession, because they had to be to function at all. Now, I meet all manner of MAs who I just have to wonder about.<br>
<br>
Am I becoming cynical here? Or has our profession been diluted by the masses now that it's 'cool'? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uxxxchaosshadexxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>xXxChaosshadexXx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#660000>(3/28/02 10:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1835.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rpgicons.com/images/icons/xg/faces/miang.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The State of Martial Arts in Rubi Ka</span><hr size=1> Hmph, it sounds like the same thing is happening to MAs what happened to tamers on UO.

At level 19 I still breeze through 75% missions, and get about two levels each three missions. I have yet to meet any real resistance with that character. <br>
<br>
All the complaints I have been hearing about the MA is for now purly academic to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I see that the road ahead is bound to become steeper, but I can understand that people who don't do their homework may not understand the true power of the MA (or any other character they play either).<br>
<br>
On the other side. I like to research my abilities. Not everyone does.

<br>
Someone may be really weak at there lv because they only need a couple more lvs to put their IP into treatment which then gives them the ability to wear better implants which in turn lets them use a better prog. they may have maxxed str stam agi int etc so they could put in these good implants and wear better armor. maybe they are an ex hammer ma. maybe they were a bow ma. ma;s arent fixed and everyone who has played an ma since release (like me) wont be able to 100% fix themselves until the IP reset is implemented.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ulethalfire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LethalFire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#660000>(3/29/02 7:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1835.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The State of Martial Arts in Rubi Ka</span><hr size=1> Dragonfly is right, personnally I invested 400k ip to use bows+fists before they nerfed it.<br>
And when I started at lvl 1 I had the goal to be self-dependant with implants by making my own ones.<br>
In a few level I will also max weapon smith to improve MA weapons.<br>
All of this wasn't required but they are little things that add a lot of fun to my gaming experience.<br>
<br>
And I can still solo 50% diff missions at lvl 141 so I don't regret the choice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

game. I was using premium stigmas, and ranee's, at lv65.<br>
MA's probably ARE taking the easy road. I know my agent<br>
did, after equipping the big dogs of rifles. Good thing is,<br>
14.2 will make him work up to the rifles, and working for<br>
a TIM's LLS would be infinitely valuable for firing faster.<br>
<br>
If things get easy, or you reach the pinnacle of equippable<br>
weapons, things get too easy, and you get bored, or<br>
slack of heavily. Personally, I've found playing an MA<br>
to be refreshing because every level REALLY counts.<br>
<br>
The name's Yasunori. I'm only Lv39, but at lv50-51, I ditch<br>
these QL50 implants for QL112-115 ones. Drag was right,<br>
seeing as MA's only OE talent lies in implants, which<br>
have large windows inbetween exchanges, right?<br>
<br>
From what I hear PvP is best for MA's between lv25-45,<br>
is that correct? Seems to me 50-51 is better with aggressive<br>
implanting. Of course, I'm a n00b... but I was just curious<br>
considering I plan on PvP-ing this MA very soon... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udevinlonehawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Devin Lonehawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#660000>(3/29/02 10:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1835.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The State of Martial Arts in Rubi Ka</span><hr size=1> Implants certainly play a significant role.  The desire to have the best possible implants relative to one's Treatment is certainly there, but, the motiviation may not, nor the credits.<br>
<br>
A second generation MA certainly benefits from prior knowledge and credits by one that precedes it (I find this to be true first hand with a recently rolled MA, although common knowledge to many).<br>
<br>
The other limiting factor as Dragonfly is correct in suggesting is the misappropriations of IPs.  For example, the desire may have been to go with a Bow at the expense of Fists at earlier levels, then later finding out that Bows aren't quite working.  This being the case, their Fist damage lags behind compated to others at equal level.<br>
<br>
The thing that I find which I like about this game is the breadth of possible outcomes based on one's choices in char development.  It's not so much that talent is required, but an understanding of a profession and it's inherent skills and the augmentations available.  That is one part of it, the other part of course is credits and the motiviation to carry out the development.<br>
<br>
Some are more motiviated than others, some are more motivated to just beg grovel from others which in most cases just falls on deaf ears.  Which of these two groups one happens to belong to is very apparent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=spitoon>Spitoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#660000>(3/29/02 2:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1835.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The State of Martial Arts in Rubi Ka</span><hr size=1> As stated above every one takes a different course with their character. <br>
<br>
I am personally underdeveloped in the implants mainly because I hate shopping for the stupid things and asking for help developing them. <br>
<br>
At lvl 70 I can still solo 75-85% missions if I am very careful and have a couple hours to kill.<br>
<br>
However it would seem to me that it would be harder to play without tweaking your character and adding state of art implants. Due to the fact the system is designed for the overequipped player. <br>
<br>
I think it is a good possiblity that most MA's over lvl 50 are pretty accomplished players due the fact we were so gimped for such a long time. Now that we have a little love the game is really much easier for us to play becuase we are so used to having to scuffle through a mission.<br>

<br>
now i have to redo my implants so i can cast uvc much easier at the expense of AC. and with MK2 armor AC is now important. but usually there is an engi, soldier, or another MA in team that will be able to make up for it.<br>
<br>
so dont sweat it. i also cant wait for the IP reset. at lvl 175 i have a bit of wasted IP myself. Shot gun. maxed it for title. only go to 544 so was basically useless cuz u cant self swap a decent SG with only 544 and no plants to go with it. <br>
<br>
really just about the only wasted IP i have. cept for some small stuff pre lvl 20. but about 400 IP in a dark blue skill is alot of IP i can spread elswhere. probably back into multi melee and 1he or maybe into bow so i can finally have a decent ranged attack.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1835.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1835.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1835.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=1835.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.threadControl?topicID=1835.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1835.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1835.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm10">Polling Corner<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market - Rubi-Ka 1<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm9">The Market - Rubi-Ka 2<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm8">Past Humor Links<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1>Main Dojo</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
