(I know this is pitiful)<br>
<br>
I know this will be inevitable but I am having a hard time doing it.<br>
<br>
EQMunkie has been with my family now for over 2 years now.  She is the basis not only for an online character but for all that follow her as an Avatar... hence AOMunkie.<br>
<br>
I have spoke of her as if she was an alive and pumping being, that I actually know.  <br>
<br>
EQ-Munkie is 25 Months Old<br>
EQ-Munkie has found the 51st level<br>
EQ-Munkie almost has her Epic<br>
EQ-Munkie is well know and respected in EQ circles<br>
EQ-Munkie is known and loved by my children<br>
EQ Munkie is ALIVE!<br>
<br>
But I think it is time &lt;whispered voice&gt; to commit pixelcide.  I just don't know to bring myself to do this.  I know I will have nightmares of her waiting impatiently inside some server locked deep in Verant for me to come and select her from the character selction screen.  And when this doesn't happen I fear for the worst.  Not to mention the horrible guilt I will feel about offing her (DAMN YOU VERANT)!<br>
<br>
They have figured it out.  To keep this pixelated pice of memory alive I must pay 10$ a month life support.  <br>
<br>
Ugh... what am I to do?  Sneak up on the computer when she is not looking.<br>
<br>
Perhaps a party?  Get stinky-drunk and then do it, and claim I didn't know what I was doing 'cause I was drunk (I will still get nailed for conspiracy to delete a pixel).<br>
<br>
Any suggestions on how to bring the end about to Miss Munkie of Everquest?  Anyone else have this odd feeling of guilt for murdering your Avatar?<br>
<br>
And yes let the posts come stating that I am sick, this I have given way to and agree with...<br>
<br>
I am looking for HELP!<br>
<br>
Munkie in all &lt;cry&gt; games! <p><img src="http://www.naugatuck.com/ext_pics/munksig9.jpg">

(no treasure chests, lame ass theif class, horrible race balance, no good skills system to speak, insanely difficult low level mobs in the expansion zones, stupid faction system) EQ held my attention for along time. <br>
<br>
Long enough to have a 47th level Ogre Shadow knight,<br>
32nd level Dark elf warrior, 25th level Iksar Monk, and a puny 14th level necromanceress.  I had the game 3 or 4 months after release, and took a few breaks here and there...<br>
I still came back. Why? Well it wasn't the game really. It was all the online buddies I made over the course of time. I watched some little punk necro go from 26th level(I was only 10th at the time) To become a 60th level soloing powerhouse. <br>
He was a great guy to converse with. He wasn't the only one. <br>
<br>
What I finally decided though, was... Do I want to pay 10 dollars a month for a chat program, or a game I can play with/without a group. AO is alot like EQ in many ways. Though it is better also. I like the fact that, while grouping is the most effective way to level most of the time. I can still solo, but at a personal, monetary cost. So, as long as this game has all the bonuses it does, and the fun times like I had in EQ. I know I'll be happy. <br>
<br>
So how did I finally rid myself of EQ? ...Gave all my stuff to a 40th level rogue friend of mine. Then ran my Ogre Sk to meet his master in the Plane of Fear. =)<br>
<br>
Ran around about 5 minutes before I trained the zone to CT himself. ...Ah... Now that was a way to go! I was so amused that it didn't hurt to hit cancel on the account. <br>
<br>
Now, a few months later. AO is here. So far  I like it a bunch. <br>
Hopefully it will keep me as amused as I hope. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=genjuro>Genjuro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#660000>(8/1/01 3:46:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How DO I Commit Murder</span><hr size=1> And I have to add.

<br>
As far as pixilcide...   it depends on how you play your monk young ummmm lady?   If you were true to your class the whole time and helped young Monks and all of that kind of rot then do something that could make an impact on the game world.  Petition to become a master before you leave.   Or simply roleplay you accepting the Title of Master of a school before you log off.  Don't consider her dead.  Consider her retired with a little monk family and Dojo training future monks to save the lands and explore Kunark looking for a good 1hb.<br>

I just recently canceled my EQ account, fired off a nasty email to Verant (but I didn't swear at them) explaining why I was canceling and said good bye to my beloved guild.<br>

I loved my character and my wonderful guildmates very much. I had so much time invested in them. Saying good bye is very hard.<br>

There is no easy way to finally pull the plug on the grouping of pixels that dominated you life for so long.<br>
<br>
I went through the same thing with EQ-Citrine.<br>
It's like erasing a part of yourself.<br>
I just couldn't find the strength to click the cancel button.<br>
I actually had a friend of mine do it for me.<br>
<br>
Since then, Citrine has made her appearance on Rubi-Ka and hooked up with some old friends from Norrath. This helped make the transition a little less painful.<br>
<br>

When u hunt solo, unless u are in a guild, there's no one to talk to.  In EQ you could talk to people in the same zone and have everybody listen.  If you didn't want to hear all that talk you just cut the channel, that was really nice.<br>

<br>
I actually got on EQ last Sunday, since Funcom kindly gave me no other gaming option with the patch-crash, planning to give away gear to my friends.  Turned out that most of my friends had either already gone, or were planning on jumping ship too.  Same thing with my old guild - only one person on.  This may make things easier, a big part of not wanting to delete my account is that I would be deserting my friends.  Seems now that I'll just be one more person jumping off of the sinking ship.<br>

Anyhow, I feel your pain.  I'm just going to focus on my new main (assuming I settle on one eventually!) and my new friends in AO.<br>
