(even tho I am only in a few of your ranges...and they have yet to attack me when we are standing beside of each other)  I have been told so many different reasons why I am KoS....and have been told to apologize.  So, there is where I don't know where to begin at.  I have been told some people in AD think that I am Xbena.  Well,  I can promise you that I am not.  If you have seen me around..you can see my corpses laying around near me.  And from what I have heard about Xbena she's pretty tough...so how can you possibly think I am her I have no idea.  #2 reason i have heard:  I have healed Lukoma when you guys have jumped him when he was KoS.  Well I am only a little druid, how can I possibly think that I can out heal a slew of AD jumping him.....so whenever you guyys think that I have done that....think back really hard..I didn't, I have sat and watched him die or gate (wanting to stay out of the situation). #3 reason i have heard: I was invited to join PB on their Fear raid.  Ok keep in mind that I am only a little druid, and was in Chaotic Neutrals atthe time.  CN did not have the people to even be able to walk into fear never the less kill something in there.  So of course I was all about going to get the Fear armor for my class.  I still see nothing wrong with that.  If I would have asked you guys &quot;Hey can I go to Fear with you&quot;  You would have probably laughed at me and said &quot;No we don't need an extra bosy tro have to rez every few minutes.&quot;  True, Adell did send me a tell when I was in Fear telling me that if I didn't leave Fear then I was gonna be KoS.  Well, you know I almost did.  But then I thought to myself..this is my only chance to be on a raid and for me to get armor...and then I also thought to myselfNo AD isn't a big asshole of a guild like everyone says they won't do anything about it,  maybe they will understand that i'm just a little lowbie trying to get shit.  HMMMMMM I now see what happened.  <br><br>So now what am I suppose to apologize for? For being someone I am not? Healing someone I did not? Or trying to get myself geared up the only way I knew possible at the time?<br><br>So I guess I am apologizing for this stuff....I have heard other countless reasons too that I am KoS...but those 3 are the reasons that I have heard the most.  <br><br>I seriously do think it is hilarious that I can be Kos to someone and still have 2 spells and a book sold to me by a member REALLY cheap,  and having my corpse drug from several bad places, being buffed by someone, getting a rez, helping with a quest....by the same people that say they hate me and that I am DOUBLE KoS to them at the same time.  <br><br>So is this acceptable to make myself Non-KoS?  <br><br><br><br>Hugs and Kisses !<br><br>Elizibith Heartrobber<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ubiguss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Biguss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gimp0r</span><br>  Posts: 906<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 2:25:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: un-kos</span><hr size=1> You are not unkos.. and quite frankly i dont fall for your hugs and kisses bullshit<br><br><br>Facts<br>You were dragging PB corpses to get them rezzes during the fear raid we came upon.<br>You have came into zones we were expin in to inspect us and then moments later xbena comes in to try to gank the person who was wearing gear.<br>You have been warned several times to stay away and stop helping pb, which u dont seem to care to listen to.<br><br>Personally i do wish just to see you get in lvl range so that we can kill you, corpse camp you and all the other mean stuff us Evil gestapo AD do.<br><br>Your still KOS<br><br>Hugs and kisses,<br> <p><img src="http://www.users.qwest.net/~njcogswell/bigusssig.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ubiguss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Biguss</A> at: 4/16/02 11:26:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uquillarstav.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QuillarStav</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 336<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 8:59:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://photos.yahoo.com/bc/quillarstav/ WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: un-kos</span><hr size=1>      I'm not an officer so I have no official say in this but if you want some advice, stop grouping with and helping PB.  There are many raid groups and guilds who can do fear and other places for druids to get some decent equipment.  <br><br>     PB and AD are at war.  A war brought on because PB let FU drag them into it.  Since you've come here to post, you now know this and can understand that you are and will remain kos if you insist on helping them, grouping them, drag corpses for them etc.  As you, apparently, are not level 56 yet, there isn't a lot that AD can do to stop you you from these actions.  If you do intend to level to and/or past level 56, you might want to consider working to get un-kos.  Posting here is a good first step, talk is cheap however and your actions will, in the end, deterimine your kos status.  <br><br>Hope this helps,<br>Q<br> <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl"><IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80 SRC="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame/6.png" ALT="What Video Game Character Are You?

BIG OLE AD  pickin on the lil people. Its kinda funny how freaked out u guys are over this xbena chick, and cause shes such a threat u are grasping to take revenge on unsuspecting people. I know elizibith very personally and i know for a fact that she does not know Xbena, i know for a fact she has spent multiple nights tryin to figure out who this person u all say she has been helpin is. Do u have any proof she hangs with Xbena. Do YOU know for a fact there friends. Prob not your all just prob so bored u have nothing else better to do. Who on this server appointed u guys the police. WHy in the hell should any one pay U jerks money to lay off. Me myself wil be in all your range very soon and look very foward to goin Toe to Toe. Frankly me and over half the server are sick of your over powering tactics. The pointless trains and Exp loss due to u morons are your gay wars. I have addressed u Face toi Face im keepin my name out of this for the time being to prevent a guild war with my guild due to the fact i am the only one willin to step up and call u what u are  ASSHOLES. I cant wait for the day im KoS to u jerks =)&gt; Biggest thing that makes me laugh is why your actually worried about PvP. Arent u al supposed to be no drop... and the fact that one person can roll up in your raid and kill any of u is just hillarious =). Work on those PvP skills peeps cause its obvious u all suck ass. Now as u all know PB is basically no more. From what i understand PB has tried to make peice with u all. LET IT GO. U know sometimes i wonder if u guys are wanting to go PK. Our last incounter was in SS and one of u logged on one of your gay twink wizzards to kill me. Aye he blind sided me and got first kill but sadly after that he did have to die. AD basicaly suxs ass and like i said over half of the server will agree. Is this the rep u all set out to get. To be the most hated guild ON rallos Zek. Just curious. Welp i said my peace ill see u all face down in about 3 lvls =) ( BTW  im not PK) isnt it sad when an anti wants to kill another anti so bad. I lokk forward to reading all the smack talk u will be posting very soon<br>  Much Love<br>( 1-800-345-9908   number to the local doctor that specialized in  removing sticks from Pricks ass holes) =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uterin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Terin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 1:32:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ?</span><hr size=1> Uh yeah.<br><br>An interesting read but you can find more truth in your daily horoscope.<br><br>Have fun in la la land.<br><br>Staark <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrazykane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>crazykane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 1:37:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?</span><hr size=1> Bah lame responce   NEXT! ! ! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uwetall.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wetall</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Bed Wetter</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 1:38:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?</span><hr size=1> Owe Owe my eyes...Havent you ever heard of paragraph's..And so i dont get the &quot;you ignore my valid points and make fun of my grammer speech&quot;<br><br>Your post was pathetically thought out and you have really no bearing nor clue as to what happened in the situation..<br><br>She was asked to stop..warned to stop.. told to leave.. offered Tl's and she refused all of the above<br><br>Wetall&quot;Return key plz&quot;Boneshatter <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ubiguss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Biguss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gimp0r</span><br>  Posts: 910<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 1:38:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: un-kos</span><hr size=1> yawn, anonymous posts mean jack shit....<br><br><br>ho hum we are so evil!<br><br>In fact that imma make my new sig hitler nude with biguss's face...<br><br> <p><img src="http://www.users.qwest.net/~njcogswell/bigusssig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrazykane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>crazykane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 1:42:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?</span><hr size=1>       Why should anyone care about u all askin them to vacate the area they are exping in.

See Para-, and Graphic, and cf. Paraph.] <br><br>1. Originally, a marginal mark or note, set in the margin to call attention to something in the text, e. g., a change of subject; now, the character [para], commonly used in the text as a reference mark to a footnote, or to indicate the place of a division into sections. <br><br>Note: This character is merely a modification of a capital P (the initial of the word paragraph), the letter being reversed, and the black part made white and the white part black for the sake of distinctiveness. <br><br>2. A distinct part of a discourse or writing; any section or subdivision of a writing or chapter which relates to a particular point, whether consisting of one or many sentences. The division is sometimes noted by the mark ?, but usually, by beginning the first sentence of the paragraph on a new line and at more than the usual distance from the margin. <br><br>3. A brief composition complete in one typographical section or paragraph; an item, remark, or quotation comprised in a few lines forming one paragraph; as, a column of news paragraphs; an editorial paragraph. <br><br>Source: Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, © 1996, 1998 MICRA, Inc. <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrazykane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>crazykane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 1:57:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?</span><hr size=1>    HHMM english teacher?  who knows but still im am waiting on proof of why u think liz and xbena are in cahoots.

You see, thats what has been supposed to happen, but too many goddamn lil fucks slip thru the cracks and never have to pay a dime for the problems they cause.<br><br>Whats funny is that, the MINORITY (aka the bitches who do this shit) whine when we have to uphold rules, but guess what Einstien? THe rest of the server doesnt give a shit bout you lil maggots anyways. They are busy getting their exp, raiding their cool places, scoring their loots, hanging with their friends, and killing their pks/kos... People cheer us on cuz we actually take the time to set a standard that there are rules to this server and they will be maintained... If you dont like it, go to legends, quit the game, or make a new char.<br><br>If upholding server made rules is being assholes, evil, gestapo, meanyheads, whatever else you retards can think up... then fine..

BUT where are the boundaries. When u so called police go to uphold the law and take away from innocents exp and play time hw is that cool . Should everyone keep noted on KoS to avopid zones that YOUR KoS are in  thats BS. I have been trained multiple times in OS SS and zones the like by AD tryin to get to gay ass KoS. And i wasnt even grouped with your KoS. I lost exp and my time to play without even an appology. Is that cool, i think not. Even in real life if police take the lives of innocents there are reprocutions true or false.<br><br>         I didnt label u guys pricks u all did that yourselves.
