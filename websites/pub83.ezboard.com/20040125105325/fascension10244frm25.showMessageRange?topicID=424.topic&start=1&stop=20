Army? no...I am a Marine, and have been one for 9 years.  I have spent time in every corner of the world - from Kosovo to Guantanamo Bay, from Parris Island to Okinawa, from Norway to California, and soon Iraq.   Learn to recognize and respect the people that defend your right to speak and breathe.  When and if you ever get the hair on your sack to give your life to defend something you believe in, you can talk shit.  Till then assume the position and kiss the crack of my ass, if you are so fortunate to get that close.<br>

Er, in all fairness to Silene whom I thought during my time in AD was a good member, the reasons for her departure were given to anyone who asked as far as I know. She left quietly, I don't remember any drama that spread to the guild about this subject aside from the chat channels, I don't see the issue. Just let it go Dermel- I'm all for fighting the good fight but don't let the shit go off the deep end.<br>
<br>
Later Ruhi, I'm 100% sure you'll be back again but til then have a nice break, even if you did kick me out of Caveo Ervum and try to block my AD app, I did always like you a lot ! /huggles<br>
<br>
And Silene who I never really talked to, much like everyone in EQ (Its like calling someone irl, using /tells is hard ok) I hope you enjoy your time with Wudan, your skill is unquestionable and your loyalty to friends is the same.

I really doubt that Dermel.

Its obvious that you posted with such intent, and furthermore used the opportunity to make jabs at Tiig and Ruhi.<br>

You want to play the military card, then fine.  While I maintain immediate respect for anyone who volunteers their lives for the service of their country; it isn't commanding  - and, unfortunately, it speaks nothing for your personal integrity.

Silene deguilded on the spot because an officer asked her nicely to have her young son (who happened to be playing Ruhi, not as a favor to AD, but more as a favor to Silene) leave the raid in Plane of Air to make room for recruits and guild members. As you know there's a 72 person limit for raids, and there just wasn't room for Silene's son. The situation was handled as nicely as it could be.<br>
<br>
Silene did not offer any explanation or even try to talk to the officer in question about this request - she just guildremoved herself immediately. All of the AD officers attempted to work the situation out and reach a compromise with Silene (even after the fact), to no avail. Nobody crossed Silene or treated her unfairly, in fact we did everything we could to accomodate her. She chose to hold a grudge over something petty and play the victim role, and I'm here to tell you that's complete bullshit.<br>
<br>
That's not what I'd call 'loyal to the end', but whatever. Good luck with Wudan. Hope they don't make a decision with the best interest of their guild in mind - which in turn pisses you off and makes you quit on the spot again. <br>

I don't need to, Dermel and Kilyin doing a great job.<br>
<br>
Since ya wanna be petty, let's get the facts straight:<br>
<br>
&quot;Silene deguilded on the spot because an officer asked her nicely to have her young son (who happened to be playing Ruhi, not as a favor to AD, but more as a favor to Silene) leave the raid in Plane of Air to make room for recruits and guild members.&quot;<br>
<br>
Err, wrong, he was not playing Ruhi, he wasn't doing me any favors, nor did he take a spot over any AD members. You can ask Slithur. He wanted us to use Surety.<br>
<br>
&quot;Silene did not offer any explanation or even try to talk to the officer in question about this request - she just guildremoved herself immediately. All of the AD officers attempted to work the situation out and reach a compromise with Silene (even after the fact), to no avail. Nobody crossed Silene or treated her unfairly, in fact we did everything we could to accomodate her. She chose to hold a grudge over something petty and play the victim role, and I'm here to tell you that's complete bullshit.<br>
<br>
Err, wrong again, I did talk to officers, the two that were on, Naerini and Slithur, they gave their opinion, I gave mine.<br>
<br>
I spoke to Adell after the fact, again I gave my opinion she gave hers.<br>
<br>
I spoke to Yslaath, he told me if had he been there it wouldn't of gone down the way it did, and wtf did I listen to Naerini, he has her on permanent ignore. He then put me on permanent ignore. Great communication between officers going on there.<br>
<br>
Lohengrin never did reach out to me.<br>
<br>
Orchid did, he was sorry on the whole matter, and wish I'd come back.<br>
<br>
And you sir Kilyin, never once sent me a tell til about a week later, when AD wanted to finally kill Corniva (sp?) and you were short clerics. I remember you trying very hardly to get me to come back to AD, that night only of course, since you were lacking clerics.  And the way to loot was being delayed!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That's not what I'd call 'loyal to the end', but whatever. Good luck with Wudan. Hope they don't make a decision with the best interest of their guild in mind - which in turn pisses you off and makes you quit on the spot again. <br>
<br>
Not loyal to the end. Hmm, maybe you see me as disloyal, maybe I see you as a self absorbed lootwhore. <br>
<br>
It's in Wudan's hands now to see me for what I am.<br>
AD can worry about ya, let's just hope they don't award any loot you ask for to someone else, or maybe you will disband in a hissy fit for the night.<br>
<br>
<br>
To all the Uptight Clerics, Be happy. You'll live longer.<br>

You are one delusional bitch. I haven't seen so many lies since the OJ trial. Let's get one thing straight first of all. I never really cared that you left. Quite simply, it didn't phase me in the slightest. I posted my response not because I have a grudge, but because all your FS buddies are here trying to portray you as some sort of martyr, and acting like your shit doesn't stink, and that's just not how it is. Ruhi created this thread. If I really cared that much, I would have posted about it five months ago. AD is doing great. In hindsight I'm glad you left. Grats Wudan on your drama.<br>
<br>
Moving along - I was on that night, and yes it was Ruhi your son was playing, not Surety. You didn't talk to any officers, until AFTER you got your panties in a wad and guildremoved because Naerini politely asked you if your son could leave the raid to make room for recruits and other guild members. No sooner than she even asked you that, you zoned out without a word and removed yourself from the guild. You can say it happened differently, but you'd be lying.<br>
<br>
As far as one of your other lies, I guarantee you Zhao never said anything like that, especially about Naerini. See, one of the biggest mistakes you made Silene, was claiming one of the most selfless, nicest, always put the guild first people on RZ (Naerini) was 'rude' and 'unfair' to you. Maybe if you had said that about me, someone might have believed you. Claiming AD officers have each other on ignore too, that's a fucking laugh. Excuse me while I chuckle at your weak-ass spin doctoring. Ok, I'm done.<br>
<br>
We weren't short clerics, the longest talk I had with you just happened to be on a night we were doing Coirnav. You didn't come back, we killed Coirnav. Explain to me how any of what you claim makes a bit of sense? It doesn't. To tell you the truth, I only talked to you at someone else's request, not because we were 'short clerics' and the lewt flow was in danger. Are you really shallow enough to think that YOU make or break an AD raid? Even I'm not that much of an egomaniac. Check yourself, honey, before someone pops that overinflated head of yours.<br>
<br>
Everyone is human, everyone gets mad at stupid shit sometimes, except maybe Arlene and Naerini. You're not the only one to ever throw a tantrum and guildremove yourself. The difference between you and me Silene (for example) is that I have the capacity to look back and admit wrongdoing, or poor judgement.  I'm not too proud to apologize when I fuck up. You lack the character and the integrity for the former and the latter. To be frank, I pity you, and I sympathize with Wudan when they have to deal with your drama-queen bullshit and you abandon them too. Although, Wudan has done well before you came along, and just like AD, I'm sure they'll continue to do well after you leave over something amazingly stupid.<br>
