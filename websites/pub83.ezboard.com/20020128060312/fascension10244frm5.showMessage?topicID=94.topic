Have full ToV, epics, any primal I can use - so I have little need for loot. <br><br>Why then do I want to join, is probably the first question that pops into anyone's mind. I'm not a loner, and enjoy the chat, the loyalty, and the comaraderie of being in a Guild. Being unguilded is a new experience for me, and not a particularly good one. Also, there are a lot of places I have yet to see and do. I'm not going to get there with a pickup group of 6 or 12 people. <br><br>Actually, when Sabbat fell, BoK probably would have all joined AD, but as many of you know Adell and Kasg aren't exactly on the best or terms. I have been with BoK since day one. Have played with Kasg and Fyrestaff since then. They are my closest friends in EQ, and always will be as long as they play - which does not appear to be much longer, as Staff's account is closed and although Rile is still active, Jon is busy with law school, raising a daughter, and working. EQ isn't that high on the priority list for him. Those that know Kasg, knows he's relentless. He gives 100% of himself all the time and demands the same from others he plays with. He's burnt out from EQ, and seldom plays. <br><br>I feel I was loyal to sabbat, and I know I got treated very well and fairly, not to mention I was the lowest level ever allowed into Sabbat. However my first loyalties were with the ones I started with, so I was not willing to leave BoK to join any other guild.<br><br>I have all the necessary requirements with respect to resistances and item checklist. I have all keys with exception of VP, but I do have a few pieces of the quest. <br><br>I also have a past, and the last several months of it has not been my best. I got put into a situation where I was at war against many of my friends, and the people that helped me get where I am today. I can't change that. I fought and I died. I fought and I won. But through it all, I think I maintained my beliefs in honor and fair play. <br><br>In the end, I think the players that have known me since the beginning of sabbat, knows that, though I may be a bit outspoken and will say whats on my mind, I'm a team player who isn't greedy, plays fair, expects loyalty, and gives it back twice over.<br><br>Thank you for your time if you read this. If you didn't, it's probably because you can't read. <br><br>Baron Darkfyre Mortnoire<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uendymia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Endymia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#333333>(1/2/02 4:32:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Application to Join</span><hr size=1> You got me as a sponsor for sure. <br><br>I have been in BOK myself and know Darkfyre pretty well.

Few minutes later Kasgardigen is in the zone asking why we attacked a non-guilded person.  After a quick explanation of &quot;all ex-bok/pb/FU are kos to IE till they make amends&quot; he tells us he will never make amends and asked if we would kill him.  Couple seconds later after he zones to his bind point, I replied with a &quot;yes&quot;.<br><br>So, putting 2 and 2 together, Darkfyre has access to Kasgardigen.  I doubt Kasg would give access without having access to Darkfyre himself, so you could expect all the Fyre family to have access to him. This all happened last week.<br><br>I am not AD and prolly shouldn't post here, but I figure you guys can take this for what it is worth, if anything at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udarkfyremortnoire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkfyre Mortnoire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(1/3/02 10:57:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Darkfyre</span><hr size=1> Ok, I was not going to post any comments to anything that was said here, good or bad.  but I feel I need to clarify one thing.<br><br>Some of the older Sabbat members probably know this, as does a few of my friends that were in BoK.  I was a Guide since the beginning of Phase 3 of beta.  Guides had only one account.  Their account is flagged as a GM account and can be seen by any other flagged one.  Account sharing is grounds for being banned for anyone, and worse so for a Guide.  If a person logged on one of my Guide characters and was caught, I would be banned, as would the person on it.  Those of you that were in Sabbat think back.  Do you remember how our plane raids always had a few Guides sitting in your chat rooms while you prepped.  Well, they were there because they were in Sabbat playing on a Guide flagged account.  <br><br>During that time, I never allowed anyone to log me on.  And as a player, guides were held to tighter rules than players.  Complaints about us for exploiting, corpse camping, etc...  were not handled the same way.  We could lose our account over any rule infraction, and I had seen it happen many times.  Plus it would be pretty hypocritical for me to do the same things I report players on, so I played the game and always stuck within the letters of the rules, without exception.  When I finally quit the Guide program, I never changed the style of my play, and I still haven't.<br><br>There are two people in this game that I consider my closest friends, and that I trusted without hesitation, Kasgadirgen and Fyrestaff.  Oh, I have many more friends and people I trust, but they are the two that I have known the longest, and have played to most with.  As a matter of fact, I knew Fyrestaff long before EQ ever came out.  <br><br>I will not post here that I have ever given my account information out to anyone, that would be admitting to  violating the EULA, and grounds for banning, as you all well know.  <br><br>However, someone did gain access to my account, and did at times use it during the BoK-PB/AD wars.  I did not give them permission, I was not aware of them using it, I do not condone anything they did, but I do however, accept responsibility for any actions done on my account.  I have also personally apologized to anyone that told me I wronged them in any way.  If I missed anyone, you have my apologies, as well.  <br><br>People that have known me for any length of time, know how I play.  Even during the never-ending BoK/TB war, I think most TB will tell you I fought within the guidelines of the rules, and never cheated, corpse camped, bind camped, or anything else like that, nor did I talk shit.  I took my lumps, and gave them out - but did it with honor.<br><br>Now, to address the last two posts.  Malio, I have never given Fyrefist my account information, and have never had permission to use it. PERIOD.  To Drosenj, I was talking on the telephone the day your group attacked me in The Deep.  I told kasg, he logged on himself.  He stood there and waited for you to attack.  Do you think he was that inept as a cleric to allow himself to be pk'd 10 steps from a zone line.  <br><br>So, now you have all the info.  Judge people by their actions, but if their actions seem out of their character take into consideration it may not be who you think it is.  Fyrestaff quit playing, kasg barely does, no one has my info - so if you see Darkfyre, you know its the real McCoy.<br><br>    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utavilrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TavilRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(1/4/02 2:16:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Heh</span><hr size=1> Well, Dark, I think that he was that inept, simply because he was rooted, blinded, and killed in under 7 seconds.
