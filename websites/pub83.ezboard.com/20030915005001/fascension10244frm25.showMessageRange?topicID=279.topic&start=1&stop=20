i am rotations officer for Celestial Empire. There are a number of lower level guilds rotating mobs, rotation board is on Seekers of Divinity board. (at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.wiberg.nu/~larsen01/phpBB2/index.php)">www.wiberg.nu/~larsen01/p...index.php)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Guilds in the rotation are:<br>
celestial empire<br>
covenant of the wolf<br>
seekers of divinity<br>
legacy of the fallen (mainly the reformed eternal shadows just so you know)<br>
magus imperilaus magus (ok, spelling is wrong)<br>
comet noscet.<br>
an informal wudan twinks/friends/alts raid group (they probably joining rotation too soon i think)<br>
<br>
mobs being rotated are:<br>
cursed cycle srz temple<br>
ntov<br>
creator<br>
sleepers tomb<br>
king tormax / idol / aow<br>
cazic thule.<br>
<br>
not all the guilds are in those rotations (ie some guilds are working their way up to joining some of these rotations, some higher guilds don't do the lower level mobs) but broadly, these guilds have agreed to do the rotations.<br>
<br>
The parameters are pretty straight forward, 24 hours to kill, after which, free for all. About 75% of time the rotated mobs are killed withing 24 hours, so there is still plenty of opportunity to kill them while FFA if people need them.<br>
<br>
Does AD wish to join rotation for any of these mobs?<br>
I know most of these mobs are generally well below AD level mobs, reason i ask, from info i have recieved (although i can't personally verify it) AD have dropped some of these mobs recently.  <br>
If you wish to be part of any of these rotated mobs, it is easy, just have your rotation officer sign up to sod board and ask for acces to rotation forum. There are generally qualifiers for killing stuff, but don't think AD would really have to prove they can kill any of this stuff <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
If you do not wish to be part of these rotations, can i ask please that you respect the agreed rotations set out here.  Rotations generallly seem to be the way that guilds work out contested spawns, and if it works on the AD/wudan / mim level, no reason why it can't work at our level too.<br>
<br>
PS: maybe i should have edited the first line. i don't mean to imply that any of the guilds i listed above are 'lower level guilds'.  I know each is uber in their own way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , don't want to bruise any egos.<br>

I don't think I'm going to give you the answer you want but I'll try to give you our perspective on these mobs<br>
<br>
yes AD has dropped several of the mobs on that list somewhat recently (the past month?).. there are also some on that list we haven't touched in a long time<br>
<br>
All of those events you list are all pick up events for us, which means that generally they are unplanned, done by a small number of people, and done either before or after our main raiding time.  None of the mobs on that list are actually planned ahead of time, nor will we be adding them into our schedule again.<br>
<br>
I hope that as part of your rotation you'll allow whatever guilds mob we 'steal' that day to have another legit shot the next pop.  That's the best possible solution I can offer you and how other guilds have handled it in the past.<br>
<br>
Sorry that we can't join up into rotations with all of you, but it's hard enough rotating the current content we're doing.. those mobs you listed are just treated by us as FFA. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mearisthecowslayer>Mearis The Cowslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#333333>(6/20/03 8:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My thoughts</span><hr size=1> I am posting here as an SoD officer, and its pretty hard to be impartial since I have plenty of friends in AD, but I am very dedicated to this guild.<br>
<br>
When we listed our rotation mob, we avoided placing mobs that can be done with 6 people with the exception of ST, because mobs like Zlandicar, Dozekar, Klandicar, Statue of Rallos Zek are too easy to farm with just a few people 2 boxing, that legislating a rotation on them would be very hard.<br>
<br>
Mobs like Tormax, however require a slightly bigger crew, even for a guild like AD, and I assume those take at least 15 or so, even for an elemental guild to kill, and are slightly easier to control.<br>
<br>
The main reason for a rotation, other than ensuring mobs are evenly shared is to be able to schedule your events.  Since AD has long since been the top guild on server, competition has been less of an issue, but its wonderful to be able to post a schedule for the week to allow people to plan ahead and make events.  Most of SoD's players aren't hardcore players like those found in AD, and being able to post a time for a mob is a great help for us.  <br>
<br>
Before we managed to get a rotation worked among the guilds in our tier, this was impossible - expecially with mobs having a +- 12 hour random timer associated with them, officers would have to check non stop on twinks when a mob would spawn, and then rush over and kill it as soon as we spotted it up, and it was very stressing, lead to many disputes, and often times our USA players would never make events because they'd never know when we'd end up killing anything.  <br>
<br>
An example that used to happen, is after checking non stop for Tormax during our prime raiding time (7-11 CET) we end up going after an alternative target, and right as people are preparing to log off, we notice Tormax spawning.  Before, we'd have to beg clerics to stay online perhaps past their planned bedtime and be late at work the next day, and get it killed RIGHT AWAY, or risk Reverant killing it during the night; and people would be in a horrible mood - with a rotation instead, we can say, heck, we got 24 hours to kill it, kill it tomorrow instead, nobody will touch it.  If we know on the other hand, that no 'prime' targets will live past USA late night time, it puts an entire different pressure on people's minds, and changes EQ from fun to a job.<br>
<br>
I understand that those mobs are beyond trivial for AD, and that probably at any time during the day they could field enough bots/players to kill them, but at least a mob like Cursed requires us to plan ahead.<br>
<br>
I understand that after a night of raiding, and perhaps wiping to new content, slaying trivial content for twinks, or perhaps getting some loot that recruits could use is therapeutic, but there's plenty of mobs that drop very good loot that are FFA - and any mob that is left up for longer than 24 hours, is of course FFA as well.<br>
<br>
While AD might end up killing less mob, if they randomly take them FFA when they are up than if they joined the rotation, it is far more damaging if mobs are killed FFA, because it can be an extreme morale killer for people to come in early from work expecting to do cursed, only to find that it died already.  MiM and Wudan, who both have a late night crew who goes after mobs, both agreed to respect mobs that are rotated by us, and go after them only when they become FFA, or go after different mobs.<br>
<br>
In the case that a specific loot is requrired, like for example a new warriors needs a Blade of Carnage, or a newly recruited melee needs primal, let us know and we are very willing to accomodate you in whatever way.  I would mention ST keys as well, but there's plenty of ST mobs that are FFA, and Sontolak is always up, and Zlandicar is perma farmed by some AD members, so I don't imagine that would be an issue.<br>
<br>
Both at a friends level and at a guild level me/SoD have a great relationship with AD -  I owe a lot of very good advice to plenty of friends, and those in AD who help us regularly we try to help in return or award them some of the loot we get which might be upgrades for them, and we try to help whenever we can on occasions like Ring Wars, AoW's, and I have no wish to ruin it in any way.<br>
<br>
The reason why its so important that we hopefully get this sorted out, is because a rotation depends on everyone complying, and while AD doesn't 'hog' those mobs, having a single rogue guild or group of people makes it very hard to enforce it, and more importantly to plan events. <br>
<br>
Anyway, sorry for this long and rambled post, but it took a lot of work to get Wudan, CE, MiM, ES (now Legacy of the Fallen) CN, Reverant (now not anymore) to agree to a rotation, and its very disappointing that the top guild on the server, perhaps the champion of rotations on this server wouldn't understand how important this is and try and encourage us instead of making it harder.<br>

unfortuetly as long as people have the ablity to do certain encounters by them selves or with a few slecet frends and this benifits them directly either by gearing up their twinks or selling the loot to others you can bet your bottom dollar any mob in question will be a FFA mob<br>

<br>
If a single SoD person continually hogs for example Lodizal, that can be easily duo'd or solo'd, the entire guild can hardly be held into account, but if 3 dozen SoD's take part in an action, than its something the entire guild is represented in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sirdario>sirdario</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drama Please!</span><br>  Posts: 760<br> <font color=#333333>(6/20/03 2:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My thoughts</span><hr size=1> I'll say personally that when we are aware of it we do try to leave spawns in those rotations alone, to an extent.

I'd be interested to know what mobs exactly though are still highly contested / rotated by the lower tier guilds so that these sort of requests can better be accomidated! not asking for access to spawn rotation board or anything like that and infact would prefer not, but a list would suffice. tks <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.aladarya.com/Sirdariosig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>

All we ask, is that if you do want to kill those mobs, you make an effort to rotate them with us and kill them during your turn, like all other guilds have offered to do, or, kill them after 24 hours they are spawned.<br>
<br>
None of those fights are particularly fun imho, but the reason why those mobs are considered premium at our tier and the same reason AD enjoys killing them, is because they drop the best loot for their difficulty. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pyrosprial007>Pyrosprial007</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.nerdrevenge.com/images/wow.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kick Me</span><br>  Posts: 1028<br> <font color=#333333>(6/20/03 6:59 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.nerdrevenge.com/images/wow.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My thoughts</span><hr size=1> why are you all trying to take the lootz out of bozzt's hands?

bollix says &quot;hey, big guys, can you leave our mobs alone, please?&quot;<br>
adell says &quot;no. sorry small guys&quot;.<br>
<br>
seriously though, i would simply endorse everything that mearis already said.<br>
the 'easy kill fat mobs' are i suppose KT and cursed cycle.  i suppose all i can really do is to repeat the request in respect of those mobs.  Of course, i could try to shame you into it, by asking what a guild that just killed xegony could possibly hope to gain by slumming it in Kael <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Bollix Braker <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Warlord <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Officer <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Celestial Empire <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--> <br>

<br>
Now I know my guild is barely getting a chance to even be in this rotation of mobs and what Im about to say might completly screw it up, some people might say I should bite my tongue and not even dare say it, but after what some guilds in that rotation did I honestly am not too thrilled of being forced to join it.<br>
<br>
Ok well I should get to the point, basically the rotation's rules for guilds not in it is, you get no chance at all to even attempt a mob or its considered an act of war against all 4 or 5 of thoes guilds.<br>
<br>
Yes, they may not say that to AD, MiM or Wudan when they take the mobs, just bow down and say go ahead, but when smaller guilds then them want to even attempt, lets say cazic thulle, and they spend hours clearing fear, then someone from the rotation finds out and says, 'that mob is rotated, you cant kill it.' <br>
<br>
Cant kill a mob because its being rotated? I know it sounds like some kind of joke but that is seriously what they say, I think its kind of funny that they push the smaller guilds around then when someone like AD comes and starts to take a few of their rotated mobs they go and ask to please stop? <br>
<br>
Now Im not trying to start any flames or wars or anything, just simply stating the facts that they are fast to say war if you attempt that mob to guilds like the one Im in.<br>
<br>
Yes I could have said nothing bit my tongue and hoped for the best when our 'try out' to get into the rotation comes, but I wanted to let people know what they are like.<br>
<br>
Just think its complete bs that they have those 5guilds telling people to back down from mobs and not even try them or you go to war. Nobody wants to war 5guilds, and its bs that they think they dont have to camp and move on mobs like the rest of the guilds on the server. They think just because its rotated they dont have to move, well obviously not or they threaten war........<br>
<br>
Well I want to apologize to AD for one posting this on their board, but I thought it was funny for them to come asking you to stop when they are basically pushing everyone else around.<br>
<br>
hehe I forgot to add that they claim this is the way AD , MiM and Wudan rotate mobs, which I know isnt how any rational people would conduct themselves, little regard for anyone else on the server like these guilds do<br>

Let the drama begin<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Well I agree with Andarvi. Its mere bull shit that you guys threaten the lower end guilds with war of all 5 guilds in rotation if they attempt any mobs on the list. Than you ask guilds like AD to plz stop? I been on both sides of the game where u guys stood there and let a higher end guild take one of your mobs right from under you while you stood there and watched , and I have also been there where you guys were all over one of the lower end guilds with threat of war from all 5 guilds. How are you guys any better?I say if you want to war one guild not on the rotation than you better be prepared to war all of them. You want to enforce this rotation, than be prepared to back your shit up no matter what guild it is.<br>

<br>
Do you think Wudan, AD, MiM have FFA on Fire nameds?  or PoE rings?  An FFA enviroment if anything squashes lower level guilds, because the bigger guilds in the tier never get a shot at mobs because they are instantly killed on spawn.<br>
<br>
The only issue we are having right now, is that a few AD occasionally go after mobs that are rotated after their main event, and even though it happens very rarely I explained above why its highly disruptive.  Also, I'd like to add that outside of certain experiences with Tetzou in DN, who several guildmates of his also witnessed, I have never had the experience of AD members coming and taking a mob away from a group of people ready to kill it, they merely raid at a different time than us, and sometimes with the way spawns work out, the mob doesn't spawn until its their raid.  <br>
<br>
The reason why I am willing to go to extreme lengths to talk and discuss this, is because I have a great experience talking with AD officers and working things out, unfortunately even though very very few AD officers actually partake in those killings, understandly they don't want to limit their members actions, but I am hoping to find a common ground.  <br>
<br>
My experiences dealing with CN officers were all headache inducing, typically including 5 CN members showing up at a mob with nobody else in the guild online, and claming the mob was camped and they were gathering people, while SoD had the force ready to engage the mob there and now, of course we always backed down, but you realize that if things were to be truly FFA, I'd pull the mob right through your group 'camping'?]<br>
<br>
If you hate SoD so much, isn't it entirely hipocritcal to accept not one, but two CoH's to loot both a Primal Warsword AND a Primal two Handedsword, when your own guild has never even been to ST?<br>
<br>
As soon as CN requested it, they were given access to the rotation board and their own turn at Cazic Thule, same as every other guild who requested it, how is this 'unfair' treatment?<br>
<br>
Anyways, this is getting horribly off topic.  If you want to discuss your issues with the current rotation, we have a rotation board set up for this, and your leader has access.<br>
<br>
This thread was started merely to see if the people who do late night raids in ascending dawn, would be willing to target other mobs who aren't rotated, and or wait until they became FFA, the way Wudan and MiM do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malio1>Malio1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mr. Hotkey</span><br>  Posts: 1842<br> <font color=#333333>(6/23/03 12:06 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://w3.one.net/~malhavok/malio.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My MQ</span><hr size=1> <br>
Rotations ensure everyone gets their fair shot at a mob once it spawns.  It helps the lower level/less member guilds because if there was a FFA, the lower guilds would never get a shot at these mobs.<br>
<br>
The problem here is different &quot;levels&quot; of rotation, not the actual rotation system in general.  Guilds have a calendar or rotation on almost every EQ server, it's not perfect, but it's the best system overall.<br>
<br>
Once you've seen both sides of the issue, FFA and rotation within your tier, I think you'll agree it's the fairest option. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bellatoress>Bellatoress</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(6/23/03 2:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My MQ</span><hr size=1> Hello ,<br>
<br>
I was once a CN member and it took forever for us to finally get a crack at Zlandicar and Rumblecrush. Mostly because CE, CoTW, and Es, Reverant, finally found better bigger mobs to kill. But the dream didn't last forever. We still occasionally find ourselves fighting those people for the spawns. I'm sure most of the guilds above feel the same way about Tormax and Cazic, but occasionally they find their selves fighting for the spawns from the higher end guilds. So where do we go from here? I think Adell said it best. &quot; I hope that as part of your rotation you will allow whatever guilds mob we 'steal' that day to have another legit shot the next pop.&quot; My point was in no way intended towards SOD or any other guild. I'm sorry if you took that personal Mearis and yes I thank you for letting me loot my first primal. I'd just like to add if ever I make it  to ST and we got primal rotting. I will be more than happy to allow any respectable anti loot the rott.the only point I'm trying to get across is if CN or Neco or whoever thinks they might have a shot at Tormax and their willing to try their dam best. Why not let them have their shot? It's not like they kill it everyday. Than if it becomes a problem cause they owning left and right. it's time to join the rotation eh?<br>

Especially on RZ rotation in general works well, since the PvP aspect most often keeps the excess greed in check, unlike blue servers where stealing a spawn just results in a sulking and cussing flamefest. Let me paint you a picture.<br>
<br>
Imagine people queuing outside the shop for the latest Harry Potter novel (woot). What you would like to do, is walk nonchalantly past the queue into the shop and get your copy before the people who have been there for hours. Therefore it's no wonder that someone grabs you from the scruff of your neck and tells you to get to the back of the line just like everyone else. Likewise, it's hardly surprising that when a leather-clad (except for his &quot;&lt;3 Harry&quot;- t-shirt), 120kg thug comes along with a &quot;wha'cha gonna do 'bout it&quot;- look on his face and his biker friends cheering him on, about the only option for the crowd is to swallow it and keep their teeth intact.<br>
<br>
You see, just as long as everyone has equal or at least reasonable chance to get in the queue (if you don't have enough money you have no place in the queue), everyone gets their copy sooner or later, in good order and fairly.<br>

<br>
you're telling me that every one of those guilds used to say nobody is allowed to try mobs when they gather for mobs before the poeple rotating do? what they say and do is, nobody at all is allowed to even touch the mobs being rotated or else you risk war. and the only way you get to even try the mobs is to be on the rotation, how is that fair to everyone on the server? I dont know what you think but telling people they are not allowed to touch mobs because those 5guilds rotate it isnt fair. <br>
<br>
Ok, my question is if a guild came out and were all flagged for the mobs ad wudan magus rotate, would they say you cant touch that mob because we rotate it? or would they say you got to it first go ahead and try it?<br>
<br>
Because the rotation doesnt give anyone that chance, they compltly say get out its ours or you war, they give nobody else the chance, I mean isnt the point of rotation to know when you got the mob so you can be there when it spawns? and if somehow another guild gets there before you do do you say get out we had it rotated? no, the only fair thing to do is let the people that actually got there first try the mob at least <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=279.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=279.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=279.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=279.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=279.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=279.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=279.topic&start=141&stop=148>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showPrevMessage?topicID=279.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showNextMessage?topicID=279.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.threadControl?topicID=279.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=279.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=279.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Gimp's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25>Gimp's Gallery</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246e<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
