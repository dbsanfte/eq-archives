I came back hoping to enjoy the game but cannot, i enjoy playing with my guildmates and shootin the shit, killing people and inflicting pain and suffering to my enemies. However when it comes down fact to fact, 90% of the people on rallos zek are straight up pussy. The meaning of this is Rallos Zek was designed for pvp enviroment by adding 1 loot + coin per kill, this was the 'risk' added for the pvp enviroment, but naturaly anyone can get around this 'risk' by bagging gear and going full nodrop.<br>
<br>
I can no longer enjoy this game when not even my enemies play the server as it was intented, they say we cheat, we say they are cheap. The fact that in our situation we have a lose - lose enviroment because we have nothing to gain the truth behind the fact is our enemies only seem to think they are cool and 'elite' by gaining loot off us, whereas we play for the enjoyment of our kill:death ratio, and as well always the victem.<br>
<br>
How can i enjoy a game when neither sides pvp for the same reason. Myself i enjoy the ability to inflict pain and suffering ruining what they try to create, i wouldnt have to gotten to these levels if these fucks would just play with the risk that was intended for this game. This game just seems to grow a hate off me, i feel like the character in all those non-online roleplaying games where the arch-nemisis is the one who seeks to destroy everyone and himself because of his hate towards what he believes in, myself i have tryed to overcome this but still cannot, spychat was one of my greatest come backs against the enemy at the time, however endangering alot of friendships of true moral friends on the other side who i still consider close.<br>
<br>
I have always tryed to control emotions before it controls me but it is very difficult when the only thought in your head is to kill, inflict pain and hatred. I love no one not myself nor my family people can say thats bullshit and really fucked up but i cannot cope with life with my current emotions, would infact rather put a bullet in my head but cannot bring myself to the fact that there is no life beyond this one, religious and philisophical beliefs cannot prove anything beyond this point in time, everyone in life is unique beyond standard in the universe and dimension we exist in. My decision of this has been motivated by what i would rather want, not how i would want fate to decide.<br>
<br>
in end if this is the type of game you would rather play to encourage the fear factor, hate factor and suffering, by all means continue. However i have seen other games other things to do that do not resort to these high levels of thinking. There are plenty of upcoming games which i doubt will even spawn the hatred that has been growing off me thanks to everquest, which i will look forward to playing but myself can/will not continue because in mental health i am dieing inside.<br>
<br>
in all i can only look to one person who can define what i am trying to explain.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
PvP in general. The majority of players on Rallos belong on a Blue server. That's all there is to it. They are not cut out for PvP and they are not prepared to lose anything. We always wore good eq, and I would say at least 90 percent of the time we had better stuff on than the people we fought. This includes so-called PK guilds such as IE and The Begotten which are, for all intents and purposes, nothing but a gang of bitches too cowardly to do anything on their own that group up in big numbers for warmth much like a rl gang. They do stand and fight more than most people, but they are almost always naked and invariably there has to be half an hour of chat or tells after every encounter.<br>
<br>
This isn't a pro-sport. There isn't anything separating the top, say, 50 pvpers. We are one of the best two man teams to hit this game and that's hands down a fact, but I'm not going to tell you, like Rigamortiz wants people to believe, that Everquest is such a complex game with so many subtleties and nuances that there can ever be a &quot;#1 PvPr.&quot; There are also a lot of others that are good at winning fights but there's a difference between winning and looting. We made the trade-off for being able to have protracted fights to actually be able to get some loot now and then, but we still took on clerics and shaman and necros and rangers, cause we never backed down from anyone. And that's a fact.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, we pk'd for fun, we did it on the PvP server, we did it without abusing any bugs, we did it for no profit, Ebay or otherwise, and lastly, we did it with composure. Luckily, that ship has sailed and our time has come and gone. I hope a few of you had fun like I did. For those of you that did, I'll see you on Shadowbane. For those of you that did not, enjoy the trip to 60...and 70...and 80...and to infinity and beyond. Godspeed. <br>

<br>
and there you have it, my #1 rolemodel of pvp, quiet silent and always feared. But like i said Rallos brought out the hatred which went against what i wanted to believe in, my retirement is simple, there is no end to this game, there is one to life, never to be encouraged by this game.<br>

<br>
Why do these so called SUPER MEN of RZ resort to such bs just to score the ever important killshot? <br>
<br>
Rienne the self proclaimed god of PVP...gone from RZ to icetrainer...JInx, the all around GOOD GUY of the bad guys, resorts to betraying his friends on the other side just for an upper hand in a petty war on a video game...<br>
<br>
You gaming gods....LAUGH...When you gonna realize that its more fun to actually hold some decency or honor into a game? I have respect for some of the FU crew but lately you show none with the down-right lame attempts of tryin to &quot;get the upper hand&quot;... How far do you guys take this game and its war?<br>
<br>
The silly part is, most of FU claims they dont care bout loot... when i see 95% of them get the best items and barge into raids of PB's where they arent even invited in the first place. <br>
<br>
As a person from the other side, i feel we have done a pretty damn good job fighting you and your allies. So much you have resorted to screwing over friends and using trainers... Whats that really show as to who are the real &quot;tops of the food chain&quot;? <br>
<br>
Never in my life have i seen such jealousy... Yes jealousy... Jealous of what we in AD have created. Your not welcome in, so you seek to destroy... Just remember you helped make us just as we have you. And your crew is now setting new standards for the life on RZ... I hope you understand what im saying...<br>
<br>
All in all.. Jinx. I dont understand why this game is so important to you that you betray your friends in it just so you can get a few more killshots on your enemy. Is it worth alienating friends for what could have been very long standing and beyond this game? <br>
<br>
Its sad to see the feared of RZ stoop so low, and then blame it on their victims as to why... The standards of RZ has just gotten decreased once more after these past few days.<br>

What I have seen as well from you guys are not stooping down? What about the time in POM I was at my bind spot and I got attacked non stop, i was told to loot and leave, well lets be honest here, I go loot what will happen?  And btw I was being killed by my so called 'friends' who I betrayed too right? When me and Gigirl were the only active 60 clerics at events Ageoing everyone who asked.  If you want to go head to head on each issue I can easily do so.  But what the main problem is Rift is pissed off at this shit for brains Video game, and its more than just what he said, how the hell can we fight you with GM interference? Last night in DN a guide summoned everyone's corpse in Synergy to the zone in/out.  I am debating of quitting too after this knowing that no matter what happens a GM/Guide will always bail your asses out.<br>
<br>
NOONE in FU betrayed you friendship because like it or not the people in FU wanted change, you guys wanted to stick with the system you got now, loot over anything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ubiguss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Biguss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 298<br> <font color=#333333>(10/22/01 10:44:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: i forgot another ilsen paragraph i wanted to add.</span><hr size=1> Pizz<br>

I hope this a lesson to some few out there that some poeple take this game way too seriously so much that they dick over their old friends...<br>
<br>
Its a shame, you know it, jinx knows as does everyone else... You wanna quit cuz your side likes to grief for fun and the gms are forced to intervene thats your call. At least when we fucking PVP you outta a zone, we then attempt the mob, not dick around and waste everyone's time in attempts for grief.<br>
<br>
No disrespect to most of the other KOS that come to our board, but Pizz, your highly misinformed.... To even come here defending, thats its ok to take advantage of your friends in this game with a 3rd party proggy is sad...  <br>

Go defend something that you can morally defend... Any way this is spun, you cant deny the facts that dicking over friends is RIGHT...<br>

no one likes to see their enemies prosper... but never before have tactics on BOTH sides gone this low, and gotten this far out of hand. Well they have - but it didnt involve so many people before.<br>
<br>
pizdar.. heh. many of the FU are closer friends to people in AD/Syn than they will ever be to people in PB. Dont be naieve enough to assume that they are there because you are &quot;best buddies&quot; - you server a purpose, they can play with you to cause grief to their enemies and further accomplish their agenda.. much the same as with AD + Syn... many of these people woudlnt call themselves friends - but accomplises. Tho I would agree some long lasting friendships have formed from this. <br>
<br>
Months down the track (in the typical Rallos Zek style), no doubt you may be fighting us again, allied with AD, kosing BoK... who knows. Fact is a lot of bridges have been burned in this war - things change quickly on rallos zek - and those that have caused the most grief will find themselves with no where to go. <p>Neckros Dundee

<br>
I wont pretend to know you in real life nor even be your friend.  I do however know you as an enemy.  For whatever reasons we have always ended up on the opposite sides of things and that is as it may be.  I have always known you to be mostly an honorable fighter.  I have also known you to spin a bit but then i think everyone in EQ has done that at some point or another.  What i want to say is that i understand where you are coming from wholeheartedly.<br>
<br>
I can say im also a part of the problem.  At times i want to pvp like no tomorrow and at others i dont.  My no drop gear owns pretty much any droppable shit out there.  So people get pissed when they kill me and i have full no drop.  I rarely loot anyone when/if i kill them if i respect that person.  However, i dont pvp for loot, i pvp for the fun of the battle and the sheer intent of putting my skills as a ranger (LOL) against whatever class im fighting.  Most days i consider myself pretty decent.   Just ask how Rui and Ehunogor how long it took them to kill me other day during that huge fight in EW.  Unfortunately it got out of hand, my wife bitching at me to log off and i get corpsed every time i get near my body and i HATE not having my gear before i log off, its like im paranoid im going to lose all my shit somehow.<br>
<br>
Also i dont believe that EQ is really meant to be played pvp style.  We make do with what we have however and deal with that.  Its a broke ass machine and causes grief more than anything else.<br>
<br>
Anyway, im getting off the subject.  What I basically wanted to say was simply this.  I personally, though i didnt know you as a friend, will miss your presence on EQ.  Because i respected you for you as a player.  I know that may seem sappy and shit but i also highly respected Ilsen.  He didnt talk shit and always seemed to just play the game to have fun and thats all that counts.  Most of us including myself have lost that fun factor.<br>
<br>
Anyway, though you may never read this if you leave then good luck to you and yours, if you return then i shall see you on the battlefield.<br>

<br>
sorry everquest in the high end game takes alot time .. if your guildmates and you run to zlandicar to pk a cleric that is doing corpse recovery i dont see any point that you are intersted in a fair good and for both sides intersting game expriences .. its more like that YOUR guild + your allies are GRIEFING our game play in order to ruin our days .. everyone feels sad and unhappy when they cant access their corpse and get even attacked while moving to his corpse<br>
<br>
on vallon we had a straight agreement of LnS . Loot and Scoot means after you died or most of your Guild died in PvP you are forces to leave the Zone for atleast ONE hour ..<br>
<br>
Jinxat you talking about good PvP on Rallos .. sure there is good pvp but if you support killing ppl moving straight to their corpse , killing CR teams in order to ruin the game for most of a Guild waiting for their corpse .. sorry i just feel sad then for you cuz nothing more then a griefplaying Fag that got nothing more to do then ruin the fun for others.<br>
<br>
oh and you can call me newbie but i think i pvp in alot more games and since much more time then you .. so i think i know what i am talking about griefplaying . game exprience for everyone and so on<br>

Why play the innocent? Nobody in this war is the &quot;bad guy&quot; we're on one side of the fence, you're on the other. Both sides do the same exact things you and many people might percieve as lame. I very much remember Lohengrin, Reefman, and that 60 transfered ENC coming down to Zlandicar after Rebirth failed it and promptly killing the cleric that was ressed by Jinxat's res stick, which gave them control of the zone.<br>
<br>
So I heard Rebirth did that to you, and Ozuri stepped in and took the zone down, and you're crying about it? How is it any different? It's not.<br>
<br>
You guys were allowed free passage from SG zone to TOV (via COH) first thing WarhoundT did was talk shit in ooc, I'm sure that didn't help the cause at all - later on that action was repaid by Synergy/AD attacking us in TOV. So... FU took it upon themselves to ruin not 1, but 2 of your ST events. <br>
<br>
We let people &quot;Loot n Scoot&quot; all the time, you know for what tho? To have them attacking us shortly after, as if we're not outnumbered enough - need to gain some sort of respect to be allowed to loot your corpse untouched. Getting dropped like Cascia does in Kael (bound there) allowing her to loot her corpse, only to have her attack you as soon as she loots her weapon and armor defintely isn't one of them. A lot of AD fit Ilsen's description, some don't. Nothing wrong with how you choose to play the game I suppose, but you're kinda doing it on the wrong server :~).<br>

Things change on RZ all the time, but given the last few weeks and the fact not even &quot;event peace&quot; terms could be agreed upon regardless of Lyndro requesting it makes that doubtful anytime soon. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uzyrino.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zyrino</A> at: 10/23/01 5:00:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umalio1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malio1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#333333>(10/23/01 4:59:32 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://w3.one.net/~malhavok/malio.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: For those that care, and for those that dont</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;&gt;I can no longer enjoy this game when not even my enemies play the server as it was intented, &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>

Yea, that's the way EQ was intended to be played.  Your &quot;philosophy&quot; you think you have is just bullshit.  Sorry, I can't respect anyone like that.<br>
<br>
At least now you and Rienne can go jerk off in Quake 3 together screaming &quot;I'm a gaming legend!&quot; with all your 3rd party proggys running in the background, thinking that's the way to play to win.<br>

<br>
Every IE I know wears gear in pvp.  No, I don't go inspecting them to check up, but when one of us drops, the next thing in guildchat is, &quot;damnit, there goes my diamond ring.. or my hp ring.. or my frog crown.. or my bd earring/bracer.. etc etc.&quot;  We are the most poorly geared pvp guild on the server in my opinion in the high end game.  Most of us are still in hate/fear armor with a few pog/thurg pieces.  We wear the gear we have, and when we die, we lose it.<br>
<br>
I currently am down to two jagged bands and a non-resist cloak because I lose my gear more often than I replace it.<br>
<br>
I don't have golem wands.  <br>
I don't have egg-pumice.<br>
I don't have rad clicky items.<br>
I don't have gate potions.<br>
I don't run from ANYONE solo unless it is clear that I am beaten.<br>
...<br>
I am a lvl 56 fighting  60s.<br>
I take full dmg 90% of the time with FR over 100.<br>
I wear the little gear I have.<br>
I die.  <br>
And I'm not afraid to die.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm in this for the fight and the friendships, just as you said you were.  I think you have IE all wrong in this.  I still can't think of anyone in my guild that doesn't fight straight up, though I can't be watching them at all times.<br>
<br>
And as for gear..<br>
<br>
Moffon, Isildr, Teren, Kestral, Tremor, Myself, Drosenj, etc..<br>
<br>
I hear of them needing replacements every time they die.  They wear gear.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, I personally don't come to the boards to yell cheater.  Even if you are, I can't do anything about it, so I deal with it.  I know when people are using Show EQ.  It's rather obvious sometimes.  Yet, I can't do anything about it so I deal with it - plain and simple.  Please don't generalize my guild as a bunch of whiners because we're not.<br>
<br>
Good luck in life.<br>

&quot;I very much remember Lohengrin, Reefman, and that 60 transfered ENC coming down to Zlandicar after Rebirth failed it and promptly killing the cleric that was ressed by Jinxat's res stick, which gave them control of the zone.&quot;<br>
<br>
You should have your memory then checked as killing a freshed rezed cleric (cykubis) merits gm involvement more than killing a cleric who logs on (not was fresh rezed from jinxat rez stick).  Also, you were allowed to recover your corpses and in some cases you're people were rezed for you.<br>
<br>
However, both were with the intention of ruining the others event, aka griefing.<br>

What gets on my nerves are the 3rd party hackers.  I always had a lot of respect for FU in general as a pvp machine and felt they were a force to be reckoned with.  Why then, do you need to hack the game to win?  By doing this you have taken an element out of the game.  There are no suprises left for you.  ShowEQ allows for one to see whomever is coming and hacking into enemy guildchat informs you of all movement.  I won't even get into the trainer hacks that were so popular untill a certain rogue got banned.  Its like those guys who would finish Quake by using God mode and bragging about it.  I honestly think that FU are arguably the best pvp'ers on the server but not feared for that anymore.  They are now feared because they are known, self admitted, hackers who will stop at nothing to win.  I know that many of you are tired of being called cheaters and/or hackers but, lets face it, you've been caught and/or admitted to it too many times for it to be ignored.  To those of you who are innocent of this, my humblest apologies.<br>

excuse that post that said IE, it was not intended towards IE at all, i copy pasted ilsen's post from his last msg from badmartigan.50megs.com, his post actualy said TR and The Begotten, however TR does not exist i gave myself a half second to think of another guild who gave themselves the pride of having a good pvp rep so i changed TR to IE, the rest of the post was not targeted to your guild at all, i just changed one of the guildnames as i was speeding through my post at the time, yes IE wears gear and pvps etc. my apologies on using ur guildname w/out proofreading the terms.<br>
<br>
about Spychat, it is not a 3rd party program, why does everyone insist because it is a 'program' it is considered cheating or a hack, myself i did not want to retype your AD guildchat into my guildchat to keep ourselves updated, so i wrote a program to do it for me, there was no involvment with datastream nor effecting EQ in any terms, for everyone who continues to accuse us of using SEQ or any other hacks i find it continualy botheresom, i have been guilded with these people for nearly 7 months now and all of them always encourage against any type of hacks/cheats for it would demoralize our reputation, we may find you guys throughout zones, but either its common sense &quot;ok their at velk zone, or they might be xping or factioning off these guards, lets check there&quot; , or druid tracking (which doesnt work well in velius but we can find out where u were just last by the tracking bugged. Just because we can spot or find, its because we search throughout possibilities, those that hide and cannot be found, well they go to places that arent so oblique and obvious, more power to ya!<br>
<br>
and this spychat creation did not last long infact it only lasted 3 days maximum, those that accuse us of overall cheating throughout our entire EQ career or using spys are  ones who were effected by the war so much who need an excuse for loss(or win, or they just h8 us). It was very obvious when we were able to see your guildchat as Wailem would tell the guild, WE HAVE A SPY, (duh!), then other half of the guild &quot;They use showeq&quot;, no sorry.<br>
<br>
also my apologies for the post i was still rather fuel'd by posting reasons that most people should quit EQ instead of rather myself, the very few people who really know why im resigning would understand on a higher level, and i thank you for understanding my concept at hand.<br>
