I have played EverQuest since approx. April of 1999.  i am a lvl 60 half elf paladin, i meet all of ADs requirements and am still working to better myself in some of the ways i feel i could more adequetly meet said requirements. i currently have 4 AA points and i am working hard to get more.  Please do not confuse me with Ullrich, a wood elf bard.  <br>
<br>
i greatly enjoy the high end of EQ, and have many friends in AD.  i also highly enjoy pvp and if bored spend much of my time in the arena in the bazaar <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
many of you know i was a long time member of Ordo Malleus which i recently left.  Some are worried about my status as a player because of this matter.  I would like it to be known that i am not after loot.  i feel that i earned my loot.  the reason i left OM was after an incident which angered me greatly.  i do not appreciate it when people confide in each other then, attack them with said real life issues (while possibly not known) blaming them for mishaps through the day.  <br>
<br>
if anyone has any issues that i am unaware of i would greatly appreciate it if you would take them up with me in game or you can email me at jsoiski@bellsouth.net<br>
<br>
i would not mind being a recruit of AD in a probation status if need be, to prove myself worthy. <p><img src="http://fhase.net/~midway/ulrichesig.jpg"><br><a  href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=43848">Magelo Profile</a>

Don't lie and say you aren't in it for the loot, that is all you're in it for. I guess you just got what you wanted from OM and moved on huh.. And don't lie that this arguement was why you left, I remember a certain someone telling me &quot;Ulriche was talking to me about how he wanted to join a different guild&quot; 3days prior to when you left over this &quot;arguement&quot;<br>

Convenient, ass. Go apply to more legends guilds. <br>

His loyalties are.. well, non existant. He left OM several times, was let back in because we sorta pittied him. He loved to preach and everything, say how he would never leave again (each time) but then do it again.. He had rejoined OM for the like 6th time, got lance + BP within that week because we (wrongly) trusted him, and he shat in our faces..<br>
<br>
He is a hypocrit, and I really dislike him. He will seem loyal for a little bit, then he'll deguild in a hissy fit and beg to rejoin.. Maybe it was our fault for letting him back in all those times /shrug, but IMO he will always be trash. <p>Sirdario of Rallos Zek<BR>

Most active and most senior OM paladin was/is Kendrel. Second in seniority and activeness until recently was Darkcutter. Ulriche was lowest level and the least active Paladin in OM. In addition he has quit OM about 5-6 times that I could remember. Reasons for quitting were anywhere from &quot;I was depressed&quot; to &quot;I am pissed at someone&quot;.<br>
<br>
The incident he is talking about (being upset at someone) happened after he informed an officer of guild about his desire to leave guild, so its hardly a reason. More like an excuse.<br>
<br>
Ulriche has been awarded droppable loot during his OM membership various pieces of which (sup Trak bp) he lost. Over time when he bothered to attempt HoT raids he accumulated about full ToV set minus bp.<br>
<br>
Prior to his deguilding he borrowed money from guildbank to buy spell. Was awarded SS bp and Telkorenar's lance within few days. After that he told officer that he doesn't see himself part of OM anymore, used first convenient excuse to throw a tantrum and left.<br>
<br>
As for hipocrisy. Ulriche is person who continually accused OM members of disloyalty and shamed us about not being loyal to OM. He posted posts on private board that would say &quot;I am OM to the last day I breathe and there is nothing that would make me leave my brothers and sisters&quot;. After I think 4th time he deguilded from OM those posts and speeches got really old. Last time he was reinvited into guild with a strict warning &quot;this IS the LAST time you are allowed in&quot; and it WAS the last time.<br>
<br>
One last time so my ramblings dont distract you. Ulriche's gear if subpar is only subpar because he for very long time was lowest and least active paladin in OM who repeatedly quit guild without good reason and was reinvited because he tearfully asked to forgive him. The good pieces that he does have he recieved shorty after dinging 60 and subsequent deguilding. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uulriche.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulriche</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#333333>(7/11/02 8:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=230.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://fhase.net/~midway/ulrichephoto.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clarifications.</span><hr size=1> i felt it best not to reply to this thread and let it go where it went, but i would like to address some things where i felt wrongly accused.<br>
<br>
1) that money you say i allegedly borrowed from guild bank.  yes, i know i posted on the board about it.  but i never got any money from the guild.  i borrowed money from a RL friend and bought the spell in question when i saw the person selling it online. i think talthan can vouch for me that i never got money from OM's bank.  i borrowed 2k from a real life friend to buy brells mountainous barrier<br>
<br>
2) as of late i would say i was the most active paladin in OM in my opinion.  log on at 7AM log off at 2AM every day.  if i did my math right thats 19hours of EQ per day.  prior to the summer i had school and a very hard schedule, i had work and other things that take major precidence over a game. so before the summer your right i wasnt the most active paladin. <br>
<br>
3) I left 4 times MAX. i dont know how this is exagerated to 6 -8 times on every thread flaming me.  yes, i sometimes get depressed, ive learned over time that when im depressed its best i stay out of EQ, and go play counter strike or AOE2 and do something i know i can win at.  i think it is best that i do aknowledge that i left, because hey i did. i left OM for reasons at the time i felt legitimate. and ive LEARNED from these mistakes.  i cannot change what ive done, but i can learn from my mistakes and better myself with what ive learned.<br>
<br>
4) this &quot;desire to leave guild&quot; incident you talk about, if i recall correctly was about 2 - 3 hours before Hamurr logged on, in which case i talked to him about it.  <br>
<br>
5) i NEVER accused anyone of being disloyal or shameful to the guild that im aware of and if i did i apologize.<br>
<br>
6) loot, i hate this subject after this whole ordeal, i call it an ordeal because well it pretty much is one after the crap ive been put through by people.  yes i lost a deepwater BP, i was wearing it in VL while exping with a guild mate and got hit with a nuke and died. accidents happen.  like i said in my application post, i did NOT leave over loot.  i know many people could agree with me that i waited a VERY long time to join OM.  im not going to bring anyone elses name into this post because i feel its right to leave them out of it if they want to stay out of it.  i had wanted to join OM since i was lvl 9.  and eventually i got in... i would hardly call that lack of loyalty. while i did join other guilds through that time none lasted very long.  as for the lance and the bp, yes i got them.  wether or not it was within a week or not i dont recall.  but it seemed more like a month to me. take it as you will.<br>
<br>
7) the incident I am talking about is when you attacked someone in open forum (guild chat) and used stuff in their RL as fuel to the fire and then you denied it.  so yes you could say i was upset at someone... that someone was you.<br>
<br>
i probably dont look at some things the way i should, which is my fault.  i dont look at some things the way everyone else does. and it gets me into situations like this.  i dont wish to cause trouble nor do i wish to make people angry.  i only want to play this game doing what i love most. raiding.  <br>
<br>
for all of you that i have angered in some way or another, im sorry. take that as you will, but i mean it. i had hoped this wouldnt come down on this board but i guess i was wishing to much, but then again i guess it had to.  <br>
<br>
i hope ive clarified some things, and i hope you believe me.  i know what the incident looks like, but i also know the truth is much different.   <p><img src="http://fhase.net/~midway/ulrichesig.jpg"><br><a  href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=43848">Magelo Profile</a>

Ulriche joined OM back in what?  October 2001?  He's been in the guild a long time and earned what loot he got.  If he was in it for the loot, he would have stayed OM because you guys are doing the high end stuff now.  Not to mention the fact that he stuck with the guild when that wasn't the case - why would he quit now when you actually WERE doing it and he had a shot at much better stuff than a crummy lance or tov bp?  Seriously think about it a second - he stays and he goes primal.  He left because people in OM were being nasty to Darkleetah about her availability on raids and got into her rl dissing her because she has kids to take care of.  That's not cool and I applaud Ulriche for sticking up for her by leaving the guild.  Have you forgotten that you quit OM several times because you wanted to make a point about the bullshit that goes on sometimes in the guild?  I know you have left OM MORE than once over bs.  Do I knock you for it?  Hell no - sometimes the only leverage you have in changing things is leaving the guild when you disagree about something.  If anything, Ulriche did something noble by sticking up for his friends and leaving when they did.  Please don't say Ulriche isn't loyal - that is utter bullshit.  Him and I were pretty good friends in OM.  When I left for DoZ, he got all over me about it.  When DoZ warred OM, he no longer spoke to me - putting his guild loyalties over his game friendships.  The guy is a loyal bulldog just like you - it boggles me why you are posting this nonsense about him bro. <p><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~nmenasch/kyle.gif">
