Fact iraq is a hotbead for violent anti american sentiment.  And I know not alot of people think this is true, but.. Fact iraq does indead pose a threat to not only american interests but the saftey of americans abroad and here in our country.  I am not so bold as to even insinuate that every iraqi is bad.  But the regime that has it's boot on the necks of the iraqi people IS.  Need proof?  Ok how about the members of the iraqi national soccer team that were tortured and killed because they performed badly in a soccer tournament(good thing cinci bengals dont play in iraq).  Not enough?  How about the THOUSANDS of kurds that were gassed in mass, at the order of the regime.  Still not satisfied?  How about them not thinking that they apply to the rules of the geneva convention.  Example?  Well in the first gulf war, american and british soldiers were tortured.  Yes that's right tortured.  Not to mention the american pows that were EXECUTED at the hands of faithful iraqi soldiers in this war. If you dont think that this is true, then id like someone to attest to the remarkable marksmenship of the iraqi soldiers to neatly shoot holes in the foreheads of the american soldiers.  The fact is people that saddam and his regime are not only ruthless dictators, but they are insane.  You do not make the decisions that they have made in the span of 25 years and be all right in the head.  The basic reality of the situation now is the coalition is there.  We are there to arrest criminals for crimes on humanity, and they will die or stand trial.  For people who are being complete fucking idiots, and violentally protesting peace(ironic huh?) just get off of it.  If your country has troops there, the thing to do is support them.  And if you dont, I challenge one person to look the family of a service member that has died in the eye and not feel like a pathetic  piece of shit.  I myself am a former us marine.  Guess what?  I knew one of the marines that were killed in the early fighting.  Not only did I know him but I worked with him for a month straight and had some good times with him(drinking WAAY to much after work and the like).  Protesting the war is fine.  It's what our militarys do so that we can have that freedom.  Do you think the iraqi people have that same freedom?  The answer is no.  They would be most likely brutally dealt with at the slightest provocation.  God let the innocent iraqi people be kept from danger.  God let them prosper in a FREE iraq.  And finally God protect our enourmously Brave service members who without question do their duty to protect our freedom.  <br>

<br>
Iraq doesnt apply to the rules of the geneva convention, right. But now get down from ur high horse, because the US permanently violates the geneva convention on Guantanamo Bay (sp?). And they dont stop it, no matter how hard the international protests are.<br>
<br>
Executed soldiers is a bad thing isnt it? I tell u what happened to taliban prisoniers that didnt get shipped to guantanamo bay. 4000 prisoniers were put into containers, with these containers they went to the north alliance, saying that in there are taliban for them. So the NA forces were shooting on these containers until all prisoniers were dead, some were already dead because they had no air to breath for the transport. So again, get down from ur high horse.<br>
<br>
And now to ur comment that made me question who the idiot is: &quot; For people who are being complete fucking idiots, and violentally protesting peace(ironic huh?) just get off of it&quot; <br>
What do u expect peace protest to be in a country which supports a war, where like 80% of the people in it oppose it? not violantly? their voice obviously didnt matter impress their government enough to change its policy. Do u expect the peace protesters to be flowerpower children who sing &quot;cumbaya..&quot;? The majority of those who protest against the war are no freaks, no peacemongers. And of course in those countrys where the government opposes 80% or more of the population the people are very angry and not too shy to show it.<br>
<br>
&quot;If your country has troops there, the thing to do is support them. And if you dont, I challenge one person to look the family of a service member that has died in the eye and not feel like a pathetic piece of shit.&quot; the guy above<br>
<br>
You know, if Id look in that eye, i knew who the piece of shit is. Those who sent that son into war, away from his family, lastly to death. Why would someone who doesnt support this war feel like a &quot;pathetic piece of shit&quot;? I dont get it, if it was after them he'd still be alive. (I know some paranoid afraid chicken now thinks &quot;but then probably a lot more would die in future and not just soldiers&quot;, if ur paranoid like that u punished enough with living like that)<br>
<br>
Finally keep God out of this, it really is geting on my nerves God bless this God bless that, u can keep this &quot;God&quot; show rolling in Juta, Kansas or Texas (or whereever these sunday-morning-church-guys come from) but not international.<br>

<br>
Personally I hope that all involved in this conflict make it through safe and unharmed: our troops, the Iraqi civilians, and the Iraqi troops.<br>

And I'd love to hear alittle less from idiots who have trouble with this relatively simple concept.<br>

Right or not, what America is doing is the correct course of action, they are freeing millions of people from an opressive ruler, and saving thousands of innocent lives in the process.  <br>

I wonder how many Iraqi's die under Saddam Hussein for every hour someone spends protesting the war.  <br>
<br>
What's the reasoning behind it, do the war protestors honestly think Iraq would be better off with him as a dictator?

This gets better and better.  Where are you coming up with 90% from? Please quote me a source other than your sub-conscious.  And &quot;violently?&quot;  I haven't heard of a single instance of violent protest in the US yet.

Not international?  The majority of the world believes in God.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I know allot of people don't really agree with the war(eruos ect), and I know that maybe the us isn't there for ALL the right reasons.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I think if you look carefully, the issue is far larger than the Iraq question alone- it is the concern that the doctrines laid out in government documents and the new US defence doctrine are being applied for the first time.  Moreover the concern that pre-emptive action will become the norm in the 21st century's world order- and that the law of the jungle takes the place of international law.  As for your assertion that &quot;euros&quot; are the main political force opposing war- that's not entirely correct<br>
<br>
Most of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>international community</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is opposed to conflict- and I put it to you that a reason in large part that the US public supports it is down to misconception and easy belief in the words of a politician just because that politican happens to be the President.  That misconception I allude to is that the war on Iraq is associated with a war on terror- something which is to all experts and astute observers an outright lie.  Historians will take comfort in the fact that several wars have been started on the basis of outright lies- but seldom have the goals of such wars been moral.  If the goals are as pure as are purported- then using lies to achieve that &quot;moral&quot; outcome compromises the nature of the justification does it not?  <br>
<br>
Probably the best example of misleading the public is to commit the United States to a United Nations process of inspections.  Then, when troops were close to full deployment, a second resolution authourising force was sought.  When even the simple moral majority to pass a resolution could not be obtained- the UN process was abandoned.  The assertion was made that the US would <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>independently and without a mandate</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> enforce the will of the UN.  Allow me, just to show how farcical an argument this is- to present an analogy.  As a citizen of the UK- suppose I determine on my own, unilaterally, what taxes I did and didn't pay.  The argument being- that in the interests of the government I was enforcing a spending policy on individual terms.  How absurd does that sound?  If you're a citizen of a country and a member-state of the UN and are committed to either one of these- it's absurd and immoral to assume you can follow the rules you like and ditch the ones you don't.  After all, if the second resolution <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>was</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> passed, you'd expect the UN to act it out...given that it was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> passed, ignoring the fact that authorization was rejected is no justifaction to fabricate that authorization, is it VarMax?<br>
<br>
It is extremely important to remind oneself that respect for the office of the head of government cannot overshadow the madness of a pre-emptive policy.  Far from it being unpatriotic to question the motives for war- I argue that if we are not willing to make our voices heard after sending a democracy to war, then what kind of democracy are we?<br>
<br>
Regime change without first empowering the people- democracy imposed rather than achieved, force before an honest attempt at diplomacy- that creates insecurity and chaos, not stability and peace.  The Bush administration has looked for every excuse to deny inspections and trigger a war- its goal not disarmament, but regime change.  I've outlined the reasoning behind this true analysis of goals- and my arguments have stood unchallenged.  Containment is working, deterrence as a backup initiative- that counters any claimed threat.  Add inspections to that cocktail and disarmament by peaceful means is not only possible- it's far more effective than sending thousands of untrained personnel into a warzone to evaluate sites.  Far from an honest attempt being made to explore peaceful alternatives, war was sought from the beginning- the architects of PNAC now have their wish.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I am not so bold as to even insinuate that every iraqi is bad. But the regime that has it's boot on the necks of the iraqi people IS.  Not enough? How about the THOUSANDS of kurds that were gassed in mass, at the order of the regime.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
On the first point- yes the regime is bad- but it's been bad for about 40 years.  Why have we supported this regime for 75% of this time, brutal as it has been?  My point to you in this VarMax is that if the US were in this conflict for moral reasons then your government (along with ours) would not have supported Iraq for 35 brutal years, supplying him with the very gas he used on the Iranians and the Kurds.  Put yourselves in the shoes of an Iranian in the 1980s for a moment- given that the US/UK forced a dictatorship on your country (Shah)- and that they supplied chemical weapons to a brutal dictator who then used them on you- wouldn't you harbour resentment too?  This is how terrorism is born, out of injustice and hate for the architects of that injustice.  Short-sighted policies like supplying chemical weapons to a dictator or triggering a war of aggression under false pretences create terrorists VarMax, and more innocents will die.  That is the price of miscalculating policy in this way.<br>
<br>
The other point I've emphasised again and again is the obvious- the only reason Saddam was emboldened to use chemical weapons in open violation of international law is that the two most powerful countries in the world supported him to the hilt.  In the absence of that support you may be sure that he would <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>never</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have even dreamt of using such weapons, because of deterrence.  My proof for this- expert testimony and the Gulf War, where he didn't even think about chemical weapons because of the nuclear deterrent.  Add to that the modern sanctions regime, other containment measures, inspections- and the Saddam of today calculates in a very different way to the Saddam we supported for so long, even through the grisliest of war crimes against humanity.  If we cared so much about international law and the Geneva convention- then why didn't we bloody well apply it when it mattered- when these warcrimes took place?<br>
<br>
Yes, it's disgraceful and disgusting to see Iraqis parading PoWs around on TV- I was appalled to see it.  But was I any less appalled when I saw how prisoners were dehumanised at Camp X-Ray?  Granted, a neat little legal loophole through the Geneva convention has neatly disposed of the human rights of these <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>suspected</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> terrorists.  But I hardly think anyone disputes that US treatment of these suspects is very much against the spirit of the Geneva Convention.  Likewise, if the Iraqis use the obscure legal definition as a loophole to smudge the definition of &quot;giving humiliation or public insult to PoWs&quot;- then I shall condemn them just as much as I condemned the Bush administration for a flagrant violation of human rights.  I find it despicable that when Camp XRay was established, the Bush administration cared so little for the Geneva Convention's principles and yet seek to apply these when it suits their purposes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Protesting the war is fine. It's what our militaries do so that we can have that freedom. Do you think the iraqi people have that same freedom?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yes, the Iraqi people deserve freedom, they deserved it 40 years ago- and if the war had a proper mandate and international backing, I would be the first to have supported it VarMax, don't have any doubt about that.  I am no pacifist, no &quot;violent demonstrater&quot; and neither were the vast majority of the 2 million people that flooded the streets of London.  On that day of mass protest, less than 10 people were arrested, and no one was charged.  These weren't peaceniks or &quot;hippies&quot; most of them were ordinary men, women and young people.  Everyone from pensioners wounded multiple times in the service of their country from 39-45...to secondary school pupils walking out of classrooms en masse, this wasn't a niche demonstration.  The vast majority of those people would have supported war with a 2nd resolution, a war with international authority behind it.  <br>
<br>
Yes, the Iraqi people deserve to be free, but we have to do it the right way- via an analagous judicial process.  To explain the importance of a system functioning- as much as a serial rapist deserves to be punished severely- individual citizens have no legitimate right to take matters into their own hands.  Vigilante justice is no justice at all, without a court consensus no person can be fairly tried.  Certainly, the outcome of my locking that person up in my cellar for life might well achieve the same <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>result</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as a life-sentence handed down from Her Majesty's courts, but it would not be a legitimate punishment coming from me.  Just as a war fought without UN backing can have no legitimacy.  <br>
<br>
What good is it to us, if in liberating the Iraqi people we betray the very system set up to keep us safe in the first place?  Who will ever believe us again when we claim to seek international legitimacy in future conflicts- people will continually point the finger at this hasty act of aggression, and security will suffer.  Indeed, the entire world order is threatened by this war of aggression.  If I were to weigh immediately freeing the Iraqi people against threatening the entire world order's stability, I must regrettably choose the latter.  The Iraqi people can and should live freely, but we cannot tie a noose for our own neck in achieving that.  We need to act with vision, conscious of the far-reaching consequences of stepping outside the international order.  Our respective governments haven't done it, and we will pay a terrible price for it in years to come.<br>
<br>
The fight against terrorism, the Middle East peace process, the reconstruction of Iraq, the resolution of future conflicts have all been threatened by actions we have taken VarMax.  Without international cohesion, none of these can be realistically be achieved- and the Bush administration aided by us have dealt a severe blow to that cohesion.  After 9/11 the world was united in a show of support against terror, a huge coalition was formed, the like of which had never been seen.  That coalition of 190 countries agreed to liberate Afghanistan and fight terror.  The manner in which, through this war and other belligerent international policies the Bush administration has cast aside that coalition will be one of the saddest tales of history.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And finally God protect our enormously Brave service members who without question do their duty to protect our freedom. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't question that your servicemen and ours have shown enormous courage in this conflict, as they always have done in past ones.  However, I must point out that your freedom or mine does not depend on our forces fighting thousands of miles away from home.  Our freedom is protected by our willingness to daily examine the rights granted to us by government and question vigorously when those rights are denied for whatever reason.  That battle is not fought with guns, but ideas, and requires as much moral courage as to be able to do one's duty in combat.  <br>
<br>
The views existing out there- that we can defend our democracy overseas in an undemocratic way, or deny basic rights to serve security are a myth conjured up by the Bush administration.  The idea that we betray the very principles of democracy on the basis of suspicion (no proof of a credible threat, no proof of hard terrorist links)- is just as criminal an idea.  Those ideas need to be fought with the values of freedom, justice and true democracy- a society in which it is not unpatriotic to criticize policy yet support our armed forces that are the unwitting tools of that policy.  They have no voice VarMax, so it is our sacred <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>duty</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to protect their interests by making our voices heard when we feel they are being put unecessarily at risk.<br>
<br>
Read carefully what I have written VarMax- I'd like very much to hear your further views on the subject.  They are passionately held, but my fear is that, however noble their motivation- that they are the wrong policies to keep your family and my family safe in the long run.  Short-sighted quick-fix policies are a dime a dozen, and a great way to get re-elected.  But to actually present lasting long-term solutions?  That is the gift of elder statesmen, and I'm sorry to say Bush Jr. isn't even a shadow of his father or indeed any President in my lifetime in that regard.  <br>

35 years ago we also beat blacks in the street and refused to let them drink out of our water fountains.  No one's saying the US has an innocent history.<br>
<br>
Whether the US has the legal right to invade Iraq is one thing.  I don't think too much on it.  However, I believe the US has the interests of the world as a whole at heart, and I'm glad to put my trust in it.  I can imagine what it would be like if a place like China or Korea was the number one superpower in the world.  I know the US is doing the morally correct thing in invading and forcing Hussein out, so that the Iraqi people will have the freedom to live in a country run by themselves instead of a dictator.<br>

But not to Iraq Spooks. Out of a war budget of 75 billion, only about 8 billion has been set aside for foreign aid- out of that, half a billion for humanitarian aid to Iraq.  The United Nations has estimated that just to prepare humanitarian efforts in anticipation of a war, 120 billion dollars were needed.  Out of a war budget of 38 billion pounds, we have pledged 10 billion for humanitarian assistance.  More than ten times the US contribution- but it's still not enough.  Of course, the morality of destroying a nation with the understanding you'll pay for the reconstruction is very questionable in itself.  No amount of aid will restore Iraq's sons killed defending their country, or innocent women and children who became victims of the bombing (the dehumanizing euphemism &quot;collateral damage&quot; sickens me).  It's also worth noting that most of the rest of the 8 billion dollars of foreign aid goes to Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey.  Thinking of the political consequences, I doubt very much the starving Arab population of Iraq will be very impressed with Israel being awarded 4 times the aid they are.  <br>

However, on the flip side, most of the arguments I hear against the war when I voice my support are along the lines of the U.S. is not morally perfect either... yadad yada yada. I think it is equally ignorant to assume people who support the war are ignorant of the past crimes of the U.S.  I just don't see why it is relevant to wether or not one supports the war.  If anything, since we supported Saddam in the past, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , we should feel a duty to clean up our mess.<br>
<br>
My reason for wanting to remove Saddam is simple.  But, alot of times, the simple answer is the correct one.  Even in international affairs:  <br>
1)Saddam has WMDs( they found a 100 acre chemical weapons plant recently).  <br>
2)Saddam tried to hide his WMDs.<br>
3)Why does Saddam want to keep his WMDs even at the cost of his hold on power?  Well, the simple answer is so that he can use them.  On who is anyone's guess.<br>
<br>
Freeing the Iraqi people from a brutal dictator is just a fortunate side effect.  As far as loss of life goes, I have no way to prove this but I am willing to bet that the loss of life caused by the war &lt; the loss of life that would be caused by Saddam during the rest of his lifetime if we had left him in power.<br>
<br>
But, I am not a mindless Bush zombie!  I can voice dissent to!  I think Bush should call this war what it actually is.  &quot;Operation Kick Saddams Ass and Free the Iraqi People in the Process&quot; is more appropriate.  And I am perfectly fine with that because he deserves a good ass whooping.<br>
