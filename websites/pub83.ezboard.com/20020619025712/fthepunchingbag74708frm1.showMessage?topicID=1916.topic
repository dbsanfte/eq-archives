Any lower and the sword begins to slow down. It seems also whenever you have this imbalance you begin to see reductions in the total number of attacks over time. So for me i will continue to use my &quot;special&quot; ql 199 torturing tool on test. Seeing as that is impossible to obtain on the live servers however, the WW katana certainly is a tempting choice. again you will need a lot of init to get it to work optimally even at the highest aggro settings. ***I am still testing the speed times on this sword, and will hopefully have some concrete numbers in the near future*** <br><br>the other note on this katana is that it is the only weapon i have seen that contains the new MA multi req described in the patch notes. here are the stats for the ql 200 - <br><br>MA - 806 <br>2HE - 537 <br>Brawl - 537 <br>Dimach - 180 <br><br>then a little further down. . . <br><br>Martial Arts for combined attack: 969 <br><br>yes, 969! and i can confirm that if you do not have 969 MA skill you do not punch at all, just swing the weapon. now while this does not show up on any other weapon (even the new claws) i have a feeling the code is in and takes affect already. 2 main evidences - 1) remember the wierdness with the improved taichis needing MA mastery or 4-fists to work?  and 2) whenever i get hit with one of those nasty veteran trader skill plunders i begin to only swing the weapon, and i regain fists again when the nano terminates. this is a major concern i believe for any MA weapon user, for if you are squeezing into the best weapon already, you are surely going to need even more MA skill just to get your fists to work. and dont even get me started on what a pain this is against those annoying trader mobs. . . <br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mavik>Mavik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#660000>(5/8/02 9:37:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1916.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> How's Agro</span><hr size=1> With MAs crit more often in 14.2, not to mention throwing a heal now and then, are we goimg to get stuck with all the agro? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umingz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mingz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Martial, Baby, MARTIAL.</span><br>  Posts: 594<br> <font color=#660000>(5/8/02 9:37:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1916.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New WW katana info</span><hr size=1> Just be glad I cancelled my account or 2HE MA weapons never would have made it into the game.

My other chars have also teamed with a great number of docs that, perhaps due to either laziness or a lack of understanding for AO's game mechanics, prefer to simply hit the team heals over and over rather than switching targets and using individual heals.  As you are no doubt aware, using a team heal when an individual heal is called for will add significantly to the doc's aggro, and will often pull the mob(s) away from the tank and onto the doc unnecessarily.<br><br>Good doctors know this and use individual heals when appropriate, rather than just spamming team heals and then shouting when they ultimately draw aggro.<br><br>That's what I was referring to.<br><br>As for Enforcers, I actually had one tell my doc: &quot;Aggression Enhancer?
