Given:<br>
1.  The 21 year old was mentally unstable.  <br>
2.  Everquest has the WORST customer relations and the WORST customer service people in the MMPORG business.<br>
3.  Everquest is designed to eat up large amounts of time and leveling/getting items is gruesome and difficult, losing any of them for whatever reason could take months to get back, and they refuse to refund or return items or levels, so you have to spend even MORE time getting them back.<br>
4.  The game is a major source of anxiety and stress if you are a long time player and lose levels/items.<br>

What that mom is sueing Sony over is equivlant to making a mentally unstable person worse by pushing them over the edge.<br>

Do you think its a coincidence so many people hate Evercrap? Sheesh, get a clue man.  You might remember the saying about &quot;walking a mile in another person's shoes before you understand them&quot;.

Sony/Everquest's sheer arrogance and stupidity when it comes to customer service/game design is criminal enough, I'm glad somebody is going to sue them for a nice large sum of money.  There is a large history of poor customer service on Verant's part to give that mom's argument some credit.  <br>
<br>
You lose a son to a stupid video game you think she's sueing because she's a greedy bitch?  Give me a break!<br>
I wouldn't be surprised if unhealthy long term exposure to EQ contributed to a large degree of his mental instability, he lacked any &quot;healthy&quot; counterinfluences.  It wasn't the mental instability that killed him it was the fact he was pushed over, and EQ played a part in that, and hopefully the greedy bastards will pay for that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uthesensei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Sensei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The MAN.

That's the dumbest argument I've heard yet on this.  By your logic she could sue the city they lived in because the stop light on the corner caused him stress and anxiety.  Or the U.S. Postal Service because his monthly Playboy magazine wasn't always delivered prompty after publication.<br>
<br>
Man this is what's wrong with this fucking country's legal system -- people have to always find a scapegoat.  You want to know why he committed suicide?  Your first line there, and only your first line.  Normal people don't whack themselves.  You don't need to go out and sue everyone under the sun and fuck up things for everyone else because you can't deal with that simple fact.  EQ is a game, and it's a very, very good one.  So because it's &quot;too good&quot; we should be able to sue?  I guess I should take every woman on the planet to court then, because they're addictive and cause me stress and anxiety as well.<br>
<br>
Let me guess ... you probably thought it was nifty when that idiot woman years ago got a cup of hot coffee from McDonald's, drove with it like a boob with it in her lap and then sued because it burned her. It's the same shit, really, except in this case it's much worse.  That woman got over ... whack-a-mole's mom here, though, is riding her dead son's corpse to a payday.  If there's a God they'll both go to Hell, hopefully, but mommy dearest should get the honeymoon suite.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What that mom is sueing Sony over is equivlant to making a mentally unstable person worse by pushing them over the edge.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  No.  She's suing because she can't cope with his death without a tangible scapegoat to blame.  Someone has to pay, right?  Because she couldn't have given birth or badly mothered her child into being a suicidal nut-job, so it MUST HAVE BEEN THE VIDEO GAME.<br>

Hey dipshit, I ran one of the biggest EQ fansites for a year, and I guaranteee you I know more about the game than you do.

<br>
And btw, if you thought EQ's cs was bad, try Funcom's.  Someone call a lawyer, I think we've got another defendant.<br>

<br>
EQ's a game. It's addictive because it's fun.  Some people, unfortunately, do not have the mental capacity to deal with any addiction, even non-traditional ones.  Blaming, and trying to punitively damage the provider, however, is not the answer -- that's called scapegoating.  And whether the person in question is addicted to over-eating, drugs, alcohol, Pokemon trading cards or gambling, I sincerely feel that the problem is not the tool used, it's the wielder.  Suing the maker of Hostess Fruit Snacks, drug dealers, Coors whoever makes those annoying Pokemon toys and Park Place (casino company) doesn't make the world better (well maybe suing drug dealers does), it just contributes to the further decline of our own ability as a society to deal with the root of a problem rather than blindly lashing out and fucking over the other 99% of a group that can deal with something addictive in a responsible manner.<br>
<br>
399,999 other EQ players, in this case.<br>

<br>
Let's see if I can grasp this logic.<br>
<br>
1. Unhealthy long term exposure contributed to his instability.<br>
<br>
Who's fault is that? Is that VI's fault? Should they make the game suck, so people won't spend as much time in front of it? <br>
<br>
2. He lacked &quot;healthy&quot; counter-influences?<br>
<br>
Like what? Name one &quot;healthy&quot; counter-influence. God? TV? Wacking off? Smoking crack? Eating at McDonalds? What? Who decides what &quot;healthy&quot; is, you? Anything in excess is bad. If he was incapable of regulating his excesses, then we can only blame his caretaker. <br>
<br>
3. EQ pushed him over?<br>
<br>
 Sure, ok. Yeah EQ pushed him over. EQ was the catalyst. Let's just say this is true. Now what? Like sensei said, where does it end? Can I sue Disney for filling me with lies about good and evil when I was a child? How about- I want to sue the Jehova's Witnesses because they influence gullable people. Oh, let's sue Colt, because they made a gun that killed someone. They should make guns that just shoot caps. <br>
<br>
You wanna live in a plastic bubble? Go right ahead. I dont need a disclaimer or a warning on every wall telling me that if I run into it, I could get hurt. I don't need a warning label on a knife to know it could cut me.<br>
<br>
 Your argument is this:<br>
<br>
Game company's should make games less desireable to play so instable people won't be pushed over the edge from playing too much. <br>
<br>
No thanks, I'll take the good stuff.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uthesensei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Sensei</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The MAN.

&quot;I know more about the game than you did because I ran a fansite&quot;.<br>
That's an assumption, with no facts to back it up.<br>
Its also more than a little arrogant.<br>
Its like I said you have to walk a mile in someone's shoes to know.<br>
Death? Suicide? Mental breakdown?  Ever had your body shut down from the stress?  <br>
Been there, done that, crawled and pulled my way up out of it with sheer will power and rebuilt my life.  I've talked with the bastards that run EQ unlike 99.999% of the player population. They are soulless greedy money grubbing bastards.  Mental stress, suicidal behavior, violence prone, been there done that Sensei.  I know what the guy went through, and EQ was not healthy for him, I recovered from it, its obvious you have never had to deal with that situation.<br>
  The fact of the matter is you do &quot;not&quot; know you know more than me.  I rebuilt my life and its too bad that kid didn't have the will to do it but killed himself.  I hardly find it an amusing situation.                                                                               You are &quot;supposed&quot; to be a good journalist Sensei, or at least had the training of one.  Did you get all the facts? NO.  You took some half assed, half cocked assumptions and ran off with them to turn this victim into something to laugh at.  Did you speak to his mom? Parents?  No? Thought so.  Oh and your taking Sony on their word? 400, 000 EQ players huh? or was that 400, 000 EQ accounts?  Guess how many accounts people owned on average.  Divide that number by 4 to get your real figures, and that's an average. I knew people in the game with as many as 10 accounts just for guild raids.                                 <br>
    To finish, hey I have my opinion, you have yours. I respect your opinion however half assed it is, I don't expect you to respect mine however half assed yours is.  Concerning the McDonald's coffee incident, she did NOT get as much money as was reported.   YOU as a journalist should know how those stories are blown out of proportion to make a headline.  She got far far far less, she was also permantly scarred on the legs because the coffee was so hot.  PERMAMENTLY SCARRED ON THE LEGS.  She got in reality maybe closer to $100,000.  How do I know all this? I researched it, something you might want to do when your making these claims.  <br>

It is a tragic case for all the involved, and you make a flame of it (even turning into flaming eachother instead of the case). I know flames are all the fashion, but it's frustrating that whatever matter is brought up, someone feels obliged to post a flame about it.<br>
<br>
And the case:<br>
I agree with Sensei here - on his claim about the scapegoat mentality. The MacDonalds case is a good example of how misused the legal system is. It doesn't matter how much she got scarred - if you drive with a hot cup of coffee between your thighs you should know what you're risking. What the court judgement says here is that it not your responsibility to try using common sense. That is at least the message the public seems to read...<br>
<br>
Quote Mingz (quote Hogmaster): &quot;2. He lacked &quot;healthy&quot; counter-influences? - Like what? Name one &quot;healthy&quot; counter-influence. God? TV? Wacking off? Smoking crack? Eating at McDonalds? What? Who decides what &quot;healthy&quot; is, you? Anything in excess is bad. If he was incapable of regulating his excesses, then we can only blame his caretaker. &quot;<br>
<br>
- No, we cannot automatically blame his caretaker. There are mental disorders that are physically based, no human being can cure that with being a good parent. There are also psychical conditions that the best parent in the world could not help against with all their love. We know too little to blame his caretaker. Maybe Everquest was the only thing that kept this guy from beating up old ladies or smoking crack? I wouldn't blame the parents for letting him play then... Besides, he was too old for the mother to &quot;force&quot; him to do anything against his will anyway.<br>
<br>
I said the case was interesting - the reason I say that is that whatever the solution will be, it will be of some symbolic importance. Yes, personally I think it's wrong to sue Verant for this, but I know that my understanding of right and wrong does not always fit with what the legal system comes up with. <br>
<br>
And Verant is likely like any other company, including FC: It has one portion of idealists, visionairies and creative people, and one portion of dirty, down to earth marketing and economics people - and possibly some mixes of all the above... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ukatzy69.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Katzy69</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#660000>(4/9/02 2:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1864.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> /me recives popcorn . . and passes it on . . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucson777.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cson777</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#660000>(4/9/02 7:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1864.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re</span><hr size=1> I mean no disrespect, but anyone that feels so depressed about a game should seek professional help.

Now, we have the Stella Awards given to the individuals who win the most frivolous lawsuits ever. The Stella Awards are named in honor of 81 year-old Stella Liebeck, the woman who won $2.9 million for spilling a cup of McDonald's coffee on herself.<br>
<br>
The following are candidates for the award:<br>
<br>
1. January 2000: Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas was awarded 780,000 by a jury of her peers after breaking her ankle, tripping over a toddler who was running amuck inside a furniture store. The owners of the store were understandably surprised at the verdict, <br>
considering that the misbehaving little fellow was Ms. Robertson's son.<br>
<br>
2. June 1998: 19 year-old Carl Truman of Los Angeles won $74,000 and medical expenses when his neighbor ran over his hand with a Honda Accord. Mr. Truman apparently didn't notice there was someone at the wheel of the car when he was trying to steal his neighbor's hubcaps.<br>
<br>
3. October 1998: Terrence Dickson of Bristol, Pa., was leaving a house he had just finished robbing by way of the garage. He was not able to get the garage door to go up, because the automatic door opener was malfunctioning.  He couldn't reenter the house because the door connecting the house and garage locked when he pulled it shut. The family was on vacation.  Mr. Dickson found himself locked in the garage for eight days. He subsisted on a case of Pepsi he found in the garage and a large bag of dry dog food. Mr. Dickson sued the homeowner's insurance claiming the situation caused him undue mental anguish. The jury agreed to the tune of a half million dollars.<br>
<br>
4. October 1999: Jerry Williams of Little Rock Arkansas was awarded 14,500 and medical expenses after being bitten on the buttocks by his next door neighbor's beagle. The dog was on a chain in its owner's fenced-in yard at the time. Mr. Williams was also in the fenced-in yard. The award was less than sought because the jury felt the dog might have been provoked by Mr. Williams who, at the time, was repeatedly shooting it with a pellet gun.<br>
<br>
5. December 1997: A Philadelphia restaurant was ordered to pay Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pa., $113,500 after she slipped on a soft drink and broke her coccyx. The beverage was on the floor because Ms. Carson threw it at her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument.<br>
<br>
6. December 1997: Kara Walton of Clamont, DE., successfully sued the owner of a nightclub when she fell from the bathroom window to the floor and knocked out her two front teeth. This occurred while Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through the window in the ladies room to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge. She was awarded $12,000 and dental expenses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Since I don’t have the time or inclination, like Hogmaster2000, to study the case law, interview the participants (and all witnesses), research the court records, and follow up appeals process, I can not verify the above published news stories as valid or 100% accurate.<br>
<br>
But I can say with growing certainty, my fellow Americans seem to require a fall guy for any unfortunate occurrence that happens to them, or someone they know.  Maybe it’s because of the glut of aspiring lawyers whispering sweet financial nothings in their ears.  Maybe it’s because of the liberal awards given by ignorant jurists. Or maybe it’s because we, as a society, have increasingly declined to accept responsibility for our own actions.<br>
<br>
Whatever the reason, to blame the makers of “Mousetrap” for the incident where I imprisoned six of my family members in large baskets, is ludicrous.<br>
<br>
And Hogmaster2000, just to show you that I can do research and spell check:<br>
<br>
“Ludicrous-adj [Lat. Ludicrous, sportive &lt; ludus, game &lt; ludere, to play.]  So obviously absurd or incongruous as to be laughable”<br>
<br>
Kinda like the name Hogmaster2000.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Death? Suicide? Mental breakdown? Ever had your body shut down from the stress?

<br>
So business-people are greedy?  Well call the New York Times because we've got a new story for the front page.  Come on, Hog -- you are scapegoating.  I've dealt with plenty of addictions in my life, btw -- the pack of Camel Lights in my car and the Joe Camel voice I've had going for the last decade is testament to that fact.  But believe me, if I get lung cancer I will be firmly laying the blame on one person and one person only, myself for being so stupid as to smoke when I know it's dangerous.  I won't be out there suing big tobacco and the state and my insurance company because I was too fucking dumb to stop hitting the cancer Russian roulette wheel.  <br>
<br>
And that's my point here -- if you take a gun, point it at your foot and pull the trigger, it's not the bullet's fault, it's not the gun manufacturers, it's yours.  But we live in this litigious (sp?) society where instead of making ourselves smarter about issues and takingresponsibilities for our own actions, we just lay the blame at someone else's feet and collect our paycheck.  Well fuck that -- you want to live that way and blame everyone else for your own failings, be my guest.  But the answer in the end is that this kid was weak.<br>
<br>
By the way, Mr. Journalism Critic, did you ever stop to think even for a second that EQ might have had nothing to do with his suicide? Hmmm ...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The fact of the matter is you do &quot;not&quot; know you know more than me. I rebuilt my life and its too bad that kid didn't have the will to do it but killed himself. I hardly find it an amusing situation. You are &quot;supposed&quot; to be a good journalist Sensei, or at least had the training of one. Did you get all the facts? NO. You took some half assed, half cocked assumptions and ran off with them to turn this victim into something to laugh at. Did you speak to his mom? Parents? No? Thought so.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now that's true, I don't know that I &quot;know&quot; more than you.  But the simple fact remains I disagree wholeheartedly with your opinion.  Furthermore, I had all of the facts I required because I was poking fun very specifically at the sickness of a mother who sues a gaming company for her son's death.  While I have to admit the words &quot;natural selection&quot; come to mind in terms of his death, I wasn't poking fun at him directly and furthermore I very specifically tempered what I wrote to make sure I didn't run that too far.  In fact, on the odd chance that one of our fellow MA's might be feeding their addiction in AO, I even put in a (albeit smartassed) plea to anyone feeling like this to get help if they need it.  <br>
<br>
In terms of questioning my journalistic abilities, you need to learn the difference between a news story and editorializing (hint, the second one's what we do here at TPB, even when reporting the news, and I very specifically point that out in the essay I wrote when I opened this site). Nothing I reported was untrue to the best of my knowledge. My opinions of mommy dearest going for the big bucks at Verant is just that, an opinion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> To finish, hey I have my opinion, you have yours. I respect your opinion however half assed it is, I don't expect you to respect mine however half assed yours is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No, actually you don't respect my opinion, and I don't need to go further than this sentence to prove that fact.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Concerning the McDonald's coffee incident, she did NOT get as much money as was reported.

I researched it, something you might want to do when your making these claims.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You want to know the God's honest truth about how I feel about that permanent scarring?  GOOD.  Because it's about fucking stupid to put a piping hot cup of coffee in your thighs when you're driving, and anyone with the brains God gave a fucking kumquat knows it.  It fucking sickens me to the core to know that she got a dime out of anyone for her own stupidity, it really does.  I don't care whether she got $10 million or $1, it's too much.  And I didn't need to research it further because my point was she got a single dime BUT I knew she had gotten something.<br>
 <br>
I research companies for a living, and I am so frigging tired of reading about frivolous lawsuit after frivolous lawsuit that I'm ready to scrap our country's legal system at this point.  People like Bill Lerach (your personal idol, I'm guessing) and the burnt pussy woman have destroyed our legal system's credibility and done more damage to the morality and ethics of our society, in my opinion, than all of the violence and cursing and nudity on tv combined.  It's created a culture where you don't have to take responsibility for your own actions and you can always blame someone else, and that pretty much sucks.  Maybe when you get older, or just more mature, you'll understand it better.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But again, hey, its a free country.

<br>
First, what evidence are you backing anything up with?  You're making the same assumptions because you shared this person's problem?  You don't even know that he killed himself because of EQ, that's just what his mom said!  Fact check that, chief.  You accuse me of running wild and fancy free with facts and then turn around and (as opposed to what I wrote) immediately assume it WAS EQ's fault he died ... think about that.  Maybe his girlfriend dumped him.  Maybe the Penthouse forum letter he wrote didn't get published.  Maybe the dog was talking to him -- I mean for all we know EQ was the only good thing in his life, and that's why he played it until it wasn't enough to cover for his other problems so he ended it all.<br>
<br>
Lastly, in terms of that shot on &quot;good journalistic style,&quot; coming from someone who doesn't know the difference between a real news story and an editorial position, I'll take that with the context of your ignorance of journalism in mind, if you'll excuse me.<br>

I'm not criticizing or defending here but there is something that many of you don't know. I can only repeat what I learned in a class discussion with one of my Law Professors several years ago. They (McDonalds) received 16 official warnings from state and federal regulatory agencys demanding that they turn down the temperature of their machines after numerous employees had filed workers compensation claims because they received 2nd degree burns while using the machines. They ignored it. They were ordered to pay fines because they had not complied with &quot;public safety&quot; standards regarding this. They still did nothing. Along comes little old lady and a new example of the stupidity of the American legal system is born.<br>
<br>
As for this poor young man. The idea that EQ contributed to his death is pathetic. It's sad the way society has brainwashed some people to think that no matter what you do, it's always someone elses fault.<br>
<br>
I actually feel for the mother. I can't imagine the guilt and grief shes feeling right now. Then this lawyer starts feeding her head full of ideas that its not really her fault, its EQ's...yeah, thats it.<br>
<br>
If you want to blame someone, blame the American medical industry who, despite their magnificent advances forward, still are totally inept at dealing with mental disorders like clinical depression. This kid had a disease in his mind. EQ didn't have anything to do with that. His poor mother is just being victimized a second time by a slick lawyer offering to relieve some of her guilt.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=publius>Publius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Martial, Baby, MARTIAL.</span><br>  Posts: 480<br> <font color=#660000>(4/9/02 11:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1864.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get a clue?</span><hr size=1> LOL, Nazu, Nazu, Nazu...<br>

You went to law school, and you use a phrase like &quot;advances forward&quot; ??<br>
<br>
That's right down there with &quot;penetrate into&quot; and &quot;respond back to&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nazu>Nazu</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.tripod.co.uk/redhotant/icons/iconoc01.gif " BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 296<br> <font color=#660000>(4/9/02 12:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1864.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.hampsterdance2.com/gif/gerbil.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get a clue?</span><hr size=1> Lol, no I'm not a lawyer and I didn't go to law school.<br>
<br>
But I had to take classes with all a bunch of them to get a degree as a para-legal. I just got to finish about 2 years before they did.<br>
<br>
Sorry if my phrasing isn't up to snuff. No need to be mean about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1864.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1864.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1864.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1864.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=1864.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.threadControl?topicID=1864.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1864.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1864.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm10">Polling Corner<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market - Rubi-Ka 1<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm9">The Market - Rubi-Ka 2<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm8">Past Humor Links<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1>Main Dojo</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
