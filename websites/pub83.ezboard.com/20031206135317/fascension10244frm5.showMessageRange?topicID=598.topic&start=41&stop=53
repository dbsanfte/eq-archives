<br>
So um lets get started....<br>
<br>
Iegan was guilded in revered for as long as i can remeber, and from an officers standpoint, though he could get a buzz at times.. I NEVER ONCE HAD A PROBLEM I had to deal with because of him. No kos issues no stealing spawns no talking shit nothing hell he had less drama attached than some of the officers.<br>
<br>
As a sober player he does quite well ! How do i know this well lets see I lead enough raids in revered to know, I exped with him enough in revered to know. Hes one of the few rangers that could get taunt in a kite group and keep it and  not once did he train a raid or cause a wipe.<br>
<br>
I can not speak for his past guilds I can only speak for when he was in revered and that my dear i can tell u was fun and he was far from a LW,we still talk and group hell he didnt even mention to me that he was applying but now i know so I shall vouch on his behalf.<br>
<br>
Now Iegan for you!<br>
<br>
Redo ur app if u haven't let them know just how bad u want to be a part of this guild.<br>

Well in fact you did train people while you where guilded in Revered.  I haven't really meet you, but I happened to be in EC for a short time;  Maverickraven wasn't in the group, but seemed like you had a problem with someone named Nulwen (something like that cant remember the exact name).  He was in EC at the time also.  You zone in to Unrest and SOW him, then train my group, exp killing the whole group 5 or 6 times.  Then you continued to laughed about it in OOC.  Well, I just happened to be in that group, and I didn't think it was TOO FUNNY at all.  If you had a problem with someone oor to you, why would you train kill his group inclueing innocent people not involved?  Is that how you PvP people?<br>
<br>
While it was a long time ago, and I hold no real grudges now.  I still don't think it was cool of what you did during my early years in Norrath as a Noob Wizard.  You never even bother to apologize after you ruined my night sending me back a level.<br>
<br>
PS.  you could have atleast give me a SOW also<br>

&quot;Come now iegan. I didnt post anything for your information. I posted it for ADs info&quot;. <br>
<br>
there you go again bieng the king of the obvious.<br>
i didnt ask or say that you posted anything for my information, its obvious that you posted for AD's info the question is why? why would you post exagerrated or warped versions of the truth ? to benefit AD? a guild you hate so much. no. you did that simply to hurt my chances of getting in. what was warped or bullshit about you initial post? well lets start with what you said about me 'never shutting up about gear espeacially that damn POE bracer&quot; what exactly do you mean by that? thats a pretty negative comment imo. why is it bullshit imo? this is why, only couple of times that i can remember while in MiM did i really speak out about gear other than saying the occasional &quot;wow thats uber stuff&quot; ,  yes i was exited about the POE bracer. we killed peregrim rocksoul like 5 times and he never droped it. what did i say about it? &quot;omg i hope that pos peregrim bastard drops bracers!&quot; or &quot;peregrim must die!....and drop some damn bracers lol!&quot;  why was i eager or exited about it? becuase its an uber item imo that would benefit anyone in the guild who got it greatly and yes i wanted one too.  lets see another time that i wouldnt &quot;shut up about gear&quot; hmm RZ maybe? yeah i remember screaming out &quot;OMFG! THIS BASTARD BETTA DROP LIKE 4 BoW TONITE&quot; well i sure as hell didnt wanna be the first ranger to wield a BoW ill tell ya that much. so wishing you guild gets the uber drops it needs to advance is a bad thing? no it isnt,  but taken out of context and the way you phrased it &quot;iegan would never shut up about gear espeacially that damn POE bracer&quot; it does sound bad doesnt it? <br>
<br>
quote,<br>
&quot;We have known each other for a pretty long EQ time&quot;<br>
we were friends in EC for a short time until i realized what kind of person you are i then did my best to stay away from you. i left EC and never had any real contact with you again untill you joined MiM,  and i cant even remember ever really grouping much with you during this time. you dont know much about me or my skills. you are definitely not qualified to pass judgment on either of the two.<br>
<br>
quote, <br>
&quot;And the fact that it takes nothing to set you off is exactly the same as it was 2 years ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
not true it actually takes alot to piss me off, exept of course for one thing and that is simply fucking with my friends you do that and yes you will set me off.<br>
<br>
quote, <br>
&quot;The opinion i stated about your WSing ability wasnt about 1 time lag out it was how every time WS needed to be done we could never rely on you for it. Itd always have to be Aulwen (which cuts out a ton of dps) or myself.&quot; <br>
<br>
so it was only you and aulwen? tanager, ippyy, vege, braslo etc etc (theres no shortage of good rangers in MiM) they never Wsed? you only mention aulwen because everyone knows hes one of the best rangers in the game and you would look rediculous not mentioning him.  allways aulwen and yourself huh? dude your allmost as full of yourself as you are full of shit. i Wsed plenty of times, fact is MiM is where i learned to do it, i had done it before but not many times and as such didnt have much practice at it. its not that hard. <br>
now as to my not WSing as often as you, (which is actually argueable i dont remember you WSing  much more then most other rangers) do you have any idea how many times i was just DPSing on iegan while boxing a cleric? do you have any clue as to how many times i was part of a CH line when i did this? of course not you speak with out knowledge very often.<br>
<br>
qoute, <br>
&quot;Morb. whatever man you have totally become not worth the effort to flame anymore. Its just to bad you dont hve the balls to say somthing to someones face about your opinion and youd rather do it on a board.&quot;<br>
<br>
do you allways find it neccesary to &quot;flame&quot; people? what do you want morb to do log on and take off his helm so you can see his face and then tell you &quot;draaxx your a dipshit&quot;? right here on this board it seems pretty close to your face man, here where you and anyone else can see. not like you did draaxx talking shit about morb behind his back in guild chat, oh my do you remember what the thing that pissed me off the most is? can ya figure out one of the reasons why i dislike you now draaxx? morb was my guild leader and a good friend who i miss alot. fyi you are a dipshit imo draaxx, and your not even qualified to shine up morbs turds.<br>
<br>
<br>
quote, <br>
&quot;And one last thing iegan. I never hated you. i never thought myself better then you. I disliked a how you would take advice as a personal attack on you or your abilities&quot;<br>
<br>
i never saw you give anyone &quot;advice&quot;, you never gave me &quot;advice&quot; you would just simply come out during legitimite discusions and interject with your often ignorant and off the subject remarks, like the time me a couple of rangers and an SK were discussing using one handers VS two handers and we were talking about how using a 2hander would be better in a situation were riposites couldnt be avoided EMPHASIS on COULDNT BE AVOIDED. you steped in and said &quot;blah blah one  handers are better and if you dont know how too avoid riposites ill show you&quot;. again i told you dude we are talking about situations where ripo cant be avoided and then you repeated something like &quot;pfft ill teach you how to avoid ripos&quot;<br>
how do you tank a mob without it ripositing you again? yup thats the day i crowned you king of the obvious and ignorance. you call that giving someone advice? thats some pretty shitty advice and also a shitty way of giving it.<br>
<br>
quote, <br>
&quot;Its also sad how to this day you still refuse to post somthing to your Ex guildmembers who gave you most of the gear you use today. Its been about a month and you still havnt said a word on mimrz.com as to why you left. Oh well i guess.&quot;<br>
<br>
this i am sorry to say was a big mistake on my part, letting anger and frustration get the best of me lead me to deguild without saying goodbye to the guild in general, i said good bye to those which were close to me but i left many others in the dark. ive  just had alot of things going on in game aswell as in RL lately mostly bad news and it lead me to that really fucked up action. i am human and i do make mistakes that was definitely one of them. i will be posting on the mim site my reasons and an apology for my abruptness.<br>
<br>
<br>
i also ask for your apology's for this extremely long rant, i swear i will never post so much again! i think im going to hell for writing the worlds longest post hehe.<br>

Iegan, if it were such a mistake of just ditching all of us without a word, then try to fix it. It looks really bad, and makes you look really rotten. I mean, it's not too late to do something about it. You owe that much to MiM in general, not just your best buddies.<br>

I don't think only your best buddies helped you gear, and level. It was your deserted guild as well, and I believe we deserve a whole lot better than that.<br>

I offered my opinion and simply stated that he also left EC without a word, and no one knew where he went.  I didn't know there were actually two people playing the account, which probably explains a lot.  Maybe this cousin was the one training his former guild in MM that night.  I don't have anything against Iegan or dislike him.  Just never knew why he vanished the guild or started training us.  As you said, that was 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
Either way, ignore it if you want to, I care about this application about as much as I care about Morb's opinion. <br>

This'll be my last post on it. <br>
