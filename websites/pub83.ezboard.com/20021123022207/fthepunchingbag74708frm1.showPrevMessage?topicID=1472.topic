<br>
OK. i honestly have just about had it. I started day 1...within 10min of goin live. I made an MA because of one reason..we were supposed to be good at pvp. <br>
<br>
well guess what. we are the WORST. i am a lvl 165 MA, ql 200 implants, ql 200 armor, all the buffs its possible to cast and guess what. i cant even kill a green.<br>
<br>
I pvp every single day. so im not some gimp. im a rookie. was apprentice at one point. how? from ganking grays mostly. do i want to gank grays? no. do i want a good title? yes. why? because im made a pvp character. <br>
<br>
let me give u a run down:<br>
<br>
soldiers: shield, alpha strike the crits for sometimes 5 times my crit (50% barely fixes that) and thier recharge time on full auto, fling, burst smoke us.<br>
<br>
agents: a green agent can crit me for 2.2k. plus ad shield if in false prof, or blood red pets if in MP form (with a heal pet), plus roots<br>
<br>
MPs: blood red pets that do over double my dmg, plus heal pet, plus nano shutdown so i cant heal, plus mezz pet<br>
<br>
crats: no high lvl crats..but blood red pets to me that do over double my dmg plus crits from shotgun<br>
<br>
enforcers: dimach, brawl, fists, plus a beam or hammer that crits for over double my fists or brawl<br>
<br>
NTs: nullity (cannot even touch a green NT with nullity), nano shutdown, roots, nukes that hit for 500-1k which is over triple my dmg in pvp. <br>
<br>
engineers: can u say slayerdroid? triple the dmg i do in pvp..plus better AC buffs<br>
<br>
traders: crits for over 2k, debuffs so i cant heal and lowers dmg even more, roots, steal nano<br>
<br>
doctors: crits from shotgun or whatever gun they use, big huge debuffs (the ones that make u heal at like 10x as slow and hit just as slow), DOTs that are 2x faster then any bwt or shen, plus major heals<br>
<br>
advents: swords with several attacks, faster heals, big dmg shields, shot guns with huge crits<br>
<br>
what does an MA have: blah life, crit buffs that everone else uses in pvp, crap evades (geenish blue but impossible to raise if u want enough ncu, brawl, dimach, health and other stats to even lvl with), bwt that is slow and dose crap dmg, shen that recharges every 17 min and stops when an enemy zones, no way to root, no way to debuff, no way to do a decent ranged attack cuz bows really are BAD (slow, broke, low ammo, poor dmg, poor crits), dimach that does crap dmg in pvp and sometimes misses and recharges every 30 min.<br>
<br>
i was just trying to fight 2 different NTs that were 30 lvls below me. one at a time. i didnt even put a dent into them, same with the MP who was same lvl, same with the agent who was 18 lvls below me using FP as an MP..then FP as a soldier. <br>
<br>
MAs are so gimped and you guys dont even know it. there is no way an NT with half the live i have and 30 lvls below me should be able to kill me. nor should ANY other proffession that low lvl. as a matter of fact..NO proffession should be able to take down an MA cept an even lvl or higher soldier or enforcer.<br>
<br>
Im telling you right now..most of my guild is high lvl MAs and most of us are totally sick of it. im the only one that really pvp because i like it..the others dont because htey cant even get a freshman title at our lvl. <br>
<br>
I got so fed up tonight i was an inch away from cancelling my account. <br>
<br>
celestiness lvl 165 clan ma<br>
shokker lvl 74 clan trader<br>
lowtime lvl 52 clan fixer (dont get me started on how bad fixers suck to try and play)<br>
<br>
and a few other retired toons. <br>

Looks like I'll be hitting cancel within the month if shit doesn't start getting fun. I've got nobody to group with anymore, and I'm sick of trying to group with a bunch of kiddies (no offense kiddies, some of ya are really cool) and soloing is LAME (read as: totally f#^ boring) so basically thanks to FC's BS and empty promises I'm also tired of AO. It was cool, but I have issues with designers too shortsighted to implement a MA melee class properly.  EQ did it too. They made my MA a gimped PoS. Then 6 months aftr I left that game after over 2 years of being faithful, they revamped the EQ monk. Bastards. Too little too late. <br>
<br>
Heck I may even reopen my EQ account. My monk is stripped down to her skivvies, but Mingz still lives. Ming is still fully equipped (sans his Trak BP prolly, hehe) oh you non-EQ<br>
ers are getting all steamy so I'll shut the hell up about that.<br>
<br>
Yep FC is nothing but a chat interface anymore. The magic is gone. I can't level past 116 because I'd rather not play than beg to be in a group. Miglio is humble but he doesn't beg from kiddies with their UBER enforcers for crumbs. He will meditiate deeply, perhaps forever. <br>

I'm bored stiff with AO as it is, and I see no real hope of it getting fixed any time soon.<br>

No, don't tell me about the 13.6 patch. I read all the notes, and my reaction is, &quot;so fucking what?&quot;.<br>

Much too little, waaaaaaaay too late.<br>

If they don't, I'll keep playing my soldier and enforcer who are currently much more fun and not gimped (soldiers have problems but it's nothing compared to the MA).<br>
<br>
The real pvp problem is funcom tried to balance the profession 1vs1 forgetting AO is a multiplayer game.<br>
Combat classes (MA, enforcer, soldier, adventurer) should be able to kill all the other classes 1vs1 without trouble but thanks to all the fucking whiners on the official board it will never happen.<br>
<br>
When I started playing AO last july my first character was a MP, I made him to learn the game mechanics and to coop mostly, I was well aware that this profession isn't supposed to equal a soldier in pvp but could be a serious opponent in team pvp ; that's how things should be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udinoandrey.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dino Andrey</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.extraweb.com/anarchy/andrej.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#660000>(2/6/02 2:42:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1638.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I left the game already</span><hr size=1> If it was only the MA bugs, I would even have tried for a little longer, although they suck big time.<br>
<br>
True, game bugs are annoying, but if the game itself was versatile and exciting, I would be willing to be patient and wait for the Funcom team to fix them.<br>
<br>
The main reason is, that I am tired of this leveling treadmill, and the game doesn't really offer anything that could keep me interested any longer. During the past weeks I wasn't motivated at all to log in, as I am bored of merely striving for the next level.<br>
<br>
One big disadvantage of the game is, that it only makes sense to play with people who are near your own character level. I met some great guys in game, but in most cases we lost contact sooner or later because the level difference between us was too big to allow reasonable team playing. The level restrictions for team hunting is the most annoying community killer in game.<br>
<br>
What else can you do but leveling? PvP is a joke and not really existing, due to overequipping issues (only the rich player will win) and due to the lack of PvP opportunities. PvP is restricted to certain zones and this concept is a bit fanciless in my opinion. There isn't really a PvP thrill whenever you leave a city, or a roleplaying background that would allow you to play a bad person. Not even guild wars are possible.<br>
<br>
So long and thanks for all the fish!<br>

<br>
An update (woot!): <br>
<br>
The Martial Artist crit buff won't be changed at the moment. The reason is that everybody has the chance of getting such a buff, so even though it makes PvP more deadly, it is equal for everybody. <br>
<br>
Now, Martial Artists shouldn't feel &quot;short changed&quot; either because they crit ontop on minimun damage whereas other professions can crit with higher damage weapons: the Martial Artist minimum damage bug is being fixed in an upcoming patch, which will also include some great new additions. This will get that damage up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utoymas69.showPublicProfile?language=EN>toymas69</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#660000>(2/8/02 4:18:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1638.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Cosmic update - &quot;</span><hr size=1> Well, I'll belive it when I see it - hi hi - right....<br>
