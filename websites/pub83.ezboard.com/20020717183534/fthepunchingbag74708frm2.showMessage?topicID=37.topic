Am I getting screwed?</span><hr size=1> It sure feels like it.<br>
<br>
I have no sense of what anything is worth in this game. I've seen a lot of people say that money comes easily in AO but I don't see that happening for me.<br>
<br>
Is Q30ish meta and kevlar worth 5k a piece? What about Q30ish MA armor?<br>
<br>
I see the auctions for Bau and the amount people are paying and I can't believe it. 15k for a Q24 piece? Is it that valuable?<br>
<br>
I alway try to take the mindset that something is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it but I really feel like I'm getting shafted.<br>
<br>
On another note, what is up with the auction style sales now? Can't someone just say &quot;This is what I want for this piece.&quot; and sell it? Instead everyone does this &quot;QX XXXXXXXXXX Bid is now at 12k.&quot; crap.  I'm not sure why this bugs me so much but it does. I've even seen it with low quality Cyber armor.<br>

Am I getting screwed?</span><hr size=1> The easy out answer is that an item is worth whatever someone will pay for it.<br>
<br>
From my own experience buying, selling and watching the auctions, the only items that regularly command &quot;premiums&quot; (which I define as prices above 100cr per QL) are Bau armor, Waitt armor, Freedom Arms 3927 pistols, sunglasses and armor above QL45 or so.  The others, from the stuff that no one wants (Nail armor) to the stuff that is wanted (MA armor) see a lot more fluctuation.  I have seen QL30 MA armor sell for 3000, and then for 5000.<br>
<br>
I think in part this is because there are still not too many of a given item; once there is a more steady supply I think prices will fluctuate less (and be lower).<br>
<br>
Occasionally I will get an item that I know will fetch big prices.  For these I tend to do an auction (&quot;bid currently at ...&quot;), just because I will get more that way than if I try to guess how high someone will go.  While the prices we see for things like Bau do seem out of whack when compared to other armor types sold by players, merchants charge so much more that the PC traded items don't seem like such a bad deal.  And I believe there are some folks for whom buying from merchants remains an alternative, so plopping down 10k for a QL20 item might actually save a bit of money.<br>

Am I getting screwed?</span><hr size=1> I really get anoyed at the &quot;make offer&quot; replys, sure they are trying to make optimum profit but damn, it only goes so far.. its like they are ussualy trying to screw you over, thats not cool.<br>
<br>
Bau, waitt is cool and all but when it comes down to it its not that great for the prices people try to sell for, I think the prices in auction are all based on hype.  Same with freedom arms, there is pistols out there that are actully better just not as common and people think they are crap... why? because of the hype, they really dont know.<br>
<br>
I was gona buy some armor after I did all my token runs and saw the prices and was like uh.. pleeeze I dont think so.  Went to the mission machine and what did I end up getting? A full set of bau for FREE in 2.5 hours.. at level 16.<br>
<br>
Try to get missions that are the eye over a box when trying for specific items, that way you can get a extra chance on getting that item.  Also if thats not working you can do the retreive item missions but just not finish them and keep the item instead of returning it.  Hell you could get a bau helm at level 20 easy on a mission and turn right around and sell it on auction then use the money to buy 2-3 peices of other armor same ql like ma or kevlar to have a smooth black look,  think about it, 20 points of armor seems like a lot at level 15-20 but thats only -2 damage a hit.  <p>Keidric<BR>

Am I getting screwed?</span><hr size=1> Hiyas... I buy and sell for hours everyday. My theory on it is if I'm selling it then I obviously don't need it. So I watch prices being shouted then I go about 2 or 300 credits less. If I shout something then get a tell I'll usually ask for them to make an offer. Most often people reply with a reasonable offer thats about 300 to 400 less than the going price and I'll sell it for that for the simple fact A: I don't need it and they do so theres no reason to make &quot;all&quot; my money off one person.<br>
B: I firmly believe that if you hook people up then later on when you need help..you get remembered. C: Most the people usually end up asking if I have anything else to sell and then will buy more than one item of me. (cause they know they'll get it at a cheaper price) D: Most of the people I sell to also send me an occasional tell asking me if I have anything to sell...and every business man knows repeat customers are great for keeping business pumping.<br>
So if you hang out in Tir then you've prob seen me around.<br>
If you are looking to sell stuff just make sure your not trying to make a ton of cash off the sale of a couple items. <br>
As far as buying goes...if you know what you are looking for I'd suggest at bare minum do some research on the item..just ask people that have the item you want how much they paid for it...is it worth what they paid for it...(performance wise).<br>
Also alot of item prices depends on where you are located. I've been to newland....prices there are inflated alot compared to the prices in Tir. ( MY main office of sales :P )<br>
Well hope this helps some...if not...sorry <br>

We don't need to worry about ammo or weapons and as such, I have noticed MA's in general carrying alot more cash.  I personally just went to the advanced store and spent about 50k buying like 4 pieces of armor all within like 5QL's of my level.  I'd also sooner do that then put up with that whole &quot;make me an offer&quot; crap. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.showPrevMessage?topicID=37.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.showNextMessage?topicID=37.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=37.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.emailToFriend?topicID=37.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.threadControl?topicID=37.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=37.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=37.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm10">Polling Corner<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market - Rubi-Ka 1<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm9">The Market - Rubi-Ka 2<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm8">Past Humor Links<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2>All About Gear</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
