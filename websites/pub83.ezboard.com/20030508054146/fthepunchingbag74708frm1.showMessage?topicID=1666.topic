<br>
Preliminary Build notes v13.8<br>
General Changes:<br>
<br>
The PVP grace period now works as was originally intended. This means no more grid camping!<br>
<br>
Neutrals will now have PvP titles.<br>
<br>
You will now be able to apply implants when wearing social armour.<br>
<br>
The reward for PvP has been changed. You will now be able to loot all items your opponent has gained since last saving, and you will receive a trophy if the person looses more then 10% of the experience needed to gain a level.<br>
<br>
You should get more &quot;points&quot; from each token at higher levels! This should now better reflect the time it takes to get the tokens at higher levels. Please do not see this as us &quot;deluding&quot; the value of past accomplishments.<br>
<br>
There is now a chance of getting a special token reward for killing sided monsters.<br>
<br>
You will now receive feedback when trying to use Brawl and Dimach before the recharge time has expired<br>
<br>
A bug with closing lockpicked chests has been fixed.<br>
<br>
Some mission descriptions were missing locations. This has now been fixed.<br>
<br>
Your team members will no longer share the experience when doing single player missions as a team<br>
<br>
Your faction will not appear as monster in the character creation any more.<br>
<br>
You will no longer hear your own footsteps while flying with Quantum Wings.<br>
<br>
Launcher Changes:<br>
<br>
Added new background bitmaps in the launcher.<br>
<br>
Item Changes:<br>
<br>
Some melee weapons displayed ammotype=0 in the description. This has now been fixed.<br>
<br>
Fixed the incorrect look of the higher quality level Kodaik vehicles.<br>
<br>
The Biomech armour cloak will now fit in the correct clothing slot.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Rubi-Ka World Collectables&quot; can now be worn on the right finger.<br>
<br>
The Balanced Netgun now has the correct icon.<br>
<br>
Purchased ammo will now stack with looted ammo.<br>
<br>
The superior deflection shields from quality level 105 and up gave too much of an AC modification when used. This was caused by a bug, and we had to lower the modification.<br>
<br>
Special arrows have been added to use with the Bow Special Attack skill. The Bow Special Attack requirement has been removed from all bows that had it. You will still need a bow to fire them, but the bow can be of any quality level. This should make this weapon more flexible.<br>
<br>
Some armour textures got messed up after un-equipping a vehicle. This has now been fixed.<br>
<br>
Game world changes:<br>
<br>
Added a new dungeon; Smugglers Den!<br>
<br>
The Treepine Hut in Pleasant Meadows is now covered with 100% suppression gas.<br>
<br>
The Tir arena has a few changes to the borders around it.<br>
<br>
A few graphical glitches in Tir have been fixed<br>
<br>
Two places where you could get stuck in Tir have been removed.<br>
<br>
We have added special shops for Fixers and Traders.<br>
<br>
Some shops have been cleaned up. A few of them still had tradeskill items that we now have specific shops for.<br>
<br>
Monster changes:<br>
<br>
NPC Nano Technicians have had several nano programs removed, since they made them too powerful.<br>
<br>
Some NPCs did not have textures on their weapons. This has been fixed.<br>
<br>
A certain large lizard has some new goodies.<br>
<br>
Monster AC decreased. There was a bug in the AC of &quot;human&quot; monsters. They got their AC added twice. This has now been fixed, and should a decreased chance of hitting &quot;minimum&quot; damage only.<br>
<br>
Nano changes:<br>
<br>
The &quot;Team Warp Time and Space&quot; programs have had their descriptions changed. The team side requirement was missing.<br>
<br>
All Taunt nanos now inflict a minor amount of damage and now work as they should.<br>
<br>
False Profession Engineer and Bureaucrat nanos have had their descriptions changed to clarify their use.<br>
<br>
We have decreased the duration of the Agent's Assume and Mimic line of nanos. The Assume line now lasts for 25 minutes and the Mimic line now lasts 20 minutes.<br>
<br>
The DoT, Slime Cascade, will no longer occasionally heal the victim.<br>
<br>
The following nanos were missing their nano point cost, and will now take the correct amount of nano to execute:<br>
<br>
Total Focus (soldier)<br>
<br>
Limbo Mastery (martial artist)<br>
<br>
Imaginary Distractions (trader)<br>
<br>
Mimic Profession: Nano Technician (agent).<br>
<br>
All stun nanos will now have their recharge time executed correctly.<br>
<br>
It will no longer be possible to break Root nanos during a fight by executing hostile nanos on yourself.<br>
<br>
The feedback has been reduced when Speech nanos are executed on you. You will no longer receive a message each time these nanos refresh.<br>
<br>
Another size bug with Ruse of Taren has been fixed.<br>
<br>
Armour summoned by Fixers should now go in the right slots.<br>
<br>
Quantum Wings will no longer terminate when you zone.<br>
<br>
Area effect nanos will no longer be non-resistible to anyone who wasn't the original target.<br>
<br>
Martial Artist changes:<br>
<br>
The martial arts damage output has been increased! The &quot;damage range&quot; has been increased too, so the chance of doing minimum damage only to monsters has decreased.<br>
<br>
The martial arts critical have been increased quite a bit. You should no longer envy having a shotgun when you use martial arts as your prime attack.<br>
<br>
Blessed with Thunder has been modified slightly. The data for the DoT part of BwT has been changed to correspond with the damage it was actually inflicting - so, the complete damage has not been changed at all. The damage shield segment has been slightly changed and will result in it no longer being possible to stack this aspect of BwT.<br>
<br>
Fixed the stun effect on the Bird of Prey special attack. Note: there is only a possibility of achieving a stun with this attack, it won't happen every time.<br>
<br>
The animations when using special attacks have been fixed.<br>
<br>
Fixer changes:<br>
<br>
The Area Burst special attack has been added.<br>

<br>
You know.. the thing about roots that I've never understood.. look at all the classes that have them...  Pretty much all ranged classes.  Now, tell me.. who does it make sense to have roots?  Ranged classes or melee classes?  For a ranged class.. roots are too powerful cause they are mobile and have range (duh).. meaning they root us meleers they just run out of range and start pluggin us.  For a melee class though.. we HAVE to get in close to fight... wouldn't is make more sense for melee classes to have roots?  We would root people to enable us to get in close and they can't run away.. it was EVEN the playing field.. as it stands now, roots make the game unbalanced.. giving melee classes roots would make it more balanced.  Even rooted.. the ranged class could STILL shoot us, but it would allow us to get in close and do our thing.  In my opinion, they completely screwed up when they chose to give ranged classes roots.. sigh.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=publius>Publius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 339<br> <font color=#660000>(2/14/02 3:04:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1666.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/cjoiner/priest.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 13.8 Preliminary Patch Notes</span><hr size=1> heh, what we need is a new item<br>

<br>
Your team members will no longer share the experience when doing single player missions as a team<br>
<br>
If this is refering to mission reward exp, no issues.  If this means, you take a team into a single player mission, no one get's exp or no one but the mission &quot;owner&quot; get's exp, that's BS.  Time to beat some info out of FC and see what they mean on this.  Especially with team missions *STILL* not working.<br>
<br>
This one concerns me more then fixing our fists to be blunt.  Grouped mission exp is the only reliable source of exp ( and the only way of getting it that doens't bore em to tears ). <p><http://www.anarchy-online.com/character/photos/40240.jpg>

If mission rewrd xp was shared and NOT conctrained by level difference of teammembers then I guess it would be pretty exploitable.  High level players clear the mission, then lower levels team up to finish the mission and share in reward, which would be huge xp for lower level folks.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hidro>Hidro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#660000>(2/14/02 5:09:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1666.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 13.8 Preliminary Patch Notes</span><hr size=1> hmmm 3 positive changes and one nerf.....

Does it mean the end of senpai coats and the beginning of a new most wanted item?<br>
<br>
Biomech armor is better than primus decus (more AC covered) and also gives bonus to 1st aid and treatment.<br>
If they keep the current AC of biomech coats (which currently go to chest slot and give as much AC as a normal biomech chest armor) there's no doubt it will happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1666.topic&start=21&stop=33>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1666.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1666.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1666.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=1666.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.threadControl?topicID=1666.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1666.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1666.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm10">Polling Corner<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market - Rubi-Ka 1<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm9">The Market - Rubi-Ka 2<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm8">Past Humor Links<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1>Main Dojo</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
