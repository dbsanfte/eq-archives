In a true historical sense. This is inaccurate. <br><br>What you know as ninjitsu is in fact, a form of guerilla warfare created by peasant people to fight back against the oppressive shoganate. See in Japan, only Samurai were allowed weapons... swords, spear, bows of war, halbards. The weapons style of the ninja follow the same rules for the most part that the Samurai learned(though ninja were trained to fight left-handed to trick arrogant Samurai). The unarmed fighting style, taijitsu, is alot of things Samurai learned, but is also things that worked for the individual that made the move.<br>Example is monkey grabs the peach. ...This is a headlock evasion that isn't typically taught as it grabs, and mauls the groin ...dishonorable of a move. <br><br>Yes, eventually ninjitsu, like anything else in Japan at the time, became a partly spiritual endeavor. Though &quot;Martial arts&quot;<br>as hollywood shows it. Comes from monastaries. Ninjitsu has it's roots in warfare, not spiritualism.<br><br>So it makes sense that enforcers get to use a katana. A katana was NOT a peasant weapon. <br><br>We should however have our own special weapons as MA's.<br>Example for a nunchaku would be like<br>Martial arts as the prime skill<br>1h blunt as the secondary<br>brawling<br>fast attack<br>dimach<br><br>the multi melee requirement should be kinda high, as in reality trying to weild two nunchaku is rather difficult.  Either way, our prime mode of combat MA, should be used the most in a weapon. Not some blue skill, that is tied to a dark blue intiative. That's just poor planning. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utrust20.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trust20</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#660000>(8/8/01 8:05:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Had to do this</span><hr size=1> Thanks bro, that was actually enlightening.

I'd rather think that a &quot;ninja katana&quot; would be better for Agents and have it 1he.<br><br>Ninja's were mostly known as assassins, and well Agents are kinda that way. Much more so, than the MA. Katana's used to be straight. Ninja's stole the old ones, when it was found out that curved blades cut better. =)  <br><br>I've been into the Martial arts for as long as I can remember. <br>I think I was 6 years old when I watched Chuck Norris in the movie the Octagon(about ninja's). It wasn't until a few years ago that I learned more about ninjitsu. I found this cool school where I live that has one of Stephen Hayes students as the owner of the dojo. ...Stephen Hayes is an American that traveled to Japan to learn from one of the last great Grand masters of a ninja clan. He has published several books regarding history of the form, and much of it displaces most of the myths. (some of the myths are true... kinda) You can probably find these books lurking in a local Walden books or Borders. ...Just look in the sports section. Also you can find some Wing Chun books written by the Master that taught Bruce Lee. Plus there is the book that Lee wrote in the 70's about his own style.

A lot of us are aware of that, at least those with an interest in the martial arts.<br><br>Weapon forms start with the weapon and teach it's use, the martial arts start with the body and teach it's use.  Both do have some cross over, but one starts with the weapon, and there the emphasis remains, the other starts with the body, and again that is the principle weapon.   That's not to say that you wouldn't learn some weaponless moves with a weapon form, and certainly many martial arts teach weapons as well ( once the unarmed forms are well know )<br><br>I have no question that the &quot;ninja katana&quot; is not a martial artist weapon.  But what I do find funny is that a &quot;Ninja Katana&quot; is a dicotomy,   ninja didn't use the longer curved blade of the samuri, as a rule.  They use a slighty shorter straight blade sword, it was also edged only on side but that's where the similarity ends.<br><br>The Katana was the weapon of the Samuri,  the ninjato was the weapon of the ninja.  <br><br>PS, a single edged straight blade is a actually harder to smith then a curved singel edged blade,  the weapon of the ninja while similiar to the katana was in fact harder to craft <p><BR>Tigerwhite<BR>"Tigerwhite burning bright"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utrust20.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trust20</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#660000>(8/8/01 8:32:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Had to do this</span><hr size=1> Sincerely guys this is all very interesting, but once again I don't think Funcom is that technical and the game is riddled with inaccuracies if we dig that deep.

They flead thier homland and the warlord's of china for Japan (sort of the old grass is greener on the other side sort of thing). Well when all these boatload of people started arriving in Japan, the Japanese ruling class (again just as bad if not WORSE than the Chinese warlords) persecuted these peasants from mainland China. They forced them into the mountains and country sides. Alot of the principles of Ninjitsu are based on the book by Sun-Tzu, the Art of War. I learned of this book when I started taking martial arts back in 1988, long before it became well known I think. Diversionary tactics, subterfuge, alot of Ninjitsu training had to do with misdirection.<br><br>Also Ninja's weren't traditionaly all dressed in Black. One day I forget the Ninjitsu master's name but he attended a Kabuki theater group travelling through his province. He noticed that when the acts changed, they people in the background (stagehands) would dress in black from head to foot. They would move along the background, somtimes even during the play. Virtualy unseen with thier black costumes, and black background. Thus the Ninjitsu master, started dressing his field agents and such into these costumes (this was around 1600, so it was many years after the founding of Ninjitsu). While Ninjitsu, the style basicaly came from Chinese peasants living in Japan.<br><br>Some things not readily known. Thier were three types of Ninja. One was the field agent. He was the soldier. Thier was the spy. This person would often work in the Samuri or Warlords house, would gather information and if possible pass any sensitive information onto the Villages if they were going to be attacked. The third and most interesting Ninja class was the assassin. No, not ALL Ninja were assassins but some were particularly good at killing people (mostly Samuri) silently.<br><br>One story had a famous Ninja (again was about 20 years ago so exact names escape me), who was so dedicated he snuck into the Samuri's house. The Samuri's bodyguards had succesfully defended the warlord against this Ninja's attack so the Ninja mad as if he was escaping the house. In reality he had climbed up into the crawl space above the Samuri's bed. Well this Samuri was scared shitless so he had his bodyguards lay in bed with him. For three days the Ninja lay in that crawl space, waiting for the perfect time to jump down and strike. It didn't come until 1 day later. beyond fatigued the Ninja unwrapped some strands of his wifes hair... fed the hair down thru a crack in the floor board into the samuri's mouth. Then drop by drop fed the sleeping Samuri poisen along the hair into his mouth. Then escaped into the night. Ninjitsu IS absolutely without a doubt a Martial Art. MOST martial arts were developed by the peasants of the time. Martial = War .. Art = Art... back to front The Art of War. The Martial Arts. <br><br>Arachis<br>64 MA<br><br>P.S.
