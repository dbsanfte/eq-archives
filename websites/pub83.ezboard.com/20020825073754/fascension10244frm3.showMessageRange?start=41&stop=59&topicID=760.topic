For instance...<br>
<br>
Joe comes up and calls me some derogatory name.  I kill him.  He returns, and says the same thing again.  I kill him.  He returns, and says the same thing again.  I kill him...<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Joe comes up and nukes me.  I kill him.  He comes back, loots, and sits to med up well past gate mana.  If I engage a mob, he can nuke me again, so rather than babysit him, I ask him to leave, he stays, I kill him again.  Repeat.<br>
<br>
So, in short, what Fist is saying is that (1) he has no recollection of the events you describe, but if they are as you say then (2) he is saying the result was justified.<br>

There really is more than one way to describe the color green.<br>

I remember it like it was yesterday, Xazzt bound up by TTs and got corpse camped. I dont recall wether you had more ppl there and what class, however, rogues werent hot PvP shit back then, and we had like banded for Sunday gear.<br>
<br>
Its close to 3 years ago tho, but I bet Drazzil (Sendog) still remembers it as well, he came to our aid in the middle of it all.<br>

At any rate, you behaved like a bitch back then, but whos counting. I guess you just tried to impress Penney by getting boots for her.<br>

Jump on some other bandwagon.<br>
<br>
Yazzt<br>
Funny that neither Fist nor I recall this scenario, and frankly I dont recall zzt's before about the time Kunark came out in any event, and the ones I partied with I liked.  Until I posted I was quitting (damn addictions) no one ever accused me of cc'ing them in Najena, much less a zzt.  (Yazzt on these boards did once I posted I was quitting, and he said something to the effect that he was waiting for that day.  Why he couldnt bring that up to me before hand or after, but only once I tried leaving the game on a message board -shrug-)  I figure in all that time various zzt's were partied with me someone would have mentioned it if it occurred the way you try to paint it now, at least.<br>
<br>
Also understand there are MANY people that ripped the Fyre____ naming convention, most that were not us / friends were people trying to sneak into the original Fyrelake guild before most left for Bristlebane over the disarm crap.<br>
<br>
Names like Fyresword, Fyrestar, Fyreblade, Fyrestone, Fyres, Fyrestick, Fyrefyst were none of us.<br>
<br>
Fyrestaff, Fyrefist, Darkfyre, Dawnfyre, Fyrethorn, Fyreeyes, Nytefyre, Fyrehorn, Fyrehart, Brightfyre, etc were Fyrelake.<br>
<br>
After reading above about Penney being there (or someone on her char at the time (a possibility)) I asked a few people that were around those days.  Here is an account I got that was significantly collaborated by a now-bluebie fyre:<br>
<br>
2 gnomes were camping jBoots.  A few Fyres and their lowbie members/twinks arrived in zone.  Gnomes said they were there for one more boot.  Fyre's camped Rathyl for packs while they waited for the gnomes finished with the Drelzna spawn. Gnomes packed up and left eventually, shortly before hand 2 dark elves and a high elf or erudite showed up and tried saying they were camping Drelzna.  The Fyres present pointed out they were there and waited, and if they wanted to wait that was fine.  They didnt seem to like that answer, claiming they take priority over twinks having boots camped for them.  They tried to KS the next Drel spawn, Fyres killed them.  They came back, and tried to KS again or PK (not clear), resulting in their death again.  They said the names of the dark elves could have been zzt's.<br>
<br>
That was the account I got.  Apparently this was when Jakkard was in DDH and Penney was friends with Fyreeyes, and it was Fyreeyes there to get boots next when the maybe-zzt's tried to KS.  Fyrethorn (and possibly Saybr) assisted in protecting the camp.  Apparently Fyrestaff *was* there as well, though I don't have any recollection of this myself.  No one recalled Fyrefist being there.<br>
<br>
There a few times -I- remember being there and fighting for the spawn... Thyrm and I camping them for his lowbie (we had to stop using the longer casting big damagers and go with faster lower damage to beat the lowbies trying to KS);  another time was when I was helping a gnome or halfling named something like Arkynn who had just started a guild called lords of law or such (gave him a FBR cause I didnt much like having lootables on) and Xune and a few other DDH came in and tried to PK us for the spawn;  and once when some enchanter was trying to get rid of us by charming us from outside... (worked).  None of the ones I recall involved zzt's.<br>
<br>
So if that incident was the one you are complaining of yazzt, I don't think you have much of a claim of woe.<br>
If you are recounting a different incident, then your inability to recall which Fyre(s) it was as well as any details other than the view-point determinant claim of &quot;Fyre cc'd me&quot; doesn't do a lot to support that claim either.  I certainly didn't make a habit of running around picking people to attack and cc.<br>
<br>
As I don't have personal recollection of these supposed events, I won't hold it against the other zzt's.<br>

<br>
And read my post again while your at it.<br>
<br>
You say it is me, then you say it is fist.  The fyres I spoke to about it say fist wasnt there, and that I was, again assuming that the event in question is the same.<br>
<br>
Summary: I don't recall the incident, your recollection was erroneous according to you (as to ID) and then the x'zzt.<br>
<br>
Lets assume you are correct, and that Fist or I cc'ed you.  Of course we dfid it out of spite against someone we didn't know, right?  Or perhaps there was a reason?  You fail to say the circumstances.<br>
<br>
I think the account given by the Fyres, if it refers to the same instance, which by the accounts for your claim of CCing, of your first and third claims Fyrestaff was there, incorprates the reference to Penney, etc, provides a pretty damn good reason for doing so (continuing to return to attack / KS will generally trigger the same response).  Again, assuming it is the same event.<br>
<br>
Of course it is easy to believe that if we were there camping the boots we'd easily decide to ignore the camp and attack people we didn't know at the time, and further, to decide to CC them for shits and grins while maintaining the camp as mana users without a clarity level enchanter.<br>
<br>
So, if you wish to continue to try to trash us, provide some specifics.  And if you &quot;... saw this on Xa and Xezzt's screen&quot;, that would indicate that they had first hand experience with the issue yet they chose not to bring this up with me at any time, while you do so when you thought it would be a parting shot.<br>
<br>
In any event, you either held a grudge against me OR fist (obviously one or the other) without so much as a credible claim as to which you were carrying it out on.  This statement is based upon your using the same event to bash me then fist, and then having your cohorts correct you as to who.<br>
<br>
I know, how about we just kill every fucking body, that way we get rid of all the 'bad' people on earth, with the negligible downside of there being no 'good' people left to benefit from it. <br>

I wasn't talking to you about saying Fyrefist or Fyrestaff was there and who you said was there or not..was I? I directed that statement to Yazzt since he had no clue what was going on.<br>
<br>
Next time only read the parts I direct to you.<br>
<br>
And Xezzt.. I don't particularly care about making you huffy or whatever.. i have no qualms with you.<br>
<br>
Only time I can remember interacting with you was that day you trained that big goddamn black horse in WW.<br>
<br>
but you offered a res so I doubt it was on purpose hehehe.<br>
<br>
I got a port back and res'd myself anyways <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
