<br>
You can pull out examples?  Go on then, that particular 'example' consisted of us checking on Burrower, finding that CN had begun gathering there, then going down to ST, coh'ing down to warders, killing warders 2-4, then going back to check on Burrower, being told by CN that they were still gathering and guess what?<br>
<br>
WE LET THEM HAVE THAT SPAWN!  We didn't even try to take it, after they had been stalling on that spawn for over two hours... Damn, are your other examples this strong?<br>
<br>
Tetzou, the incident you are referring too, was when we spotted Zlandicar up, while I was exping in BoT, then as we were on the way there with 5 friends (including 3 AD members heh) we bumped into some friends from ES who had also spotted him up, and we stopped rushing to discuss how to kill it together and split loot, you of course ignored both people, and went ahead and killed it while two groups of people were trying to work things out.<br>
<br>
No, we aren't doing particularly 'cutting edge' content, but we are progressing at our own pace, and have no intention of allowing people we don't like in guild for the sake of being able to tackle bigger encounters, we are very happy where we are, thank you very much.<br>
<br>
Could you kindly explain to me how AT ALL we are cockblocking anyone?  We offer anyone who requires it the same chance we do at the mobs we kill, we never ever pulled a mob when other people were preparing for it; can you claim the same?<br>
<br>
Go on, I want to hear examples of SoD 'racing' guilds to spawns, or pulling mobs from underneath people, I am calling your BS.<br>
<br>
I never threatened anyone with war, get a screenshot and prove me wrong if you can.<br>
<br>
You are by far the biggest hogger of lower end content that RZ has ever seen, you are the last person ever that should speak here.<br>
<br>
Mearis<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
I just read that bunch of lies you spouted down there.  I never ASKED to roll on that ring, it was originally announced that it was going to be rolled on, and I passed as soon as you asked me because I thought a pure caster having a Dain Ring over an MT was a crime.  Stynk passed under the promise you'd help him with his war, which coincidentally you never did.  The funny thing is, even after passing, I called the rest of my guild over to help you, finish your war.<br>
<br>
Your account of the Tormax episode is also funny as hell.  SoD got all the droppables?  You must be smoking some strong stuff, you know who got the 'one' droppable item that dropped that raid?  MIFFINI, Arlene's wonderful paladin, who is still wearing them to this day.  How does it feel to be caught lying?  The ST key was rolled on, and the roll was won by Briareos, a paladin in my guild, and the Tormax head was won by Cyna, Steph's twink, the rest of the loot was claimed by Neckros for Adsales, since nobody was present who could loot it, don't try to distort facts against people with a very good memory who can call your BS, do you still wish to deny that Miffini got those boots?<br>
<br>
Finally, about Yelinak, that raid could not have even happened without me, since I was the only + CoV mage present, and I CoH'd the entire raid up.  I passed on the ST key, insisting I shouldn't roll, and that key was won by Cusinit playing Gildurath, what's even more funny, is that I rolled on the head for the gloves ONLY after people started rolling for their twinks, including AD mains, originally I intended to pass, but after seeing everyone present roll for them, I asked Atsuko in tells if I should roll and he told me to go ahead - but didn't you just say you had organized that raid for the purpose of getting them for Kelgar, if so what was everyone doing roll for their twinks?  Doesn't quite add up does it?<br>
<br>
None of those raids you mentioned were ever lead by you, they were lead by Atsuko who is a very good friend, and someone I respect a lot, and don't try to twist that for a second, because so many guildmates of yours were present, and none of whom will stick up for any of the stuff you said.<br>

<br>
that was the same event when you told me you are already there ? but i didnt saw you in CS SG WW or DN for atleast 30 mins after we killed it. That was also the same Zlandicar, when i remember correctly where Cloak and Talsiman went to Flupher, which was first with your Group and then came down with us. I get things done for my Friends, while you discuss how to fuck them over the best  (hint : <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> and we stopped rushing to discuss how to kill it together and split loot<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> ).<br>

Just ask a ton CN People how YOU have threaten them. <br>
And indeed i can claim that i didnt done the same, at one time i attempted to do so but Adell called me back. And i am thankful that she told me to do so, even the people that was doing xy mob was total asses, i did never done that.<br>

<br>
Why? But you stated earlier that i find those Mobs up, everyone else can do it also, i wouldnt call RoK dragons / Wuoshi Raid Mobs. any Guild on the server can do them with &lt; one group. why you call them lower end content? They are the same like any Rare spawn, for example take Lodizal or Hadden or anything. Its the same thing, first there gets it. Its not that others couldnt find them earlier too, correct? if it gives you so much headache, you can run around and check for them also. They are FFA!<br>
<br>
Also i might be wrong, but i clearly remember how you was in Kael when we had the incident with ES and King T where Loh watched how someone threaten War to the CN people that was hanging with us for having a good time.<br>

<br>
To CN you make it a habbit of biting off more then you can chew.  You say the upper guilds forced there way and took your mobs, and quote reverant as one of the guilds doing it im afraid that during the times when we where around there wasnt a rotation untill about the end on anything apart from ST.  And the only time we &quot;stole&quot; a mob from you was when you sat on Doze for 3 hours with 12 people online claiming its yours even though for 3 hours you had 0 attempts on it and no new members show up.  Then you show how hot headed you are by training us and having three of your members atk us which we delt with and to top that off we where kind enough to give you a tear that dropped off of Doz somthing you wouldnt have gotten on your own.  So please make sure you mention entire truths before blabbing how everyone &quot;steals&quot; stuff from you and prevents you from moving forward.<br>
<br>
To Mearis, some things you say seem are things i remember when dealing with it and your guild.  Maybe you should realize that if your still using the same rotation method you where using its flawed.  and realize that rev didnt want part of it wasnt just because we contested on how you took the mobs but because it was multi mob rotation.  if each mob has its own rotation then if say AD or wudan takes a spawn of if you can easily say ok they get another shot at it.  where ass when you running CT, Creator and KT CT isnt ever really gonna be wanted by the higher ups since his loot to time ratio is sup par.  so youd have a back log of KTs where as CT runs smothing and eventually overlapping and making it so you have 3 mobs at the same time possibly.  You also Have no right to call Anyone content whore when lastnight 20+ mim where in BoT and when asked what we where doing we said BoT tower minis and since only 1 was up at the time you Rushed with your lil 6 man crew up to the tower and tried to steal it but since you rushed so fast and knew we where on our way you failed and wiped to it.  Funny i call that karma.  You also call people hipocrits why dont you look in a mirror your self, didnt just week or two ago you guild a nicly geared SK and Cleric and when one of your members said wait a minute we have a protocal on how we recruit people you made him sit in the corner and keep his mouth shut.  Fine dealings there you post on how to do things then break your own rules.  You sir are a far bigger hippocrit they anyone else that has posted on this thread.  <br>

Hello, we guilded Exquisite and Aleki, and they followed the same procedure every single person with RL friends in the guild followed you can double check if you'd like.<br>
<br>
We changed the rotation a long ago Draaxx, it is no longer a multi mob rotation, but just several rotations on individual mobs, its been that way for a loooong time, ask Tremor, hell, Reverant was part of the changed rotation until it disbanded, we scrapped the idea of one all encompassing rotation as soon as we saw that it didn't work well.<br>
<br>
Tetzou, about me farming minibosses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    No, actually, I was in BoT exping with Cusinit, Pinaduz, Orchid, Kaminie and Flupher, but the reason I didn't want to move on Zlandicar right away, was because Orchid really wanted to exp, and even though everyone else was willing to go, we stayed until Orchid went to sleep, ask him, he will confirm every word.<br>
<br>
Draaxx, we were up at Auliffe, while you guys were ooc'ing OREEM CAMPED, long before you had ooc'd anything about the towers.  How can you claim a mob camped in the water wing, WHILE moving up the towers?  The reason we wiped, was because all the mobs on the platform except one were casters, and since you guys were rushing up, we didn't have the time to clear the platform to cause a melee giant to spawn, I have done Auliffe plenty of times with crews of 6 since the charm nerf, but I have never rushed another group who was there before me, trust me, we were up at Auliffe long before you OOC'd that you were doing towers, or that you ooc'd that you were 'camping' Oreem.<br>
<br>
I'll make a nice chronology of events that night, to clear things up for those who weren't there:<br>
<br>
- I was exping in BoT, helping VL farm spheres for her Tower key, with VL, Zazzi, Etric, Alrec, Mearis, Bharkh, no MiM are in zone.<br>
<br>
- VL, Zazzi, Etric leave to raid PoA, Fathom, Britetribe, Chalendar join us, no MiM are in zone.<br>
<br>
- Auliffe Chaoswind spawns, and we toy with the idea of killing him with 6, we decide to go for it in the end, we harmony our way up and kill the named stormrider that spawns near Auliffe platform.<br>
<br>
- MiM ooc's OREEM camped (Oreem spawns at the botton of the wing)<br>
<br>
- We try to plan things, since the spawn on the platform had 3 Vindi Praest, and one Elemental, and with 6 people we needed two pets for additional DPS.<br>
<br>
- MiM ooc's Auliffe camped AFTER we had been in tower for a good five minutes with no indication of their intention, they then shout that they will come and kill anything in two minutes anyways.<br>
<br>
- We try it with a charmed Praest and a charmed elemental, unfortunately we wipe because the charmed Praest keeps dispelling my elemental's charm, and we decided that we didn't have time time to clear the platform to try for a more favofable mob spawn.<br>
<br>
How is this 'greedy' or 'racing people to a spawn'?  We were already there before we had any ideas you guys meant to kill him, and yet you had no qualms to run up while we were engaging him, TRAINING us with a giant as well.  If anything, you guys trained us. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mearisthecowslayer>Mearis The Cowslayer</A> at: 6/24/03 2:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blizzyy>Blizzyy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Powernap</span><br>  Posts: 926<br> <font color=#333333>(6/24/03 2:25 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/blizzard/fullsize/playboy_1001.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: requesting consideration for lower level guild rotations</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your account of the Tormax episode is also funny as hell.

Hello McFly. I never say that the Droppables from KT went to SoD. If you would be able to read it would be a defiantly Plus. But indeed all Droppables from RingWar went to SoD, and i didnt say anything else. Also keep in mind that all this happend ~ 5 Months ago. I still have everything logged from it cuz i knew you will do Trouble about it. Now its just missing that you will say that both ST keys didnt went to SoD? is that incorrect? please, just let me dig out the Log Sir.<br>

<br>
One time you are saying you are On the way there, on the other side you saying you was keeping exping. I acutally went there 0 Zero people in CS / WW / SG / DN for 1 full hour. Not even an ES scout or anything. I am sorry i caught you there, but NP, you are correct, keep posting buddy. Nice shoes.+<br>
<br>
Edit: Also you shouldnt forget who got the Stuff from that Zlandicar (and that means all of it Loottable) that was indeed Flupher, the Person that you was argumenting about the Loot Split with. While i just invited him to come down if he needs anything he can just take it. <br>

You play it off that u where there for hours.  which takes longer to do get 1 single already buffed group up the tower when 3 different people have a harmony type spell or a group of 20+ still forming groups and needing buffs. Hmmmmm again use that brain of yours.<br>
<br>
and if 1 group of the people there had it camped then they did.  Is Oreen not on the way to tower? hmmm well lets see 4 wings 4 ways to tower.  Come on man use your brain for somthing other then pitting guilds vs each other.  Yeah i know about you trying to pit rev vs ES while Es tried to pit us vs you. was funny i got a good laugh.  And i prolly talk to tremor more then you do in fact his first words to us about the rotation where &quot;I will NEVER do a multi mob rotation with SoD&quot;  And hell i was in the channel and talking about it with them when we decided What the hell least we wont have to to rush everywhere to do stuff now.  and whether you like to admit it or not it was multi mob up till the weeknd of the LA gathering that we broke up.  we just never took CT on our times and gave it to people to try.<br>
<br>
and on your recruitment me myself i wasnt going to throw namse in there but since you did thats your choice.  I dont care how you recruit people nobody here does.  But when one of YOUR members posts hey can we do it this way cause we made everyone else do it that way and you say Talk to me in game and make him STFU thats funny as hell to a outsider and shows a bit of hipocricy.  And altough Altaris &gt; Tetzou ~_~ im gonna have to /agree Tetzou on this one.<br>

After Orchid left, we were still exping while we were discussing if we should move or not.  WHEN we started moving, we found out that another guild was moving there as well, so instead of porting to DN then discussing things, we decided to discuss things with Linenai in tells before heading there, we must have waited about 30 minutes or so in PoT while we were working things out - we had the group ready to port, just seemed pointless to kill the mob first the argue later, why don't you ask your own guildmates for a description of the episode?<br>
<br>
No, not all the droppables of the ring war went to SoD either.<br>
<br>
The one good droppable from the ring war (most of the hero's had died) went to VORGE, again, whom he will confirm.  The other two droppables (eye of Narandi, and something else) went to SoD members, but thinking that after doing the ring war the one good droppable item was awarded to Vorge, then claming that SoD got all the droppables is a bit rich, or still want to claim that SoD got all the droppables?  (PS, Vorge is a friend an awesome guy, much &lt;3 that he got the hat, just Tetzou)<br>
<br>
I recall only one ST key dropping, on that particular Tormax raid, and it was rolled upon and an SoD won it, by your version of things it seemed as if you in your infinite kindness awarded it to a needy SoD melee, instead of everyone there, including caster twinks rolling for it - so yes, I agree with you that one SoD melee won the roll on the ST key that dropped from Tormax.<br>
<br>
Any other lies I need to debunk? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pyrosprial007>Pyrosprial007</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.think-evolution.com/uploads/larue1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Kick Me</span><br>  Posts: 1035<br> <font color=#333333>(6/24/03 2:55 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.nerdrevenge.com/images/wow.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: requesting consideration for lower level guild rotations</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.think-evolution.com/uploads/Darthvaderfag.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blizzyy>Blizzyy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Powernap</span><br>  Posts: 927<br> <font color=#333333>(6/24/03 2:58 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/blizzard/fullsize/playboy_1001.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: requesting consideration for lower level guild rotations</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>discussing things<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I dont need to discuss with the People i am going with. They just take what they want and everyone that coming with me is always happy. thats what friendship should be, not discussing who gets what and if you dont find a solution, you wont go. Forgive me i dont follow your Lootfocus sheme, it matters more to have a good Time with my friends then getting xy Item. Forgive me that i cant understand your Point there.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, you are correct with the Crown. (has been a few months) but indeed i remember Vorge asking if any SoD needs it and everyone say gratz to him.<br>
<br>
You might include then around 100 other things i did with your Guild, letting you tag along. Etc it was such a great time, for both sides. Remember that SS Robe? you came for like 20 mins and looted it -- same goes for ton of other SoD when i did SS a few Weeks. And do i care ?? NOT AT ALL, CUZ IF THEY HAVE A GREAT TIME then everything is alrighty, cuz having a great time that should be EQ about. <br>
<br>
Forming static plans and trying to plan the life from other people that taking this Game not as serious as you do, isnt correct. <br>
<br>
I totally agree that any Mobs that take over 20 Members to kill should be planned infront. But anything that is ~ 1 Group Content should stay totally FFA. <br>
<br>
I mean EQ is fun to run around and find stuff up that is challenging, then gather some friends to slay it. Everyone got the same Chances to get it. That makes EQ fun for me and i know alot people feel the same. On the other side planning trival stuff just makes the game totally more static. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=409825" target="top"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.tu-clausthal.de/~wits/tetz.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Anyway Tetzou, let's sum things up, you claimed:<br>
<br>
- SoD steals spawns from lower level guilds:<br>
Ye the one example you brought up, we actually let them have the mob AFTER they had claimed it for two hours, when we had forces online to kill it!!  Lie number 1<br>
<br>
- I threatend people with guild war:<br>
And failed to show a single example ever, of me doing it.  Lie number 2<br>
<br>
- You only did 'a few' Zlandicars:<br>
Want me to even comment on this one?  No you don't, Lie number 3<br>
<br>
- SoD got all the droppables from a ring war:<br>
Out of 3 droppables, we got 2 of them, and by far the worst two, and we didn't get to pick which ones we wanted.  Lie number 4<br>
<br>
- I pretended to roll on GoDS on a raid specifically to get Kelgar gloves to make me appear greedy:<br>
I only rolled after people started rolling for their TWINKS, and after sending a tell to Atsuko asking specifically if I could- and I sent this tell only after other people started rolling.  If this was a raid specifically to get Kelgar GoDS, why the heck were people rolling on their twinks, and anyone informed.  Lie number 5<br>
<br>
- EDIT add:  I almost forgot, you claimed you don't bull people for spawns, but by YOUR OWN admission, you tried bullying people for spawns, but Adell cought you and made you apologize!  Lie number 6<br>
<br>
You aren't doing so badly, keep digging yourself deeper.<br>
<br>
I hate totally derailing this thread, but when people make false accusations, I am not the person to sit and take them silently. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mearisthecowslayer>Mearis The Cowslayer</A> at: 6/24/03 3:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mearisthecowslayer>Mearis The Cowslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#333333>(6/24/03 3:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: requesting consideration for lower level guild rotations</span><hr size=1> Yes I am right about the crown, and no, you never did ask, you said, Vorge really wanted the crown, so grats Vorge.<br>
<br>
The 100 other things you did with my guild?  Jesus man, like, the time you invited yourself down to ST, after we were doing a latenight raid with a few friends, and you invited yourself down there, then gated yourself out while we were doing warder 4, because you were pissed off I looted an SoD for SoDbank (something that I had explained extensively to all people who were present at the begining, that I'd loot the SoD's for people who needed, yet you couldn't seem to stomach).<br>
<br>
I got an SS robe on one total pick up HoT raid, because LITERALLY nobody else there needed it.  NOBODY, that's the only reason I even agreed to loot it.  I am not focused on loot in the least bit, I am not the type of person that loots a God mask to upgrade from a 125 hp mask to a 150 hp mask, I only bring it up to defend myself from the allegations you are springing and being proven wrong about.<br>
<br>
The reason you need to discuss things, is because whenever I claim something, I make sure I can prove it - IE have members of your own guild that would back up everything I say as the truth, when you do, you just spout lies then get caught on them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=taranna>Taranna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>HiElf Snob</span><br>  Posts: 835<br> <font color=#333333>(6/24/03 3:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: requesting consideration for lower level guild rotations</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.alcofielen.com/pics/forumpics/owned/ownedbull.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

HMn plus the post from Draaxx regarding Number 1. HMNnnn else you are totally stupid or you didnt get the point. Mearis indeed your stink also, so dont act like it doesnt, thx.<br>
<br>
Number 2 - Just ask Loh, how someone threated war to CN for hanging with us at their turn with King tromax<br>
<br>
Number 3 - You failed to read, i answered that 1 out 6, also Kilying / Dermel was present at any and all slaying cuz i cant do it alone. Please learn to read the earlier posts before posting again, thx you sir. Np.<br>
<br>
Number 4 - Just take that example and add the endless times when your guild got items from our raids / my events. and you will see that indeed you got more then you fair share, thx sir =). Question got answered already earlier too. Mind to read before repeating meaningless phrases. that already lost their weight.<br>
<br>
Number 5 - How about the tell at the ring war then when you wanted to roll with me for the Ring and i told you its not a Caster ring? Insert here endless Complains from you how we handled loot and how you got to short. i think you got more then a fair share. and it doesnt matter at all, cuz loot is completly meaningless to me.<br>
<br>
You arent bad at all .. just spread out some more propaganda Mister Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf errrrrrrrrrr Mearis. note .. the M in the both Names, to much simlar. <br>

Anyhow i am sorry your empty phrases dont apply to me. Goodbye sir, this is like argumenting with a retard. once you are able to read, we can continue this discussion. Btw, you still own me 2 hours of my life when we had a nice irc chat and talked about all those problems and seemed to found a solution. Now you digging out the old dirty wash you made ~ 2 Month ago?

Reverant resisted a rotation as long as they could, and when we finally agreed to one with Tremor, things went very smoothly, I'll freely admit that Pinaduz tanked a great deal of mobs with SoD, but he always did it with the blessing of his guild, because he was with friends.<br>
<br>
2 -Tetzou, SOMEONE might have threatened war to CN, but it sure as hell wasn't me or SoD, how the heck am I responsable for that?  So, because someone with no association to me, threatend war on CN, I am somehow responsible?<br>
<br>
3 - You got a hell of a lot more than a few.  How many do you think is a few, 2, 3?  Go on, tell me how many is a FEW zlandicar.<br>
<br>
4 - Guild got endless items on your raids?  Hell, Pinaduz, Cerien and Tomza got more stuff with SoD, than SoD ever got with AD, and they hardly got enough loot to repay them of their help, expecially Pinaduz and Cerien.  People are very happy to help your guild in general, because most of your guildmates are very nice people, and its wonderful to help friends get stuff, you are the exception.<br>
<br>
5 - The ring war was announced that it was going to be randomed.  You have all the logs, post the logs from KD that says we are going to GD to do Tetzou's ring war, in the end if I wanted too I could have INSISTED on rolling for it, instead I passed on it right away with zero fuss, and dragged along the rest of my guild.  I didn't insist at all, as soon as you asked I agreed to pass on it, because it was silly that I'd get it.<br>

Tetzou, I told you this once, and I am going to tell you again.  Stop while are you are still behind - its not gonna get any better, I promise.<br>

enough is enough already<br>
the bottom line is, everything i said in my very first reply on the matter is our stance<br>
<br>
I realize you want to plead your case to change our minds here, but we're just not going to be: 1) joining your rotation or 2) discontinue killing mobs on that list<br>
<br>
So, that leaves us at treating them like we treat them, ffa.<br>
<br>
I know we've talked about this in game, I know I've given you our stance, you've been given your little platform to whine about it but for real.. sometimes you need to know when to stop.<br>
