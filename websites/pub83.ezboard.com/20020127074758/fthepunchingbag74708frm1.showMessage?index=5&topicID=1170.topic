What kind of exploitation? Cuz I think that kind of statement is a bit general. I used to exploit every night.. sometimes multiple times a night. Did I mean to? No.. but if that damn deep orange mob is too stupid to come outta the pond while I hit it.. or what about when the mobs exploit me? Hittin me through the walls like they used to love to do. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I dont condone exploitation, but the fact is, they sure made it damn near impossible not to during the first few months. If they got banned for some simple shit like that.. I'd raise all hell, and maybe threaten class action like one of pictures intoned. Not to sound like a conspirer but if they got banned, I'd imagine its cuz they were all pissed and definately showing it in front of the gm's. I know I would if they handed my 100k for losing stuff even at my low level. Thank goodness as a ma, we dont have to worry nearly as much about losing ql200 weapons.<br>

Dude they didn't force you attack mobs that couldn't hit back. You did that because you wanted to level really fast. I'd probably have done the same, but I'd also accept that banning is a very real risk.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I don't think their logs are good enough to trap things like that.<br>

Once again, thats a blanket statement, only i find offense in it. I dont/didn't seek out mobs that are in water so i can exploit them. But with the possibility of tokens being based on how many mobs you kill or how much exp you get during the mission.. what you want me to pass him up? So YES THEY DO FORCE ME TO!! I'm guessing youve never been rooted in a spot where you could hit the mob but they couldnt hit you? Wouldnt that be exploitation? I've had it happen to me. Gawsh, maybe i should have turned off my attack and waited till root wore off, so we could put up our fists and duke it out like civilized gentlemen trying to kill each other. pfffft<br>
<br>
Where do you get off assuming you know what my intentions are when I run a mission? Since we're assuming now, I'll assume you didnt mean any harm by it and leave it alone. Just dont assume anymore.<br>

<br>
 I am an exploiter! Here is the list of ways i cheat, condemn me at will<br>
<br>
A. I token farmed, had 30 tokens at lvl 8 from doing missions and terminating before i lvled<br>
<br>
B. I click on treatment centers more then once to buff my treatment by hundred upon hundreds of points<br>
<br>
C. I carry seperat implants which i use soley to put on better armor then take off after i have the armor on...if u look at this from a role playing stance i ripped out the implants in my chest put on armor ripped it back out and put in the old one...all within 2mins..OUCH THAT MUST RLY HURT<br>
<br>
D. After lvling i hit /terminate when i want to go home...how in hell can you say the game is meant to be played that way...YAY i just lvled i think i will...SHOOTM MYSELF IN THE FUCKING HEAD<br>
<br>
E. If i see an item in the store that is VERY rare i will buy it and resale it on the open market for more then i payed<br>
<br>
I'm sure i do more then just those basic ones WHICH I BET 99% OF ALL OF YOU DO AND IF U DEFEND THEM AS ACCEPTABLE THEN I REFUSE TO EVEN LISTEN TO YOU CONDEMING OTHERS.<br>
<br>
This is my THRID ma character, what i've determined from the first 2 is not that i should play my character how it appears that it should be played, or in theory how it could be played but instead USING every means i can to do a little bit more dmg have a little bit more ac ect ect....<br>
<br>

That I've done all that, but some I have, and nearly everyone I know has too. The fact of the matter is, theres several instances that nearly force you to do some form of simple exploitation.  I've personally witnessed the NT's in mort casting their ae's  on themselves to hit 2 and 3 30 plus leveled monsters through walls who wouldnt or couldnt strike back. Whatever, I'd never do it, and I dont condone it, but I certainly cant point a finger and say im mister innocent if pressed by the 'rules' of the game. <br>
Hell, that would negate the use of BwT while trying to break the main room.. ( hit with BwT and zone while the mob gets worked over by the dot). They cant zone out to hit me.. so I guess I'm just as bad. I suppose I could prolly take monsters this way if i wanted to, hoping I dont shift fail.<br>
<br>
<br>
I wont condemn anyone due to the circumstances of the game at this point. I'll give Verant credit, they certainly make alot of this moot.<br>
<br>
Getting back to the original argument, I definately wont condemn those mentioned, who prolly got screwed over by some 12yo l33t hacker d00d who managed to get into Funcom's already screwed servers. They were exploiting??? What.... did they use the treatment exploit? Who knows, we dont, so I wont condemn them, nor shall i believe, if they truly were banned, thats why the 'com banned them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This could be the one that opens up the can o'worms and forces the 'com to put it all into writing (beyond the eula) or actually fix the bugs (yeah right <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

<br>
That's a very minor example of the term &quot;exploit&quot;, and I would think if they wanted to ban people for that sort of thing they'd have no players left.<br>
<br>
No, bannable exploits would include duping cash, award boards, tokens, that sort of thing.  Their logs won't tell them the mob you killed couldn't defend itself, but it sure as heck will tell them you went from 100k credits to 200k in 1 second.<br>

The fact remains, we dont have any clue what the 'Com might have used as an example of exploitation to get them banned. I dont believe that theyd use something small like that against you or I. My point is, with those screenshots, its pretty plain to see how the people reacted, and how they voiced their opinions. The 'com could have used anything, and justifiably so, to get them banned. If they wanted to..  Thats a bit of conjecture I suppose.. but if someone screamed and insulted you, enough to really raise your ire, and you knew they had broken the rules, however small, wouldnt you use that? Most people probably wouldnt, but really, how well do we know the 'Com nowadays? <br>
<br>
heheh I suppose I sound like somewhat of a theorist now.. I guess the same could be said about verant.. this coming from a guy who worked there and knew most of kunark team. But how well do we know those companies.. especially one thats floating along iceberg filled waters in a boat... err nm you get the inference.<br>
<br>
I'm interested in seeing the followup if they truly did get banned. <br>

<br>
<br>
but on a ligher note<br>
<br>
the question we should be asking our selves is not ARE we exploiting but are the npc's exploiting!!!!<br>
<br>
npcs have unlimited heal, they can lag kill you in one hit, they can still turn invincible, they can c you before you can c them and chase you down and kill you no matter what your lvl<br>
<br>
grays can kill u easily...........HOW can a gray kill you?!?! <br>
<br>
SIMPLE THE NPC'S IN THIS GAME EXPLOIT I CALL UPON COM TO REVIEW THAT ACOUNTS OF ALL THEIR MONSTERS AND BAN ALL OF THEM FOR EXPLOITING<br>

I think that's a VERY sad argument there.  I mean, they've got their share of problems, and I am FAR from a fan-girl -- but this is like kids bickering in the playground.<br>
<br>
We don't, and never will, know all the facts.  If they got banned for exploiting, they got banned for exploiting. Fact of the matter is, those players HAD to have done something wrong to deserve it.  'Com can't just make up an argument... they'd potentially face a lawsuit for doing such things (although I haven't read the user agreement and I think ANYONE who sues a game company is rediculously misaligned).<br>
<br>
Get over it.  Play or don't play -- bitching about things is terribly unbecoming.<br>
<br>
*ching* Two cents.<br>

I just wonder if it was really a player exploiting or a drunk gm being an idiot. I know they deny its a real gm, but hmmmmm. Espcially as one of the guys their confessed to being given knight armor by a GMJonez a couple of days before.<br>
<br>
The fact he was trying to role play killing all the omnis as well makes you wonder.<br>
<br>
The funniest thing is that hobbit idiot - the one who said he'd quit over it except hes a professional games player and earns his living from it. He's also the guy who is trading creds for delivery food on the AO-Basher news page. Wonder if we could slip him some poison in it.<br>
