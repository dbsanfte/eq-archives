I actually don't hold anything against you.<br>
But!<br>
I have to ask you this...<br>
<br>
Did you leave PB because you didn't like the leadership or something like that, like for example: you didn't like someone, or some people in guild?<br>
Or was it the &quot;start over&quot; over and over again, that got too much?<br>
<br>
Or...was it only because of loot issues?<br>
<br>
If you left because you had problems with someone, or some people or whatever, I understand you, otherwise I don't.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S - Kuerten if you are online pls send me a tell? kthx~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ukhanen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>khanen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(3/5/02 9:50:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: 2 Questions @ Kuerten</span><hr size=1> admit it! you fell for my joke and thought ah well I´ll go join too!

hah I seriously hope not but sad to see you go and I really didnt think you would join AD after all. NO hard feelings tho but I really have to get manaburn now cause all those hp gonna get slow.<br>
<br>
At first I got really dissapointed but whatever you feel like doing and if it´s right to you, just do it. If you dont like it, drop it and move on. I havent played much lately so dont know what´s been going on.<br>

<br>
As for kuerten himself. What did u expect? He doesnt play the game the way most of you do. He played fair and honorably even when his enemies did not. He talked to people, was very friendly, yet all you guys can do is bash him...<br>
<br>
I have seen your private boards, where he posts strats and worked really hard for you guys, yet you insult him, and call him a betrayer... All this time he has stuck by you guys, and you insult him.<br>
<br>
Take a look around, I didnt get private access to pb boards from kuerten.. I got it from some punk who believed in selling out his guild for a shot somewhere else. Something i know Kuerten would never do. <br>
<br>
The boy has honor, and you guys kick him down... F you guys who do so.<br>
<br>
If someone like Kuerten wishes to leave PB, then maybe its PB that has a problem...losing one of their most loved members. Its sad to see, but yet again, im happy that he doesnt have to deal with the crap that i viewed daily on ur boards.<br>
<br>
If u wish to continue downing Kuerten, I will be forced to become Biguss Nazi and editing ur posts or out right banning you from this board...

&quot;Kinda sad to see people who were once thought of as friends of kuerten come to this thread and bash him... &quot;<br>
<br>
Kind of like it's sad to see your guildmate of almost a year defect to the opposing side?  What did you expect us to do, wish him well?  If we were on a blue server, that's one thing, but we fight a daily battle against AD, and Kuerten made the decision that he wanted to join the enemy.  I can't blame my guildmates for not accepting it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have seen your private boards, where he posts strats and worked really hard for you guys, yet you insult him, and call him a betrayer... &quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe because he is a betrayer?  How the hell can you argue that?<br>
<br>
&quot;Take a look around, I didnt get private access to pb boards from kuerten.. I got it from some punk who believed in selling out his guild for a shot somewhere else. Something i know Kuerten would never do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lol.  &quot;..selling out your guild for a shot somewhere else.&quot;  Read the thread, bud.  That's what Kuerten just did.  He was fully geared by PB with uber items by RZ standards.  (Claw of Lightning?  There can't be more than 10 of those on the server.  Full SS armor, and then almost full KD?  etc.)<br>
<br>
If Kuerten didn't like PB, that's 100% cool with me.  PB isn't for everyone.  He should have said his goodbyes and left the guild.  Instead of saying jack-shit, he comes and posts here that he wants to join our #1 enemy.  If you don't think that's going to spark a little hatred, you're sadly mistaken.<br>
<br>
A lot of people, including myself, are pretty hurt by this.  I've personally fought in many wars to protect the ideals of PB, and one of the people I was protecting just pissed in my face.  I'm not going to insult Kuerten for his decision, but to say I'm not affected would be inaccurate.<br>

<br>
Ill resay what i said before... ON you OWN private boards, I saw noone more actively tryin to help you guys with strats and stuff THEN kuerten. Always posting stuff from other sites bout how to do this and that. He took plenty of items from you guys, yes. But also was a big influence to making u guys a more successful bunch.<br>
<br>
I completely understand being hurt, but coming here the way some of you guys are and just outright fist fucking him isnt called for on MY boards. Thats more of something for your own boards. <br>
<br>
And in his own defense, he is tryin to join your enemies, but WHO isnt an enemy of PB? Noone, so that leaves him with nowhere to turn to cept in the hands of your enemies. He obviously has tried his ass off to make pb work, and im sure doesnt wanna quit the game just cuz he doesnt wanna be in one of the most hated guilds on the server. <br>
<br>
Its your own reputation that leaves your members with no avenues to turn to. Some of you are perfectly fine with that, but others just arent fit for your guild's ways.<br>
<br>
Anyways, enuff bout this, just take the kuerten bashing back to you own boards, it serves no purpose here.  <p><img src="http://www.users.qwest.net/~njcogswell/bigusssig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uawfalxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>awfalxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Justin Timberlake</span><br>  Posts: 326<br> <font color=#333333>(3/6/02 10:26:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> &quot;uber items by RZ standards - Claw of Lightning?&quot;<br>

guys are racist.talk racist trash.speak<br>
racist trash.you should think more.<br>
&quot;there only have bad *Taiwan* guild.<br>
but not all player from *Taiwan* are bad&quot;.<br>
<br>
Kuerten are my friend.even we don't at<br>
same server but we had e-mail a lot.when <br>
PB are PoF before that already *don't* have <br>
leadership.never see a good strategy at there.<br>
only those player who come from cyber-net shop <br>
control whole guild.when I play at Rz before.<br>
only I saw at guildchat on PoF or PB are&quot;Gann&quot; <br>
&quot;No song&quot; &quot;G8 be killed&quot;.Kuerten try to find some<br>
good information and strategy from everywhere.<br>
but what PB do to him?they laugh him.don't believe<br>
him and keep *Gann* etc etc.that only reason PB<br>
can do Ntov all becasue Caplayca know one RL<br>
friend from Los at Luclin server.so they can pull.<br>
know what sport can kill.but I saw they fight before.<br>
that's CHOAS.a JOKE.many of their rog don't know<br>
how to control aggro.and just like at guildchat said<br>
*I am God.I just BS 1200 dmg*.than you see him dead<br>
when em 90% HP.many of old PoF member still think<br>
this game are *old like two years ago*.there only<br>
have *uber pker*.but don't have any good membership.<br>
they don't have strategy.many member don't know how <br>
to do when fight.Kuerten keep trying to teach them.but<br>
noone listen him.very sad.they only know use weapon<br>
push *auto-attack* and cast spell &gt; &lt;<br>
<br>
Stop talk like children.Kuerten deserve get what he could<br>
loot.he not only a good warrior.but also have very good<br>
information.and know how to learn *new*.<br>
<br>
PB are history.with those leadership they are going down.<br>
when you try to blame Kuerten think about yourself first.<br>

Racist is really different than that.What we are complainning about lot of PB peoples is they cant play with fair rules...their policy is...if we can do something(train,corps camp,bind camp, hack, cheat, bind in a wall, etc etc), allowed or not, they will, it s that making us keep killing them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ukuertenii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kuertenii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#333333>(3/7/02 6:12:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: to choose or not to choose that's the question to yourse</span><hr size=1> Josheb i think you only believe what webe pizz azrayl said in guildchat.<br>

they seem to always forget that AD is very diverse in cultures, coming from ALL over the world. Just ignorance on a few of their members parts who claim racism over and over. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uavih8r.showPublicProfile?language=EN>avih8r</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#333333>(3/7/02 7:30:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=116.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Awfal, just for the record, &quot;uber&quot; is a subjective term.

That's one step up from correcting someone's grammar in a post.<br>

Kuerten, please don't feel like I hold anything against you in RL.  If I met you, I would treat you the same as I would have 30 days ago -- as a good friend.  If I see you in game, however, I will kill you.  You betrayed our guild to try and join our enemy, and there's not too much you can do to change that.<br>

When I have a mission, it consumes me; I will not be satisfied until the job is done. I have a strong sense of duty, and a strong sense of direction. Changes in the tide don't phase me - I always know which way the wind blows, and I know how to compensate for it. I get on poorly with people like myself. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>
