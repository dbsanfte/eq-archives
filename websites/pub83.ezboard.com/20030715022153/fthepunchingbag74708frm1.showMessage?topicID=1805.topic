<br>
What skills should I invest in? I mean, I'm only lv10,<br>
so I max all base stats, brawl, dimach, and MA. I also<br>
max all of my evades, and runspeed. I mean to ask:<br>
What nano skills do I want to invest in? MA nanos <br>
need sooo many different types of skills, much like agents.<br>
<br>
Of course, there's comp lit, and such... oh! What about<br>
nano resist? Does it help at all? As an agent, no one<br>
stood a chance against a few good roots... they all stuck.<br>
<br>
Also, I'd like to know about MA weapons. They ADD to<br>
our damage, right? But do they also add special attacks<br>
as well, am I correct? I'm not to informed when it comes<br>
to those, but here's my idea on the subject.<br>
<br>
This is a ex-agent giving MA's tips.. so it may not be too <br>
great, but hey... my heart's in the right place!<br>
<br>
If we equip MA weapons, why not use range increasers?<br>
I mean, we'll want to max perception, and conceal, now<br>
anyway, or at least I will, so why not raise.. I forget the<br>
ONE trade skill involved? SO what if you get a good 3-4% crit<br>
increase from lower QL LLS's? Two skills cost more than ONE.<br>
<br>
It's only at higher lv's that they are really valuable. Also, perception is easily buffed, as well as the trade skill. Eagle Eye gives +120.. or was it 180? You can range inc 22, probably, by lv50, and perhaps even more, if I am correct. In theory, and remember please that I have a feeble understanding of MA life, increase our range BIG TIME, and meet the 40M cap, making roots somewhat of a joke. <br>
<br>
Am I right, or wrong?<br>
<br>
For the most part, I'd like just general tips, and info on <br>
MA weapons, that thank god, I don't have to OE. I have<br>
a 67 agent, and a 51 trader.. and a 47 soldier. Weapon<br>
classes have me burnt out on over equipping.. it's nuts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=yasunori>Yasunori</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#660000>(3/16/02 8:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1805.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Oh, another thing...</span><hr size=1> Is parry worth a damn?

<br>
Maxed out -<br>
MA:  from what I've read MAs want to stick with there fist till they're near 100.  As I'm still able to solo most low red mobs have seen no reason to change this.<br>
<br>
Brawl:  see above<br>
<br>
Dimach:  kept this maxed till around level 30.  After 30 I found it's hard to spend the IPs on it for as much as I use it and the damage it does.  Might start raising it again when I find a Shen.<br>
<br>
Evades:  Mixed feelings.  They only seem to work vs Green and Grey MOBs and crits.  Some people say they work against reds, more say they don't.  I suppose it all depends on your skill.  Wouldn't put any IPs into duck unless planning on PvP.<br>
<br>
Run:  Kept mine maxed till got it up to 250 in skill.  Found I can outrun most things if needed.<br>
<br>
Nano Skills:  I've only raised them when I was finnially able to cast the nano.  From what I've read, alot of people seem to think our AC buff line isn't worth the IPs you spend to get them.<br>
<br>
Comp Lit:  Raised this as soon as I've found some good NCUs to used.<br>
<br>
First Aid:  Nice to have but not really needed as MAs have healing Nanos.<br>
<br>
Treatment:  NEEDED - I've found I've almost always raised this just so I can squeeze into that higher level implant.<br>
<br>
Parry:  Only raised this so I could use the BwT MA special attack<br>
<br>
Repost:  Haven't touched it.  Think it's broke.<br>
<br>
Nanoresist:  Been keeping this maxed in the hope sometime it'll actually work.  Might reset this skill with the IP reset, haven't decided.<br>
<br>
Stats:  I'm still trying to figure this one out.  Been keeping my green stats maxed, body development maxed, and dumping a few into my nanopool.  Raise the others when I need to get into that nice armor or implant.  Also I try to preform a balancing act on raising them vs skill costs (INT is the big one here as it effects a lot of skills and sometimes it's cheeper to bump INT up 4 or 5 points then raising 2 or 3 skills).<br>
<br>
My 2 credits worth.  Interested in hearing what others have to say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umaxiusmanaburn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maxius Manaburn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~maxcool/usa.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#660000>(3/16/02 11:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1805.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.bellatlantic.net/~maxcool/usa.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IPs and where I spent them.</span><hr size=1> I like the above list however here are my suggested changes:<br>
Evades:MAX them when ever you can spare the IP, the cut to the crit you take makes it so worth the IP.<br>
First Aid: Try to keep this skill up I like to use standing nano kits so I can squeeze extra castings of healing in.<br>
Nano Skills:Figure out what line of nano's your going to cast then raise, there is ton of debate on AC nano's, I use them so ppl don't, you will want to use the Force of Destruction line now that they fixed it and you will want the Crit line and healing line. <p><img src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~maxcool/Finaesig.gif" width="298"

They *do* work, and they are *definitely* worth the IP.  With our new and improved damage, you WILL draw aggro, so keep these maxxed.  You'll be glad you did.<br>
<br>
First Aid:  Spend as needed to squeeze into the next NANO stim, then use your heal nanos.<br>
<br>
Treatment:  Best to just keep it maxxed.  Implants are VITAL for MAs, since it is the only way we can overequip.<br>
<br>
Comp Lit:  MAX.  You'll need all the NCU you can get to keep up the bajillion of MA self-buffs.  Trust me.  And get some specialized Comp Lit implants and use them every 5 levels or so to keep your belt and NCU modules up to date.<br>
<br>
Nano Skills:  My (humble) opinion on the MA nano lines, listed by priority:<br>
 1) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> BM and SI:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Heal line, &quot;Fists&quot; line, AND Force of Destruction line [&quot;Crash of Thunder&quot;, et al]<br>
 2) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> PM, T&amp;S, SI:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Crit Line, Self-buff line like Dirty Fighter &amp; MA Mastery (PM, SI), &quot;Elusive&quot; line (PM, SI)<br>
 3) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> MM, BM:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  &quot;Muscle&quot; line (only really useful to self buff into armor/implants, and doesn't stack with doctor str buffs)<br>
 4) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> MC and BM:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  AC line (don't bother...)<br>
<br>
I say don't bother with the AC line, since MC is ONLY used for this nano line (and &quot;Cohort&quot; and &quot;Horde&quot;, which are useless AND broken atm).  The meager AC boost is not worth the IP expense, IMHO.  Let the engineer in your team buff your AC, and use your IP to raise STATS which will help you get better armor on.  Basic Tech/Flowers Tech armor is one of the best in the game, and is easy for MAs to equip (Agil/Str) since Agil should always be maxxed and Str is very easy to buff.  Add a Decus coat and your AC will not be an issue.  'Nuff said.<br>
<br>
You can get Sub G at level 28-30 pretty easily with careful IP allocation and aggresive implants.<br>
<br>
Always max Int.  It boosts a LOT of other important skills, and quickly pays for itself.<br>
<br>
Nanoresist is broken, IMHO.  Don't bother.  Even with &quot;even&quot; NR versus the nano skills used to root you, you will still get rooted 75% of the time.  In PvP, 1 root is pretty much = death.  In PvM, you'll be on top of them before they root you, so just break the nano after the fight with a self debuff (still works).  And if you fight orange/red mobs (as most do), you'll counter maybe 1 offensive nuke nano out of 500, so save your IP until they revamp the NR formulae.<br>
<br>
I'd also hold off on concealment until after the new &quot;invisibility&quot; patch is in.  It might be fun in PvP then, but until then it won't be very useful.  You'll never really get it high enough to sneak a high level mission effectively (compared to your agent), and your MA could CLEAR the mission much faster by simply killing all the mobs rather than creeping through it....so you get loot PLUS xp. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Use a low light scope but only if you can keep your Phys Init above 120 or so.  You want the + to crit %, but don't slow down your fist attack speed.  &quot;Range increase&quot; for melee is barely noticable, and won't help your MA special attacks as far as I can tell.<br>
<br>
MA Special Attacks:  Use Bird of Prey until the low 30's, at which point you can start using Blessed with Thunder with lots of Parry IP and Parry implants.  BwT rocks the house for about 60 levels until Shen.  All other MA special attacks are broken (sad, isn't it?).<br>
<br>
I'd hold off on weapons until after level 75 or higher.  You won't need them, and can use the IP elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

Good point.<br>
<br>
Of course, level 30 chars could always get a higher level alt or friend to roll a BwT mission for them, and then help them complete it for the new attack.<br>
<br>
But, yeah...it will be damn tricky for a level 30 to complete a level 55+ mission.  (I think Q55 was my first BwT, if I recall correctly...)<br>
<br>
Rumor has it that BwT will &quot;supposedly&quot; be returning to stores after the next patch.  But I'm not sure whether I believe that or not.  You never know with FunCom...<br>

But it's the only MA special attack I've noticed which has this problem.  The damage, however, is not unbalancing, so FunCom has pretty much left it alone.  Or maybe they're just lazy, since they've left all of the currently &quot;broken&quot; MA special attacks alone, too...<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my second point.  All of the other MA special attacks (Angel of Night, Flower of Life, Bright Blue Cloudless Sky, etc) are pretty much useless.  Either they are completely broken (Flower of Life actually damages YOU AND the mob, rather than healing the MA like it should), or the effect/damage is useless compared to the list of useful attacks (below), or they lock the related skill for so long that it is not worth using at all.<br>
<br>
It's a shame, because having a full arsenal of MA special attacks would be nice, and would add a certain tactical challenge to each fight:  Flower of Life to heal yourself if your health drops dangerously low in a tough fight, Bright Blue Cloudless Sky to stun the target every time, Angel of Night to drain the caster-target of vital nano points, etc.  But for now, the only viable attacks based upon effect, damage, and length of skill lock are:<br>
<br>
 Attack of the Snake (very low levels)<br>
 Bird Of Prey (sub level 30ish)<br>
 Blessed with Thunder (30ish to whenever Shen is usable)<br>
 Shen<br>
<br>
Naturally, this is all my personal opinion, so feel free to disagree...<br>
