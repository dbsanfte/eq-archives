<br>
first i would like to say I have started and been playing an MA since the game launched in US, took a break for a while and then continued.  when i first started the MAs were absolutely the most horrible profession in game, after about lvl 60 you couldnt even solo a low green con. then came some nice changes and then some more. i have stuck with it pretty much through thick and thin and i was hoping that by time i hit 200 or at least TL6, the prof would be fixed to the point where i would be able to enjoy all aspects of teh game on at least a semi-decent level. but that is juts not the case. after all this time FC has decided to revert us to practical nothingness again at the upper levels.<br>
<br>
MAs overall are still great at newbie levels 1-50, and do ok below 120 and in PvM. And I also know and realize that there are a ton of people that say they dont PvP, or dont plan to , etc. But let me tell you this, you will want to in the longrun, and you will be very very dissapointed with your character unless FC makes some really drastic changes in our favor. By the same token I have learned that whatever FC fixes, they shortly break thereafter. To hope that FC will come up with some decent solutions is a waste.<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind that the game is becoming more and more PvP oriented, and PvP will now have serious rewards as well as consequences on the gameworld. Do you want to be the person taht at least has a chance of geting some of those rewards ? Or do you want to be the person that always gives the otehr side the points to earn theirs ? For those that have played DoAC there is a term the people in that game came out with that perfectly suits MAs: &quot;RP Cows&quot;.<br>
<br>
In light of all this, and the hopelessness with regards to any feasible practical solutions forthcoming from FC, I advice you to all quit MAs, start another profession that is more usefull. There  has been lots of testing done with his, and MAs now not only get completely owned in duels, but are utterly useless in team PvP as well. In fact, they are so bad now taht it is better to kick em out of group to be replaced with virtually any other prof.<br>
<br>
if you like to see the details on some of this, why is it so horrible, and what the numbers are, etc., feel free to visit the official MA board <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://forums.anarchy-online.com/forumdisplay.php?s=6b71099983a1eb9991b9d753d36a24e6&forumid=165">forums.anarchy-online.com...orumid=165</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> scroll down some pages if the posts arent on top. its all there.<br>
<br>
so please support our cause by sending e-mails to FC, or cancelling your account. if you are new, at least do yourself a favor and dont waste time on MA. play a doc enf or trader, we need more of those anyways in light of the 50% population being fixers lately and tradeskills coming more into play ahead of us.<br>

It's been proven three times now (EQ, DAoC, AO) and you cannot combine and balance PvM and PvP. It's simply not possible as things are understood right now in MMRPGs. <br>
<br>
I still enjoy playing my MAs, especially my nanomage. I've slacked off a lot lately do to the mess known as 14.6.0 and PSO GC. <br>
<br>
My main complaint is we're now beginning to see some serious feature creep with the coming of 14.6 and Notum Wars. Previous experience in EQ would suggest that this is NOT good. Time will tell. <br>
<br>
I'll play until I can't stand the way things work. Not there just yet, but I keep a jaundiced nose out for anything even remotely smelling of the stench of creeping featurism. <br>
<br>

No holes barred, MAs were the worst of all of the ones I tested. And with the advent of Notum, PvP is becoming more and more needed, esp if you are in a guild and wish to participate in it's activities. So I agree with the previous two posters......MAs have a bleak future in AO unless something is changed within the realm of PvP.<br>

Since NW is focusing upon group fights, an MAs crit dependent ass is no longer a prevalent thing you should be worried about.<br>
<br>
Yes, we do a LOT less damage in pvp now, but we still crit more often than other classes since we have uber crit buffs. If you throw in the fact that the damage being dealt will be thrown out by 6 people at a time, then the fact that we don't do as much as other folks won't be really noticed.<br>
<br>
I'd thought of giving up on my MA once 14.6 was released and they were touting the NW horn, until a guildmate told me that I should stop thinking of 1 on 1 fights and think of the largescale battles. THAT'S where the glory of the battlefield lay in the booster. In a place where our damage output is as much needed as the next persons.<br>
<br>
And if you try out NW and think an MA is still worthless in the pvp wars, then you'll just have to make a backup character that can get a super weapon on and see how well they do. <p>Bellerephon<br>

Personally, I can't see where I made much of a difference dmg wise in the grand scheme of things. I was actually more useful in a healing/support role....until the other side figured it out, then BAM, lights out. My crits in these battles were sub par to say the least (although I admit, I reported more than many others that were fighting), and overall dmg was uninspiring compared to the bursts, aimed shots, and Full autos that were popping across my chat screen. Bottom line: We got gimped. Period. End of discussion as far as I'm concerned.<br>
<br>
Now with that said, I will admit that the beta is probably not the best place to really determine how well MAs will do in massive PvP battles. Everyone in beta is lvl 200 with ql 200 imps, all prof nanos, and the best (and most rare) armor, weapons, and support gear available in the game. You won't see that everyday on Live Servers. BUT if MAs don't fare well in the most optimal setting that they can be in, how do you think they are gonna fare on the Live servers? Not well. See end sentence of first paragraph.<br>

<br>
It's great that you have resigned yourself to doing far less damage than pretty much every other class, but not all of us are as pleased with our new role as &quot;cannon fodder&quot;.  We would rather be able to actually impact the battle besides simply filling up position #6 in the team.  And that's assuming your guildies are nice and don't have another profession available to fight in that slot...cuz if they do, guess what?  You won't be in it.<br>
<br>
When the entire guild is reliant upon their tower(s) for the bonuses, there will soon be a return of the same issue we had when MAs were doing puny minimum damage against mobs in PvM...we will be passed over when teams are forming in favor of someone who can actually do damage in combat.  Go figure.  I'm going to presume you simply weren't around yet when that problem meant hours of standing around yelling &quot;LFG&quot;, and only being accepted into a team because no one else was available and (at that time) our regular crit buffs were castable on others and we were expected to sit back and spam team heals.<br>
<br>
I, for one, would prefer not to rely on pity from my guildmates or be forced to play the role of backup combat nurse and MoP buffer to keep me in a PvP team.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Yes, we do a LOT less damage in pvp now, but we still crit more often than other classes since we have uber crit buffs.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Er, no actually...we DON'T.  Let's look at the facts for those who are using crit reliant weapons (take the ever-popular Ithaca shotgun, for example), and let's include the forthcoming scope nerf for us melee types, and assume all outside buffs possible (which is pretty much <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>de rigueur</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in PvP now anyway):<br>
<br>
PvP MA: 3% crit base, 24% UVC, 4% Take The Shot = 31% critical = 16% crit in PvP<br>
PvP Non-MA: 3% base, 15% scope, 7% Mark of Peril, 4% TTS = 29% crit = 15% crit in PvP<br>
<br>
Wow, I do 1% more crits in PvP!  Yaay!<br>
<br>
And if you wanna play the &quot;most players...&quot; game, such as &quot;most players won't HAVE a 15% crit scope!&quot;  OK, most MAs won't be able to cast UVC until level 193.  So let's look at the numbers using a Vision Enhancer/LMA in the mix:<br>
<br>
PvP MA: 3% crit base, 19% LMA, 4% TTS = 26% critical = 13% crit in PvP<br>
PvP Non-MA: 3% crit base, 8% VE, 7% MoP, 4% TTS = 22% critical = 11% crit in PvP<br>
<br>
I don't consider +2% crit all that &quot;uber&quot;, especially when our regular non-crit damage is so very very low.<br>
<br>
And let's not forget that the result of the recent PvP crit nerf is that most professions are now simply switching to newer NON-crit reliant weapons anyway, which do massive normal damage such as the X-3, Hellspinner, Manex Catastophe, and Queen Blade.  Well, guess what?  We MAs can't switch off our fists.<br>
<br>
The problem is based upon the fact that our fists are ABSOLUTELY crit-reliant.  A level 200 MA with a nearly 1200 attack rating will do, on average, about 250-350 pts with a normal hit in PvP.  Compare with an Enforcer with a beam hitting just as fast for an average of 3-4 times that at least, and let's not forget he has other Enforcer benefits (a ton more health than the MA, rage to ignore roots, etc).  It's only through our crits that we were viable in PvP at all.  And now they've taken that option away from us.  It is, after all, why increased critical chance is the class-defining ability of MAs.<br>
<br>
Face the facts...we're now the WORST profession for PvP in the game.<br>
<br>
To believe otherwise means you have either NEVER PvPed as an MA, or you are deluding yourself.<br>

All lvl 200, running their own respective buffs (no outside buffs), mostly the same equipment (Azure armor, crit scopes if they were provided, Globes of Suffering, custom prof rings, best ql weapons provided....blah, blah, blah, you get the point), and with every &quot;combat&quot; profession the MA got owned in dmg output. <br>
<br>
Yes, the MA got more crits on the average, but that dmg was nothing compared to the bursts, full autos, and enforcer brawls. Fixers, Soldiers, Enforcers, Agents, and NTs (I didn't make any pet caster profs or traders) ALL had much more superior dmg outputs than the MA. If other prof buffs had been added then the result would have been even more lopsided against MAs. Sorry, but with PvP becoming ever increasingly important to the game, MAs are left holding the short end of the stick.<br>
<br>
Even with MA weapons being used, most profs were able to outdmg MAs. Crits WERE our balancing feature in PvP....now we are just sad again.<br>

Did anyone else notice the staggering injustice that the Agent self-only crit nanos, such as &quot;Utter Concentration&quot;, were doubled from a 100% to 200% crit chance to allow them to completely ignore the 14.6 changes in PvP?

Martial Artist <br>
  <br>
Added a new Martial Arts special attack, called &quot;Upon a Wave of Summer&quot;, existing at QL50-300. It uses riposte as main skill. It clears all Same QL snares and roots, and has a chance to stun the opponent. You will get a Run Speed and Nano Resist boost for ten seconds to either close with the opponent, or run away. It also snares the opponent up to 20 meters away. <br>
<br>
Who uses Riposte anyways? Just another sign that FC doesn't know what they hell they're doing with the classes. <p>Bellerephon<br>

Not to mention the fact that at later lvls we get a riposte buff (not that many ever saw a need for it until now possibly). The problem with riposte is that it has never really worked as a stand alone skill and not much better with reflection shields. The whole skill needs to be tweaked (as they promised to do months ago) to make it a viable MA skill worth spending IPs on. <br>
<br>
And speaking of tweaking.....I'd like to be able to parry 1/10th as good as these damn PvM mobs. Jeesh, they need to tone that down quite abit. It's unreal to watch your health steadily falling, while they are barely scratched because they have parried 4 out of your last 5 attacks (not in all cases and not against all mobs of course, but still it happens often enough to be detremental). Should I even get started on another rather uselss skill known as Nano resist? Nah, we'll save that for another bitch session.<br>
<br>
The game is teetering out of control again, after being rather stable and quite enjoyable for a few months. From what I've seen of the beta (And I can't divulge anything tasty as per EULA) only the biggest and richest orgs are gonna really benifit from it, with PvP being a very important aspect of the game (not to beat a dead horse, but did I mention we now REALLY suck at PvP?). I'm starting to see EQism creeping into the game now, and by the time the full expansion hits, you can pretty much bet that EQism will be full blown. FC is STILL, after 1 1/2 years of being Live, implementing huge game changing patches that seem to throw the game all out of whack. I don't forsee that changing anytime soon. For myself, I'm gonna play it as long as I can stand it then probably hit one of the new MMORPGs that will be coming out next year. What's a guy to do?<br>

Anyway, come join us in PSO, Crim. You have a Gamecube? Come to Antares 09-01 and name yourself Crimhawk. We'll put you to work, post-haste. Play a force. We androids need a force to love us, and care for us, and call us...ahh...nevermind.<br>

As for other MMRPGs, well, I'm very wary of those coming along. SWG looks...like Verant. Quotas on classes? What's up with that? They don't think that will cause truly epic powergaming/guild abuses? Insane. <br>
<br>
AC2 just looks, well, looks good, but that skill system is a flashback to Diablo 2. Dunno, but I think I've played this game before...a lot.<br>
<br>
Shadowbane will never ship, so enough said. <br>
<br>
EQ2...well...I'll play it, but I'll bet heavy coin we all know where that will end up...ahemLuclinahem...<br>
<br>
I think there's something fundamentally wrong with the MMRPG paradigm. Not sure what needs to be done here, but someone needs to think outside the box, because the inside sucks, bigtime.

I would also like to say that I am feeling like I did about 8 months ago, the first time I gave up on AO because my favorite proffesion was all screwed up and FC had no clue wtf to do about it. Worthless patch after worthless patch has screwed us MA's time and time again. Furthermore i think none of us at that time even knew what to do because we didn't know what FC was changing next, or if it would even work. Hell, I think it took the founding father of this board and this whole community to get their damn attention. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/character/bio/d/1/name/viirruss">Viirruss</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alectosf>AlectoSF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#660000>(11/22/02 6:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2154.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: advice for new MAs</span><hr size=1> SL = Shadowlands (remember this one?

PSO = Phantasy Star Online. Dreamcast online game similar to Diablo. Now an updated version playing on Gamecube. Fun stuff, but still like Diablo. Compared to MMRPGs these days, it's a pleasant environment, only marred by the occasional beggar and Nintendo's clumsiness in the new (heh, Sega did this two years ago, but it's still &quot;new&quot; to MS and Nintendo) online console market.<br>
<br>
And, agreed, FC pretty clueless these days. Just spent a few hours locating the new ENF vendor with the new weapons. Neat stuff there, but those reqs! Geeeez!! I cordially detest heavy weapons and mean to reset it, but these reqs are brutal. Doubt I can get the new swords on at anything near my present byom/rider combo. Course, new swords 20 levels lower are about same damage output...but still...ouch. Not to mention having to crank up yet another dark blue nano skill for the new 1he buffs that don't--quite--equal the old challenger. Hope that 100 extra ATK is going to be worth it.<br>
<br>
Still, it's something to do, I guess. Losing interest in AO with all the changes upsetting the system. See? There's the real downside of creeping featurism: frustration and confusion. This reminds me of Diablo v1.07 where Blizzard revamped the entire game system, rendering 75% of the characters online unplayable overnight. Smart move. If you wanted to play you had to buy Lord of Destruction to have a chance with the new rules against the revamped mobs. Sound familiar? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crimhawk>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Martial, Baby, MARTIAL.</span><br>  Posts: 450<br> <font color=#660000>(11/23/02 7:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2154.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: advice for new MAs</span><hr size=1> Heh, I have haven't even played my Live server MA in about 3 weeks.

I should have known SL was Shadowlands. PSO though, I haven't been keeping up with whats going on with console games, I haven't played em in years. The last console I bought was a Nintendo 64, lol.<br>
<br>
These last changes are driving me crazy. I have always loved my MA. I have never been a huge PvP'er, but I do enjoy it from time to time. I actually was excited to hear that the expansion was PvP oriented...until I found out that I am not worth a fart in a windstorm anymore. This whole riposte based attack item or whatever the hell it is, is flat out ridiculous. I wonder if it will even work right. My money is on something being seriously wrong with the way it works.<br>
<br>
I read somewhere that the changes to crit damage in PvP were to make the battles last longer and not just depend on who has the best weapon with the best crit chance and damage. Now, maybe I am wrong here, but this has been sort of the bread and butter of this game since release. We all came to terms with it, accepted it as the way the game was to be played, we all adapted to it, we all grew accustomed to it. FC made the game this way, and like many things, decided after the fact it wasn't how the game should be played. Everything they did in the last patch seems to cater to the new expansion Notum Wars, which unless someone at FC gets their head out of their ass, I will not be buying. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/character/bio/d/1/name/viirruss">Viirruss</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viirruss>Viirruss</A> at: 11/23/02 9:55:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jaqrabbit>Jaqrabbit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 180<br> <font color=#660000>(11/23/02 10:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2154.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/ccallahan3/radiohead.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: advice for new MAs</span><hr size=1> That new attack really boggles the mind.  It occurs to me that if FC wants to give us a way to break snares and roots, they should just throw it in with our controlled destruction nanos (Crash of Thunder, etc), kind of like the enforcers Rage line.  Maybe even set it up so that we're root immune for the duration of the nano debuff the destruction nanos put on us.  Granting root immunity (or massively raised nano-resist) for that time period would prevent other players from just rooting us again, but limiting it to only that period when we can't cast means there's a trade off for being un-rootable (you can't heal yourself).<br>
<br>
Instead, FC gives us an ability we obviously need in a badly flawed way.  Just a short list of how that attack is FUBARed:<br>
<br>
1)  It uses Riposte (obvious and covered), which is useless in and of itself.<br>
<br>
2)  Connected to Number 1, it's a skill that most MAs don't use, which means NEW IP expenditure, and it's QLs start right around the time the IP crunch gets really noticable.  So we're expected to start dropping points into Riposte just as we're strugginling through the 50s up to 100...  Yeah, that'll work just fine.<br>
<br>
3)  This will almost certainly lock MA skill, the same as the other MA attacks.  It will most likely (given FC's tendencies) lock MA skill for a good long while.  This means that after we use it, we can't use another MA attack, like Blessed with Thunder or Flower of Life until the skill unlocks.  Not only that, but we won't be able to use THIS attack again either, so unless the thing cycles in ten seconds, you're just going to get rooted again when it wears off, and then you'll have no way out of it.<br>
<br>
4)  Since FC decided selling MA attacks in the stores (or by players, for that matter) would be a bad thing, we'll have to mission for this, or hope for a lucky drop in a team mission, which limits the level of the attack you can use to probably less than the max level attack you could use (assuming you max riposte).  Root casters can buy their root or snare nanos in stores, a significant number of levels over their own.  So in all likelihood, rooters will have roots/snares that are higher QL than our copy of the attack if they're of the same level we are (particularly the primarily nano classes), so against same level nano-casters, we'll be incapable of cancelling a root, even with this attack, if it only cancels roots/snares of equal or lower QL.<br>
<br>
So, all in all, it looks like a fairly useless attack (although I'll grant #4 is kinda shaky and makes a lot of assumptions).  Switch the main skill to Parry (or MA skill, God forbid an MA attack should use MA skill as its primary), set the recycle at no more than 10 seconds, and make the attack available in the stores so we can buy an attack as high as we can use, and this might actually be worth picking up.  Otherwise, its value will be very low. <p>~Jaqrabbit<br>
&quot;It's a trick... Get an axe.&quot;<br>

So while you may break the first root, the +300 nanoresist for 10s (at Q200) will do little to simply prevent them from rooting you again (and they always do).  And then you are stuck for another 1:40 wishing you could go hit them for your pathetic 200pts of regular fist damage.<br>
<br>
The special attack is an interesting idea, but is (as usual) thoroughly useless as implemented.<br>
<br>
I was incredibly frustrated with this past weekend's series of colossal FunCom F*ck-ups on the live server: Bug-ridden 14.7.1 patched live on a FRIDAY, emergency patch applied shortly thereafter was COMPLETELY FUBAR, so bad that the database was ROLLED BACK immediately afterwards, another emergency fix on Sunday, and now another emergency fix today I think.  After 12.6, the president of the company wrote a letter to all AO gamers and PROMISED they would never patch on a Friday again.  They lied.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, MAs are still castrated when it comes to PvP, no one can break roots anymore (even in missions), you can't pull team missions in certain zones (like Newland City), and ill-conceived, half-witted and poorly implemented workarounds abound.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>This game is broken.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Again.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Anecdote #1 about how f*cked up AO was this weekend: Since playing my MA is pointless, I played my 95th Agent on Saturday.  Had a VERY hard time getting a team together, even in prime time.  &quot;Where is everyone?&quot; I foolishly thought.  (They had all quit AO for the weekend after getting frustrated, I later surmised.)  Finally got a team together of 90-110s after nearly an HOUR.  A cool new bug prevented ANYONE from pulling ANY missions in NLC: &quot;No missions available!&quot; it said.  As if we had been clicking &quot;Get missions&quot; too fast...but that was after only the first click. Same bug in Mort.  I eventually found a working team mission terminal in Stret West.  Got the mission.  Got the team into the mission.  For the next 90 minutes, everyone alternated going LD about every 10 minutes.  (I almost NEVER go LD with my DSL connection.  Since 14.7.1 I have crashed about 10 times.  And after 14.6, just zoning into Omni Trade or NLC or BS is torturous, and takes up to 60 FULL SECONDS until I can even move.  Before 14.6, it was only about 5-10 seconds.)  The team spent about 5+ minutes waiting around every 4th room when the mob would root us right before it died.  None of the &quot;root breaker&quot; items work.  At one point, TWO members were LD, so I asked the team if I could open some chests in rooms we had cleared while we waited for them to return.  &quot;Sure&quot;, I was told.  One chest was locked, and when I picked it open, everyone in the team LOST 34,000 xp.  &quot;You lost 34,000 xp&quot;, the game calmly announced to us all.  WTF?!?  Shortly thereafter, we all broke up.  To add insult to injury, after we broke up I went to my bank in NLC and checked on a bag of rifles I had been saving.  Immediately after I pulled it out of the bank, the server crashed.  5 minutes later when it came back up and I could log in, the bag had been eaten by the crash.  12-15 high level rifles...Gone.  And over 35 petitions in the queue in front of me.  I waited around for 45 more minutes and then logged off in disgust with 27 petitions still ahead of me.<br>
<br>
And they had just started doing well with things like team missions and boss camps and new static dungeons.  Oh, well.<br>
<br>
That nonsense coupled with the fact that MAs are now completely castrated in PvP prompted me to go buy an XBOX this weekend.  Man, it's amazing how fun it is to play a game that isn't broken!  Played some HALO and Splinter Cell, and enjoyed every damn minute of it.  No time lost working around stupid bugs.  Not once did I have to spend agonizing minutes &quot;dealing&quot; with stupid issues in-game (needless 5 minute roots in PvM).  No gametime lost due to a database rollback after a disastrous patch.  Nope.  Just FUN from the time I turned the console on.  I had forgotten what that's like.<br>
<br>
As a result, my friends and I have all decided to quit AO once our current month's subscription is up.  We've decided we like having FUN when we play games...and AO does NOT seem to want to accommodate that requirement any more.<br>
<br>
So I will no longer be posting regularly to this board, although I'm sure I'll check in with you all from time to time.  Good luck, all...and if you decide to stick it out with AO, you'll need it.<br>

I was just watching the video of EQ2 on the NVIDIA website (or maybe it was another website, can't remember) and the absoute beauty of the game is enough for me to want to give it a shot.....(even if it is EQ).

I'm sure we'll be seeing a mass exodus in the following weeks due to the jackasses leading this project.<br>
