<br>
First off, RK2 is more difficult. It has the attraction of being less crowded, and generally more friendly. But on the other hand it is harder to find buffs, teammates, and all the other stuff that makes this an MMORPG rather than just a single player RPG.<br>
<br>
Most of all, I cannot help you on RK1. By this I mean direct physical help as in equipment, credits, and escorts to places, etc.<br>
<br>
First off, the best site for general info today is <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.anarchyarcanum.com">www.anarchyarcanum.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
Starting your first character off, with no creds and no idea how the game works is HARD. On the other hand, you have picked the easiest class to do so with. The MA is a good, solid choice, with any race, at any level, on any dimension!<br>
<br>
If you want to start a character on RK1, look me up as Hildegaard, a L172 Omni Doctor. Try this -<br>
<br>
/tell Hildegaard Hello, this is yournamehere, from TPB!<br>
<br>
Catch me online, identify yourself as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  being from TPB</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and I'll help you out with some creds, equip, advice, etc. If I seem to ignore your first message, just send it again, or even a third time if need be. I'm probably just AFK, or missed your message in the battle-spam. Stuff on the console can fly by in a BIG hurry!<br>
<br>
For starts with mechanics, try the built-in help system. Type -<br>
<br>
/help<br>
<br>
Like that, and the system will reply with a list of specific subjects. then type -<br>
<br>
/help missions<br>
<br>
- or whatever the subject of your query is. This will get you most of the info you need on the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  basic</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mechanics of the game.<br>
<br>
Familiarize yourself with the GUI for starts. Look at the icons at the top right of the screen. You can click on them to open and close, or you can use (Ctrl-1) through (Ctrl-9).<br>
<br>
Next up, there are TWO maps available to you. the local map you toggle on and off with (Ctrl-6), and that one is precious for guiding you around cities.<br>
<br>
The other you toggle on and off with the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  P</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> key. This is a so-called &quot;Planet Map&quot;, and the stock one is about as useful as tits on a boar <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
When you're a bit more settled-in with the real basics, try Dovve's map upgrade, from <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://peacefairchild.tripod.com">peacefairchild.tripod.com</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. Dovve is a design architect by trade, and her graphic work is just exquisite. Installing this does, however, require making a directory, copying files, and that sort of real basic computer knowledge. On the up side, Dovve's map is not just sweet-looking, it is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  hellaciously</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> useful, in that the zoomed-out view shows you the whole wompa network.<br>
<br>
AO is a wonderfully, delightfully, infuriatingly complex game. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you howl in victory, and it will at times make you want to put your fist right through the monitor <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Although I did not beta, I've played AO since the 3rd day of US retail launch. That was over a year ago, and I am still learning stuff. Don't expect to master it in a week!<br>

<br>
This is the premier site for AO news, on a daily basis. It is also the home of the detail maps which I personally continue to use in spite of their being a bit dated. From the main page, look on the left menu for the &quot;maps&quot; link. Click on that to see a graphic layout of all the zones and cities in the game. Now click on the zone/city to take you to the page for that zone/city. Note the cities are those little blue squares.<br>
<br>
On that page will be a scribble of cryptic and mostly useless data, and usually 1-4 thumbnails of detail maps.<br>
<br>
Let's say you're looking for a shop in Omni-1 Trade, (commonly called just &quot;Trade&quot;). Click on the Maps link from the main page, look at the bottom of the map for the cluster of three little blue squares labelled Omni-1 Trade, HQ, and Entertainment (commonly called just &quot;Ent&quot;). Click on the top left one, labelled Trade. There are no less than 4 thumbnails on the Trade page, three of them useless! You want the dark one on the middle right, with the tooltip that says &quot;color shop map&quot;. Click on that and, HOLY JESUS, it's a map showing you where all those elusive goddam shops are at!<br>
<br>
As you will see, Trade boasts no less than *8* Basic Supermarkets. This was a big part of the reason why I bailed on clan long ago, and went Omni <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Your homework assignment, young jedi, is to compare this map with the local (Ctrl-6) in-game map, (run AO in a window, and Alt-Tab back and forth), and figure out which shape on the in-game map represents shops. It is almost always the same symbol, and once you recognise it, life gets a lot easier <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The above paragraph assumes that you're omni, and can get to Trade. If not, then you are excused ;p<br>

That means some woompa travelling. <br>
<br>
Since--assuming you're Clan as you should be--you'll be starting in Tir, you need to get outside and get the hell away from Tir. It's not a good town to learn your way around (or for much of anything else). Run outside, experience the lag, then look up for the tallest building in Tir. That's the (former) Council of Truth Hall, and the woompas are nearby. Head that way and home in on the very tall antennas. Find the woompa to Athen and bid Tir a hearty goodbye and good riddance. <br>
<br>
Athen used to be Omni-2, so it's similar to the big Omni cities. From the woompa, head up the hill behind it and get your bearings. There are three basic stores in Athen (one more in W Athen in Athen Shire). Head towards the intact towers to the right of the statues and you're on shopping row. The buildings there say &quot;shop&quot; on them to help out a bit more. First one is basice, second advanced, third superior, fourth general, fifth general, six superior, then the last three (and one around the corner) are a mix of basic and advanced. Just too make it really interesting, there are two Miir outlets on the very fringes of all this. Enjoy. <br>
<br>
As an aside, I too have played as Omni, and I can't stand Omni-T. It does have everything, including a very healthy dose of lag. Unfortunately, it all looks the same and I never have gotten a real handle on which shops are on which side of what. It's also usually about pitch black, due to the canyon effect of the highrises. A pox on Trade. I prefer Rome. <br>
<br>

The first 3 are the beginning of &quot;shop row&quot; as I call it. They start near the West Athen exit (You may actually start in W Athen sometimes, a couple of my alts have started there) and run in a row. After the big 3, you get a couple of &quot;special&quot; shops. On down from the special shops on the same row, you start running into the normal shops again. The 2nd basic shop is on the other side of the row, across from either the 2nd normal advanced or superior (can't remember which). This effectivly gives you 3 normal supermarkets in which to shop if you use W Athen shops (which is not far and only requires one zone change.<br>
<br>
I agree with Alecto on Tir and Omni 1/Ent......both are extremely confusing to get around in, especially for someone just starting out. Lag is also a huge issue in both zones. I'm not sure of the Omni mirror city to Athen...It may be Rome. Pubilus can direct you there. Old Athen and W Athen is the best place to put down roots if you are Clan though. Make sure you scan somewhere in Old Athen (even though technically you don't need to scan until lvl 20), as if you die you will be rezzed in Old Athen instead of the ent park where you first started. A nightmare, if you you are a noob to the world.<br>
<br>
A few other tips:<br>
1) Go ahead and grab your lvl 10 (or 20 if you can squeeze into them) implants...They are in your basic shops already assembled. They are not optimal, but they help in the lower lvls until you learn how to get your custom set built (that, my friend is another tutorial altogether).<br>
<br>
2) If you are going to use a weapon (ie. the claw, the only one worth a damn at lower lvls) go ahead and start using it now so that you can keep up with your skills early on. IPs are a major issue early on, so if you decide to start using a weapon at a later lvl it will be difficult to play &quot;catch up&quot; in the skills required.<br>
<br>
3) Bio met, Sense Imp, Psy Mod, Time&amp;Space and treatment are your main nano and aiding skills that you need to keep raised. First Aid is important, but not as much so as those other 5 skills. You might want to raise Mat met to 108 in order use Muscle Stim....with the general +12 str buff, you can bump your str +24. This will help with equiping armor and some MA skill increase. After that, never touch Mat met again.) Mat creation is a controversial skill for most MAs...it allows you run your AC buffs. Most old school MAs will tell you not to worry about it, since it doesn't really raise your AC that much and it costs alot of IPs to raise. Personally I think that in the lower lvls it helps alot. I raised mine enough to use Greater Wooden Skin, and have not touched it since. It'a an individual preference thing though.<br>
<br>
4) Computer Literacy, although a blue skill (green, aqua, blue, and dark blue are the skill colors...green costs the least amount of IPs to raise while dark blue costs the most), is never the less a very important skill for MAs, esp if you solo. The more NCUs you have (you start with eight) , the more buffs you can run. You have to equip NCU belts and NCU memory modules, both of which uses Comp Lit skill, in order to raise your NCU count. Comp Lit also lets you use the Grid (a place which takes you all over the world, some places not accessed by Whompas), plus allows you to get better prices at the shop terminals in the Supermarkets. I normally keep it maxed for the first 20 or 30 lvls, then taper off and raise it as needed (while using temp implants) to equip better belts and memory. Keep in mind, the higher your base intelligence, the better your comp lit, map nav, trade skills and nano skills will be.<br>
<br>
5) Map navigation needs to be gotten to 130 as quick as you can get it there. At 130 you an upgrade your map reader to see monsters on the map. By that time you should already have direction arrow, machine, and people upgrades...not to mention a slew of maps for different zones. You can use implants to get to 130, as maps and reader upgrades are a one time upload. Many will tell you to stop there since you can use Dove's map to travel pretty much anywhere in the world you want, but I think a healthy map system is pretty important (until you get a Yalmaha which is the only way to travel IMHO) as it allows you to see what's on the horizion enemy wise. If you are running on the ground keep raising map nav and upload as many zone maps as you can....a deep red can't kill you if you avoid it.<br>
<br>
There are many, many more tips out there that we, many who have been here since the beginning, have available to our younger inexperienced brethern. Never hesitate to ask us a question. You'll find most ppl on this board are very helpful and friendly, and will gladly chime in and help when they can.<br>

<br>
The extremely kind and info packed responses to your post shows very clearly one of the best resources that an MMORPG has to offer.  Your fellow players.  That kind of response isn't restricted to message boards like these.  Since my return, I've never had any problems finding a helpful &quot;elder&quot; who will take the time to answer my questions.  No one person can now all there is to know, but the &quot;community&quot; of players will.  The helpfulness of the other players in Rubi-Ka is quite possibly the most pleasant surprise I've found.<br>

I think this last one is a leftover from EQ. It doesn't make much sense even to me, but sometimes it just rubs me the wrong way. After about two years in EQ, any oddball or annoying request was responded to by /d. More than a few annoying (and stupid) noobs felt the wrath of harm touch.
