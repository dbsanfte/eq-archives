At lv.70, my MA is kicking some SERIOUS ass. I tank very well, hit VERY hard and just plain kick ass.<br>

Last night this trader mob kicked my behind. I was hitting for steady 31's. Nothing higher than that. At all. Level 29. MA Skill of like 180 or something. Don't have all the implants I want yet. I use the general MA buff and Lesser Rage or whatever it's called. (Loonnnggg day). Damn mob would deprive my skills making me restart my attack. Then hit me for steady 27's with both fists and guns. My 31 steady punching was crap. Definitely feeling the pain now. I made level 30. I think I might kick back and hang out until 12.5 comes out. That was just ridiculous. I knew it was coming as I was gaining levels, but man did that piss me off. Thank goodness they addressed this. This would be a game stopper for me if they hadn't. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ufhastal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fhastal</A> at: 8/15/01 12:26:01 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=alianna>Alianna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#660000>(8/15/01 1:24:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Thoughts on MA and concept.</span><hr size=1> Not so much complaining as noticing some things. And the timing of my 2nd maxing-for-title-level coincided with the mobs' new-found uber-brawling ability--not good.<br>
<br>
So... rather than just complain, I'll explain my particular situation. I'm Solitus, female, 48. I spent IP on some things I wouldn't have spent them on, in hindsight, though the skills I bought (like break&amp;enter, nanoprogramming) do come in handy from time to time--I can install up to QL 100 faded clusters into implants, for people around me in a hurry, for example.<br>
<br>
I solo almost exclusively. This is a big factor, I think--the people that don't find problems with MA are the ones with docs doubling their hp, enforcers soaking up the mobs aggro'ing, soldiers dishing out mega-thousand hits and reflects, or NTs and MPs nuking the night away. For myself, the measure of my relative &quot;power&quot; is how high I can set the difficulty on the mission slider and survive. This, for my purposes at the current time, shows me every couple of hours, or every level, just how my relative power is gaining or declining.<br>
<br>
At 25, I could take missions from 1/2 to 3/4 hard. At 32, I couldn't do it above 3/8. So I stepped back and really looked at how I was spending and what I was spending on, and I found out I was &quot;wasting&quot; a lot of points on strength and stamina. And intelligence and psychic, to be honest, but the protections on Cyber armor are second to none.<br>
<br>
So after 32, I laid out a nanocluster chart, analyzed my skill set, and only bought what I needed to stop getting hit so much. A nearly-full set of QL 50 implants were done and installed at 36 or 37, and I could set my slider from 5/8 to 3/4 again.<br>
<br>
Until I hit 42, anyway. Then my MA and all my defensive skills maxed. That means no more real advancements until 50. And I already had some pretty major implants in. (For example, in that interview here, Gaute mentions his 41 MA friend buffed to 260 MA. At 41, I buffed to 321.)<br>
<br>
And it started dropping again. And continued to drop, until at 45 or 46, I couldn't take missions above 1/4. So I decided what the heck, I had until 50 before my defensive skills were going up again, and I'd heard about weapons and MA, so I figured it'd be worth a shot to see how it worked.<br>
<br>
It worked really well. I was still getting the living bejeezus beaten out of me, but at least now I could do sort of respectable damage--and at 48, I can almost do a mission at 1/2 again.<br>
<br>
So I started thinking about it, and the first post in this thread is the conclusion I came to about why MA is broken. It's not that they don't dish out enough damage--it's that they take too much, in the current setup. MA have two green offensive skills and FIVE green defensive skills. This, to me, says, &quot;You can't take a beating, so avoid damage.&quot;<br>
<br>
But we can't avoid damage.<br>
<br>
byte, the damage balancing against other classes, I don't know about. I've only had two PvP encounters so far, both in 25 zones on mission runs against -----|-o--- players with guns, and both times I won. Both times I used dimach, however. I'm not ready for PvP yet, in any case, and upping a class' damage is always easier than truly &quot;balancing&quot; it. If that makes any sense. Don't get me wrong; I like doing more damage as much as anyone. I just hope that's not what MA is going to be defined as. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showMessage?topicID=508.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showMessage?topicID=495.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=501.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.threadControl?topicID=501.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=501.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=501.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1>Main Dojo</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://www.thepunchingbag.net">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
