Keep the mission lower, even, or just nudge the hardness bar abit to the right.<br><br>2) Unless you REALLY want a certain mission reward, don't be too picky at the mission terminal. You are after the boss loot, and unless you know the person that has grouped with you they are doing you a favor so don't hold them up long.<br><br>3) Be prepared to spend HOURS in these missions (at my current lvl anyway...I spent 8 hrs in one mission, so long that time ran out for the reward...hehe, still got boss loot though). Bring plenty of healthkits/nano rechargers and first aid kits.<br><br>4) Always grab at least two missions. I have found that certain cave missions are &quot;bugged&quot;, in that the boss always fully heals when you ride the elevator back to the next lvl in order to save your hide (you will do this often, same goes for the front entrance mobs which usually consists of 4 mobs). If you find one of those bosses, congratulate yourself on making it to him, boogie on out of there, and go to the next mission. Since boss loot is the main thing desired, then it doesn't matter if 2nd mission runs out of time while you are running it....you still get the boss at the end as long as you don't zone completely out or log while in mission.<br><br>I made 1.5 mil credits and 3 lvls between 2 team missions in just a few hours. Unfortuanately the first boss was one of the unbeatable kind, and I never made it to the 2nd boss because my RL boss (my wife) made go to bed. So running team missions solo is a great way to build bank, gain massive amounts of exp, and get loot that you can't get in regular missions. Sure, after hour number 5 or 6 it gets tedious, but what the hell......I'd rather do that than spend 3 friggan days camping the VSR stone in Karnak's Castle.<br><br>Maybe others can share their insight. Hope it helps.<br><br>Hawk <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ualectosf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlectoSF</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#660000>(8/9/02 2:23:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2098.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Doing team missions solo?</span><hr size=1> Ranger, eh? You have my sympathy. At least I could solo camp my tome in The Hole.<br><br>I've done a number of team missions solo. They aren't hard to do, but you do have to keep a few things in mind. <br><br>Difficulty. I've run about 60% and have been able to complete the mission. It's not easy, but the mob level tends to be a lot more consistant in team missions than solo mission. Basically, everything yellow/orange is good. <br><br>The boss. If it's a 50-60% mission, the boss will usually be yellow/orange to orange. These can be some real battles. I've been able to win all of mine so far, and that IS against healing bosses. It's not easy. I think the last healing boss was an agent mob and the battle lasted about 20 minutes. The real key is to have high 1st aid to recover quickly if you have to zone. Helps a lot. The faster you can get back to business, the less you have to re-kill. <br><br>Supplies. Carry a lot. From my early days wandering all over Rubi-Ka, I got in the habit of carrying one backpack stuffed with rechargers of various sorts. Also spare bracers, rings, and even armor. Never know what you might run up against, and bosses damage type can vary wildly. I've used over 200 rechargers in a solo team mission before. Be prepared. <br><br>I haven't had a real epic length team mission solo yet. I've had some wild ones, but mostly they've been moderate length, 4 level ones. Some have been quite interesting (subway one in Andromeda springs to mind...enjoyed this one immensely...was at shades camp no less, got to kill big ugly boss spider across the road into the bargain, woohoo). <br><br>I do like doing these, but they're alway more fun with friends. Notice I didn't say teams, as in pickup teams. Friends. Always more fun to discuss the adventure over a dead boss in the boss room afterwards. It's easy to burn yourself out in doing huge missions constantly. So take it easy. <br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrimhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 382<br> <font color=#660000>(8/9/02 3:01:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2098.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Doing team missions solo?</span><hr size=1> Heh, solo+ranger= Rez.

More like vastly improved.<br><br>I have a lvl60 ranger friend, and she's pretty effective. Her armor is substandard (i.e. not Velious quest), but AC heavy. She has her epics. With her new buffs, I do believe she can do light blue mobs without too much trouble. I've seen her do fully blue wolves in the Permafrost pit. Close fights, but doable. Mostly it depends on how early she gets a slow off. Late in fight can mean trouble. Early = dead wolf.<br><br>Personally, I always liked to partner with her. As a very high level shadowknight, I felt her skills meshed well with mine (she does damage, I take hits), and fear kiting was a breeze with her. I told her she made a very good pet, even better than my lvl58 one. I don't think she was impressed, but this is very high praise from an SK.  <br><br>I'm hoping we get another chance for greatness in EQ2. Hopefully, Verant will get a clue and give us something really immersive and worthwhile and not just another Monty Haul game. Some glimmerings out there that this might be the case, but we won't know for at least another year... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrimhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#660000>(8/9/02 6:10:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2098.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Doing team missions solo?</span><hr size=1> As long as they keep McQuaid and company away from it....... <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2098.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2098.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2098.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=2098.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.threadControl?topicID=2098.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2098.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2098.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm10">Polling Corner<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market - Rubi-Ka 1<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm9">The Market - Rubi-Ka 2<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm8">Past Humor Links<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1>Main Dojo</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
