I have played the game since it was released and I have only ONE Char-period. A level 137 Opifex MA -(Clan). As you can see-I'm Slow-or I would be at lev 200 by this time.<br>
Questions:<br>
1. I am still using the QL 120 set of Implants that I've been using since I was level 60-or thereabouts. Obviously The stores do not sell higher QL stuff since I have not been able to find any. So,where do I get higher QL Implants?<br>
 A. I was finally able yesterday to buy a full Omni-Med Suit (which gives +78 to Treatment I believe. I read I also need to get a Biomech Cloak,Helmet and Boots which add a bit more but I have never been able to find any- and I also read where I could buy a OT-Windchaser QL 22 Rifle from Stores which would add a bit more Treatment--but I have never been able to find any. The set of QL 120 Implants I currently have were purchased from another player who had outgrown them way back then and I had no problem equipping them at that time since you could click on the surgery clinic as often as needed to get treatment up as high as needed to equip. Now cannot do that. <br>
2. What is the highest QL set of Implants could I hope to install at my level 137? Who puts these thing together--an Engineer? I'm guessing.<br>
3.I've also heard about Marks of Risk,Danger,Peril for MA's but I have never found one in any store. Where found? I've tried many Missions yet found none.<br>
4.LLTscopes? I happen to have one from a loong time ago ( don't even know why I have it in the Bank since I usually sell stuff I can't use to the store) that has a 5 % Crit to it but it requires a lot of EE and WS skills-is it worth it?<br>
<br>
Sorry if I seem to be rambling-but I am a bit bewildered at this time and am trying my darndest to learn.<br>
Thanks for your time and hopefully for any advice you may proffer.<br>

You get ql126+ augmentaions from missions. From what I've heard nothing above ql 125 (except for clusters it seems) is sold in stores.....I may be wrong about that, but I don't think so. <br>
<br>
As for treatment, the omni med suit is great, the Biomech armor adds tx and FA (dependant on ql as to how much), and Docs can give you the +35 or +80 tx buff. At your lvl, IF you have kept up with your tx (treatment) skill, and have a full omni med suit, AND have a 2nd set of full Biomech, and have the rifle you were talking about, and can get the +80 Doc buff, and your base abilities are high enough then you can probably squeeze into ql 200 implants. <br>
<br>
Nano Technicians usually have the highest NP needed to make those implants, but I'm sure other ppls of other professions has high enough NP as well. Your best bet is to download Net Nanny (sorry, I don't have the link...it is in these threads somewhere), and build yourself a set of ql 200 implants just to see if you meet the requirements. If not then start going down until you find the ql you can fit into.<br>
<br>
Once you determine the highest ql implants you can fit into (several ways to raise your base skills as well...I'd ask Publis, he has a formula for over-equiping imps), then either start running missions for the augmentaions or goto the buyer's channel and see if anyone is selling them. After you have your augs (or even while you are still collecting them) then start cluster shopping.....long, boring and frustrating at best. After you have everything you need, find a NT with the NP needed (Net Nanny will also tell you the min NP needed for each imp) and get them to build them.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that you can use other implants to raise some deficient skills, ie. Treatment, Stam, Str, Agil or any others that you need. All in all it's confusing doing imps, but some of the others can give you better advise on them than I.<br>
<br>
The nanos you are referring to are either mission rewards or boss loot, I can't remember which. They are team crit buffs. You may be able to buy them on the channel, only good if you group much IMHO. The scope you have is damn near priceless since it is pre-nerf, I do believe it is worth the high non MA reqs....but again, you'd have to ask one of the other more knowledgable MAs that use such items......I don't yet.<br>
<br>
Hope it helps some, other know way more about this stuff than I do I'm afraid.<br>

The clusters can't be saved, but you are primarily after the augmentation anyway.<br>

1. That OT Windchaser MO-6 Quartz QL22 Rifle (adds + 20 to treatment) must sure as hell been removed from the stores because I've been to every Basic store in tevery clan city at least a dozen times each at various hours of the day and never found one.IF anyone knows where this rifle can be purchased I would love to know.<br>
<br>
2. QL 200 CLUSTERS are indeed sold in Superior Stores in the Trades area (never found a SUPERB Store-where are they?)<br>
but it sure as Hell is unlikely you will find the Clusters you are looking for--50 trips to all the superior stores I could find in every clan city only yielded me 4 of the 39 Clusters I need--LOL!!!<br>
<br>
3. I looked at the NANO-NANNY proggy--LOL!!-to equip QL200 implants I need a Treatment of 998  not to mention the other  skill levels required. I would need at least another 25-26 levels of IP's just to get in the neighborhood of beiing able to equip QL200 Implants. This is ridiculous to me--is Funcom nuts? Don't answer that-it may be true and would spoil my day.<br>
<br>
4. Same thing with using QL200 Biomech armor--skill req's are outta sight!!! So,unlikely I will ever be able to use the Biomech to add to Treatment.<br>
<br>
Seems like the very best QL Implants I could hope to use now would be QL160'ish. And that would be by dumping all the IP's from the next 2 levels into Treatment! I'm beginning to wonder why I am staying in this game-Funcom has made it so incredibly difficult to find/buy items you need. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrimhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 397<br> <font color=#660000>(8/20/02 5:37:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2108.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Implants in stores</span><hr size=1> Hehe, told ya cluster hunting is a bitch). Well, since you can't get into ql 200 (was a stretch anyway) imps.....why not settle for lvl 150 imps to tide you over? It's better than what you have, and every little bit counts. It's all according your needs really. Implants are great at bolstering the skills you are deficient in or for getting the most out of your maxed skills.<br>
<br>
Another tricks is to make support imps to help you get into yours imps......for example, if you are lacking in treatment to get into your ql 160 imps, then make ql 130 treatment imps (shining head, bright eye, and faded r hand) which should raise your treatment enough to squeeze into some of your ql 160s. Use the same strategy for your base abilities. Sure, it's time consuming and a pain in the ass, but can be very rewarding once it's all done.<br>
<br>
Remember also that you can use higher lvl clusters in an augmentation, I normally only go 10-15 lvls above though. Another example....a ql 150 augmentation with a ql 160-165 cluster. If your NT has high enough NP skill then you will actually wind up with a higher than ql 150 imp. You will hardly ever find an exact match with augs and clusters in most cases anyway. Unless you run missions for the clusters, which can be just as frustrating.<br>
<br>
Finally here's the route I use when cluster hunting: W Athens, Old Athens, Tir, Newland, Newland Desert, Hope, and Borealis. All locs are accessable by Whompa and if you have a Yalm will not take long to search. Bottom line it does suck to build good implants, but they are sooo helpful in the long run.<br>

I just found out that the OT Windchaser Rifle I've been looking all over Hell for is available only (if it ever is actually in a store now) from an OMNI shop--LOL-go figure!!<br>
<br>
AND-that LLLTargeting Scope I have --wheeeeew-was just offered 55 mil for it ( who in the Hell has that kinda money to blow anyway) so someone thinks its worth it I guess. I did not sell it-figured if its worth that much money I had better hold on to it --just in case.<br>
<br>
Seems like you are correct-I'll need to settle now for some QL150'ish Implants. Damn-the thought of having to go through this mess a couple more times tho is almost too daunting to contemplate.<br>

<br>
(Btw, the OT-Windchaser M06 Quartz only adds +10 to treatment...not +20)<br>
<br>
For a level 137 MA, depending on your base stats (Int, Agil, Sense), you should have approximately 550 treatment if maxed.  With +78 from your omnimed outfit, +100 from the stationary clinic, +80 from a high level doctor, +20 from expertise, and ~+5 from Int, Agility and Sense buffs (including the Agent Feline Grace and Enhanced Senses buffs which add a couple pts), you would have ~833.<br>
<br>
The treatment requirement for Q175 implants is 829.  Add a specialized treatment implant or two and you could get even higher.  A Q175 shining treatment head implant adds +93, for example, a Q175 bright surgery eye implant adds +55, and a Q175 faded treatment right hand adds another +37.  With those 3 treatment implants in, you get to 1018, enough to equip Q200 in every slot other than head, eye and rt hand.<br>
<br>
That's without any biomech, or a treatment library, or the OT Windchaser M06 Quartz rifle.<br>

<br>
OK, the full Omni Med suit adds +74 to Treatment (and First Aid). <br>
<br>
You do not need a full set of BioMech, you just need the helmet and cloak. You can't wear the rest at the same time as the OM suit, and the OM suit adds more.<br>
<br>
The Stationary Clinic will add +100<br>
<br>
Generic Treatment buff will add +20<br>
<br>
Catch Hildegaard online, identify yourself as a TPB denizen, and she'll buff you with Superior First Aid, (+80 to both Treatment and First Aid). This won't be easy, cruel reality has severely attenuated my playing hours lately. Any doctor above L120 or so should be able to do this for you, and many can do it at much lower levels. BUT, be aware that docs are hounded mercilessly for this buff any time we appear in public, and expect some doctors to either ignore you completely or refuse you outright. You can try camping the Shopping Channels, and see if you can find a doc advertising services.<br>
<br>
The OT Windchaser Quartz can be hard to find. It only appears in Q22-Q25. As a thought, if you DO find it in the perfect Q22, consider buying several and selling the extras at a markup.<br>
<br>
Consider the use of a temp Head Treatment implant. Make or have made a Q125 Shining Treatment Head implant, put that in, stack all the rest of the shit up, and you should be able to get into Q150-Q160's. I say this blindly, however, having no idea how well-developed your Treatment skill is or isn't.<br>
<br>
I personally still use Nano Nanny, for all that it has flaws and is no longer supported. There are better alternatives now available, I agree.<br>
<br>
Implants are a hideously complex, confusing, expensive, time-consuming subject. But once they are finally IN, you'll agree it was worth it.<br>
<br>
If nothing else, get your Right-Hand, Left-Hand, and Feet implants as high as you can, since those are the locations of the MA skill.<br>
<br>
Oh yes, about shopping....were you under the impression that you had to exactly match the implant and the cluster?<br>
<br>
In fact, the cluster can be infinitely higher Q than the implant itself, and as much as 10% lower Q.<br>
<br>
Oh yes, and whover was using the terms &quot;aug&quot; and &quot;augmentation&quot;, AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

I appreciate it .<br>
<br>
After I ended up paying 500k for the Windchaser Rifle(from the RK-1 Exchange Forum)  I found one in each of the next 2 Missions I did---go figure! <br>
<br>
Saved up the IP's from last 2 levels and with these all dumped into Treatment I can get my Treatment to 450. Best QL Implants I can do is QL160-163. I have 4-5 Backpacks full of Implants ( some with clusters-some W/O) but the damn rub here is that all are in QL range of 171-200.  Nothing I can use! Again-go figure!  I advertised 3 days ago on RK-1 Exchange-no responses yet and I have stayed glued to the shopping channels online and advertised there repeatedly-<br>
Had ONE response from some guy who had  a QL 162 L.Wrist,R.Wrist,Eye,waist and L.Arm--he wanted 500k for each. And these all had clusters in them so I would also have to pay to get them &quot;stripped&quot;. SOAB! About 3 Mil for just 5 pieces out of the  13 pcs that I need-- I had to,sadly,decline. I have a bit over 5 Mil in credits and it appears this may not be enough to cover the costs of doing these implants if I have to spend 500k for each Implant,stripping costs,buying all the Clusters I need,and paying to get them assembled.<br>
Well, I'll keep trying for a bit longer to get these Implants but for me it may turn out to be the last straw- or as Kelly Bundy is wont to say &quot; The Squaw that stroked the Camels Sac&quot;!<br>
<br>
Why Funcom decided to make such a Fundamental Aspect of Char building so incredibly difficult is something I cannot comprehend!<br>

basically nano nanny is a huge spreadsheet saving you the trouble of writing down what clusters go where.<br>

<br>
I totally hear you about the problems in finding implants. It's a never ending fight.<br>
<br>
The good news is that you are very close to a level where it all gets much, much easier.<br>
<br>
Past L150, and especially past L160, many things get a lot easier.<br>
<br>
So take heart, be of good cheer, and know that you're not the only old fart playing AO. I'll be celebrating my 43rd birthday on October 8th, assuming I don't fall over dead of old age between now and then <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ureagan5.showPublicProfile?language=EN>reagan5</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#660000>(9/28/02 12:39:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2108.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How goes the fight, reagan5?</span><hr size=1> Been absent from Ao for a Month now.Have been Beta Testing AC2-its got a lot of problems-maybe Turbine can work them out but its iffy for me at this point. I really do not see anything in AC2  thats better than AC1 except maybe the graphics.<br>
<br>
Got my AO  MA Char up to lev 152 before I took my Hiatus. Had to settle for 165'ish Implants so got that to go thru one more time when I get ready to do the final ql200's. Need to hop back in to AO  awhile next week just so I don't forget what I'm doing there.<br>
<br>
Ahh-43 be a good age--Happy Birthday. I'll be a Septuagenarian on Nov 15th.<br>
