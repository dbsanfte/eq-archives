It has been a well known fact for some time that DoS aids LV at every opportunity they can get away with it.  When caught thier responses are weak lies at best.  The guild as a whole does little to respond to the accusations or try to show good faith that they fully support the server vs LV general state of war.<br>
<br>
DoS members regularly buff LV and assist them in pve situations.  This is coming to an end today on RZ.  AD will not stand by idle.<br>
<br>
If you are a DoS member and wish to clear up your KOS status with AD, /guildremove immediately and do NOTHING to assist in pvp in this war.  This includes buffing, gating, ressing or giving information to your former comrades.<br>
<br>
Some DoS members will remain KOS forever.  If you've ever been caught assisting LV, you should ask for a guildinvite from them now, they are your new allies.  This list will be posted shortly and will probably not include many names.  You already know if you're going to be on it.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for someone to be upset with, look no further than those guild members who brought you to this point.  The guild known as Dynasty of Shadows is done.  Disband now. <p>Tohde's army</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=frawg>Frawg</A> at: 12/13/02 4:11:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tekas>Tekas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(12/13/02 4:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AD at war with Dynasty of Shadows</span><hr size=1> OK since no officers/members have time ( more like the will ) to discuss this in game I will be forced to talk about this on the boards. <br>
<br>
1) Where are the SSes? <br>
2)Where is the proof that Dynasty of Shadows helps LV at every chance we get? <br>
3)Where is the SSes of Rhyden tanking mobs for LV at kael? -As I was informed by Awfal.<br>
4)Where is the proof of DoS members aiding LV in pve situations?<br>
<br>
I am aware of a few enchanters who were guilded with DoS recently who buffed,( who are removed, and have been for some time now) and I'm quite sure that someone has gotten screenshots of this.  Must the guild as a whole pay for the acts of single character even when by OUR standards this character has been found guilty and removed? I did not know this was AD's policy on how they treated such guilds. Please be sure to include it in the 2003 RZ players handbook because being it is a pvp server, and the mere fact that it happens to be a GAME, (yes its not real life AD.... close... but not quite) it is impossible for me to fly to every recruits house and meet them in real life, talk to them, find out their interests and hobbies, take them to lunch, blah blah and find out if they have the potential to buff known pks on the server of Rallos Zek. Do you get my point? Did you see Shak turning pk? Did Wudan foresee Shoon turning into the menace he is before they geared him up? I think not, nor do I feel that they should be held responsible. <br>
<br>
Zennael was found taking a faction hit off of a mob in droga, which was being killed by a SK in LV. This to me is a pretty big offense not only to AD, but to our guild as well and he will be disbanded, if he is not already ( he hasn't been online for a while as of the time of this post) This is not an issue for discussion as far as his innocence, and it is a pity we will lose one of our very well geared monks, but this as well is our policy for people who aid LV.<br>
<br>
<br>
Last point I will make before I pop more blood veins, if we love aiding LV sooo much, and at every opportunity, how is it LV aren't doing bigger and better things? If DoS really wanted to, we could help LV so much on things like HoT, plane raids, even KD. Do you see this happening AD? no. Do you have proof of this? Apparently not. Do you see us fight LV? yes. My god, its even on the LV homepage, how on their first raid of HoT, DOS showed up to war them and stopped their raid. AD.... I don't understand this at all and maybe putting all this out in the open for the rest of the server to see....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This will suffice until I see evidence of some kind brought to my attention in the reasoning behind this war. At this time, anything besides Zennael   the 2 enchanters who are atm removed, I see no reason to KoS Dynasty of Shadows, Perma KoS at that. An officer in AD ( you know who you are) told me some time ago something to the lines of -&quot; We have been getting information from random people, we think it has been LV trying to ruin the reps of anti pk characters thus giving them no choice other than to join LV&quot;.  If you at all listened, or took information from any of those sources I really thought you as a guild were above this sort of thing.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wylieecoyotee>Wyliee Coyotee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 546<br> <font color=#333333>(12/13/02 4:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Buck up.</span><hr size=1> Your right, its only a game.  <br>

This post from Wyliee seems to be attempting to trivialize the point of this war. While yes being as uber as AD is, warring a guild such as DoS must seem extremely trite. But there are members, me for one who have seen this guild born, and raised it from the point where a weekend KD arena raid was our goal. My point being I will not let DoS end in this manner, sorry if I don't share your triteness of our situation at hand. Good luck finding DoS to kill for I have given the word that DoS members must retreat at the sight of all AD until this is resolved as to not make matters worse. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blizzyy>Blizzyy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Powernap</span><br>  Posts: 676<br> <font color=#333333>(12/13/02 5:56 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/blizzard/fullsize/playboy_1001.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Buck up.</span><hr size=1> maybe this is a good time to clean the scum out of your guild while you reform it.<br>

<br>
I heard there a rumor that Rhyden was tanking mobs for Lucid Vision, whether you like him or not isn't the issue, I talked with him for quite some time and he has been a friend of mine. He reassured me he has never tanked mobs for any pk guilds, this includes Lucid Vision. I heard possible rumor's that there are screenshots, if those can be produced then I can chew on an ass hat for a while and think about where I stand, but I believe him until I am shown evidence otherwise as most people would stick up for there friends.<br>
<br>
It was brought to my attention that Fuedaenchat from DoS had buffed 1 lucid vision member, and was talked about it and told never to do it again, he has opted to take the hgih road and take his chances solo in everquest until he is cleared to do otherwise, he has deguilded and told me he's sorry he got things messed up.<br>
<br>
Zennael... I was online whenthis event happened. Zureus(lv) was in droga as was Zennael (dos), Zennael decided to keep his distance  because he had been in Droga for several days working on faction and didnt think he could take a sk, I talked to him when they were the only two in the zone and he said he was just hiding and factioning, a few hours later maybe less I recieved a tell from Glamore (I believe to be Lelu from AD but cannot be sure) anywyas saying zennael had admitted to helping LV in droga, I immediately messaged him and said &quot;what happened in droga&quot; I got the general run down which included, zennael found out that a ad monk was killed and lucid vision brough a few people in and killed a mob for a chardok quest ring, this is where problems started, zennael decided to hit the mob for faction and ran off. Apperently he said something to Glamore that gave her the impression zennael was an LV ally or what not, anyone who knows him knows he hates Lucid Vision with a passion. So knowing this it becomes more of a moral issue in my opinion, we are on a pvp server and I for one like most of Ascending Dawn and I'm not saying what his views towards any guilds aside from LV because I just don't know. I think he should have the choice to hide if he wants to and not be condemned for it, maybe I'm wrong but it wasnt his fault that Slivur was killed. He would be the first to say ya I fucked up I shouldnt have tried to get a faction hit from 1 mob it wasnt worth it, but hind sight is always 100%.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't know wtf is going on with the temperate ordeal, I know temperate manaburned wailem, I was told he attacked 1st, then later told it had to do with ninja looting part of a hoh key, which isnt kewl no matter how you look at it. Further fact on this area or any other area would be greatly appreciated, I know I have a lot of friends in AD that I would have to fight or deguild over this, both of which I don't want to happen.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time people, if this has to do with DoS and Eternal Shadows you can message me in the game about there ties with lucid vision if thats not the case then forget I said anything I don't want to get any more poeple in the hot pot with me there just not eough damn room.<br>

Both Zennael issues that have been resolved by him being removed from guild.<br>
<br>
I have to ask,<br>
<br>
Ive heard privately that some of the issues might have to be<br>
<br>
a) AD real friends with Eternal Shadows.<br>
b) LV trying to ruin what reps we do have.<br>
c) Accusations that we werent doing rotations etc on spawns and consuming content too quickly, causing resentment.<br>
<br>
Im not a DoS officer but I am a DoS regular. <br>
<br>
Please substantiate the declaration... If the officers didnt respond to Tekas because you were in VT, why start a war while in VT? Why has Slithur been attacking DoS whenever we are fighting ES, even days before this war was accused?<br>
<br>
DoS is my family. We arent PB, we arent FU, we arent LV. Seriously. If you have issues with our pve stance, tell us, but please dont hang the sceptre of LV on us without proof (beyond the Zenn issue)...<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<br>
What saddens me is that you have a quite a few good members that are trying to get ahead in the game, new players and old who have found a home in your guild. <br>
<br>
Then I see them guilded with , to make an example, Slurpee, that guy used to portal gank with DB in So RO. <br>
<br>
Then I see screenshots of your members trying to help out LV.<br>
<br>
Quite frankly, when you decide to guild people who have been assholes and random PK's in the past, it means that you are willing to stick up for them as players and people in the present.<br>
<br>
So now you get the chance to do that.  <br>

- a) AD real friends with Eternal Shadows.<br>
- b) LV trying to ruin what reps we do have.<br>
- c) Accusations that we werent doing rotations etc on spawns and consuming content too quickly, causing resentment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
a) not true at all, majority of us don't like Eternal shadows since they have tons of ex-PB there.<br>
b) no clue, I am not on except for events so I haven't been able to see that.<br>
c)  no offence, but we are way past that content that you are doing, so we wouldn't care what you kill.<br>
<br>

Pure and simple. There is no excuse(other than being a crackhead) for spreading baseless rumors about DoS and LV being close. We fought LV on every given occasions. We fought LV outnumbered and  we fought LV side by side with some of you. Sadko used to be LV's enemy number one. And I am pretty sure he is not doing much to fix that faction. Why LV is not doing ToV? Because 3 DoS(Sadko, Rhyden and me) with help of Sirdario(AD) made sure their first attempt will be a very memorable failure. <br>
<br>
If there are no other motives behind this war, I would say &quot;Thank you AD for helping us identify and remove an extreme ho of a member&quot; (helping those bishes for a faction hit... jeez)and call it quits. If there are other motives, spell em out and drop the bs. Given that I've been inactive for three weeks and pretty much plan to stay that way, I have to add that I will come back if this war becomes e-reality.

By the way, to the dumbshit who mentioned Morrissey c3ing Abused: Abused is a 61 enc, he's been 60+ for nearly a year, much like myself (neither of us xps much). If Morrissey c3'd an enc that can c3 himself, he's not too bright. (that's the only reason I posted this reply here, but I figured I'd write another paragraph)<br>

Let's be honest.  DoS hasn't had the most stringent of recruitment policies.  Taking a look at past and present guildies:<br>
<br>
Agoz - DB / FoH<br>
Apotekus - DB<br>
Balabalax - PB<br>
Beldargon - PK<br>
Elbon - Black Daggers (harbored pk's)<br>
Evegirl - PB(?)<br>
Flyiksar - PB<br>
Jamison - BD<br>
Leliel - jesus christ...who would guild Leliel.  DB/Random<br>
Slurpee - PK / Portal ganker<br>
Tekas - DB<br>
Temperate - flag stealer<br>
Axxeron - DB<br>
Brenlain - another &quot;WTF were you thinking?&quot;<br>
Complex - PK<br>
Dempig - DB / random<br>
Ever - Ok, yer kidding right? You fucking guilded EVER??<br>
Fefie - PB / asshole<br>
Fizzletwit - DB / PK his entire eq life<br>
Hibbin - The druid helping LV in PoG<br>
Maule - Yea, let's guild Maule, he needs TOV loot.  DB/ PK<br>
Messenger - DB / PK<br>
Voldemorrt - DB / PK<br>
Searano - DB / PK<br>
Plopz - PK / HIV<br>
<br>
(you'll note I didn't include Shoon, Zeurus, etc.  They went random after they left DoS.  Nothing you can do about that)<br>
<br>
I don't have a problem with a good portion of DoS.  You guys have accomplished a lot.  But you guys have always had a habit of guilding PK's who are &quot;anti now!&quot; cuz they want loot.  Gravesson did it when he first started DoS, and it continues today.  You are guys are doing NTOV and Sleepers.  Frankly, I don't want to see these people getting that kind of loot. (look, Ever got Vulak robe!).  Sorry, fuck that.<br>
<br>
Don't be mad at us.  Be mad at the people who you've let join that's brought your good name down....see the list above.    Personally, after Maule, Ever, Leliel, etc. I'd be like &quot;what the hell kinda guild am I in?&quot; and wouldn't have stood for it.  <br>
<br>
It's a bad situation, I wish it wouldn't have come to this but the PK's and assholes have continued to flow in.  I hope the good folks in DoS don't take it personally and can see our point.<br>

First off how about u check some of ur dates? i think your guild order is off a lil.. Hibbin was in DoS b4 he started helpin LV and shit(btw hes a halfling rogue). <br>
<br>
2. Half of these people i have never even heard of.. yes this is funny since ive been in the guild since the start pretty much and played just about everyday since. There was a DoS that split up because of school Etc about a year ago after everyone left some pks joined etc... thats probably where u got all these names like Ever, Maule, messenge etc.. most of those DB ones.<br>
<br>
3. Temperate.. so.. how do u exactly &quot;steal&quot; a flag?.. id like to know.. considering wouldnt u have to be there from the start(shrug) to be able to be in aerins lair? I'm not sure i havent tried but heh.. <br>
<br>
That is all i have to say for now heh. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1657.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1657.topic&start=41&stop=54>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=1657.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showNextMessage?topicID=1657.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.threadControl?topicID=1657.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1657.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1657.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Gimp's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3>Public Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246c<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
