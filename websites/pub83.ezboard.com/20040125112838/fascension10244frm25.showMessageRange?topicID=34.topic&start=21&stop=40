www.houseofsagacious.com the one difference between you and them is there are several of your officers, leaders, and members who do give a damn still and I really admire those that I have met. Adell and Kaycie just to name a few.<br>
<br>
Anyways enough said about that. Frawg there was a VERY serious allogation Against Ibinax witch was ignored and I was flamed. If you wish to ignore it cause Im just another E-bay whore then so be it.<br>
<br>
Whitemagik Carpe'noctem and Blackmagik Carpe'diem did a little bit of everything, however we didnt hang out in WC area we were in the BB,Qeynos, SK,NK Lake Rathe area back then it was light vs dark and we gave the lighties hell...much has changed since then.<br>
<br>
As for just buy 15k on PA its no longer an option I have been informed by your leadership in game and by members posting here that &quot;You are perma KoS for reasons that have nothing to do with you personally&quot;. I have no say anymore. However your leaders have informed me I will not recieve treatment like I did the othernight, and that was all that ruffled my feathers.<br>
<br>
As for this being my first druid yes and no. Whitemagik was a necro who got to 40 and then I quite. I had a druid but she topped out at level 18. Im not a newb to EQ, just the highend game. However I can feel the &quot;Ebay whore&quot; comments coming now. Say what you want its your board <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The only issue is Im now in a tight spot. I am not pk, I wanted off your list, but its not an option. I now have a choice to make. I can either sit still and not take the offensive and hope you guys dont attack, witch you seem to prove you will everytime, or I can attack first and meet you half way....only issue with this is Im only reinforcing what you are claiming I am. I am however sick of letting you guys kill me with no effort to fight back on my end. Seems to me you guys are forcing me to pk you...<br>
<br>
I will be forming a guild this weekend named The Dark Knights (assuming they let me have the name). TDK is a long standing MMORPG guild that has been around since UOera. As you refuse to change your stance towards me, TDK will be Hostile to AD.<br>

&quot;AD does not condone exp loss in pvp. If any specific allegations are made I can address I will. Keep in mind it is your responsibility to avoid exp loss while on CR. Don't blame an AD just because you lost exp after getting PK'd. &quot;<br>

Actually bud I have played a chanter and a lvl 60 Chanter at that longer then half your guild has been playing the game bud...And that &quot;loser Wizard&quot; has wracked up more PvP kills then you have PvE kills in less then 2 years time at that...Not to mention less then a dozen deaths...And most of those deaths are just a little suspicious kinda like the one to tried...I zone into SRO get jumped at the spires so I zone into NK...I run to the NE river and sit in the river to med...Withen 30 seconds Tried kills me...I guess he just got lucky and combed the entire zone withen 30 seconds right?  Or maybe it's just another cheat your guild allows but deny's....<br>

&quot;See...smart player &gt; retarded player. Everytime. Don't blame us you're retarded.&quot;<br>
<br>
Malio don't even get me started with your post mintal midget...Your post usually consist of RL insults...Game insults...And complete and utter bullshit pulled straight from your ass...Which in front of anyone other then your own guildies would make comedy central staring norraths examples of the 95% of people that should have been removed from the gene pool at birth...<br>
<br>
Once again you guys hide behind your overinflated egos to dodge the problem at hand...Your guild is partially formed of cheaters that for some reason you must just keep around to remain &quot;uber&quot;  Grow some balls and maybe some morals...Once that happens maybe you won't be the revised Peacebreakers (Yes the people you despise for the same reasons) to 90% of RZ<br>

&quot;I just recently started playing my 58 druid and its been a LONG time&quot; makes it sound like you leveled up a druid to 58, quit for a while, and then came back, instead of saying &quot;I just bought a 58 druid and have no idea where this class is good at soloing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/upyrostasis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyrostasis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#333333>(9/25/02 12:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Wow someone can do board research unfortunately they...</span><hr size=1> I didnt train them they trained me I soccored and when I came back the dog still had them on the hate list.

As for the second part, if your asking for help you dont have to give your life story. If you look at the rest of my posts they are ALL asking questions about a druid class. I dont want to tell the 0.o's I bought a char they get bitter about it I wanted help.<br>

How's this for an answer:  We don't owe you an investigation.  We don't owe you an answer.  We don't owe you an apology.

You and I have discussed this matter in game and the problem was addressed in that conversation. similarly I have discussed the problem with the person play Ibinax that night.<br>
<br>
Perhaps kos us until we resolve it your satisfaction? <br>
<br>
anyhow, I'm not sure what your goal is here. If its to reduce the problems you have with AD I think you're going about it the wrong way.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/upyrostasis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyrostasis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#333333>(9/26/02 5:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Adell</span><hr size=1> I got the response from you I wanted Adell, you were nice and respectfull. However the rest of the people in your guild seem to share different values than you and Kaycie and the ones in AD who seem to have a controll over some extreme pent up rage.<br>
<br>
As for KoSing you...umm...Exactly what am I supposed to do? You guys kill me on site, there is no talk, no hey leave, no negotiations, what would you do in my shoes? If whenever I see one of you I attack first, or at the same time my chances for survival go up 10 fold.<br>
<br>
As for helping my case, you and several others have told me I dont have a case. Im KoS. It wont be changed. It has nothing to do with me, and its nothing personal but STFU and get off your boards. Adell take a gander at what some of your boys have said in this post. You have a EXP killing enchanter in your guild who is not being corrected, Xblade flat out lied to you about me attacking, and Im told that this action isnt acceptable by your members, yet whenever I point it out Im told it doesnt matter.<br>
<br>
Adell you seem to be a sensible person, and as I myself run a large guild (all be it in Asherons call) I know what you have to deal with on a daily basis. The tells, the compromises etc. However, my guild differs from yours in 1 extremely large way. If I say we do something we do it, if I say we dont do something we dont. Im getting mixed messages from you and the rest of your clan.<br>
<br>
#1 Frawd and Adell both claim that exp killing isnt an acceptable AD method of dealing with people they have KoS. Yet on the night of the incident I asked Lohengrin (the only AD officer on at the time) &quot;Is it acceptable for AD to corpse camp and EXP kill me?&quot; His reply &quot;Yep =)&quot;<br>
<br>
#2 I was told to get off the KoS list all I had to do was pay Lohengrin 10k, however another officer told me it was 2k, and another officer told me I had no chance. I griped about it on the board and went about my business. After talking with Lohengrin I realized you guys werent just happy to pk witch I dont mind its part of the server, but EXP kill...that I had an issue with. As you guys are larger than me and my crew, exp killing me over and over is an easy feature and after loosing a buble in 58 I decided to pay your fee...I come to your boards, and am told I had the choice originally and denied it so I am now denied, however there wasnt a choice....I was told 3 things. Also You yourself Adell told me I cant get off the KoS list because of &quot;issues that have absolutely nothing to do with you&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmm.<br>
<br>
After being told by one of your members to come to the boards to discuss it with the guild, even after telling her I would get hazed I get flamed to death. I get moved to the &quot;Gimp Gallery&quot; and Im now ignored...fine...great...so be it.<br>
<br>
However there are things you and the rest of the leaders of AD need to look at Adell.<br>
<br>
#1 You have people in your guild who are EXP killers, and then justify their actions to me and others by saying no one cares, STFU, your on the KoS list, your an ebayer, you attacked first, or any of a million other excuses<br>
<br>
#2 You have people in your guild who when caught doing something un-ethical (Xblade) make up false acusations to justify his methods.<br>
<br>
#3 Any time someone trys to bring any of the above to your attention in a very nice, well spoken, non-profane way they are flamed off your boards and ignored.<br>
<br>
So whats my point?<br>
<br>
Well it looks to me like you guys have made a few compromises, and thats all fine and dandy, but at the current state and time your not an Anti guild....most wouldnt even consider you an Honor guild. Now this doesnt mean you dont have Honorable people in your ranks, I have several people in your ranks I talk to on a daily basis even helped on of them find some spells today. What it means is you have some trash in your guild witch needs to be taken care of, either punished privately or publicly, or completely removed. Your other option is to declare yourself a Honor-pk or Random-pk guild.<br>
<br>
Its all dependent on your prioritys.<br>
<br>
I await your response. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uruhi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruhi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Blowin Smoke</span><br>  Posts: 962<br> <font color=#333333>(9/26/02 6:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Adell</span><hr size=1> God your a persitant little bugger.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showMessageRange?topicID=34.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showPrevMessage?topicID=34.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showNextMessage?topicID=34.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=34.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.threadControl?topicID=34.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=34.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=34.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Somthor's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm31">Beastlords<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25>Somthor's Gallery</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3m<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
