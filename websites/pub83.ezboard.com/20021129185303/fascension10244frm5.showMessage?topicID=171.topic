Yes, Ascending Dawn is always recruiting, BUT (a very big but here) we are extremely selective with who we recruit these days - the following requirements aren't meant to be discouraging, they're meant to be realistic.  If you can't meet these requirements, you quite simply don't have what it takes to be a member of AD.  We're looking for extremely dedicated players, people willing to die (A LOT!), suffer through long hours of raiding, remain patient and attentive while keeping a good attitude.  If you're a quitter or a whiner or have trouble following directions, you can stop reading right now.  Otherwise, read over our requirements:<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must be an extremely active player.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If you can only play 1-2 hours a day, once or a twice a week, then AD isn't the guild for you.  We're looking for people who play 5+ days a week, 3+ hours a day, and love to raid.  Our general raiding hours are from anywhere from between 6pm est to 3am est.  Days off for xp/etc are few and far between!<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must have 5 sponsors.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Your sponsors need to post a follow up to your application indicating their sponsorship.  Sponsors are currently active, long standing AD members who are willing to vouch for your playing ability and personality, look after you and keep you informed at raids, and take the blame if you fuck up somewhere.  These should be people you have past relations with - doing a /who all &quot;asc&quot; will rarely find you sponsors, and may hurt your chances at joining AD in the long run.  If there aren't 5 people in the guild that know you well enough to want to sponsor you, chances are you should spend more time outside of events (xping with us, or whatever), before submitting your application.  In rare cases we might allow you to attend a couple of events as a guest to help members decide if they wish to sponsor you or not.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must be level 65, absolutely no exceptions.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Additional advancement through raid-useful AA abilities are now required.  See the next post on additional requirements for your class.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must have adequate gear.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  We don't expect you to have full ToV armor, but your epic should be complete or nearly complete, and you should be able to easily get over 100 in any required resist.  Any lower than that and you'll be a liability to us versus any AEing mobs.  You should also have some sort of EB item - Fishbone earring or lodizal shield, etc.  Additionally, some sort of right click item is required, *aside* from jboots.  (Coldain ring and shrunken goblin earring are commonly used for this purpose)<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must be not currently applying to any other guilds.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  We don't want people who are out &quot;testing the waters&quot; - We want people interested in and committed to joining AD and only AD.  It is highly recommended that you remove yourself from your current guild.  At the very least hide your tag out of courtesy to AD.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must have a good knowledge of all zones, including all expansions.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You should have all commonly used keys (Sebilis, Howling Stones, Skyshrine, etc.)  You should be able to run to any zone in the game (for instance Iceclad to Temple of Veeshan, or Nexus to Ssra Temple, or Shadow Haven to Acrylia Caverns) without any outside help.  There are plenty of maps out there, learn to use them.  You should know how the /loc command works, and have your sense heading skill maxxed (or carry a compass).<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must have approval from everyone in the guild.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  This doesn't mean that everyone loves you and wants to sponsor you personally, but it does mean that you need to work out any past arguements or disagreements with any current guild members.  Additionally you must have a good reputation with the server at large - if you random in your spare time, if you're kos to half a dozen other guilds, if you KS and train whenever possible, we don't want you.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must have a thick skin.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Whats that mean?  We joke around a lot, tease, and call each other names in guildchat.  No, we don't really hate you when we call you a stupid fucked up piece of shit for accidentally training Aaryonar on the guild - we want people who won't take things like that personally.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must be patient.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Recruitment is a *long* process - most past applicants spent AT LEAST six weeks or more as recruits.  We are very careful with who we guild - basically, when no one in guild is asking &quot;who is this guy/gal?&quot; we'll be close to guilding you.  While its fine to ask on occasion how your recruitment period is progressing, excessive and frequent inquiries every day are frowned upon.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must enjoy playing and working to improve your current character class.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If we recruit your necromancer, it means we want you playing and working on improving your necro, not twinking up a warrior, or rogue, or whatever.  If you have the ability to &quot;two-box&quot; and play multiple characters at raids, that is welcomed, but changing your primary is not an option while in AD.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must be willing to pvp.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  AD has been through several large scale wars in the past, and knowing RZ, will be through more in the future.  If you are the type to log off or hide on a twink instead of fighting for your guild, AD isn't for you.<br>
<br>
Think you have what it takes?  Talk to your potential sponsors, make sure they're willing to vouch for you.  Get to know as many additional AD members as you can.  Once you're ready, post your application here, telling a bit about yourself and exactly why you want to join AD - this will be an important post, be sure to mention anything you feel is noteworthy or special and worth us knowing.<br>
<br>
If you have any further questions feel free to post here, or talk to me or any other officer in game.  (As long as we aren't TOO busy during an event we should be able to get back to you.)<br>
