I'm wearing MA chest, legs, boots and sleeves but am wondering if that's really the way to go.  I mostly solo or find myself in main tank role in groups and am level 84.<br>

<br>
I'll probably switch to my black MA suit here before too long (need to get STA back up to speed). I have a lower level one, and it's almost as good as a primus coat 25 ql's higher. My new one is vastly superior to my present primus coat; not sure what I'll do about a hat. They all look like hell. <br>
<br>
I solo mostly (as my primary), and run into almost all the damage types. Flower's really probably is best, especially if you're clan. <br>
<br>
If I was solitus omni, I'd probably go Elite (can't beat the look), and implant the living daylights out of chem AC and religously carry chem shields. <br>
<br>
My omni MA is a nanomage, so she's sorta tied to the INT/PSY armors. She can go PSY/STA if necessary, but decided biomech was a losing proposition compared to nano armor in the long run. Presently she's in full Bau, with full Waiit and nano armor waiting in the wings. <br>
<br>
MA armor is actually pretty good. Especially if you hunt bosses in Andromeda. The nastier ones seem to tend to cold/fire/poison damage. Still, in missions I run into chem and even radiation far too often for my peace of mind, so no MA armor for me (though I do love the look). Additionally, I don't like raising sense any more than necessary. AGI is dark blue for nanomages, so a real no-go there. <br>
<br>
That's my feelings about armor for MAs.

Omni-Pol is a good choice, the MA suit pieces seem pretty good and some of the Waitt/Bau cyber armor has good resistances and whatnot.  I've been staying away from Flowers unless I can get it in a mission or something as it is really expensive from what I have seen.  Radiation has always been my lowest protection so far which sucks...but chem, energy, projectile and melee are the most common damage types I have run into, though last night I ran into a boss that was switching his damage types every 30-45 seconds.  Cold, Fire, Poison, Chemical and Projectile were the ones I remember off the top of my head....annoying little bastard he was.  I hear that a lot of the higher end mobs, especially boss's have a propensity towards the damage switching. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uiccusion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>iccusion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#660000>(7/29/02 12:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=501.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is your armor preference?</span><hr size=1> My opinion:  Flowers Tech, hands down with a decus armor coat.<br>
<br>
If you REALLY want full protection (since flowers doesnt cover poison damage) and happen to keep your Stam high, mix one or two pieces of Omni Elite in with your Flowers Tech armor.<br>
<br>
And unless you are independently wealthy, always use missions to get your armor post Q50.  Elite starts showing up at Q75.<br>

Looks like I'll be headed back to Flowers.  A question on the Sempi cloak; is that better than the MA battle suit?  I have been comparing the battle suit to the web cloaks and it seems to be running ahead but am not sure about a Sempi cloak as I don't have one to compare it to.  The helmet is another issue altogether..they all make me look like a giant ugly grasshopper or something (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

I am clan so I cannot wear the Omni gear.  I have noticed chemical damage is my weak spot..any suggestions?  My base stats are all pretty equal and on the high end (finally maxed out my MA and Brawl skills so I'll have a few more IP points between now and 100 to play with).  Still playing around with the idea of a single claw but I am still confused so I will keep reading until I figure it out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My impression was they were, more or less, about equivalent to decus coats (primus anyway). <br>
<br>
The organic MA suits are way better than decus coats. The hanshi coat might narrow the gap, but the senpai series aren't even close to the MA suits in protection. Literally, a ql66 black MA suit is almost as good as a ql92 senpai primus decus coat. <br>
<br>
Chem damage is always a pain. My chem AC is pretty good, but it's not as good as projective, energy, or melee. Chem shields (and rad shields for that matter) are everyday equipment for me.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udevilhands.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Devilhands</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#660000>(7/31/02 1:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=501.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is your armor preference?</span><hr size=1> For shop-based armor: Flower is the best choise. It has good Melee/imp proj/enegy/chem dmg (the 4 types most common).<br>
<br>
Mission/rare armor: Decranus mk1/2 is best but hard to get. I also like sekutek armor, a little lower ac but nice mods. Kirsch is also nice. Servant of 8 has a lvl req built in so its harder to equip high lvls of. So I suggest Sekutek out of those.<br>
<br>
On back: MA-suit blue/black/red. If U need some extra MA skill for that claw use the blue (also have good chem ac). Otherwise I think red is nice. At lvl 162 I use the blue if nothing else but because it goes nicely with my servant of eight helmet!

It's hard to overequip that Sense/Agility armour but as an Opifex I still think it's my armour of choice (Green Sense/Agil). You might want to mix in some Flower parts for the Radiation AC but with a good implant setup you can cope easily.<br>
<br>
Most people tell me I should go for Flowers but for me it's easy to obtain armour upgrades in Obtru as all my clans Obtru goes directly to me - I have full sets of Obtru in the range from 90 through 200 so I won't ever have to worry about obtaining new armour <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Flowers if the Opifex armor IMO, unlike Obtur where the highest req is the harder to get sense, Agility is the primary attribute, and the strength req is very reasonable.<br>
<br>
Additional for the savy MA, there is a nice little +20 rifle out there that's got decently low reqirements meaning you can boost YOURSELF 20 points of agility before you even go looking for an agent for feline grace if your into over equiping.<br>
<br>
Personally i prefer the red organic combat suit for regular wear ( i see no point to the turquise as i have neleb's robe and it goes on and off a LOT eaiser then the sta req for the turquise suit ).<br>
<br>
Eventually: Sevants of the 8 armor with black combat suit ( looks ), maybe some MKII thrown in ( especially the hood  for looks ).<br>
