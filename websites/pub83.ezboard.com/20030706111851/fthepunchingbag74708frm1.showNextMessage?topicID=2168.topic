<br>
Blessed with Thunder<br>
NODROP<br>
Quality level:56<br>
Requirements:<br>
Use:<br>
Parry from 176<br>
Brawling from 185<br>
Nano Points from 82<br>
Cannot weild weapons<br>
Must be in combat mode.<br>

Damage 148<br>
Nanopoints -81<br>
Damage 147<br>
<br>
Skill locked on use: Martial Arts<br>
<br>
<br>
This does NOT seem to be increasing my damage output by 6X for ten seconds like some websites suggested. Instead its doing 148 damage, then 147. Its still nice, but not what I was hoping for. I wouldn't have spent 30,000 ip on parry to get this had I know.<br>
<br>
Am i doing something wrong or did Blessed with Thunder change at some point?<br>

That's just silly.<br>
<br>
What MA special attacks DO deliver, however, is extra damage above and beyond your fist damage (you can't use these special attacks when wielding a weapon).  Attack of the Snake is the simplest form: Every 10 seconds you can trigger this MA special attack and do a single extra shot of damage, with the damage range varying by QL.  The two &quot;lowest&quot; level MA Special attacks (namely Attack of the Snake and Bird of Prey) both work this way.  If you are a fist-only MA, they are akin to extra &quot;free&quot; damage during a fight.  If you use a weapon, you have to unequip the weapon, trigger the special attack, then re-equip.  Often not worthwhile to go through this ordeal, and it prevents you from overequipping your weapon if you are into that sort of thing.<br>
<br>
However, Blessed with Thunder is rather different from Attack of the Snake and Bird of Prey.  In addition to its initial damage (148pts with your Q56 version), several other things happen.  Landing the attack also nets you a melee damage shield for 20 seconds, with reflect amounts varying from 20 to 80 pts for QL 55 to 200.  Furthermore, hitting someone with BwT places a DoT on them (Damage over Time) that does almost the exact same amount as the initial BwT melee strike, but it repeats as energy damage 6 times every 10 seconds (so it continues to damage them for a full minute).  It also locks your MA skill for 40s preventing you from using another special attack until that period elapses.<br>
<br>
So let's do a little math here.  With the lowest level BwT (Q55), you hit for 145 melee, then 145 energy 6x every 10s, for a grand total of 145*7 over 1 minute, or 1,015 pts/min.  This 1,015 pts of damage is in addition to your regular fist attacks.  It's essentially a lot of extra FREE damage, with a melee reflect shield thrown in as a bonus.<br>
<br>
Compare with a Q55 Snake which does ~69pts of damage every 11s, or ~380/min, or a Q55 Bird of Prey which does ~126pts every 22s, or ~416/minute.  As you can see, a Q55 BwT is way outta their league, with nearly 3 times that damage over time at over 1,000pts/min.  <br>
<br>
And yet you think it sucks?  Interesting.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Anecdote:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Back in the days when MAs didn't completely suck at PvP, I was shooting for my Apprentice title in MMD as a lowly level 60ish MA.  I would usually just stand out in the 25% gas and let whomever felt up to it come and attack me.  One particular day, this rather unprepared melee adventurer decided to take me on, and we began our battle.  I opened with my usual brawl, then immediately followed up with my Q110 or so BwT, which does a hefty DoT of about 300 pts a pop.  I then hit him with BioMet Incompetence for -20 to his BM, hoping it would block his best heal.  It did, apparently...which seemed to rattle him a lot when he went to heal himself.  He used a first aid stim while scrambling for his older &quot;backup&quot; heal, but my crits, brawls and BwT were wearing him down.  After about 40s, my martial arts skill unlocked, and I hit him with BwT again, shortly before he died.  Well, the poor guy had saved there in MMD, and so I saw him rez at the nearby terminal, with a fraction of his full health, as we all know while sitting at the reclaim.  To his amazement, since my 60 seconds of BwT DoT damage had only recently been refreshed, he continued to take the 300 pts of DoT damage after he rezzed...and so he died to my BwT TWICE.<br>
<br>
BwT is the BEST MA special attack in the game for damage over time.  As an aside, Flower of Life is arguably one of the best special attacks overall, thanks to the awesome save-your-@ss healing.  Both should be an integral part of every MAs arsenal for both PvM and PvP (if any MAs are foolish enough to actually PvP anymore).<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Parry is far from a useless skill to have.  I suggest every MA go check out some Deflection Shields.  They come in a variety of flavors, for melee/proj, cold, fire, energy, radiation and chemical damage.  By the time you can use the lowest BwT, you can use a Q50+ Deflection Shield.  A Q50 deflection shield will add somewhere around +400-500 to your specific AC for ~23s.  A Q160 Deflection Shield would add something around +4000 to your ACs.  Scenario: Getting hammered by that red Enforcer mob who's doing more than minimum damage to you every hit?  Don't know if you'll be around long enough to get off your next heal while the last one is recharging?  Hit your Q55 deflection shield, and subtract an extra 40-50 pts of damage from his attacks over the next 20+ seconds.  It's like having an extra 800-1000 health.  That get your attention?  <br>
<br>
Deflection shields lock Parry for 5 minutes, so you can repeat it a few fights later.  Since every armor type has at least one damage type vulnerability, the smart MA makes SURE that s/he carries a deflection shield to cover that weakness, if available (there are no deflect shields for poison damage...sorry).  MP Mobs taking you to the mat with their nasty chemical damage?  Hello, Chemical Deflection Shield.  Thus ends the lesson.<br>
<br>
To summarize:  If you are fighting with a full team and the Mobs are dying in 20 seconds or less, don't bother with BwT.  Use Bird of Prey instead, since BwT delivers its damage over 60 seconds.  But against boss mobs, with partial teams, or when soloing, BwT is the MA special attack of choice.  Ignore it at your own peril.  For claw/weapon users...I can't recommend it as strongly, but it's for you to decide if you want the hassle of unequipping/triggering/re-equipping every 40 seconds to do the extra damage.<br>

I am a MA from before claws and all that crap, so I am a purist. I am a fist only MA and swear by BwT and Deflection shields. Why a MA would ever waste IP to use weapons I don't know. If you want to use weapons, play a different proffesion. No other proffession in the game is as good at unarmed combat as us. In conjuction, many proffessions in the game are MUCH better with weapons than an MA, albeit, not as fun(except for enforcer IMO). Also remember, its not always about how much damage you do, but how mch you take that also decides the outcome of a battle.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;The best way to know the road ahead is to ask someone coming back.&quot; Chinese Proverb-Probably Confucious or another equally short, fat, smelly, little Asian man....<br>
<br>
Oh almost forgot... the story about killing the guy twice with BwT. My own little version goes more like:<br>
<br>
<br>
I am fighting a friend in the arena. We were the same level, he a soldier and I an &lt;MA&gt;. We were pretty much neck and neck until his burst refreshed and he killed me, but not before I could land one more BwT on his sorry ass. I died, and sitting at reclaim I get a /tell from him. &quot;you killed me after you died lol.&quot; To which I replied &quot;How? Did my DoT not stop after I died?&quot; To which there was no reply for a few minutes, until I see &quot;WTF you killed me again?!!?!&quot; &quot;Lol&quot;, I said &quot;you may have killed me first but I killed you twice :P&quot; I thought it was great. Now that I think about this, a bunch of MA's defending a tower, or attacking one for that matter could send a alot of people to reclaim for an extended period of time. That is IF any of the MA's made to the point where they actually killed any of the other team.<br>

You have to find it from loot (mob, chest, mish prize). Maybe from bosses too, not sure about them.<br>

Easiest way (most people will tell you) is to just download ClickSaver and get BwT as a mish prize. <p>Bellerephon<br>

So if you started with a 14 pt reflect shield in the first fight of the mission, it could be well over 200 by the time it sorted itself out. LOL, I cleared entire missions just because of my &quot;uber&quot; reflect shield. Ahh, but I digress, that nice little addition didn't last too long. Who said all bugs had to be detrimental, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

First saw it at NW Mines when a Q50 or so MA had been out hunting there for a while without zoning, and his reflect shield was stacking in the hundreds.  He was mowing down those melee mutants like nobody's business.  He studiously avoided the tacs and eyes, however...since they do chem and energy damage.<br>
<br>
Ah, the good ol' days.<br>
<br>
Roll missions for BwT.  Same for deflect shields.  They pop up with regularity.  Remember, however, that BwT does NOT show up sub Q55...that's it's lowest quality level.<br>
