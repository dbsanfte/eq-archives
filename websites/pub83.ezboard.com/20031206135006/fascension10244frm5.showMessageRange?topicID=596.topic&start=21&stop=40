Ok, one more time and one more tainted application thread: DoZ Lost! Get it through your head!! You were given the chance the first time we knew you lost to disband and all but sadko get off kos without paying ANYTHING, you chose NOT TO!! Therefore, YOU ARE TEH KOS, YOU AM TEH DIE! You basically have no right to come here and stop people from applying because you did in fact lose but are too dillusional to realize it, you should be sucking the toes of AD for actually recognizing you as a guild.<br>

He tries to be fair to all and gives respect where it is due.  He is a rockin ganter (yes, gay + enchanter = ganter) and I would stand beside him through thick and thin.  It saddens me that he is leaving MIM, but having respect as I do for AD, I know he will be happy and an excellent addition to your ranks.  I could babble on about how much of a great guy he is and stuff, but his actions have shown this to everyone already.  Strydere is one of the most honorable guys I know.<br>
<br>
With that being said...best wishes Strydere and congrats AD should you choose to accept such a valuable person.<br>

<br>
Seeing as Sadko recently ninja'd our mob, listen to his babble, then watch his smooth talking save his head from the execution block time and time again -- coupled with your annoying banter, shit talking, training, blah blah blah blah blah -- DoZ, in my own personal opinion, seems to be a smallish guild of griefing assholes who is letting their blood shed spread into the backyards of those not involved... thus dragging them into the frey as well, willingly or not.<br>
<br>
I have zoned into Seeknd's &quot;parked mob posse&quot; in BoT a few times... so much that I've started going in invisible.  Then the recent crap with Sadko, and probably a few megs of DoZ/MIM shit talk in my logs.  If it were up to me, I wouldn't honor DoZ's KOS list in the slightest... and surely wouldn't have let Sadko off KOS as easily as he was.  Guess it's good for DoZ that it isn't up to me?<br>
<br>
PS - I've never had the problems with MIM that I do with DoZ... and they're exponentially larger, so you guys must just be more concentrated version of asses!?!?<br>
<br>
Derailed the thread a bit, have had good praise for you Stryder -- best of luck on your application sir.  <br>

I can't stop you from giving your opinion, you are entitled to it.  However I feel it is innaccurate because all the people who have left MiM in the past, we did not have a problem with.  I would also like to point out that MiM Ranger just left and applied to your guild and we did not say he was KoS or anything else(Don't even want or need a post from him).<br>
<br>
People we say are KoS we say it for reason.<br>
<br>
Faysuns are all pals.<br>
<br>
We as a guild have to be careful that ANY Faysuns who leave and thus apply to the same guild, carry with them no grudge.  That would be swell, our enemies, who talk mad trash about us, all join a guild, then talk mad trash about us in that guild.  A main reason is during this war it became evident that they did carry a grudge with them all the way back from OM.<br>
<br>
Now I will say this.  Strydere is a lot more level headed and calmer individual than Srobb.<br>
<br>
We want no more grudges with Faysuns who leave MiM and apply to AD.  We want this all put behind us.  I don't want friends in AD sending me a tell how they are talking behind our back.  We want this grudge over and done with.<br>
<br>
That is what we are most worried about.  I believe we would be happy as long as Strydere posts that he has no hard feelings and the past war is the past and he is intent with moving on and leaving us alone.  So Strydere, as long as you can agree to move past this it would lower the paranoia of my guildmates and post how you have no ill intention towards us and etc.  This paranoia is warranted to them because it has happened to us before, where people moved on and said they didn't want to war us, and next thing we know, all the ones we felt held a grudge, apply to MiM and we warring them again.  That is in part my fault, I should of had them post in public how they hold no grudge, war was fun for awhile, time to move on, no hard feelings.<br>
<br>
I am just trying to explain how from past experiences it has left a lot of my guildmates on edge.  It also seems like a simple request for Stydere, if he is wanting to move on in EQ and put the past wars behind him and hold no grudge.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions Stydere just email me Notredamex@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
TL<br>
<br>
<br>
ps. If Eqnium leaves gonna want the same from him, just a heads up on that one.  My magic 8 ball says he will.<br>

also, once accepted as an AD recruit and as guildmates no one is allowed to continue any personal vendettas or grudges (in terms of their actions) against any guild or person from their past <br>
<br>
<br>
Despite that, i believe your request is fair since there is no guarantee that anyone makes it as either an applicant or a recruit and without assurance on their part they have relinquished the grudge, there would be no reason to drop KoS... and letting just those ppl off because they apply to ad with no assurance from them to discontinue the war would be unwise on the part of DoZ<br>

And to back up what everyone else has said, strydere owns and is a great enchanter with great playtime.  And he's pretty good at boxing the little dorf as well <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shimm59@ascension10244>shimm59</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#333333>(11/12/03 5:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=596.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bah</span><hr size=1> GL on your app Strydere. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cepheusrz>cepheusRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#333333>(11/12/03 7:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=596.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.planetburlington.com/budance.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bah</span><hr size=1> Strydere's a good guy.

I think Strydere would make a great member of AD.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=alurarz>Alura RZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#333333>(11/12/03 10:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=596.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bah</span><hr size=1> Sadko wrote:<br>

&quot;How about Mediman? He deserved to be trained and corpsecamped by Ubertanka while MiM officers assured him he was not KoS to MiM? He deserved that eh?&quot;<br>
<br>
How does a warrior corpse camp a shaman?  ? My snare whip land on him or something? And mediman will actually say I trained him? <br>
<br>
Btw, Strydere is a great enchanter.  Was always dependable and sharp.  <br>

Speaking to Strydere's application:  His skills as an enchanter are superb.  He is also quite able with his cleric.  He is focused and he enjoys the game.  Given what I know of Ascending Dawn, he would not only fit in well but would be a grand asset.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your application, Stry. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Symgharl Val`Sharess</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
