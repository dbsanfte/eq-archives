I'm sure people in AD have corpse camped, hell I know I have... that comes from having it done to you.  You all chose who you got in bed with, just because they are no longer a factor does not mean that we should stop fighting.  I happen to think there are lots of quality people in BoK, but that is no reason to end something like this.  <br>
<br>
Whats to happen if FU comes back, forms Rebirth again?  What guarentee can you give that BoK won't go back to that?  What guarentee can you give that members of BoK wont heal and assist PB members we are fighting?  You can't do that. so as I see it we can't stop fighting.<br>

And yes, Brilbane was stolen from Belayne.  Bel bought the acct from the guy and the mother fucker stole it.

Now we find FU gone for the most part and the people left behind (BOK and RB) want to peace.  Lets think about why...hmm.  I'm drawing a blank.  <br>
<br>
As far as the being inconsistent comment that started this thread, our actions make perfect sense.  Un-KOSIng OM wasn't a hard decision.  They weren't complete cocks to us, like BOK and PB members.  They also didn't use Ice Trainer and similar shit.  Un-KOSing people who leave our KOS'd enemies makes sense too.  Makes you guys weaker every time somebody leaves.<br>
<br>
This war became personal for a lot of people a long time ago.  I don't really think there's any way to remedy that.  This is sorta why I love Rallos Zek.  Wars are always so incredibly interesting.<br>

Verify that these trainers even EXIST to be used, and I will give your statement credibility.  Until then, how about you go use an /ooc hack.  I'll even start up a search for one.  Gee, maybe OJ made them and is perpetrating these hacks upon the RZ population!<br>
<br>
Belayne?  I wouldnt believe anything that comes out of his mouth, as I have seen him tell 2 different stories to different people depending where they stood about the same event.  Moreover, I know that he has been decietful in the past.  Ruhi saying this or that, tell me how to distiguish what you are saying as opposed to simply parroting what he yet again claims?  Isnt it odd, YET, that all these disasters keep happening to the SAME PERSON? Or perhaps there might be something to what folks have been saying aside from what he says.<br>
<br>
I have much less simpathy for the issue now, but still, if you can provide ANY insight as to why it is more likely than not that Brilbane (current) ripped off the Brilbane account, I would not only be happy to remove him but would consider KOS on him as well.  Failing ANY credible evidence to support yet another of what appears to be Belayne's continued persecution, try to get facts before spreadng hearsay.<br>

<br>
2)  As such, I do apologize for laughing at Ruhi's claim.<br>
<br>
3)  But, if such an ICE worked with EQ, then EQ has failed to suitably protect logic routines by having them on the server rather than client in my opinion.  (In other words, this means the server accepts results from the client rather than cues.)<br>
<br>
4)  In which case the assurances given to me during beta were at best misleading.<br>
<br>
Online game programmers, specifically those in the realm of multiplayer interactive games with a persistant element, have known or should have known that the only way to obtain a &quot;hack resistant&quot; game environment where players depend on the game code to keep a level playing field insofar as the game mechanics themselves are applied, is to limit or remove client logic.<br>
<br>
That this is not the case seriously undermines the stability of the platform as a &quot;judge&quot; device.<br>
<br>
5)  As to your comment that &quot;Dude, nobody in AD uses Trainers... I know people in BoK have. I dont know if they continue to do so, but I know it was done.&quot; let me start here:  Name the person.  I would seriously like to know.  Tell me in game if ya like.  On the other hand, I can specifically name a member of AD who was banned for their use now, as that info was given to me to solidify the claim these programs exist.<br>
<br>
Thus your statement, claiming AD is free of such use, and then attacking BOK on alleged past use while AD members specifically in the past have been banned as such, does little to credit your claim or your guild.<br>
<br>
I state that in response to you.  However, Adell assures me that such use has been rejected by AD to the extent possible by peers.  I am hoping this is the case.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hackability&quot; of a game removes the desire for me to play.  Who the hell would want to sit at a game of poker knowing some people there had means to see your cards?<br>
<br>
Not I.<br>
<br>
To help counter this, Adell has pointed out that the patch in recent memory that shortly after resulted in mass bannings for 3rd party software may mean that Verant is better able to detect and then act on such hacking.  If this is the case, then they have a reactive response that may minimize damage until...<br>
<br>
Luclin's &quot;new engine&quot; may address many of the material client logic issues that now distress me.  Rather than flat out quit as I thought I might do (again, who wants to play in hackfest when you dont have the means to compete legitimately?) I'm going to give VI the benefit of the doubt and play for at least a short time after Luclin and decide then.<br>
<br>
6) Your next claim is spread between two replies so I consolidate them here:<br>
&quot;And yes, Brilbane was stolen from Belayne. Bel bought the acct from the guy and the mother fucker stole it. So that in itself will keep people from FS killing that cocksucker. . . Hmmmm... if the acct wasnt jacked from Bel, how would I know the Username is davidrhill?&quot;<br>
<br>
I will give just one scenario that should address this, my only position is that you do not condemn someone on the claims of a biased party that gains from those claims:<br>
<br>
Assume Bril and Bel are so-so pals.  At some point in time Bril and Bel share account info to advance mutual goals, such as securing a res, or CR, or helping exp, or twink, whatever.  I am certain that many people who do not know eachother in real life have shared account info on nothing more than &quot;knowing&quot; eachother in game.<br>
<br>
Assume further that these two drifted apart, or became hostile to one another.  Again, we have seen that former allies can become enemies with simple twists of fate in game, no?<br>
<br>
This would leave Bel with the account name of Bril, who then says &quot;Bril was stolen from me, I can prove it! His account name is 'davidrhill'!&quot;<br>
<br>
Or lets change this a bit.  Bril trades his account for Bor, over time, Bor becomes bored with his &quot;Bril&quot; account and sells it to Bel, who perhaps is unaware.  Then Bor, not having a character, ganks back from Bril the &quot;Bor&quot; account.  Bril, now screwed by Bor and based on the even account trade, ganks back the &quot;Bril&quot; account.  Leaving Bril with Bril, Bor with Bor and Bel's cash, and Bel with no account and out cash.<br>
<br>
In neither example would Bril be the &quot;evil doer&quot;.<br>
<br>
7)  If you are going to trade or sell your account, be wary of who you get in bed with.  Be safe, get a contract that can be reasonably established and enforced.  Even if it cannot secure ACCESS to the account, it does facilitate actions to seek redress in the real world.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   If Belayne can substantiate his claim, then I am relatively certain that he can remove Brilbane from BOK by informing Verant of the issue and having the account banned.  If he cant substantiate it, then most likely all he is doing is yet again ruining another persons rep by blowing gas up people's asses.<br>
<br>
SUMMARY:<br>
Ruhi, I apologize for laughing at the notion that hack programs are / were in use in EQ.<br>
Verant appears to have banned many for their use.<br>
Yet I am unaware of anyone in BOK having been banned for such, or even being rumored to have been baneed as such.  Nor do you indicate who in BOK you suspect.  Nor do you state whether the person remains in BOK that you do suspect, if any.<br>
The same cannot be said for AD at least in regards to past use, as related to me by Adell.<br>
<br>
Rile<br>

PS: Name of former AD not stated as I am unsure if Adell told that to me in confidence or for public posting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uruhi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruhi</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://moffon.homestead.com/files/weedmart.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 281<br> <font color=#333333>(11/6/01 9:04:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ruhi</span><hr size=1> I did infact mention names that not only I believe to using Hacks...

<br>
I know Singho used a speed hack like a moron, and was banned... my responce to that is good ridence.  THat kind of shit only fucks up my fun in EQ.  <br>
<br>
To get back to the Brilbane issue.  I know Belayne (Jonathan) bought the acct from the guy using it now.  He was a former FSer.  Bel sold Bel, then twinked up another char.  He finally realized his true calling as a cleric and wanted one back.  About the same time he wanted a cleric, Brilbane was going thru some RL problems, or at least thats what he told us (FS).  He wanted to sell and he did to Jonathan.  The reason I know the username is because Jonathan let the guild as a whole use him.  And FS was a very small tight nit group.  Nobody in FS would fuck another over.  Hell some of us have even hung out together in RL, and plan on doing it again.  <br>
<br>
I'm very sure the former Bril, davidrhill, got his shit together (or so he thinks) decided to play EQ again, and didnt want a lvl 1.... The acct will be banned any day now, but its a major major issue to me and those who all know Bel and care about him getting dicked over.<br>
<br>
BTW Thanks for the apology.  It wasn't necessary but it is apreciated.<br>

    The shit that both sides did during the war is one thing.  All that stuff is in the mechanics of the game and will always be a problem.  I think PB dragged all of us down in these tactics. <br>
<br>
Hacking, I can say that anyone in AD caught doing this shit will get booted and KOSed by admission of the entire AD council.  Ya can beleive it or not but I'm telling you that is a line that we will not cross.  We don't want those players in this guild.<br>
<br>
Ganking someones account... this is something that should hit us all at the core.  Years of effort down the tubes etc.  Belayne did pull up a contract and is working to get the account banned.  Either way he's left with nothing.  He's our friend and that sucks.  How would BoK feel if suddenly one of your guildmates gets his account stolen and then you see him or her guilded in AD?  Pretty shitty I'll bet.  My question is this, Brilbane was guilded as AD not a month ago and suddenly now is in BoK.  If you dont know the owner how do you know he's not a spy?  AD won't guild any prior FU, PB or BoK yet you seem to have no trouble with this.  If you seriously want to persue a peace process with AD, you should start by booting the player who jacked one if it's clerics accounts.  <br>

While your info on it seems a plausible scenario, it does not on its face mean it is the correct scenario.  It does however, provide merit enough for me to talk to the guy about it at least.

<br>
Every damn one of them fucks should be banned from EQ.. Using ShowEQ/Trainer and speed hacks make the game not fun... Its not fair when you have a person down to 10% in a duel and they run like spirit of cheetah fast and you only have jboots and thats what they are casting cause they are a warrior....  <br>

   I would agree with you wholeheartedly if this was a long time BoK player like yourself.  But Brilbane WAS in AD untill very recently.  Thus long time loyalty to BoK does not exist nor are you protecting one of your own.  I can say that this will be a bone of contention that wont just go away.  Brilbane will be KOS'ed for life untill Belayne gets his account back or it gets banned.  Not because he was in BoK or because of this war, but because the owner of the account is a good friend of ours.  I appeal to you, one gamer to another, don't encourage this type of player by attempting to shelter him.  Many guilds share information at one time for another.  To use an analogy, 'there is a fox in your henhouse'.  No matter what happens during the war, how much I hate a particular player at times, I don't want to see any player loose his account this way.  <br>

Danforth:  Agreed.  Hacking destroys games almost as fast as biased customer support.  Also, when people say their account was hacked, I agree with Verant... under MOST circumstances it is someone you gave the info to that is fucking you.  If you cant bear the risk, dont do it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/urelgbladestorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RelgBladestorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 223<br> <font color=#333333>(11/9/01 2:58:54 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Inconsistant?</span><hr size=1> Bah, you did too bail on sabbat and were planning it a long time coming.  I happen to know of your new 'sect' planned long before FU left and lugoj returned with his shit.  FU leaving had nothing to do with someone getting loots on Gestahl claiming it was him, they all left to start a sect with BOK and probably PB (although PB wasnt in for sure when sabbat still existed).<br>
<br>
You all just used Lugoj/us leaving as an excuse, but you were unloyal to Sabbat far before any of that went down.<br>
<br>
So please don't lie, k! <p>Relg Bladestorm - 57 Outrider of Rallos Zek<br>

New Sect plan?<br>
I trust your dumbass conclusion refers to Invictus Dom.<br>
I consistently posted on the private forums that ID was NOT to 'take or supplant' Sabbat.  ID was to be a guild capable of doing stuff so that its members did not feel the need to join a sect like Sabbat or Synergy but that could join either at their chosing.<br>
<br>
Both Synergy and Sabbat rules allowed for doing stuff as a guild, just that members of one sect could not be a member of another sect.<br>
<br>
This was the goal.  That some saw it as a way that they could still do events and LEAVE Sabbat or Synergy was their perogative.  The majority clearly saw it as: a means to bridge the hostility between Sabbat and Synergy; could do things as a guild without the need to be a member of a sect; could support a sect as well (obviously for those who play a lot, a sect doesnt do enough, nor does a guild... but together should fill their time with meaningful play.)<br>
<br>
Many people from many guilds had informally agreed with the plan, and it was rolled out.  Sabbat falling apart led to ID falling apart.  This, above everything else, should point to the fact that the ideal of ID would be guild AND sect, not one at the expense of the other.<br>
<br>
When Sabbat was falling apart, I consistantly pushed for change, any change, that may pull it back together while striving to make sure people weren't made into scapegoats, such as Adell.<br>
<br>
Doing so may have made me unpopular on both sides (those for the Lugoj push and those for the status quo), but at least I have a clean conscience knowing I tried to make it work in a constructive manner.<br>
<br>
So next time you decide to make half-assed accusations, do try to get your facts straight, at least in regards with whom you direct those accusations.<br>
