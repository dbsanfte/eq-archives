While that is still true in all 3 cases to some degree, my life is so busy right now that I feel that I'm letting ya'll down and TPB as a name.<br>
<br>
I have 3 choices here.  I can let things slide like they are now, but that irks me.  I spent a lot of time on this place and you guys as a community have made it something pretty fucking cool -- no reason to let that get tarnished.  I can close it all down, but screw that ... this site will be staying open.<br>
<br>
Soo ... I'm thinking about adding a news monkey.  This person will be doing updates on the main news site 4-5 times a week.  What I am looking for is:<br>
<br>
(1) Someone that plays the game seriously, and will be for quite some time.<br>
<br>
(2) Someone that can not only write well, but with just that right touch of acerbic wit and sarcasm that I do.  That does not mean I want a Sensei clone, just someone that is, well, funny.  And knows how to spell and punctuate properly.<br>
<br>
(3) No die-hard roleplayers.  I don't run storyline and the same guild dribble I read about on every AO site for a reason, and TPB will not be doing so in the future.  If you want that shit go write for AO Vault or something.<br>
<br>
So I'm thinking this is going to be an audition.  What I want you to do is write up 2 news articles in the next 2 weeks (this sucker will end next weekend).  Post them as replies to this thread, and I'll see what I think and post who gets the job after 2 weekends from now.  Hint: spellcheck the damn thing.  Make sure it flows well.  Make it funny without trying to look like you're making it funny.<br>
<br>
Big hint:  if you really want to score points, get the TPB flavah in there.  Read our archives, etc.  I'd rather not throw the TPB crew into a culture shock by adding some nitwit that writes like the boobs at the big commercial sites or is incapable of doing anything more than research and cut n' pasting.<br>
<br>
Don't email me about this.  I don't like email.  Even email with good lesbian porn in it.  That's all ... any questions?  No?  Good, there shouldn't be any.  It's not rocket science, just rantin'.<br>

<br>
In a suprise development, industry powerhouse GameSpy chose to interview a couple of losers from Funcom, about their work on Anarchy Online. Ace GameSpy reporter Kazi Wren caught up with Funcom developers Swede Kvetchmo and Rhagnar Pørnquest last week, and some very interesting conversation ensued...<br>
<br>
        ----<br>
<br>
GameSpy: Guys, you've taken a lot of flak over AO, and there are still substantial elements of the community that are very unhappy with Funcom. What's the bottom line here for you?<br>
<br>
Pørnquest: OK, Tricia, here's the bottom line for us. We have sold nearly a quarter million copies of AO. We have established a respectable market share. We have won a Game of the Year award from a major PC gaming magazine. And we have a substantial influx of new players in the european market. These are all the things we need to get financing for our next game. We have succeeded with AO, according to the standards that these things are measured by in the industry. And anybody who doesn't like that, can just fuck right off.<br>
<br>
        ----<br>
<br>
GameSpy: What's downtime like for you? What do you do to just &quot;chill the hell out?&quot;<br>
<br>
Pørnquest: Well, Swede here spends a lot of time in the gay chat rooms on AOL, of course...<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: RAG! Jesus, just embarass the hell out of me in front of everybody why don't you?<br>
<br>
Pørnquest: What, you didn't want them to know you are gay?<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: Huh? Oh, no. I don't have a problem with that part, I just wish to hell you hadn't told the world I use AOL.<br>
<br>
        ----<br>
<br>
GameSpy: OK, guys, now what about the sex thing? You have to admit there is some pretty pervasive sexual symbolism in AO.<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: Excellent question, Tricia, and I'm glad you brought that up!<br>
<br>
Pørnquest: It's the animals.<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: Exactly, the sexual symbolism of the animals. Just think about all those Adventurer morphs, eh? And of course, for us as norwegians, the reindeer is the animal with most powerful symbolism of all. In fact, among the ancient tribes of Old Norway, sex with reindeer was a rite of passage for young boys.<br>
<br>
Pørnquest: Yeah, hah, a coming of age, so to speak.<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: This is the hidden secret of the MMORPG community, this symbolism is everywhere! Ok, like for example, take Sensei, the MA guy. We watch his site, The Dojo...<br>
<br>
Pørnquest: Punching Bag, Swede. Dojo was the old EQ site.<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: Yeah, right, the Punching Bag, anyways. We watch this site, like we do Agent Sector, really closely. I mean, if we're going to truly piss these people off, we have to know what makes them mad, right?<br>
<br>
(sadistic laughter)<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: Anyways, Sensei uses this symbol on his posts, this little animated GIF of a kitten washing itself. Now you tell me, Rhag, what is the symbolism here?<br>
<br>
Pørnquest: That's easy, &quot;I want to lick pussy&quot;<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: (laughing) It's a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  kitten</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Rhag, not a cat.<br>
<br>
Pørnquest: &quot;I want to lick young pussy&quot;<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: (laughing hysterically) ...and it's washing itself.<br>
<br>
Pørnquest: &quot;I want to lick <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  clean</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> young pussy&quot;<br>
<br>
(long pause)<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: So, as you can clearly see, the symbolism is everywhere.<br>
<br>
        ----<br>
<br>
GameSpy: How did you develop the story of AO? It can't be easy coming up with a story for a MMORPG.<br>
<br>
Kvetchmo: I was spending 24/7 making DOOM maps when AO was conceived, so I...<br>
<br>
GameSpy: WHAT!? DOOM? DOOM?? And you call yourself a mapper? That's it, fuck you both. This interview is over, and HELLCHICK can interview you next time!<br>

Could 14.0 be the first patch to go off without a hitch? I would answer that for you but my patcher kept crashing so it took me 2 hours to find out. <br>
<br>
 I'm sure you all know every grey cloud has a silver lining. I got to see Tarasque killed 5 million times in the period of about 30 minutes. Killed Morgan Le Faye 5 times or so because of server resets. If you dont know who she is, she drops the MA coveted Torture tool in avalon castle. we had 2 or 3 torturetools drop. yours truely got one;] this crashing, a feature or bug ? you decide.<br>
<br>
I got to do some PvP and let me tell you, the dmg type change is pretty nice along with the init. fix. Nothing like smackin' someone around with chemical damage at 100 mph.<br>
<br>
Also worth mention is a thread on tpb which related to the dmg type change for fists. I did test this and apparently its true. The Ma buffs dont just change fist dmg type, they change gun dmg type as well.<br>
<br>
BUT WAIT!!!! before you go starting another thread somewhere bitching about traders remember the fist buffs are MA only so the only ones who can use them to change dmg type are MAs and Agents in FP. <br>

You are sitting there reading this because, well, a multitude of reasons. <br>
#1. The servers are down and I'm bored.<br>
#2. If everyone in this community has noticed or not, Sensei, in his initial post to this thread, basically said, &quot;Hey, this place I made here is something I'm proud of. I like the people and the time I've spent here. I don't know how to tell you this, but its starting to not do it for me.&quot;  Now I think we as a community had failed him in this request.  Look at this thread! Two honest attempts, and then basically crap spam.  &quot;Less than fucking impressed&quot; - Sensei<br>
#3. If nothing else this will BUMP the thread back to the main page so everyone can again see the chickenshit inside themselves, as they totally avoid this thread like the plague.<br>
#4. After a week or two mindstorming, I finally figured out a newsworthy topic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, now that all besides the totally mind dead are on the same page, I would like to share (or warn you about, you decide) some information about myself with you.<br>
<br>
A) I'm the king daddy of run on sentences, that have lots of commas, that never ever end, and 90% of the time, sentences I have created, should be totally rewritten, to make even a modicum of sense.  Hey, I'm not a writer, reporter, scripter, or anything of the like.  So sue me (especially if u commit suicide after this). At least I'm stepping up to the plate, unlike the rest of you slackasses that let this thread slip to the second page.<br>
B) I'm a big fan of lists.  If you haven't already noticed.<br>
C) I play three characters in AO.  A level 159 Martial Artist named ostioperosis (which is spelled incorrectly ;D bonus points with Sensei). A level 101 Engie named Doombot (which is nothing spectacular, aside from the point the name Doombot wasn't taken). Last but not least, a level 9 Freshman agent named Skinfluter. <br>
D) I have not posted here often, but i have read large portions of the forums.  I am a firm believer in &quot;SHUT THE FUCK UP&quot;, and only post when something clicks in the old noggin'. Which you can tell by the amount of posts I've made, it is a rare thing indeed.<br>
<br>
Well, on with the show.<br>
<br>
The first hurdle with this newsmonkey business (sorry had to) was that, well, not much on Rubi-ka that is actually news worthy.  There is the lame excuse for a storyline bullshit, ie. &quot;the dust brigade strikes again&quot;. Which, in my opinion, is about as interesting as a wet sock (unless you're into that sort of thing).  Then there is &quot;how will funcom put the FU in fun next?&quot;, ie. what is the next patch going to fuck up.  Other than those two things, no one really gives a rats ass about what is going on.  <br>
<br>
The second hurdle was convincing myself I could tailor an article entertaining enough, informative enough, and spelled-checked enough, to pass for an honest attempt, and to maybe show Sensei,  Yes! The shit you do round here is appreciated still, don't stop or we will fire bomb your house, prick!<br>
<br>
Warning, the following article contains no nudity, and language that every 5th grader already knows. Your time will be best spent elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Decranium MKII armor.  If you don't know what this is, or just unsure about how to obtain yourself some, continue reading. If you already have a full set, go rub one off or something.  Decranium armor drops from mobs called smugglers, in a place called, you guessed it, the smugglers den.  This armor is special in that, a full set of seven pieces, adds 49 ncu and 980 max hp.  Fairly handy considering any buff worth a used condom is 30+ ncu, and extra hp is never a bad thing.  Which is why you may have noticed an increasing amount of higher level characters wearing a bastard mix of grey and black armor with a black hood.  It isn't the nicest looking get up, but if u wish to stay competitive, especially in the pvp world, MKII is a necessity.<br>
<br>
So how do we get this stupid looking crap osti, you ask.  Being I'm a fan of lists, I will go through the 4 easy steps of a smugglers den run.<br>
<br>
#1. Forming a team, and getting into the den.<br>
<br>
There are two ways into the den.  The front door and the back door (I'm a back door man myself, ladies feel free to email).  The front door lies in southern fouls hills, and you have to get through a part of the mantis cave just to get into the &quot;den&quot; area.  This is an option if you have an area mezzing crat, if you do not have this in your team, I do not recommend going that way.  The second and most often used method is the &quot;back door&quot;, which lies at 720 x 700 Borealis.  If you go to these coords and walk into the door there, you will see what looks like a lift or elevator with a button and some high tech gear around you.  This is where you would end up if you stepped into the teleporter behind Ash Anderson at the end of the smugglers den dungeon.  It is a one way ride, but due to a bug of some sort, you can use this doorway to get into the heart of the smugglers den area.  To exploit this bug, your team will need an engie or advent.  With an adventurer, he simply casts calias form parrot upon the party, and you fly through the door. Instead of being in the high tech room, you will find yourself in the den.  With an engineer (the scotty method), he must enter the high tech room, turn right, and stand in the small wing.  Once there he/she can beacon warp himself or others of the party right into the den. There is some trial and error here.  There is a sweet spot in the right wing area that works every time.  I know not exactly (I was always the warpee not the waprer)  but once you find it it works like a charm.  There is also one other way to get into the den, but only good for that one person.  A MP can fly through the door using quantam wings, and will find himself in the den, and an agent can duplicate that feat with a false profession MP.<br>
<br>
Now when you go to get a group together to do this, you know you must have an advent or an engie.  The next piece of the jigsaw puzzle is ....<br>
<br>
#2. Breaking the spawn.<br>
<br>
The first obstacle you will find, is that in the room you warp to from the backdoor, there is usually a mob.  At level 140 I could easily solo this mob, but other professions might find it difficult.  This is important if you are using an engie to warp in, because the engie's pet will not go with him when he warps himself.  I have found it to be a better idea, for the engie to warp a can of whoop ass down before himself, to clear the way.  Once that room is secure and the entire party is down, you will need to deal with 3 rooms of multiple mobs.  One that has 6-7 smugglers that are dark orange to a 140ish level player, is by far the hardest.  Unless your packing some serious ass stomping ability, a mezz type is highly recommended.  The smugglers themselves do not agro, but the robotic types, and dog mobs do, and when they do they bring every smuggler in the area with them. The trick is to clear out all agro type mobs before you go into area with the heavy hitters.  If at any time you get agro'd, DO NOT run around like a complete fucking idiot and get your whole team killed. If you get agro stop where you are, tell your team, and take care of the agro before you pull the house in on yourself.  If you get agro'd by alot of mobs, run away from your party if you have to, run to the teleporter behind ash and get out. Do anything BUT run toward your party, and especially toward the engineer, if that is how you got it.  If the engineer lives, you will spend 5 minutes waiting to get back in, instead of a half hour for your whole team to res.  So, once your in the warp to room, due east is where you should hit first.  There you will find 3 agro type mobs, and a smuggler.  Again, take out all agro before proceeding.  In this room you will see a bridge, and once you have cleared this room you can either jump up on the bridge, or back track through the start room and go west.  If you go west you will find 2 agro type mobs, and a smuggler.  This west room has the stairs which lead to the bridge in the east room.  Once you have cleared both the east and the west rooms, you can take the stairs to the bridge.  Cross the bridge easily because you have cleared all the argo mobs before hand. Once across you will be faced with the hardest room.  6-7 smugglers, and a den adamant hound (which was called a den adamant bitch pre 14.1) the hound will agro your entire party in a blink of an eye, bringing 7 high hp smugglers to come make your party 6 messy stains on the floor.  If the hound is there it's either mezz or rezz my friends.  If you manage to clear this center room, you have succeeded in breaking the spawn.  The rest is cake, as long as you avoid Ash Anderson.  A room south with 3 smugglers, a wing east with 5 in separate rooms, a wing north with 3-4, and one west behind Ash Anderson in the teleporter room.  Ash Anderson, who is this guy I've been name dropping the entire time.  Ash Anderson is your worst fucking nightmare.  He has ruined more den excursions for me, than the fabricated picture of a hairy man with a vagina on steakandcheese.com some dickhead emailed me the link too, has ruined my wet dreams. Ash Anderson is a mix between Rambo and Bruce Lee except 1000 times more pissed off.  He will fuck you up.  He will fuck your slayerdroid up.  He will fuck your demon up.  He will then fuck your party up, and find your other friends online and fuck them up for shits and giggles.  I saw him killed once.  2 slayers, a demon, 2 level 180 soldiers with uvc, and myself.  He dropped 25 shotgun shells and spawned half an hour later. If you pull his agro run around in circles and scream bloody murder for a mezz.  If you have no mezz, its zone or die.  <br>
<br>
#3. Loot and camp etiquette<br>
<br>
There is the chance that a previous team  (or 2 ;D) has already broken the spawn, and is sitting there waiting for smugglers to reappear.  While this will make your job of getting in easier, you are now faced with competition.  I highly recommend the leader of your party contact the other group(s) and state you are willing to share or deal or whatever.  If you get into a pissing match, and if you can outgun the other teams, and if you are an all around greedy ass bag, expect someone to train Ash Anderson on your party.  I have only had problems with clanner teams that have people that pvp alot.  I will not drop names, but certain clanner guilds are a bit too full of themselves.  If negotiations do not work, try outgunning them.  Your crit buff will will almost always beat teams without an MA/Agent, even if your team is highly outleveled.  If your fast and your team is on the ball you will get at least 4 smugglers every spawn cycle.  If a second team is really pissing you off you can play the Ash trump card, but that gets your team killed just as fast.  90% of the time though, if you aren't a shmuck, everyone shows a little respect and everyone gets to kill some smugglers.<br>
<br>
Now, what happens when the smugglers start dropping.  Well, if your lucky they will drop you MKII armor.  Sometimes MKI will drop, which has a level restriction of 91, and is basically worthless (unless you happen to be level 91 with a bunch of high level guys in the den).  MKII is certainly what everyone wants, and to be honest it does not drop but one in 10 kills if your lucky.  Now to decide how to set loot. If everyone in the group has less than 2 pieces, loot alpha is certainly the way to go.  If one person needs one piece, have him paste his collection to the chat, then make him leader and set loot lead.  This ensures the pieces go to the remaining 5 equally, and ensures someone doesn't snatch the last remaining piece that the poor guy has most likely spent real time days in hours trying to get.  That last piece is a real pain in the ass.  <br>
<br>
#4.  The aftermath<br>
<br>
Party : Engie or Advent (your way in) : Crat, Trader, or NT (mezz baby) : MA or Agent (crit buff pissing match)<br>
<br>
Stupid is as stupid does : DO NOT agro Ash Anderson, DO NOT run around while agro'd (especially into Ash's room)<br>
<br>
Etiquette : Don't be a dickhead.<br>
<br>
Full Set : 49 ncu, 980 hp, vogue MKII look, all the hot cyber chicks (that are really dudes by the way) <br>
<br>
<br>

Well ok I glossed over the 11&quot; paragraph in the middle.  It's not really news, but at least you're making an effort, which is certainly appreciated.  Show me a news update or two, and we'll talk; spoilers like what you wrote are great but not what I'm looking for.  Dig through other websites (please give credit where credit is due), scan the forums, etc.  It's not a daily update and I'm not 100% retiring so we're talking like 2 things a week or so.<br>
<br>
BTW, a lesson in grammar (grammer? stupid SAT test) for the comma-impaired.  You should always read what you write out-loud, at least in your head, to see if it flows.  Flow is integral to quality writing.  With that in mind, a comma is a slight pause, a semi-colon is a longer pause and a period is a complete stop.  Think about it.<br>

Ok, the newsmonkey thing aside, excellent work on the guide to the Den. And I would definitely call it a guide, not a spoiler, (see comment at end of previous paragraph)<br>
<br>
I would add that the best &quot;sweet spot&quot; is to stand on top of the western of the two yellow posts/pylons. It's darker than 6' up a hog's ass back there, so you'll need a floating torch to see the damn thing. Hopping up on top of it can be tough, too. I suggest using walk mode.<br>
<br>
The one thing that was new to me in your post was the suggestion &quot;for the engie to warp a can of whoop ass down before himself, to clear the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Uhhmm, you can do that? LOL. I was under the impression the engie had to go in first, then warp the others to join her.<br>
<br>
I have to go try this...<br>
