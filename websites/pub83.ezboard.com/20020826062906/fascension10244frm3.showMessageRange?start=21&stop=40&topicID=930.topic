Quotes from the 2-hour conversation Mike had with you before taking the account. Mike was saying from the very beginning that he would pay you for the character back and return it to you when he was done with it (2-3 months was his estimate). He ganked it back when you said you were not willing to sell it back because 'working with Mike might land your other characters KOS'.<br>
<br>
He ended up getting bored with EQ sooner than that and you got the character back as he had promised, along with 35+ AA, 100 hp neck, and whatever else he gained.<br>
<br>
Not trying to justify what he did here, that's not a conversation that I wish to get in to. Just pointing out once again that Mike did try to reach an agreement with you and did say he was going to return the character all along.

From my point of view however, even though he is better off now, from AA's and gear, I would have rather never lost him, even if it was for the better. In hindsight, maybe I would have trusted Mike and let him run his course on Legends, then there wouldn't have been any problems, but the fact that it got so serious in IRC in such a hurry, I didn't feel to comfortable about my chances of getting it back.

I completely understand that Mike was wrong to take the character back and the decision should have been Drac's. However, he didn't just randomly wake up one day and gank it. He was willing to put considerable effort into making it even with Drac, even ensuring that Drac came out ahead in the end. That changes Mike from a &quot;$1250 ninja&quot; to an &quot;indian giver&quot;, while Mike is still in the wrong, they two actions are not the same. But, I did say I did not want to get into a justification argument over what he did because it really doesn't matter which he was. Mike was in the wrong, everyone knows that, and I wasn't disputing it.<br>
<br>
Was only commenting on &quot;Never underestimate the power of Dad&quot;. That comment makes it look like someone forced Mike to give it back, when he was saying from the very beginning that it was always his intent to return it. Adell couldn't tell the difference between me defending his ganking and me disputing the way that it was returned, the &quot;if I were defending him....&quot; lines was sarcasm intended to show the difference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/usineaii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sineaii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 8:45:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=930.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> nah</span><hr size=1> not flaming you ssok, I wouldnt do that.<br>

To say the two events are unrelated is a stretch.  I don't think at all that mike's father intervened, I do think that the prospect of having to explain this to one's family was enough to get the account back, maybe the guilt associated with doing wrong remined by the phone call from the person you wronged.. who know's..<br>

I'd still argue that the phone call is what led to the return, even if it was only the final factor in the decision. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uadellrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AdellRZ</A> at: 5/25/02 11:27:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uhoserrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hoser RZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(5/25/02 5:17:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=930.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hurm</span><hr size=1> I think it's commendable that Mike stepped forward and returned the account to begin with.

Get real he gave it back because he said he was going to from the beginning.<br>

I think you just have a hard time understanding that MAYBE Mike did exactly what he said he would do?  Which doesnt make him out to be as big a monster as you want him to be...<br>

no ones called him a monster..  but he is a thief.  unless you're trying to say he &quot;borrowed&quot; the account for a while.  well, &quot;borrowing&quot; without the owners permission is stealing.  this is a pretty black and white scenario.  i don't see how anyone can try to colour it a rosy shade of anything other than what it was.  theft.  regardless of the outcome. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=930.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=930.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showNextMessage?topicID=930.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=930.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.threadControl?topicID=930.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=930.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=930.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Paladins<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Gimp's Gallery</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3>Public Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
