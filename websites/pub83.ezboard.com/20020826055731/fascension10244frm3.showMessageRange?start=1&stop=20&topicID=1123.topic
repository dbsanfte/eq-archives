Not only that, but Guznuk IS full of shit... my my startling revelation that someone is actually who they claimed to be....<br><br>Yet how many people chose to believe Guznuk, who for whatever reason decided his life wasn't interesting enough so he'd create some drama by faking a conversation then taking a SS of a GM by the same name?? Or does he still expect us to believe that is wasn't him, the GM really did say that.. and how many people afterwards tried to elicit similar information from GMs only to be told they couldn't release that sort of information?<br><br>Before you buy a character with shit for a rep find out first? Wasn't that what people harked over and over to Teralonis? Perhaps there are a few more characters with shit for a rep now.. Or is VI full of shit and faking their own webpage? Or is a mistake? Or did he pay to have it removed or maybe he has a GM friend? Or perhaps the unthinkable did actually occur and people were wrong? (my god, never!)<br><br>Some people need to grow up, find a different hobby, quit prying into things that have fuck all to do with them. Exactly like I am now because I don't even know Teralonis or Telaise just head of the working over some gave him because of Voltaic's mirraculous discovery....explain to me again exactly what you think you found again Voltaic and why we should admire you for it? That was something you made sure was clear later on.. that it was you that started this shit storm?<br><br>Arseholes wil probably laugh, some of his friends may have cried.

Not everyong cares enough about such a mute point to go to such lengths to fool you.

Not only having some sort of odd fixation with Adell that many other enemies seem to have, but now shes a bitch PK manaburn ganker....which was what she was accused of being in the first place. Well golly gee, I guess the best way to prove your innocence is to become what people accused you of being. She must have been really against manaburn gankers.&quot;<br><br>Moffon people obviously cared enough about it the first time because it drifted from the main thread that went on for 5+ pages onto other posts. So whoever it was thats fucked up enough to spend what I assume was a decent amount of money for a lvl 60 character even if it had shit for rep. Only to play in the style of a highly detailed space invaders game is also fucked up enough, or un-original enough to name themselves Adelll. (I'm betting on the second one, but there aer so many more possibilities)<br><br>Now, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong because most of the posts made on that thread were a)Repedative b)illegible, so after reading the first two pages solid I got the same story over three times. But I seem to recall T asking which characters were kos and which weren't so he decide which would go to manaburn gankers and which wouldn't. Ever think maybe people when they actually do buy a character, investigate the character. Perhaps whoever bought Tera knew the shit rep.... perhaps whoever bought Tera didn't care about its shit rep and for $X decided to have some fun with an account they put no effert into.<br><br>&quot;you guys accused him of being someone he wasnt and he sold his characters off. i hope your happy that you ruined the game for a person. he is not adelll. that is a new owner. he owns none of those characters anymore and doesnt even play EQ anymore because you ran him off the game.&quot;<br><br>Precisely the reason I posted. Next time Voltaic or Vorge or anyone else gets bored don't randomly pick someone to dump on. Because damit Voltaic pulled Tera out of his arse he may well pick anyone (or anything) out of there next, which may be YOU. Walk in another indians moccosans? You've got a bunch of people who are pissed at you  because on a whim they think your someone your not. Where the day before you went about your business peacefuly you've now got a truck load of ignorant people with itchy trigger fingers. EQ starting to sound fun for you? Wonder<br><br>Before Guznuk's so called log file was posted the arguement ran something like &quot;Xbena=manaburn gank. Xbena=Gnome with epic, Tera=Gnome with epic, Xbena=dissapeared therefore Tera must = Xbena&quot; Sherlok would be proud. But that can't be right.... surely there were screenshots? Or something? Or some people a) in desperate need of Entertainment b)&quot;having some sort of odd fixation with&quot; Xbena.<br><br>Don't even have to post, i'd be happy if some individuals would admit it to themselves that they were wrong and not try to pull the same crap on someone else lest a perfectly decent character, who up until the day before Voltaics post had absolutely nothing to fear. <br><br>::sigh:: would love to sit here arguing the whole &quot;I think your Xbena so you must be&quot; saga but it seems to me that some people just need to beleive she/he is to have a purpose. But RL friends who knew the character and player from creation didn't fool you guys so this won't either.<br><br>If your looking for absolute prove Josheb how about starting with the name VI has listed Xbena was changed to? Or will that turn your world on its head to find out that you spent all this time and energy chasing something that wasn't real.<br><br><br><br>In short for those who skipped to the end. Don't make something out of nothing just because your bored. Don't try to mess up a game for someone else who is just trying to have fun. People jumped up and down screaming bloody murder and they turned out to be wrong. No amount of posting further is going to resolve it, its a dead issue. You can hack over and over and over the stuff already covered either you have the ability to believe that you were actually wrong or your always right. Either way keep it to yourselves, I don't know you or care about you untill you randomly choose people to have a bad day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ukyorarz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kyoraRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#333333>(7/20/02 7:12:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1123.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vorge is lucky, he gets quoted</span><hr size=1> LoL why is everyone trying to guilt trip us and who are you anyways? hiding behind some random name you made?

Lugoj slips unseen into his new role.  Someone's trying very hard to not be seen. Very Lugoj-y of him wouldn't you say?  $100 ouch!<br><br>Joyce's name-change was good too.  Eiliene, very average, very blend-iny.<br><br>About Xbena/Teralois.  Character name changes on Legends are free.  People get their names changed free as a &quot;service&quot; any damn time they want.  You think their are only FOUR people that took advantage of it so far (like the page says?), you're high.  The page is obviously not complete.  (and RZ's prolly isn't either).  There's a few scenarios where the buyer of Xbena could easily have moved to legends and got a free name change.  Legends has ruined the integrity of Rallos Zek....and the pieces of shit who exploit it to their advantage know it.  It's up to others to try and hold it together by being vilgilant and watching out for the scammers.<br><br>P.S. Speaking of scammers!  Fyrefist/Tasloi, $50 bought you about a month of peace.  Don't let me catch you out of the bazaar, k?  ^_^ <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umalio1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malio1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/20/02 8:19:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=medz>Medz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Clown</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#333333>(7/20/02 8:11:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1123.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vorge is lucky, he gets quoted</span><hr size=1> Suddenly the beasts is revealed.<br><br>Too close a lamentation.<br><br>Once a mouthy old fart.<br><br>Twice his finger's do the talking.<br><br>M<br><br>'Silitel... you are barking on the wrong tree... shut the fuck up!'<br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=medz>Medz</A> at: 7/20/02 8:24:08 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umorbrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorbRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(7/20/02 8:18:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1123.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vorge is lucky, he gets quoted</span><hr size=1> Hmm, that list isn't complete. Kargon is now named Tharg, where's he? He's on Rallos, saw him yesterday...<br><br>edit: just read someone's post about Legends name changes not being there. That's indeed correct. It's still possible Telaise (or Teralonis if it wasn't his alter-ego all along) made a gimp character named Xbena when they bought her, sort of like Fazoli said he saw a level 5 Xbena (even though he probably didn't), and renamed her. We already know Telaise has the money to waste. Or like Malio said, just renamed her on Legends before they allowed paid name changes, which, I believe, weren't available anyways when Teralonis showed up.<br><br>Has anyone seen Xarbenia or whatever Xbena's name changed to? I sure as fuck haven't. And I bet Telaise still owns Couver, since his name was originally Telaise, then changed to Couver, and back to &quot;Telaize&quot;. No buyer would know that nor do it. <p>-Morb<br>60 druid</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umorbrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MorbRZ</A> at: 7/20/02 8:38:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uguznukg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GuznukG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#333333>(7/20/02 8:30:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1123.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> zzzz</span><hr size=1> I didn't fake the log or the screenshot.
