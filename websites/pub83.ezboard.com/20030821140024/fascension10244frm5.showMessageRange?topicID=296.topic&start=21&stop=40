Sorry maybe i am just a little hot headed but for what happined in ME was i was there from 9 30 AM till about 5 PM and loged for 2 hours and when i came back i asked if anyone was shard camping all i heard was deep shards were being camped and that theres no way for me to get there . . .   so i said ok ill just camp ME shard ( no one said anything ) . then when i go to ME and ask if any shards have droped (no one says anything )so i asume no one is camping them  ( i guess i was wrong to assume ) so i see that the named is up ! woot ! after all that time waiting i guess i got jumpy well i said in raid channel woot its up in ME and ppl said yay go get it yet no one said a WORD about it being camped . so i go to get it and i got to many adds and i died when i get back i am being called a kser ( didnt even kill ). . .  i guess ppl in AD havent takin the time out to get to know me or they know i would not ks another person on purpose . i try to help out as much as i can i ask all the time if ppl need help or want to do anything theres only so much i can do to try and get to know ppl  ,ppl need to make some effort to  try and get to know me as well and well i guess AD is to big for another little nothing druid like myself. not to mention adell you can tell that you dont like me from the first tell u have givn me on this web page  basically saying its my fault for being asked for nude pics because i am a girl.( &quot; opened myself up to this by adding i am a girl &quot;) ya i see where thast my fault. alot of AD ppl seem really cool and i dont want to start shit with AD at all but you guys just dont seem to have the time to get to know me. once again VERY sorry to wasit ur time.  i said it from the first msg i put on this board i am easy going and like to play around alot guess i am not as easy going as i thought = (<br>
its really hard for me to have ppl not like me i try to befriend everyone but its real hard when ppl acuse u of shit without talkin to you. well this msg is way to long i am sure  u guys dont wana read this BS anyways so once again sorry and those that still wana do stuff give me a tell i would be happy to just hang out.<br>
<br>

very  sorry ( and kinda sad = (  )<br>

I'm sure they don't want to see you end your recruit status.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I hope whatever it was can be worked out, would really love to see you back, and I know others would as well.

<br>
First time poster, Long time reader. This is Lon's friend, i was playing Khorus at the time to help get him his shards, some peeps probably already know this, from time to time i help Lon lvl his bard and work on quests and such. <br>
<br>
i was present at the time of this happening, as a matter of fact, Khorus was the only AD tagged person there.  <br>
<br>
I had been at the AR zoneline earlier in the day with Theis and several recruits working on Shards. Weanna was there.  A shard dropped, it went to another recruits, and then Theis had to head to VT.  A few of us stuck around for a bit after, but Drakkell came in and killed one group member so i spent then next while hunting pks.(died to Drakkell and Arakan later, since according to Arakan i am his bish). <br>
<br>
A few hours later i came back and none of the recruits were in ME. Impackt was. He sent me a tell asking if i wanted to work on shards with him. So we went to the AR zone, and began clearing scouts. shortly after another bard and a ranger joined us(from Comet Nosce, neither where after shard just exp) and we kept the tree and area clear. <br>
<br>
Soon the prophet spawned as he was on track, but we were mid fight with another scout, so were going to pull it once dead. Then Impackt says in group that some druid is trying to take the Prophet, i didnt really pay attention due to the fact that bards make ass tanks, so i was busy keeping myself alive. But within a few seconds Impackt said, &quot;She almost trained us, she is dead right beside us.&quot; <br>
<br>
We killed our mob, and i turned around and saw Weanna's dead body with 2 robes, a drudge and the prophet on her. We waited and pulled the prophet when clear and got Khorus his shard. I then camped for about 20min to get some food, then came back to help Impackt get his shard. At which point Weanna sends me a tell, &quot;You dont have to worry about me ksing you anymore, i removed my app from AD.&quot; I told her that i was not the person to be talking to about this matter, as i am not an AD member, just lvling a friends alt.  <br>
<br>
I spoke to Adell about this and i hope this hasnt caused any major problems. Weanna i have never met you, and i think we probably got the wrong impression of each other, i never spoke to anyone saying you are a kser.  I agree you did get pretty hot headed over this, and i hope when you cool down, you will send me a tell in game and we can resolve any problem you have with me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uweaana202.showPublicProfile?language=EN>weaana202</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333333>(9/15/02 10:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: sorry to have waisted your time </span><hr size=1> part of the reason i died was cuz i saw your group and did not want to train.( if i was gona ks it why would i pull to your group  knowing ur after it ?? doesnt make sence )  and i dont really have beef with you i just figured since we had been camping the same thing that day and was grouped together that you would know i wouldnt have ksed it and maybe said somthing on my behalf but then again thats just stupid i shouldnt exspect anything. the reason i got hot headed was cuz i was being called a kser and being told i am very disrespectful when it was a simple missunderstanding and i freaked out a little bit. i guess the reason ig ot so mad is cuz i said somthing about camping or that the named is up in ME  MANY times not only in chat but in shout. <br>
<br>
i would like to get this resolved and get some feed back on this. I see this as a stupid minor problem that just escalted and ppl got upset. including myself . <br>

I saw what happened first hand. First off Khorus and Mystereo were both tagged AD, and sitting on the hill with Impackt. However, neither one of them were in the recruit channel, therefore they did not see you asking about it. I saw you come into ME and /ooc Any shards dropping? which they replied no. You did not ask to join a shard group, nor did you ask if they were camping the named you had on track. You ran right past them at their pull spot to get the named. In fact, you pulled the mobs to their spot. <br>
<br>
What upset me is you denyed this and attempted to blame your young age on it. Age is irrelevant here.<br>
