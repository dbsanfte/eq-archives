<br>
I'm a little pissed though.  Munkie cancelled for 8 months and didn't lose her characters.  I kept coming back every 60 days to reactivate just to avoid getting deleted!  *sob* All that for nothing!<br>
<br>
The first thing that occurred to me on my return was that I forgot how to play.  I have 2 MAs, a 57 on RK2 and a 61 on Rk1.  I loaded up the RK2 character and promptly died twice in a mission because I forgot all about Dimach and fumbled with the keys!<br>
<br>
Not sure I'll play my RK1 MA -- she dumped a bunch of IP into bow skill (Bow Blaster) and my &quot;pure&quot; MA seems to be much stronger.  Once I got the hang of playing again I managed to finish two missions last night and level again.<br>
<br>
Observations:  First, I don't remember MAs getting this many crits before.  I keep Sub Guid on me all the time, and I was getting 2 or 3 crits per fight for some nice damage.<br>
<br>
Second, I'm totally lost again on implants.  I was working on some ~ QL100 implants when I quit, but now all i see is a bag full of clusters I can't use yet, and no idea what the plan was.  Is Nano nanny still out there? Or is there a better nano planner around?<br>
<br>
Third, when I left the game it was for two reasons -- the first being AO's horrible memory leaks and bugs.  The biggest and nicest surprise I had this week was that most of those are gone.  Almost all of them, in fact.  I did have a crash when I tried to shut my computer down last night, and AO's the only thing that could have caused it.  Maybe there's a way to avoid that?<br>
<br>
The other reason I left was to play DAOC.  I did, and while DAOC is a very nice game it still doesn't have quite the content that AO (or EQ) does.  That's saying something, too, because AO isn't that much older than DAOC really.  The things that have been done with trade skills and such are phenomenal.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to another question -- on my second MA, I refused to even dabble in anything that wasn't fists-oriented.  No trade skills, no bows, no nanoprogramming.  Probably no Yamaha at some point, either, unless I can scare up a few thousand IP someday.  I've heard of the IP reallocation. I'm just not sure at this point what I want to do with it -- a no-brainer on my bow MA, I'll ditch the bow :-)  But on my pure MA, I don't know what I could possibly do to improve her.  So what are you all planning when you can re-allocate your IP and fix your mistakes?<br>
<br>
Still trying to think like an AO player, here.  It aint' easy.  I keep reaching for my magic sword :-)<br>

Reading over the board, it looks like there's a bunch of us :-)  Really, my biggest gripe about MMRPGs has always been the difficulty of soloing, and as Raph Koster said, AO's idea is &quot;goddam brilliant&quot; :-)   It was the bugs that drove me away, and I'm happy to see that they're mostly fixed now.<br>

<br>
As I said, I'm not real sure how much I want to play my Rk1 MA.  I like the thinner crowds on RK2, and that MA seems to be stronger without bow skill.  Maybe what I'll do is reallocate the first one's bow skill to 2HE so she can take up weapons.<br>

Just my opinion, but don't waste your time and love on RK2. It's a dying cause.<br>
<br>
Feel free to send a /tell to Hildegaard on RK1 if you need doctor services. Just identify yourself as &quot;from TPB&quot;, and I'll do whatever I can to help.<br>

<br>
I have to agree with Publius concerning RK2.  I started my PvP doc there as soon as the second server was created, and got him up to 66th before finally punting on the failed &quot;RK2&quot; experiment.<br>
<br>
The population on RK2 is so feeble that it was impossible to PvP, since there was never anyone there to fight.  It also makes it hard to get important buffs, and it's often difficult to just get a good team together.  My guild there was awesome (Shadow Ops), but the population of the red-headed stepchild server has atrophied to the point where it might as well be a single player RPG game, rather than a MMORPG.<br>
<br>
And if you do decide to hang out on RK1, just send my 91st MP Ivorytower a /tell and I would be happy to assist you with any impants you might need.  Like Pubs said, the magic phrase is &quot;this is &lt;YourNameHere&gt; from TPB&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Actually the whole reason I started playing on RK2 was to get away from the crowds -- crowds = lag was my theory.  But you do have a point in that it's harder to find someone to build those implants for you. To heck with the buffs, MAs are all about implants!<br>
<br>
I'll probably dip my toes back into RK2, as well.  I have some friends there who have a guild going and maybe I'll even join up if they're nice to me :-)<br>

Battle Suit (Just Because)... (any real use for this anyway)?<br>

<br>
It is has been productive to say the least.  However I have noticed one of the biggest problems with AO once again.<br>
<br>
What makes EQ so likable?  Downtime, the time to talk to your friends, AO has none of that.  It is all out kill fest.  And some of the social interaction is lost.  I did mention this on Monkly-Business, and the EQ folks seem to agree, that downtime gives a chance for talk.<br>

<br>
But seriously, I have to agree about the downtime making EQ much more conversational. But I think that the floating names over peoples heads helps a bit now too. That way I don't have to target everyone in the area to see who's talking. And I managed in 3 nights worth of almost play to get a nice set of flower teck, all I need is the boots and arms.<br>
<br>
Though for my fellow Omni members I DO have a question, is there a way to get PAST the Manatze in Galway County? I did a great mission, got the loot, and then zoned out and was jumped and lost 60,000 xp because of them.<br>

I simply avoided taking missions there until either 1) they were green or gray to me, or 2) I got my plane.<br>
<br>
One of the great things about ClickSaver is the find location feature for the buying agent.  Simply enter a &quot;safe&quot; zone which already pops up for you on the occasional mission, and have ClickSaver search till it finds the item AND the safe zone.<br>
<br>
Remember you can whompa/grid from city to city and thereby &quot;adjust&quot; what mission locations you will receive from the mission terms.  Then just search for a good mission reward which is also at a desirable spot.  Preferably one sans nasty tempered mantis critters.<br>

Plenty to do in AO socializing-wise, but you have to make time to do it. Action tends to be non-stop.

For a MA there's another reason to play on RK2: The Dojo on omni side <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sinda>Sinda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 137<br> <font color=#660000>(6/1/02 1:15:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1978.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RK1 and RK2 </span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> RK2 has several advantages: no gankers (or very little), no griefers and no overcrowding (which is nice to get rare items later and everybody has a chance if they have some friends to make a good team).

I've found the same to be true as well.  In fact, I might even go so far as to say if it weren't for RK2 I doubt I'd have come back to AO.  EQ and DAOC eventually chased me away because it was nearly impossible to find an uncamped spot in the best dungeons.  It reminds me of a satire piece I wrote during my EQ days, about the brave knight who rode into town after hearing that it had been terrorized by the local dragon.  On the wall of the Inn, he found a bulletin board with official applications to stand in line to kill said dragon, with a waiting list estimated at 2 to 3 weeks and very strict loot rules :-)   It sort of dampens the heroic fantasy thing, y'know?<br>

Hmm I may be needing you very soon.  I have to dig out my old copy of Nano Nanny and figure out what I was going to do with these extra clusters :-)  Without good implants, MAs are just another fist-fighter.<br>

I found that from the first day I started a character there.  Much nicer bunch for some reason.  Maybe it's the difference between city dogs and country dogs -- city dogs are meaner and more territorial because it's more crowded.  Country dogs would rather lick your face or chase your car for fun.<br>
