And if someone just up one day decided to start playing EQ and wanted to jump right into a lvl 60 character I would probably have a problem too.<br>
<br>
But take a look at it like this, say you lvl a character up to its 50s.  Then decide that you want to play/try another class, so you lvl it up also to near equal lvl of your current character.  Now lets say you enjoy both classes and decide to give 2 boxing a try.  You see that the cleric and melee that you lvl'd up are now in need of something else... a slower/haste character.  So you decide that you really dont want to put the effort into lvl'ing yet another character up to play with your other 2 so you decide to purchase one.  Now you are 3 boxing.<br>
<br>
I have witnessed Telaise play 3 characters regularly and have seen him play 4 or 5 at a time, and this was a year ago, I am sure by now he has the capability of playing a full group of 6 at once by now.   <br>
<br>
I know for a fact his cleric and his monk he lvl'd himself.  I also know for a fact he 3 boxes better then most ppl 1 box.  We have several ppl in AD who 3 box regularly, but Telaise speaks in character for each of them while grouped.  He is an extremely skilled player.  People just getting around him  would be hard pressed to tell he is running all 3 while he is 3 boxing other then the fact 2 were on auto-follow while moving. <br>
<br>
So why should anyone who has alrdy lvl'd up 2  high lvl characters be forced to lvl up yet others just so they can play multi characters?<br>
<br>
You can say you dislike bought characters, because the new person behind it doesn't have the skill to operate it but when you are just buying support characters what does it really matter?  How many of you melee have borrowed a friends cleric to help you lvl or any other character for that matter?  Does this means you suck as a player since you are P lvling your self?  How many of you have help lvling?  Does this mean you suck as a player?  Fact is this game is one big time sink and once you have proven yourself as a capable player, what should it matter if you buy character to reduce some of that time sink and get on with enjoying the game.<br>
<br>
So if Telaise does play a full group of 6 by himself, should he be forced to lvl all 6 of them up just because you think its the right thing to do?<br>
<br>
I personally have lvl'd up 4 characters that are mid 50s from ground zero, and about 3 others that are high 40s.  I have also gotten a character that someone who quit EQ gave me which I did not lvl up  and yes I have bought a character before also from some random person, just cause I wanted to give that class a try, but did not want to throw another several months down the tube for.<br>
<br>
This whole thing about people buy/sale game stuff in RL being lame really doesnt make sense to me.  Just for example, say you sit on your ass infront of your PC for 8 hours killing hill giants making about 1k and hour.  Thats 8k.  OK say you go to work and at you job you make 20$ an hour.  Ok now say you want to buy an horse for your character.  Lets say you go with the 10k horse so you are going to sit for 10  hours killing hill giants to buy it or you have the option to buy 10k from a friend who needs money for 50$   Now you can either sit infront of your PC for 10 hrs farming hillgiants like a robot or you can give the friend 50$ who needs it and get 10k which you worked a real life job for 2.5 hours to make.  For those who have the means 2.5hrs is smarter then 10 hrs.<br>
<br>
For those of you who say well that gives people who have jobs RL an unfair advantage over those who dont.  Well those who dont have RL jobs  and can sit play EQ all day long have an unfair advantage over those of us who work, so to me it looks like it evens the playing table some.  <br>
<br>
OK analogy : Say you are into restoring old cars and you are driving down the road in a car your restored with your own hands and you see some guy broke down  on the side of the road in a car you know was bought.  This guy bought the car, because he wanted to show it at car shows, but you know he has done nothing to the car with his owns hands.  Sure you take allot of pride in your car and what you have done to it with your own hands, but should you not stop to help this guy broke down who bought his?  Does that make him less of a person because he bought a finished car instead of going to a junk yard and buying a wreck and fixing it up?<br>
<br>
Thing is take personal pride in what you do for yourself, don't try to force your standards on others who do things differently that you.  You may run into someone someday who is greater than you and does the same thing to you. <br>
<br>
I have meet characters who lvl up completely on their own, refuse buffs from others and will not equip a piece of gear that they didnt make or obtain themselves as that character (no twinking or trading for items) These people are running around in stuff they made from trade skills.  No just because they take pride in their accomplishments and hard work to stay untainted by the help of others they should try to enforce their ways on others?<br>
<br>
Fact is you are going to spend RL time doing stuff in this imaginary world.  And if you have a good paying job you can reduce the time spent on time sink things such as camping items, by spending your time wiser and working.  The only true argument here is, like I said befor, is this gives people with jobs/money an unfair advantage over people without, but people without jobs who can play EQ all day have always had an unfair advantage over people with limited playing time, so in my opinion this actually helps even it out some.<br>
<br>
Take pride in what you do.  And if you have lvl'd completely on your own thats good for you, but don't force your standards upon others just because you did.  Its like I was in the military defending the freedom that many of you enjoy today, just because I served my country does that mean everyone who enjoys that freedom should have to also?  Should I force the standards I set for myself upon the rest of you?  Should I look down upon the rest of you who chose to go to college to better yourself instead of serving to chose your country?<br>
<br>
Once again take pride in upholding whatever standards you set for yourself, but in no way hold others to your standards, unless someday you are prepared to have the same done to you.  Its a game have fun and allow other to do also, however they see fit.  If someone wants to PK more power to them, if someone wants to roleplay more power to them, if someone wants to power game more power to them.  Let people enjoy the game as they see fit.  If I go buy an enchanter to sit with me while I lvl just to keep me with c3 does that really destroy your game play? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uguznukg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GuznukG</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#333333>(6/18/02 5:13:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1032.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> sallox wrote: &quot;OK analogy : Say you are into restoring old cars and you are driving down the road in a car your restored with your own hands and you see some guy broke down on the side of the road in a car you know was bought.

You forgot this part; the car was bought from one of the most hated criminals in the nation. The transaction was illegal to begin with, let alone was the car made up of parts paid for by this criminals industry. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/upyrosprial007.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyrosprial007</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#333333>(6/18/02 5:28:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1032.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> god</span><hr size=1> you people write too much! $$!#$ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=salloxsawbones>Sallox Sawbones</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 331<br> <font color=#333333>(6/18/02 5:38:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1032.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> I like how people take one part of a post and twist it and ignore the rest of the post or the actual point trying to be made. <br>
<br>
I do not know bhark RL or really in game other then reputation.  I know allot of people dislike him ingame and probably carry that over to RL.  I am not really aware of any RL wrongs/crimes he has done.  If he has ganked accounts that have been paid for wish cash, then yes  I would say RL he is a bad person and a criminal.  <br>
<br>
But, if all he has done is PK for items to put himself through school.  I would say that I dislike him in game and dislike his way of playing, but in RL as long as he never cheated anyone I would say he is a very enterprising person and wish him luck finding any means necessary (as long as its legal) to put himself through school.  <br>
<br>
I know people who work a 40 hr week job to put themselves through school and I know people who sale drugs to put themselves through school.  I know to sale drugs is illegal but your not stealing from anyone and if you can sve some time by selling a few bags of weed to your friends so that you not working 40hrs a week and going to school 40hrs a week and tring to study also, one has to see some advantage to this however risky.  Both selling drugs and stealing  are illegal, but are they both wrong in the same way?  One you are taking advantage of someone without them knowing or participating and the other you are simply suppling something to someone who wants it.  We can get into the whole drugs are bad/illegal but alcohol isn't, but there really isnt a need for it.<br>
<br>
Back the the point of people picking one  part from a post and twisting it.  Look at the rest of the  post please and consider the WHOLE idea of it.<br>
<br>
And the transaction although against the gaming rules is not illegal.<br>
<br>
And yes if the guy broke down is a good guy you should stop to help... or at least I would. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=salloxsawbones>Sallox Sawbones</A> at: 6/18/02 5:39:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sov82>Sov82</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#333333>(6/18/02 5:48:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1032.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> hi</span><hr size=1> opportunity cost.<br>

Its really sad that someone so awesome IRL has stooped to such low scummy tactics to cover his 2k spent. Name change, personality change, hiding of gear, out right denial, questioning GMs answers, etc etc.. <br>

And a reminder to the ebay guys... I have nothing against you all, just that when you buy an account you buy that person's rep.. And the name change policy does NOT cover your ass for what you buy.<br>

This coulda been resolved by A. Not buyin the character or B. Just coming forth with the truth... which is *none of our business* ... <br>

Enjoy the KOS, its something you worked hard to earn and im sure all your characters will be back on legends once again.<br>

I don't have to much of a problem with bought characters, but I base my KOS on the character, not the person.  That's why if I did find out Teralonis was Xbena, I would KOS her.  If someone is going to buy an account that's fine, but they accept responsibility for that account and any reputation on that account.  I'd forgot about it though if Xbena replaced every item she took and paid a pennance. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=237266"><img src="http://www.waccamawlandscaping.com/crit.gif" border=1></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uadcougr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ad Cougr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(6/18/02 9:35:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1032.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Aslain...</span><hr size=1> Didn't Biguss just say damn near the same thing?  /bonk moron... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uendymia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Endymia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#333333>(6/19/02 8:16:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1032.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aslain...</span><hr size=1> I dont understad why it would be illegal to trade accounts between people, since the monthly cost is the importat thing for verant.

Im sure they got these lil toy badges there, which they suck on while they set up rules for their 'game'.<br>
<br>
IMO bought accounts are only annoying if the person doesnt play his character well. But.. then I just dont group with people who do not play well. Glad I got that choice most of the time.<br>
<br>
Just... you should know what you might get yourself into buying an account. You buy the character, but you get the reputation for free. You play with fellow human beings online (although most people seem to forget this), and some of those are not too forgiving, nor tolerable when it comes to (ex-)pks, ninjalooters etc. Anyway, how can we ever be sure the person behind the computer is not the same person? I recall some dumbass who said he bought his account every week to get off kos?<br>
<br>
Either way.. lying about where you got an account from is just dumb. Youll get yourself screwed in the end.<br>
<br>
Im not against buying accounts, but I just dont think its a good idea, unless you know the owner personally.<br>

<br>
I think they came up with the no sharing rule because it was a pain in the ass for them.  Their CS people were spending too much of their time trying to reset passwords from idiots who had shared their account, or bought an account and had the password changed on them.  And it takes a deal of research for them to get it straightened out.  They'd rather not deal with it by saying not to share or sell accounts.<br>
<br>
I hear constant stories of people sharing accounts and getting screwed by someone they &quot;trusted,&quot; whom they've probably never met in their life.  I think Guznuk's gotten hacked twice now, once on his account and once on his Gamers account.<br>
