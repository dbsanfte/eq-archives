<br>
Multi-melee: train it or ignore it? been training it and possibly gimping myself for points. Dug through a few pages of posts and didn't see it mentioned (didn't open every post, just ones in regards to ip's so may have missed it)<br>
<br>
Weapons vs bare hands: I've read a few threads mentioning at low lvls my hands are my best bet, but I caught a few mentioning at higher lvls a few ma weapons are better than our hands, around what lvl is ideal to start with a weapon?, I don't want to take the shotgun route but have seen a few ma's with kitana's and they just look to be a ton of fun.<br>
<br>
I've been soloing endlessly in missions and have yet to actually meet anyone in game other than a few people running by my battered butt and tossing a buff or two (ain't nothing like running through a mission while lite up like a christmas tree!) but it is getting a bit dull and I'm finding myself holding conversations with the poor mobs i'm killing, not good for what remains of my sanity. <br>
I'd stop doing missions and go out and hunt just so i could meet others, except I have no clue where to go lol.<br>
I raced out of the city once, found all greens, ran a bit further and found all reds, started to run the other way (screaming like a banshee between sobs of terror <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) and a miracle occured, i got a free ride back to the reclaim booth. So I sulked my way back to a mission booth and went back into hiding.<br>
Would anyone know of a link to a hunting guide or maps with lvl ranges? <br>
<br>
Nocra- lvl 8 ma (Been re-made, now Lothera-36 ma with no multi-melee! lol and now there are nice claws and ip resets /sigh)<br>

<br>
<br>
Multiple melee does not effect our fists at all.  Its only useful for equipping another weapon.<br>
<br>
MA weapons, personally I wouldnt worry about them for a while, till at least the mid 40s when you start capping for that title ( your skills will max somewhere in the mid 40s, then you can raise them again at 50, this will leave you with alot of left over ip ).  <br>
<br>
Personally I will not use MA weapons till they are completely fixed ( still alot of bugs with them ), or until I have TONS of IP left.<br>
<br>
As for grouping check the channel for your level and announce youre lfg.  You can also hang out in omni forest or other populated areas like trade and entertainment and /shout.  Im not to saavy on the places for omni's to level, as my MA is my first omni char and I just started it.  If you wanna group with me you can shoot me a tell in game, im lvl 12 so we should be able to group.  My MA's name is bonanza.<br>

<br>
Ickhor is 100% correct...multi-melee only helps you wield 2 weapons.  And unless you really want to be a &quot;weapon&quot; MA because it fits your own particular idiom, I would avoid MA weapons until at least lvl 100.  MA fists rock the house, especially at low levels.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (Edit: with the addition of Hazangerine Claws in patch 14.2, using one claw + fists is now a very viable option at early levels.  However, you will certainly be JUST FINE without them, if you choose not to max piercing.)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Keep maxxing MA, Brawl, and Phys Init, and you'll do fine.  See <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showMessage?topicID=1922.topic">this thread</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for a good discussion of what skills various MAs raise.  (For your level, though, you'll want to max pretty much all of your 6 primary abilities until IP starts getting short again in the teens.)  Max your Evade Close Combat and Dodge Range skills.  They are green and will prolong your life. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Another starting tip:  Max Comp Lit and check all the basic and advanced shops in Trade for a Component Belt and NCU modules.  You'll need lots of NCUs to hold all the buffs you can.  If you've been soloing missions, you should have enough credits to buy these, otherwise download <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://a.chavasse.free.fr/ClickSaver/">clicksaver</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and use it to find the hard to find or expensive items you need.<br>
<br>
You'll want to check out the General Nanos kiosk in any shop's Nano Dept room (back of the shop).  There you'll find all the buffs that every profession can learn.  Get (and use) MA Expertise and Brawl Expertise, along with all the handy +12 ability boosts (Agility Boost, Strength Boost, etc), and finally the nano skill expertise buffs (&quot;Bio Met Expertise&quot;, &quot;Sensory Improvement Expertise&quot;, etc).  BTW, the &quot;Time &amp; Space&quot; expertise is called &quot;SpaceTime Expertise&quot; for some reason.  Use these to upload and cast your heal nanos (and others) several levels before you could otherwise use them.  These expertise buffs will require you to raise Psy Mod and Sens Imp to roughly 61 each early on, but it is WELL worth it.  (Don't forget these expertises, as well: Comp Lit, Treatment, First Aid.)<br>
<br>
For armor, you'll probably be fine for a while with whatever you happen to find in missions or on mobs.  Otherwise hit the basic shops and pick up some lowbie armor of ANY type you can strap on.  Eventually, however, you'll want to decide which line of armor you want to pursue, and make sure to keep the related stats maxxed in order to equip it.  Basic Tech/Flowers Tech armor is arguably one of the best armors in the game, and uses Agility and Strength, and since you should keep Agil maxxed every level anyway, makes an easy choice.  I don't recall what level Basic Tech starts showing up, but a reasonable low level substitute is Decus armor, a very common mission reward armor type.  Eventually, you can use clicksaver and try and roll a mission searching for &quot;Basic Tech&quot; and/or &quot;Flowers Tech&quot;.<br>
<br>
Find yourself a nice Bird of Prey special attack in a basic or advanced shop.  The Q level for BoP is a bit screwy, and at 10th or so you can probably use a Q50-60 BoP.  By 25th level or so you can probably use the Q125, but they are expensive. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Does better damage than Attack of the Snake, however.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (Edit: As of patch 14.4, BoP no longer shows up in shops higher than basic, so you're stuck with &lt;=Q50 from the stores unless you mission for one or pull one from a mob.)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Finally, implants.  Once you've got a good handle on the game, you'll want to invest in implants, and the sooner the better.  Download <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.timezulu.com.au/NanoNanny/">Nano Nanny</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and check out how they are built.  Shopping for the parts is tedious, but really pays off after you get them equipped.  After you find the parts you want, find a friend with high Nano Programming to make some for you...or shout on the shopping channel for assistance...lots of folks will be able to build low level MA implants, and you shouldn't have any trouble getting assistance.  <br>
<br>
As for hunting spots, you need to haul your butt over to Lush Fields.  (Forgive me if you already know all this stuff...just trying to be thorough.) Here's how to get there:  If you are in Omni Ent, take the whompa to Trade.  From Trade, exit via the west gate.  Right click the &quot;ferry&quot; terminal to transport yourself across the water to Harry's.  You are now in the very eastern section of Lush Fields.  There are some very low level mobs to hunt right around the docks, and then some slightly higher ones just outside of the gate along the western edge of Harry's.  The real payoff for super-fast levelling as an Omni, however, is to head WEST along the road out of Harry's to the Omni OutPost (OP).  This is the first and only outpost you will hit along the road west out of Harry's, and it is located right where the east-west road intersects the north-south road from Lush Hills resort (the resort far to the south has a grid terminal, btw). From this OP you have ready access to numerous mutant hunting sites from about level 10-55, and theoretically you never need to leave this zone until about 55th.<br>
<br>
Most teams assemble at the gate to the OP and then head out, but some teams form &quot;at&quot; each spot where the mutants are.  My level ranges may be off by a touch, since it has been a while, but overall you should get the idea.  Also, depending on the strength of your team, you can adjust these level estimates accordingly.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Levels 10-15?:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> SE Pipe.  From the OP, head SE a very short distance to where a huge pipe juts out of the ground.  There is a single mob type here...I think they are Tacs.  No aggros in area, except maybe a stray rollerrat.  Tacs are social (will assist each other), so be ready for adds.  Also, Tacs do chemical dmg, which most low level armor is seriously lacking, so they can hurt...be prepared for some healing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Levels 10-15?:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> NNW Eye Camp.  From the OP, head NNW a short distance to where a small pipe juts out of the ground.  There is a single mob type here: Eyes.  No aggros in area.  Eyes are social (will assist each other).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Levels 15-22:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> SW Pipe.  From the OP, head SW for a while to where a large pipe juts out of the ground.  There is a single mob type here: Shades.  Very very rare hammer broodling aggros in area.  Shades are social (will assist each other).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Levels 22-35:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> SW Mine.  From the OP, head SW a long distance past the SW Shades pipe to the SW Mines.  Multiple mutant types (Shades, Tacs, Eyes, Claws, Bios).  Each mutant type is social for its own type.  No aggros in area.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Levels 35-55:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> NW Mine.  From the OP, head NW a ways to the &quot;Cave&quot; on top of a large hill.  This is the gathering spot for NW mines teams.  It is also a safety spot, since you can &quot;zone&quot; into the static dungeon in the cave to avoid a combat gone wrong.  Multiple mutant types (Shades, Tacs, Eyes, Claws, Bios).  Each mutant type is social for its own type.  Very dangerous LifeBleeder aggros in area. Lifebleeders are easy to spot, but are fast and do big radiation damage.  Very nasty.  You will die to them several times.  Everyone who has hunted here has. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
There are even a few more mutant camps in Lush, but these are the really popular ones.  Since all of these are so close to this one OP, Omnis can pretty much level from 10-55 without ever leaving this zone.  Plus, you get lots of monster parts if you use the Pharmatech tradeskill to make money.  Don't forget to save at the OP after you run all the way out there from Harry's.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Kind of funny, I ended up deleting Nocra since I had soaked points into a bunch of places it wasn't needed (including multi-melee) then while I took a break from playing they snuck in ip-resets and weapons that are viable at lower lvls. Ahh well, my new ma is tearing stuff up thanks to your fantastic tips. A bit late for the thanks but I've only been playing a week or so again and decided to give ma another try, and this time thanks to the abundance of info here, runspeed isn't my most major concern since I am living through my fights lol. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
