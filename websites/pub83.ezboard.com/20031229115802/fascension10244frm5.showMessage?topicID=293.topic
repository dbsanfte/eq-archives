We collectively joined tB to be apart of a guild that shared the same goals and direction we collectively enjoyed.  PN consists of a group of RL friends who have “played” together online for 5 or 6 years.  We are all adults, (at least in age) have families, businesses etc. which remind us of the real priorities of life, though we have all chosen gaming as an “avocation”.  We were ecstatic to join tB and greatly enjoyed our association with them.  <br>
Unfortunately guild leadership and a core of the membership moved onto greener pastures.  Those of us who remained tried our best to keep the tradition alive and attempt to pursue the same events which caused us to join in the first place.  Our task was made all the more difficult since the “old” leadership, while not actively playing EQ,  had strong influence over guild procedures, thereby severely limiting our ability to recruit new members or create liaisons.  Within a short period of time we were unable to do the events we had looked forward to doing and guild stalwarts began leaving for other guilds.<br>
It wasn’t long after that having experimented with other gaming communities, some of the original tB membership discovered that RZ was far superior to DAOC and A2 and the like, and desired to return to EQ.  Bored however with the PVE experience, they wanted to convert tB into a PVP guild and purchase accounts (having sold theirs) and cut a bloody swath through RZ.  Most of us fought this direction passionately.  Our goal was not to have tB as another HP, but to be a strong event guild…especially with the upcoming expansions.  PVP is an enjoyable element of the game, but only a byproduct of personal interaction, not a goal for the guild we wanted to participate in.  <br>
Unfortunately MIM would provide the spark which would change our plans.   With relations strained since the IE/MIM consolidation, it was only a matter of time before something would erupt.  That came when Shimm joined MIM after tB assisted him in obtaining his epic, and Kory attended a guild event.  Threats flew and the next morning I logged into a war few of us wanted…on both sides.  We warred, we killed, and we died.  We did what we were told by our leadership.  It worked perfectly for the old guild leadership.  Accounts were activated, new accts purchased, and tB became a PVP guild.  Those of us who played full time found ourselves in a war without purpose, nor without an exit strategy.<br>
We have been accused of leaving tB because of MIM’s ultimatum.  That isn’t correct.  We left with our active leadership.  Most had already left prior to MIM’s posting.  tB was no longer the guild we had joined.  It no longer was the guild that was originally formed.  Its leadership no longer led in a direction we wanted to go.  To this day we all would be members of tB if it was the tB we joined…and event “family”.   Now it is a PVP group seeking for others to fight.  We did not leave tB, they left us.<br>
I don’t fault them for this, nor do I hold it against them.  It is their choice how and when they play the game, as is it mine.  tB and its existing leadership can be anyone they want to be.   They have their own reasons for playing, and I have mine.  I don’t judge them for their decisions and I expect the same consideration for mine.  If there was one thing I have learned playing within the internet community it’s that eventually my enemy will be my friend, and my friend will forever be my friend.<br>

<br>
And just to add another 2 cents .. TB was Originaly Formed to be nothing else but a PvP Group. It was converted into a PvE-PvP Guild because it was necessary .. and allways when some standard in Gear was achived TB turned back into a PVP Guild.<br>

They got the &quot;Zel talk&quot; when they came in just like you did so you know they were very well aware of what TB is.  TB was doing lots of events at the time and they were looking for the path of least resistance to loot.  We got 1/4 of the loot and had many equpped people already.  They were looking at AD at the same time but we obviously had shorter lines.  Granted, 1 or 2 are cool people and went into TB with good intentions, but most just do whatever Medivac, Rick, Oponox says.  I'm not sure if he posted it himself, but the above words are definitely Rick, no one else in PN would take the time to be so full of shit during the pursuit of loot or give the same &quot;we are all adults&quot; speech he gave tB when they wanted to join (damn near word for word).  He did the ol' Oponox thing to IE too though, so it doesn't suprise me.<br>
