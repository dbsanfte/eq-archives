One thing that really puzzles me is that until recently Morb was very much anti-AD and expressed very strong sentiments against several friends in AD, including Xanthala, who he accused of stealing his monk.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I am getting things confused, or perhaps that was referred to when Goner used to play Xanthala a bunch, but some of the comments that I won't repeat that you made about her were very out of the line.<br>

<br>
1. That issue was between Morb and the original owner of Silvana. Not AD, hell not me, and sure as hell not you.<br>
<br>
2. That issue was settled, finished, over, stuck with a fork, and forgotten. But thanks for the drama. God knows thats all Rallos needs more of....<br>

It's certainly not a far stretch to see morb has in the past had problems with some members of AD, including ruhi who is still a member of this guild and who is welcome back ANY TIME he wants to play.<br>

<br>
Just to clarify, I'm not the kind of person to hold grudges. When I talk shit on message boards, I'm pointing out the flaws in people (even myself), not my hatred for them. I'm very outspoken, obviously, and I argue for whichever side is right, not whichever side is a better friend. Some people interpret that incorrectly and hate me because of it. Obviously, I didn't want to apply to AD when I thought any of the active members actually hated me.<br>
<br>
Malio, for example, got into it with me on a number of occasions on the LV board; but after a few times killing LV by his side I actually thought he was pretty cool. Ruhi, on the other hand, has had no interaction with me aside from on the boards, so I really don't know much about him. <br>
<br>
Anyways, I'm a very hard person to offend. Obviously a lot of the people I argue with aren't the same way. I don't have a problem with cutting down on my message board &quot;antics,&quot; but with all due respect there are a few current members of AD (I'm not going to point fingers) who currently engage in the same activity, so I never really considered it much of a limiting factor.<br>
<br>
I'll be online for a while today if anyone has any questions. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 4/24/03 11:14:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=adellrz>AdellRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Pain</span><br>  Posts: 3651<br> <font color=#333333>(4/24/03 11:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Application</span><hr size=1> I POINT MY FINGER AND BLAME MALIO! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=derm1>Derm 1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Preist of GOOD GUYS!</span><br>  Posts: 583<br> <font color=#333333>(4/24/03 11:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Application</span><hr size=1> Morb's posts are fun, they remind me of Hakatri posts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oerandunknown>Oeran dUnknown</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#333333>(4/24/03 12:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Application</span><hr size=1> Abuse I don't know you, but Mearis bring up a legit point.

<br>
When Morb was like level 56 (probably 2 years ago) Gonner was in Revered and had an alt monk named Silyana. Apparently Silyana was a shared character between Xanthala and Gonner, but Xanthala never played her so nobody really thought much of it. Eventually, Gonner decided to quit EQ, and since I played Silyana for a lot of raids (I was typically needed for pulling), he gave me Silyana.<br>
<br>
After 9 months or so of me playing/leveling/gearing Silyana, I noticed one day that the password was changed. I logged in and asked Silyana what was going on, and Xanthala was on her and replied that &quot;she took Silyana back because I left her to rot without paying for her and the character would have been deleted.&quot; I knew this was bullshit, because she had only been not-paid-for for 3 days (I use game cards for accounts I didn't originally own), nor are EQ characters ever deleted, so I got rather angry. I tried to reason Xanthala into letting me have access since, at the time, Silyana was a vital character to Revered, and she said she would think about it, but I think that was just a lie too.<br>
<br>
After a month or two, I gave up all hope ever getting access to Silyana back, so I asked Xanthala if I could at least get my items off the account. She said sure, and we met in Thurgadin and she gave me a few items that weren't really worth a lot. &quot;What about my fungi tunic&quot; I asked. She replied, &quot;oh, my friend sometimes logs on Silyana, I guess he stole it, I'll buy you a new one.&quot; I trusted her, so I accepted her word.<br>
<br>
After 3-4 months I asked her the status report on buying my tunic. She said she only had saved up 11k and it would be a while longer. Meanwhile a friend in AD told me that Xanthala was really rich and was probably just leading me on. At this point I got really fucking angry and posted on the AD board about it. Nobody really cared, though, so it eventually just faded away.<br>
<br>
All further attempts to contact Xanthala after that didn't work. Either it wouldn't be her playing, or she wouldn't reply.<br>
<br>
So in response to Mearis's delightful insight: yes, I did use multiple choice words about Xanthala at the time. Considering I was lied to 3 times and lead on like a dog on a choke chain, however, I don't think they were at all out of line.<br>
<br>
At the time, fungi tunics were hot shit. Now that it's been 2 years, I'm 65, I have a new monk, and I have plenty of plat, I don't really care. Xanthala's actions really disappointed me, and if she still plays I wish she'd at least apologize, but whatever. I forgive her, at least. Greed gets the best of all of us sometimes. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 4/24/03 1:27:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=awfalxx>awfalxx</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Beauty Queen</span><br>  Posts: 1122<br> <font color=#333333>(4/24/03 2:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Application</span><hr size=1> I've always liked Morb, and respected him a great deal for sticking with Revered as long as he could. <p>Transcendent Awfal of Rallos Zek - <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=203198">Profile </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It pissed me off go figure. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=oerandunknown>Oeran dUnknown</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#333333>(4/24/03 4:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what ever</span><hr size=1> RZ is full of surprises, one should know that 3yrs old shit is never forgotten.

<br>
At the risk of getting this thread gimped, the only times I got into an argument with Morb to my memory was when he was arguing that a 3 and 6 AA difference was totally meaningless as far as PvP was concerned between a 52 monk and a 55 ranger, when we were discussing a fight between my monk twink and Nedrian, and Morb took the defence of Nedrian.  I hardly consider that an ego bruise, but I have thicker skin than most.<br>
<br>
You argue that this entire thing was solved but apparently you were wrong on all counts, when Morb never talked things out with Xanthala NOR did was the Xanthala he was angry with a different one than the really nice person I know to be playing now, if I wanted to stir shit I'd post some of the nastier comments he'll admit to saying.<br>
<br>
Either way, if Morb works it out with Xanthala, great, but if someone who you knew went out of his way to slander a good friend of yours tried applying to that friend of yours guild, don't you think that's a concern worth bringing up?<br>
