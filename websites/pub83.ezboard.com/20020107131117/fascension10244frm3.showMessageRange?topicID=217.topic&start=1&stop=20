<br>
Animosity between AD and BOK began to generate when Hunsa mexxed Haniball as he fought Synergy.  And Markuss was breaking BOK mezzes on Synergy.<br>
<br>
Between that time and the instance of Bhark et al assisting FU, with or without Synergy being in zone, I had contacted Yslaath and Lohengrin trying to get the matter straightened out before it became war issues.<br>
<br>
I then went to the mountains for the weekend.  When I came back, I contacted Yslaath for an update, he tried a bit but it seemed he was in tell hell with other AD and only gave rudimentary answers, directing me to Lohengrin.<br>
<br>
I sent a tell to Lohengrin, and apparently got an answer meant for Yslaath, and then he told me that AD is mad about Bhark et al healing AD in WW.  Note this was after the above Hunsa / Markuss / etc actions (a trip to the mountains after...)  While I set about damage controll, I started reciveing info in guild that AD was attacking BOK straight up.  As I sent another tell to Lohengrin, Kesh stacked a few dots on me and started a tap while he was naked.  I asked Lohengrin again, got no answer, asked Yslaath again, he said looks like war, so we went to war.<br>
<br>
During the war, early on (before Hunsa in KD for instance), I asked Lohengrin 3 times if AD would accept peace, each time he said simply &quot;No&quot; occasionally clarifying that as long as BOK attended RB events, peace would be a waste of time.<br>
<br>
That is the basis for the war as far as BOK is concerned.  The only reason we are willing to peace AD is because, aside from the generally degrading level of conduct on both sides, it started out as a preventable war rife with miscommunication and prior to that we were on friendly terms.<br>
<br>
As for Veshyk, by her very post, she joined after the war started, while BOK was active in events, and left after we were on our own in the war and ceased doing events.<br>
<br>
Endy, Bhark and Shirema are not out of BOK.  Theu joined FU for TOT3.  After that was postponed, they were re-added.  I informed Darkfyre this morning, he didnt know when he was talking to Adell.  And asking that they be removed while maintaining your own &quot;alleged&quot; grief players is rather unappealing.<br>
<br>
I posted, in support of Nimade's post, a willingness to peace.  I did not post a willingness to grab my ankles.<br>

Two of the main reasons that AD continues to war BoK are Bhark and Shirema for their continued and repetative griefing.

I am unsure of which Hunsa incident you refer to.  The mezzing Hunsa herself recently (above) gave her reasons (and as I said, at the time these were occurring I was talking to Yslaath to try to put damage control on) would have sufficed then for that.  Recall that this was indeed prior to the claim of Bhark healing in WW.<br>
<br>
The reason I pointed that out was to illustrate the first interference in the war was AD assisting our KOS during fights, not the other way around.  This happened before I went on a 3 day trip.  When I got back is when I heard that Bhark healed FU, so yes, I was not around when your Bhark claim happened, but I was around for Hunsa and Markuss to assist our KOS against.  To reiterate: Hunsa / Markuss BEFORE, Bhark AFTER.  While I tried to resolve this with Ys then Loh, I was attacked by AD as well.  (This paragraph shifted from Botch to Neckros.)<br>
<br>
Adell: The reason I was given was that Bhark assisted AD KOS.  See above for my reply to that.<br>
<br>
Back to Neckros:  How a war is started very much has to do with what is acceptable in ending it.  Further, I tried talking to Lohengrin on three different occasions even AFTER the war was official.  Each time the reply came back as a no.  No negotiation, determination or re-evaluation.<br>
<br>
Which leads back to Botch: And then after the Hunsa in KD incident, I figured its pointless to keep trying unless things changed.  I did not condemn Hunsa's KD thing, nor did I say it was one sided, although it does serve as a well known depiction that AD is not a group of saints either.<br>
<br>
Now back to general commentary:<br>
Knowing that those we war have engaged in rather low means, it saddened me to realize that my own guild has done the same.<br>
<br>
Yes, members of PB fight dirty.  Yes members of FU fight dirty. Yes members of TB, MiM, IE fight dirty, and even members of AD do.<br>
<br>
Thus, if you ignore your faults and condemn ours, how can we view that as anything other than a hypocritical stance when it comes to issuing demands?  How does this get to the resolution of the issues to the point where the server can put this ugly war behind them?<br>
<br>
I am not saying that AD should SEEK peace, nor that BOK should.<br>
<br>
I am saying that perhaps it is time to AGREE on peace rather than risk sinking even further than before as folks get more and more upset about what the OTHER side always appears to do, be it ours our yours.<br>
<br>
I am here to determine if such an agreement can be met.<br>
