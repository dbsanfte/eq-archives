<br>
I really do like Merezz despite his series of bad choices, he's young and prone to doing stupid things (genetically this is predetermined if you have met his brother's you know this).. but overall they're all decent people and not griefers.  I think he's much the same, he likes to talk a lot of shit but overall is a good person.<br>
<br>
I have no idea how him paying us money to become unkos when at most all he's done is provide much entertainment and activity for our gimps galery.  He's apologized, willing to provide rezes and willing to pay an unkos fee.  I'd consider this a low risk, should he go PK again we'll be richer, he'll look silly and it would even be more entertaining.. not too much to lose.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, Like i told you in game merezz, Don't expect everyone to accept your story so willingly, if you're in range and keep yourself out of trouble people your actions will speak for themselves.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=biguss>Biguss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Man Magnet</span><br>  Posts: 1815<br> <font color=#333333>(5/27/03 7:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hi</span><hr size=1> fuck merezz and fuck all his lil supporters<br>

Fine him and move on is what i said.<br>
<br>
As ruhi stated so eloquently,  merezz is no different then any other pk.  He pk'd he caused AD very little if any harm. LV was no factor at all in our raids or our existence in EQ.  LV was a source of entertainment. <br>
<br>
Yes merezz needs to be punished for his Pking, but fact is he was of no relevance to ad at all.  <br>
<br>
PB / rebirth etc... on the other hand did train our raids, they did corpse camp our members, they could affect our existence and as such were treated much more severely.<br>

I'm so drugged up that I hold a great career, I travel to other countrys, I can pretty do just about anything I really need to or want to do, so that drug addiction is really hurting me as you can see.<br>
<br>
Hmmm mood swings?  I don't think I had mood swings... I said shit like I saw it.  I didn't let the things I saw as wrong within guild chan, or publicly be swept under a rug.  I could care less if I alienated people, at the same time when I spoke up for something people would send me tells thanking me for speaking up.  I would always rather be remembered like this then be remembered as someone who did whatever w/out question, or someone who outright lies to his guildmates like you.<br>
<br>
Hmmm slurping on FS cock... LOL I am actually laughing outloud.  I guess you could have this viewpoint cause you seem to not understand what friendship is.  It must be really hard going through your life and not knowing what true friends are.  I find it sad and comical... <br>
