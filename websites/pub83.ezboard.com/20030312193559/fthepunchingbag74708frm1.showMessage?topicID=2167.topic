approach I am using was probably a bit different than most.  I am really <br>
interested in hearing about other strategies, particularly at higher levels.<br>
Also, if someone has made some strides in trying to put together an implant<br>
strategy for PvP, I'd like to hear about that too.<br>
<br>
The concept is to FIRST improve nano capabilities so that you can get to higher level nanos earlier. The trick here is to improve all nano capabilities equally so that you actually can get access earlier. <br>
<br>
SECOND, to directly improve MA and BRAWL in an effort to raise average damage<br>
output and attack rating. <br>
<br>
FINALLY, to get every implant onto AGI, SENSE or INTELLIGENCE. Intelligence<br>
is necessary in order to make decent nano-boosting implants.<br>
<br>
What I found is that this set can be broken into four distinct groups, which<br>
can be built/upgraded independantly in order to make specific goals at specific<br>
times. For example, using Vulnerability Seeker by level 72.<br>
<br>
At QL 100, this set gives the following increases. I use QL 100 because I <br>
don't think this strategy holds up well at higher levels because I don't nano<br>
capability is as usefull above level 150.<br>

<br>
<br>
Note that Bio Met, Sens Imp, Time &amp; Space and Psyc Mod all get 58+ points. This lets you function 14.5 levels higher because each of these can be improved 4 points/level.<br>
<br>
What appears to be given up is some pretty nice base stat increases that could be used for overequipping armor. However, because the armor that you find in missions between level 60 and 100 is more than adequate to get you to minimum damage, the extra stats don't appear to be as usefull as the additional nano capability.<br>
<br>
Here is how I group the implants. Since I don't have alot of cash, I am going<br>
to create/upgrade each of these groups independantly, as budget permits.<br>
<br>
** MA Implants **<br>
Right Hand, Feet, Left Hand -- Agility<br>
<br>
** Nano Implants **<br>
Head, Chest -- Intelligence<br>
Ear, Eye, Waist -- Sense<br>
<br>
** Brawl Implants **<br>
Left Arm -- Strength<br>
Right Arm -- Agility<br>
<br>
** Runspeed/Nano Resist **<br>
Left wrist, Right wrist, Leg -- Agility<br>
<br>
The last group I choose to focus on Runspeed/Nano Resist because it seems you can never have enough Nano Resist (or it does nothing and its a bad choice) and Runspeed seems more useful than implanting parry. Getting access to higher level BwT is nearly impossible because it only drops in missions. Higher level deflection shields may be useful, but not nearly as useful to cash-strapped me without a yalm.<br>
<br>
Here is the entire layout.<br>
