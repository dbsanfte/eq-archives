It's just my fear that our government maybe creating new and extensive authority that it will be unwilling to cede when the threat of terrorism is no longer imminent. I'm no longer convinced that all the actions of our government are entirely benign, and it concerns me that so much power is coming to rest with so few. Our congress has completely abdicated its constitutional responsibilities. And now the president appears to have sole authority on a number of issues that were never supposed to be his in the first place.<br>
<br>
I'm sure (or I hope) everyone's read Orwell at one point or another. The world he described didn't occur overnight. <br>
<br>
The truth is though, that it is impossible to ever be completely safe from terrorists. If a fanatic is determined enough he will find a way. I just hope we don't sacrifice too much, merely to establish a pretense of security.<br>

I agree with that everas.  We walking a dangerous line between personal freedom infringement and doing whats prudent.<br>

Oh and Kad, you may be right about some people. I don't know. However to assume that everyone who's against the war is against it merely to frustrate Bush is ridiculous. While I didn't vote for Bush, I wasn't particularly against him at the time. In fact I agreed with him on a few positions (primarily our nuclear power industry). But his actions of late make it very hard to give the man any credit. Even his father's been urging him to rethink the unilateral approach and return to the UN. At least then if we do end up going to war it'll have some semblence of legitimacy, instead of just a rogue nation flexing its military muscle.<br>

Just to correct, it is not unilateral if other countries (which are) are involved.  If more than one, then it's multilateral.  <br>
<br>
And to say the US is a rogue nation is totally inaccurate.  The US may be involved in an internationally unpopular conflict, sure.

And while we're not completely alone, England and Spain do support us, we're far from getting any real majority among nations to support our course of action. We may lose England if Blair isn't careful about what he does. Which, and I mean no disrespect to Spain, means we'd be essentially on our own.<br>
<br>
And (should we follow through with this war on our own) calling our nation rogue is not entirely inaccurate. If we do decide to defy the UN, and the many countries who do not believe military action is neccessary at the moment, we're little better than a certain petty dictator who decided it'd be a good time to invade his neighbors a few years back. We're going to sacrifice alot of our own legitimacy over this war, and I dread to think what it'll do to global stability overall.<br>
<br>
Despite what some seem to think, there's no glory in war. Alot of innocent people are going to suffer because of this. We've recently suffered a tragedy of our own. Why be so quick to inflict another on upon others?<br>

<br>
PRESIDENT BUSH AGREES TO MORE INSPECTORS IN IRAQ<br>
<br>
(AP) Washington DC Wednesday, March 12, 2003 3:45 PM<br>
<br>
President George Bush has announced that the US will not attack Iraq. The President announced that he is agreeing to deploying additional inspectors throughout Iraq. <br>
<br>
The US will send 250,000 additional inspectors:<br>
<br>
24,000 members of the 1st Infantry Division<br>
<br>
15,000 members of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault)<br>
<br>
15,000 members of the 82d Airborne Division<br>
<br>
More than 5,000 members of the 4th armored division with their &quot;M1-A1 all-terrain vehicles&quot;<br>
<br>
Additional US Army personnel, as needed for inspections<br>
<br>
A variety of US Air Force personnel for aerial recon missions and other &quot;surveillance&quot; activities<br>
<br>
A significant number of United States Marines to aid with inspections<br>
<br>
United States Coast Guard personnel to inspect coastlines<br>
<br>
An undisclosed number of Rangers, Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Recon Marines, Delta Force, and other Special Operations personnel to inspect Iraqi &quot;hideaways&quot;<br>
<br>
Special air deliveries to aid the inspections will be made by aircraft from the USS Constellation, USS George Washington, USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Enterprise.<br>
<br>
The President said: &quot;With these additional inspectors, the inspections should be completed in a few weeks.&quot; <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Watching the tumult around the world, it’s evident that what is happening goes well beyond this particular crisis. Many people, both abroad and in America, fear that we are at some kind of turning point, where well-established mainstays of the global order—the Western Alliance, European unity, the United Nations—seem to be cracking under stress. These strains go well beyond the matter of Iraq, which is not vital enough to wreak such damage. In fact, the debate is not about Saddam anymore. It is about America and its role in the new world. To understand the present crisis, we must first grasp how the rest of the world now perceives American power.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In one respect, I believe that the Bush administration is right: this war will look better when it is over. The military campaign will probably be less difficult than many of Washington’s opponents think. Most important, it will reveal the nature of Saddam’s barbarous regime. Prisoners and political dissidents will tell stories of atrocities. Horrific documents will come to light. Weapons of mass destruction will be found. If done right, years from now people will remember above all that America helped rid Iraq of a totalitarian dictator.<br>
        But the administration is wrong if it believes that a successful war will make the world snap out of a deep and widening mistrust and resentment of American foreign policy. A war with Iraq, even if successful, might solve the Iraq problem. It doesn’t solve the America problem. What worries people around the world above all else is living in a world shaped and dominated by one country—the United States. And they have come to be deeply suspicious and fearful of us.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>after 9-11, the rest of the world saw something quite different. They saw a country that was hit by terrorism, as some of them had been, but that was able to respond on a scale that was almost unimaginable. Suddenly terrorism was the world’s chief priority, and every country had to reorient its foreign policy accordingly. Pakistan had actively supported the Taliban for years; within months it became that regime’s sworn enemy. Washington announced that it would increase its defense budget by almost $50 billion, a sum greater than the total annual defense budget of Britain or Germany. A few months later it toppled a regime 6,000 miles away—almost entirely from the air—in Afghanistan, a country where the British and Soviet empires were bogged down at the peak of their power. It is now clear that the current era can really have only one name, the unipolar world—an age with only one global power. America’s position today is unprecedented. A hundred years ago, Britain was a superpower, ruling a quarter of the globe’s population. But it was still only the second or third richest country in the world and one among many strong military powers. The crucial measure of military might in the early 20th century was naval power, and Britain ruled the waves with a fleet as large as the next two navies put together. By contrast, the United States will spend as much next year on defense as the rest of the world put together (yes, all 191 countries). And it will do so devoting 4 percent of its GDP, a low level by postwar standards.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>American dominance is not simply military. The U.S. economy is as large as the next three—Japan, Germany and Britain—put together<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>     Given this situation, perhaps what is most surprising is that the world has not ganged up on America already. Since the beginnings of the state system in the 16th century, international politics has seen one clear pattern—the formation of balances of power against the strong. Countries with immense military and economic might arouse fear and suspicion, and soon others coalesce against them. It happened to the Hapsburg Empire in the 17th century, France in the late 18th and early 19th century, Germany twice in the early 20th century, and the Soviet Union in the latter half of the 20th century. At this point, most Americans will surely protest: “But we’re different!” Americans—this writer included—think of themselves as a nation that has never sought to occupy others, and that through the years has been a progressive and liberating force. But historians tell us that all dominant powers thought they were special. Their very success confirmed for them that they were blessed.

Speaking of the current administration;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>the administration withdrew from five international treaties—and did so as brusquely as it could. It reneged on virtually every diplomatic effort that the Clinton administration had engaged in, from North Korea to the Middle East, often overturning public statements from Colin Powell supporting these efforts. It developed a language and diplomatic style that seemed calculated to offend the world. (President Bush has placed a portrait of Theodore Roosevelt in the White House. TR’s most famous words of advice are worth recalling: “Speak softly and carry a big stick.”) Key figures in the administration rarely traveled, foreign visitors were treated to perfunctory office visits, and state dinners were unheard of. On an annual basis, George W. Bush has visited fewer foreign countries than any president in 40 years. Still, he does better than Dick Cheney, who has been abroad only once since becoming vice president.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>President Bush’s favorite verb is “expect.” He announces peremptorily that he “expects” the Palestinians to dump Yasir Arafat, “expects” countries to be with him or against him, “expects” Turkey to cooperate. It is all part of the administration’s basic approach toward foreign policy, which is best described by the phrase used for its war plan—”shock and awe.” The notion is that the United States needs to intimidate countries with its power and assertiveness, always threatening, always denouncing, never showing weakness. Donald Rumsfeld often quotes a line from Al Capone: “You will get more with a kind word and a gun than with a kind word alone.”<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We like and understand America. But we find it extremely irritating to be treated with utter contempt.”<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In principle, American power is not simply good for America; it is good for the world. Most of the problems the world faces today—from terrorism to AIDS to nuclear proliferation—will be solved not with less U.S. engagement but with more. The lesson of the 1990s—of Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor, Rwanda—is surely that American action, with all its flaws, is better than inaction. Other countries are simply not ready or able, at this point, to take on the challenges and burdens of leadership. Around the world, people understand this. In a global survey taken last year, the most intriguing—and unreported—finding was that large majorities of people in most countries thought that the world would be a more dangerous place if there were a rival to the American superpower. Sixty-four percent of the French, 70 percent of Mexicans, 63 percent of Jordanians felt this way. (Ironically, old Europe was more pro-American on this issue than new Europe. Only 27 percent of Bulgarians agreed.)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Being pro-American should not be a political liability for our allies. The diplomatic fiasco over Turkey is an excellent example. For well over a year now it has been obvious to anyone watching that the Turkish people were deeply opposed to a war in Iraq. Yet the administration assumed that it could bully or bribe Turkey into giving it basing rights. But Turkey over the last year has become more democratic. The military is less willing to overrule politicians. The new ruling party, AK, is more open to internal debate than Turkey’s other parties. It allowed its members to vote freely on the motion to allow America basing rights, only to have it defeated. Since more than 90 percent of the Turks oppose giving America basing rights, this should not have been surprising. The administration wants democracy in the Middle East. Well, it got it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There are many specific ways for the United States to rebuild its relations with the world. It can match its military buildup with diplomatic efforts that demonstrate its interest and engagement in the world’s problems. It can stop oversubsidizing American steelworkers, farmers and textile-mill owners, and open its borders to goods from poorer countries. But above all, it must make the world comfortable with its power by leading through consensus. America’s special role in the world—its ability to buck history—is based not simply on its great strength, but on a global faith that this power is legitimate. If America squanders that, the loss will outweigh any gains in domestic security. And this next American century could prove to be lonely, brutish and short.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

None of the above reflects my personal opinions on any of this subject matter or its attendant debate here or elsewhere. They're mereley selections from <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>an article I suggest you all read</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, that may or may not enhance your understanding of how the rest of the world views the U.S.<br>
<br>
Many of you have asked for my personal take on all this. I don't feel inclinded to provide it yet. I probably won't. <br>
<br>
I'm an historian so much of what you see quoted here seems obvious to me. I was trained to take the long view.<br>
<br>
I used to be a soldier, I may be again, and if called upon, I know where my duty will take me, but during that tenure I learned, first hand, that the rest of the world never views us as we do. My attempts to understand why that's the case was part of what led me to become an historian.<br>
<br>
I think the only point I'm trying to make here is; we're not alone, should we attempt to force our opinion down the rest of the world's throat, without the rest of the world liking it, I and those like me may wind up a lot busier than you expect, maybe not immediately, but the chance of it happening will certainly increase. Whether we're morally or ethically justified in doing so or not, is totally irrelevant to that. Whether we should let that stop us or not, well, carry on your debate...<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>France, after all, helped Saddam Hussein build a nuclear reactor that was obviously a launching pad for a weapons program.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The nuclear reactor wasnt even a normal reactor, it was a scientific reactor where it was especially easy to extract the part for a A-bomb. However this happened at a time Chirac and Rumsfeld were shaking hands with Saddam, at a time Germany got many industrial orders and US sold biological and chemical weapons. I think thats important to not forget or its just a France bashing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Over the past year the United States became a campaign issue in elections in Germany, South Korea and Pakistan. Being anti-American was a vote-getter in all three places.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
WTF anti-American? US was never an election issue in Germany (I dont know about SK and Pakistan), the war was an issue. And believe me, if the current allies who support war have had elections at the time Germany had (or maybe a month later, when it really got a big story in the media) the US wouldnt have these allies now, because if 90% of the people are against war, the party which supports war for sure doesnt win the election. (Without the upcoming iraq crisis it was very likely not be cancelor Schroeder elected)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Between 70 and 80 percent of Hungarians, Czechs and Poles are against an American war in Iraq, with or without U.N. sanction.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

And good 90% in all other countries (excluding France and Germany they about 70% there).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Pakistan had actively supported the Taliban for years; within months it became that regime’s sworn enemy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

US has also actively supported the Taliban for years, and put them into power in the first place.<br>

I thought it was very well balanced(taken as a whole, not snips here and there).  I thought it would help both sides of the argument see the issues of the other side.<br>
<br>
If you accept what the article says, you have to look at ALL the motives it proposed for the anti-American sentiment around the globe.  It didn't just come out and say that the world is against us solely because Bush is being arrogant.  That is only part of it.  The other two sources mentioned include plain old envy and distrust based on our overall power.  As someone sitting my ass here in the US, I can tell you that I don't want my government's policy decisions on our security to be influenced by foreign public opinion derived from any of those three reasons.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm anti-Bush, but pro-war(in this case).  I think the Bush administrations stance on terrorism and rogue states is the only thing it's doing correctly, although I understand that they are not being as diplomatic as others could have been.<br>
<br>
A couple of things I wanted to add.  Enough with &quot;the US trained Osama,&quot;  &quot;the US supported and armed Saddam.&quot;  These are such hollow arguments.  All nations make mistakes in hindsight, but even in hindsight I still think the US did the right thing at the time.  Would it have been better to have allowed the Soviet Union to occupy Afghanistan?  Would it have been better to have let Iran run roughshod over the whole Middle East?  The US didn't want Iraq to win.  They wanted neither to win, and achieved that goal by allowing Iraq to fight Iran to a draw.  Even in hindsight, that is arguably the better choice.<br>
<br>
I'll give you that in Germany's case it was probably anti-war and not anti-Americanism.  This is definitely not the case with the French however.  They are not acting out of some noble sentiment of avoiding war.  The whole French foreign policy is governed by being anti-American.  Their primary motive is to thwart America at every opportunity to reduce our power, increase the EU's power, and place themselves as the most influential EU player.  I'd have to wonder what would happen if France were invaded tomorrow and the US put forth a resolution to use military force to defend France(again).  I think their heads may explode trying to decide between going down as anti-American and having to support us.<br>
<br>
I do take pleasure in the fact that the French have basically failed big time.  The fact is that they really don't matter in the overall scope of things, and now with the way things have played out, they matter much less than they did before this all started.  They deserve every bit of it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xezzt>Xezzt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Pappa Rogue</span><br>  Posts: 337<br> <font color=#333333>(3/18/03 3:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poll on US Presidents speech is closed</span><hr size=1> I am closing this thread before the war starts.<br>
