    I have a few questions for you and some comments, I hope you can provide some enlightened answers. Just for background I play an level 50 MA on RK-1.<br>
1. MA class being capped on damage, when I made 43rd level I noticed that when fighting human mobs in missions I started to hit for min damage on every hit except when I scored a critical hit. Now at first I thought that it was caused by the fact that I was at my title level cap in MA skill, so I accepted the hits for 40 damage, then I leveled and forgot about it as I had a long string of missions against monster type mobs until I reached 49th level. At 49th I ran a mission at 50% slider at the mission terminal, all the mobs where human and this time my hits(ALL my hits) where for 50 damage, I tried getting a small group together to do the mission with me, we debuffed the mobs and super buffed me and I hit for....yep you guessed it, 50. So I avoided missions with human mobs hoping that when I reached my title level at 50th my damage would go up. Well it did go up, to 52. You need to look at unarmed damage for MA's vs... Human Mobs. As a side note to this when I was testing my damage I fought everything from red rated mobs to gray and I always hit for the same amount. Against Monsters I hit for 50-87 with more then 75% of my hits landing for 70+ damage.<br>
2. MA weapons, thanks for the thought of adding weapons to our class, however at this time they hurt us more then help us. When we equip a weapon if we zone, get buffed or get debuffed we lose our ability to punch. We can not use our MA special attacks with the weapon equipped and the damage on the weapons is all melee based damage regardless if the title of the weapon suggests that it is a fire damage weapon.<br>
3. Our MA Special Attacks are all working well except for Flower of Life which damages us as well as our target. Blessed with Thunder is fine the way it is but every patch you threaten us that you are going to change it, please don't.<br>
4. Dimatch is our Burst/Full Auto why does it take so much longer for it to recycle for us then for all other classes? Please fix this to recycle every 2 min or at least make it recycle faster as skill in it goes up.<br>
5. Why don't we kick? Monsters in this game kick, why don't MA's? and that funny little hop we do for Bird of Prey is not a kick, if you have the time look at Everquest to see what an MA fighting should look like. <br>
6. Bows would be such a nice weapon for MA's to use, the skill is green to us but for some reason our bow special attack doesn't work and to equip a bow you need more skills then a soldier.<br>
All in all I personally, and MA's as a class are fed up that you would waste time &quot;fixing&quot; backpacks and ignore the needs of an entire class. Some of the problems I have listed have been in the game since beta.<br>
 <br>
I thank you in advance for your time in reading this, and encourage you to go to the forums on www.thepunchingbag.net for more specific info on our problems.<br>
Show us you care about your paying customers. You have made a good game, but now it is time to make it a great game.<br>

That would let you use BoP, etc, as an EXTRA attack, along with the weapon damage, while preserving Dimach as the 'last ditch, pray it works, in a disaster' attack they seem to intend it to be.<br>
<br>
Besides, Dimach isn't all that efficient... if it takes all your nano, you could have used that nano to heal yourself, and done nearly as much damage 'normally' in the extra time of fight you'd have from the heal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umaxiusmanaburn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Maxius Manaburn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ratheseekers.com/usa.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#660000>(12/8/01 6:48:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1465.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.ratheseekers.com/Finae.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> And here is their full answer</span><hr size=1> Greetings,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  I'll try to answer all of your questions to the best of my ability <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1) The minimum damage versus human mobs is due to the fact that they <br>
<br>
have an incredibly high AC.  We are looking into this currently, and <br>
<br>
are deciding on ways to fix this so that melee classes stop doing <br>
<br>
minimum damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
2) We have no plans on allowing people to do MA attacks while using a <br>
<br>
weapon.  I know that weapons are a bit buggy(you listed most of the <br>
<br>
reasons) and we are looking at ways to fix this.  I'm really not sure <br>
<br>
about the status of this though, so I'll send in another bug report and <br>
<br>
ask the dev/programmers what is going on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3) I don't think we are planning on nerfing any MA special attacks, and <br>
<br>
I haven't read where we treatened to in any patch notes, it could have <br>
<br>
been on the message board (which I unfortunately don't get to read too <br>
<br>
often).  As for flower of life, I'll due a bug report and see that it <br>
<br>
gets some attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4) I wouldn't count on the Dimach timer being shortened.  The way it <br>
<br>
fits into the game is that its a &quot;soul&quot; attack, which causes a lot of <br>
<br>
stress on the body, so it can't be used very often.  I wouldn't think <br>
<br>
of it as your &quot;FA or Burst&quot; since its something completely different.  <br>
<br>
Your special attacks, plus brawl, plus dimach are your &quot;FA/Burst&quot; , <br>
<br>
they may not do as much damage in some circumstances, but each class <br>
<br>
has its own perks and weaknesses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
5) I'm not sure why you the MA kick doesn't work all the time.  It is <br>
<br>
in there, there must be a bug keeping it from not happening.  And bird <br>
<br>
of prey used to have a really neat animation, I wonder why it changed <br>
<br>
to the little hop, again I'll bug report it to the devs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
6) Finally, bows aren't meant to be used as a means of combat.  They <br>
<br>
are more geared towards pulling and giving MAs a limited range attack <br>
<br>
ability.  And in a real world sense, its a lot easier to use a gun than <br>
<br>
a bow, and guns do more damage too, which is why bows are inferior in <br>
<br>
the game.<br>
<br>

Thank you for your quick response, I have some comments on it and I will use the same #'s so we know what we are talking about.<br>
1. Thank you for looking into this for us :-) I feel better knowing a reason.<br>
2. The MA specials was more of a wish then a bug, thanks for sending a bug report in for us on the weapons.<br>
3. The Nerf of Blessed with Thunder was announced in patch message for patch 12.x it was then announced that it was &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp being held for a later patch, we as a group are all scared that it will suddenly pop in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Also Flower of Life has been bugged since beta.<br>
4. Ok thanks for the clarification on that, I still hope that someday you will make it more of a FA/Burst then as it &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp stands now.<br>
5. Thanks for the bug report.<br>
6. Bows, In real life bows have been used thru the years as a weapon of war, if you study Feudal Japan you will see &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp that the armies there used bows, in dark ages Europe bows where used in wars, even today bows have HUGE power,  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I personally hunt with one. The skills that bows in this game ask for are in NO way reflective of real life &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp bows since when is knowledge of how to shoot a sub-machine gun a skill need to pull a bow string. How do you &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp justify that the bow special attack causes you to stand and /wave at your target? I think bows to be useful &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp need to have the following skills ONLY: Bow, Bow special and maybe MA and aimed shot. I don't want to out &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp damage agents and soldiers I just want to be able to whip out my bow when I get rooted or to pull with.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
  Ok, I concede, bow special attack is silly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  It used to work way back in <br>
<br>
the day, then in beta 4 something went amiss I guess.  I had forgotten that <br>
<br>
it just made you wave.  I'll go ahead and bug report the skill checks that <br>
<br>
they take too.  I know some are crazy needing FA, burst, fling, etc etc.  I <br>
<br>
think those are meant to be a bow/gun combo.. but not sure.  I'll talk with <br>
<br>
the dev team and see whats up.<br>
<br>
  Oh, I also convinced a developer to take a look into making the fist nanos <br>
<br>
(the ones that add +dam/hit) also change the type of damage that they cause.  <br>
<br>
So energized fists would make you do energy damage, coercive (I think thats <br>
<br>
what its called) fists will do chem damage, etc etc.  He said that we are <br>
<br>
looking in to do this, but we need to make a few programming changes to the <br>
<br>
way fists work before we can do this.  So thats something to look forward <br>
<br>
too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I've yet to hear of an MA inta-killing someone with a Soldier-Style-Three-Button-Mashing-Combo consisting of BoP, Brawl, Dimach.<br>
<br>
And if you want to be a smart ass with him about saying 'Diamach is a Soul Attack and it exhaussts your body', ask him to look into a martial art called Kook Sol Wan.

I don't know. Many years ago, in my foolish and ill-spent youth, I had the very great honor to study Moo Duk Kwan Tang Soo Do under master Jhong H Lee, may he rest in peace, who was awarded his 9th dan belt while I was a student.<br>
<br>
I was a wretchedly poor student, and never advanced that far at all. But I saw some things that I would not have believed.<br>
<br>
I feel so so so sorry for anybody who ever got into a serious fight with a master like that. You would just be so dead so fast...<br>

My only real point here is that it's hard to say what is or is not possible for a true master of the martial arts. Who knows? Not me.<br>

It does, as said before, not take 30 mins to &quot;charge&quot; up, and it actually gives you energy instead of taking it.<br>

I don't think that has to do with chi or what ever. Thats not like focusing you mind to do more damage to a person, or chatter glassbottles. Thats pure power. Everyone has that little extra, maybe someone knows how to put it to use more often than when a loved one is in danger, but chi? Don't think so...<br>

Well two thing's, and this is not something happening once in a lifetime, but it's a part of TaiChi Chuan<br>
with the chi, orwhateveryouwanttocallit, focused I can give you an electric shock (small, like static ones)(nice party trick) wierd?, <br>
well in at a gathering many year's back I saw a women (blindfolded) ducking and parrying the (slow) blow of an opponent. I though to my self &quot;this is a trick&quot;, but no - today many in my group can do the same thing - that's wierd!<br>
<br>
Warm hand's - heard of them? well to warm up you'r hand is another nice little &quot;party trick&quot; that work's. Can't heal anyone with it or some other stuff<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

chi is used to obtain balance with all.<br>

An early knowledge that part of TaiChi Chuan is based upon.  It can be used with any type of fighting background.  It shows some really interesting things that can be done with focusing to manipulate and redirect the opponent's Ki, bloodflow, and neural impulses.  It has nothing to do with breaking an object from a distance or part way down a stack.<br>
<br>
There are two sides to Taijiyang.  The healing side of which I have actually used successfully and the martial arts side which, unfortunately, I've had to use.  It didn't/doesn't leave me tired or having to wait 30 minutes between uses.<br>
<br>
The effects of focused Ki can be very relieving or devastating depending on intent and application.<br>
<br>
Now to power focusing of Ki.  I've actually been on the pole with 6 other men pushing the pole against the palm of one hand of an old, read upper 80s, Gung-Fu master.  We couldn't move him.  Now no-one can tell me that that was shear muscle power.

<br>
Healing: he knew a guy having pain in his appendics area, so the guy meditated with his hands focused over the area for a couple days and was relieved.<br>
Also stories of the Kook Sol Nim (KSW grandmaster) being able to focus and deliver an attack capable of shattering a person's internal organs without even physically touching him.  I saw a picture of a KSW master doing a dropkick to a pile of cinderblocks.  His foot was still about 3 inches from hitting the stack and already the first block was completly broken and the second was cracked.<br>
<br>
Someone mentioned warming hands earlier in the thread: how do you think DBZ-style fireballs came about in ancient Japanese folk tales? Doesn't Goku form his hands into a circular shape before launching a fireball, similar to the process used to do a warm-hands trick?? Also, the 'Stare of Death', a story which could have easily originated from &quot;tall tales&quot; of martial arts masters being able to manipulate objects form a distance (great or small) using their internal power.  <br>
<br>
Don't discount the power in the human body that most of us don't know how to harness.  I know everyone remembers in Matrix when Morpheous gives Neo the stats for heat and electrical energy production of a human body.  While these weren't exactly correct numbers, the fact remains that our bodies produce a considerable amount of energy which is lost as heat and could be used, in a different form, to create these amazing attacks/abilities.<br>
