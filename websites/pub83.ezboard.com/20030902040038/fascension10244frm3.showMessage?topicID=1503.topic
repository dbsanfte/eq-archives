Only time I am watching is it, is when satelite is up on the T.V next to the pc lol. Anyways, was flipping through the channels on my down time just chillaxn. When all a sudden I noticed an EQ screen on the TV, I was like wtf lol. There was a 35 minute show on addictive online rpg's. It showed some Bluebie women playing a 60 ench, in bazaar then in Ssra. She was telling the reporter how people have offered her up to 2500 dollars for her account, and she said- how she could never sell it becuase it was part of her life. All this BS- Then it went into some suicide that was caused over EQ, some guy who exhiled himself from his family and job- to log on and play eq. No one heard from him for about a week so his mother went to his apartment and walked in to find her son w/ half his head blown off and a shotgun in his hand, and on screen was the EQ char selec. I think it's sad that people take gaming to this level, but as I was watching on about it I found out some crazy stuff. People that do crack- have massive amounts of dopamine released from a part im their brain  doing so creats a high- it's a little chemical inside your head, that causes the high*&lt;think I got that right... Anyways, While playing EverQuest scientists say that while people are playing EQ this can happen, ie: killing the emp-cursed arch etc- doing a small quest or downing anything that gives a reward, a small amount of Dopamine is released, everytime- your body in return wants more and more, thats why you are so addicted, it gets worse and worse almost like a gateway drug, then one day your body will start to reject it and you will withdrawl*so is said* Thats why all people think about is EQ and how then can become better at the game. <br>
<br>
 I don't know to much about how the brain functions or how crackheads function, but I do somestuff, little amounts at that. Please if I am wrong correct me, just trying to give you all a heads up about this stuff, I don't know if this is all true it's what I watched so....<br>
<br>
Does anyone know more about this then I do?  <br>
-About how Dopamines work and the facts about how our brains work? I would like to find out a little more about this, sounds really interresting...<br>
<br>
Anyways, just something I thought you guys would like to hear..<br>

Let's ban everything that causes a small release of dopamine!  Well, stop playing the national anthem for starters- 8 micromoles/L increase!  News broadcasts, weddings, anniversary parties, birthdays, sporting events, cancel them all.  Forget elections too- far too much dopamine coursing through the carotid there.  And what about chocolate?<br>
<br>
Eating chocolate releases massive and I do mean massive, quantities of dopamine.  It's simply a neurotransmitter that can act as a mild endorphin in some cases...nothing to be afraid of.  The etymology of the word is probably what worries most people- yet the absence of dopamine is also incredibly detrimental and can lead to Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, but most common of all, depression.  People enjoy certain activities, especially those that grant a sense of achievement.  If you're going to call EQ players addicts, that must surely extend to sports fans, driven career personalities and anyone with a hobby.  The woman who said she'd never sell her account- I happen to collect football jerseys (soccer to you backward Americans!)- been doing it for 4 years, about as long as EQ's been around.  Now if you asked me to sell any of my rare ones I'd most likely slap you with a large fish, if I had one to hand.  Decent analogy- with the exception that collecting things is a solo activity and EQ is a social one.<br>
<br>
Kesh is right...linking addiction to activity is like linking crime to social activities- there is almost no link and certainly greater links in social *differences* than activities pursued.  Hundreds of people world-wide kill themselves for a whole slew of &quot;reasons&quot;- and it rarely if ever has to do with a social activity.  Another example- does anyone believe that banning violence in every form of media will seriously decrease crime?  Well, someone once believed that banning alcohol would halt alcoholism...instead it serialised it. <br>
<br>
People who are mentally unstable will take violent and self-harmful action because of their condition, not because of a game they play.  People will try and look for scapegoats, they always have.  From McCarthyism to motor cars, history is littered with skeptics and pundits pointing the finger at anything but the actual cause of the problem.  Why?  Because the actual problem is displeasing and difficult + expensive to solve, a scapegoat is oh so much easier to sell to the public.  Communists were *evil*, cars were *evil* in the early 20th century, countless innovations in social behaviour brought about by ideology and technology have been repeatedly undermined by skeptics and naysayers- usually without a fig of statistical evidence.  Show me a double-blind study supporting this claim and I'll read it...make outrageous anecdotal claims on a *television program* of all things, and I'll just laugh.  As will most people with sense I shouldn't wonder.<br>

<br>
Although I'm no medical student, I do see some true points that cause me to quit EQ sometimes just to do a reality check.<br>
<br>
1) That point about thinking about EQ away from the game is very true.  You all experience it yourself I'm sure.  It's what makes us posts on these boards, and look endlessly at allakhazams and casters realm, and basically do our best to acquire a TON of knowledge about something not really that important in the grand scheme of things. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I think if I put this much effort into the stock market, I could be rich (that is as long as we can keep those crooked CEO’s in jail).<br>
<br>
2) When you talk about addiction, usually the people who aren’t addicted look at themselves analytically just to make sure they have their priorities straight and have it under control.  It’s the real alcoholics who blow up fast and are quick to say “there is no problem!!!”  <br>

I always enjoy watching something about EQ, just like i did in the past when i played D&amp;D.<br>
<br>
The real problem is that some actually think the reporter is rigth, and will blame any problem a EQplayer has on the game.<br>
Nobody talks about the fun and good the game provided to it's &quot;users&quot;.<br>
<br>
Ofcourse it's true that some uses the game to eacape from reality, but if they didn't have the game they could just do something else <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  1) That point about thinking about EQ away from the game is very true. You all experience it yourself I'm sure. It's what makes us posts on these boards, and look endlessly at allakhazams and casters realm, and basically do our best to acquire a TON of knowledge about something not really that important in the grand scheme of things. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No doubt, but the question to pose here surely must be:  &quot;Is this at all harmful?&quot;.  Ever talk about a sporting event after the fact?  I know I sure as bloody hell have- when Steve Redgrave won his 5th Olympic gold I couldn't stop talking about it.  When we trashed the Argies at the world cup I went into lavish and often drunken detail about every key incident in the game and how England were a force in world football once more.  Is that harmful...no I don't think it is.  I discuss various current events in medicine outside my clinics with colleagues, even those entirely unrelated to my field.  It's because I enjoy my job, and find new information backed up by a colleague's point of view highly enjoyable.  How is that different to Mearis and me enjoying a drink in a pub discussing the pitiable state of warrior dps?  I don't see that it is at all- just shows that we love the game.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  2) When you talk about addiction, usually the people who aren’t addicted look at themselves analytically just to make sure they have their priorities straight and have it under control. It’s the real alcoholics who blow up fast and are quick to say “there is no problem!!!” <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I didn't say there wasn't a problem- merely that the problem is almost certainly not EQ.  I say that with the same tone that it is *almost certain* we will never find an adaptable vaccinable antibody agent for influenza- just to give you an idea of scale.<br>
<br>
The flaw in your argument is quite simple.  Let us assume, for a moment- that said alcoholic happened to play EQ.  And that as a result of his alcoholism he abused his children, pushed people away and acted despicably towards his wife.  Would we blame EQ for that, or the alcoholism?  That lad who shot himself probably, in fact almost certainly had serious and far-reaching mental health problems probably but not necessarily including depression and panic attacks.  There is no proven track record of cause and effect in this area of study, and there's a good reason for that- because there isn't one.  Human beings are thoroughly social animals, and EQ does nothing to harm that overtly- it engenders it.  As such, behavioural influences (if any)- I would hypothesize they made a positive difference on a statistical basis.  <br>
<br>
But here's the key thing- you shouldn't take my word for it.  Even if I put my steth on, and went on national TV with scrubs or a white coat buttoned over a double-breasted Saville row suit wearing a tophat...you shouldn't believe a bloody word I say until you see evidence of it.  Hard, statistical evidence, freely accessible for public consumption.  Not a squiggly red graph with unlabeled axes, not a multi-coloured Excel pie-chart that has hands &amp; legs and waves at you, no unscaled bar-graphs, no bloody paper-clips tapping on your screen.  Plotted 2-tailed t tests, chi squared analyses, p-value comparisons, Blake approximations, the sodding lot.  Human behaviour is hard to quantify so the study needs to use all the tools at its disposal to weigh the data.  <br>
<br>
Without even having seen the program (the BBC is far too sensible to screen trash like that I'm happy to say), I can already tell you no such study was carried out- certainly not a clinically screened double-blind one.  It's no more or less than a specious and loaded attempt to convince a viewer of the irrevocable truth of a biased statement.  I won't even dignify it with the title of a hypothesis, as that term implies your goal is to establish something with reasonable methodology.  Poppycock, to quote JM Barrie.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  3) Lawyers aren’t the problem, it’s those damn plaintiffs.  But I only can hope to get “millions and billions of dollars someday for likely nothing” (or whatever that means).<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Straying slightly from the point, but nonetheless:<br>
<br>
I'd be inclined to think the problem would be the judges and juries that deem such ludicrous rewards to be just and fair.  I've read a fair bit of US statutory law, well medical insurance law in any case.  The overwhelming majority of it is well thought-out and very carefully framed by its legitors(far better than UK counterparts), with one notable exception.  It assumes an intelligent and educated jury, plus an unbiased judge overseeing proceedings.  Juries are overall uneducated in the law, inexperienced (many only hear a single case their whole lives)- and are never required to submit reasoning behind their verdict.  It's like putting a number of blind piebald mice in a cage with a pencil and a piece of paper and asking them to draw a countryside portrait.<br>
<br>
Judges on the other hand are incredibly generous with rewards, for the most part because it inflates the value and ego of the civil system of laws.  I wouldn't blame the plaintiffs, far from it.  If I knew I could park my car and not get caught- who's to blame...me or the police?  In an ideal world I should be the perfect citizen and never double-park my car.  But if enforcement is lax, then it is to blame, not those who take advantage of it in a minor fashion.  If children run riot in a classroom, is the teacher to blame, or are the children?  After all, plaintiffs know nothing about the law, they are as children to Caeia Justifica.  So the caretakers of the system must ensure the integrity of expression that was in the minds of the laws' framers.  Not the verve that is associated with their profession reaching headlines and breaking salary caps.<br>
<br>

Perhaps one day people will thank EQ for occupying their kids and keeping them off the streets.  Thanking sony for keeping their offspring with a pentient for addiction off the crack and online. Who knows.  Stranger things have happened, see above.<br>
