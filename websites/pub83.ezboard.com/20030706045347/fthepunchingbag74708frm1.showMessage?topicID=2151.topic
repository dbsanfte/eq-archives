<br>
Ive been looking around your page and the information has been wonderfull and helpfull so far and made my questions a lot less, if I ask something thats been asked before tho and you know a link Im happy with that and not making you repeat yourselfs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I was working on one MA and got her to level 13 but my main problem is ive put points into skills that she will never use (was only my 2nd person and I was not compleatly shure on what I was doing).<br>
<br>
So ive just remade her and I was wishing for all of your expert advices on what im planning to do and if you think its a good plan or not.<br>
<br>
Abilites -<br>
<br>
Str (Max) - As if I am right it affects the damage I do (BTW i use unarmed combat)<br>
Agil (Max) - As it determins the speed i attack<br>
Sta - up only as my Bod Dev needs.<br>
Int (Max) as it affects many usefull skills<br>
Sence (Max) Its green - lol ok I dont know what this does but I heard i should keep it Maxed.<br>
Psy - Only as my Nano Pool Needs<br>
<br>
Bod Dev &amp; Nanno - Max every level cant have to much HP and gona need them nannos for all the buffs and heals right?<br>
<br>
Body -<br>
<br>
Max MA (we are MAs after all) Max Brawling (Every Hit counts) Max Dimach (At lvl 12 I was up against a boos and hit him for just under 200 with it, good or not it stoped me from Dieing)<br>
<br>
Melee - Parry, now this Im not shure on, since If Its maxed It helps stop a hit now and again, but from what ive seen this is not very often, but it is needed for some of the things we got like the Blessed With Thunder, Flower of life. (I chose not to Train Ripside over Parry)<br>
<br>
Misc and Ranged - Nothing, was going to Speclise in Hand to hand not in the Bow even tho its green I think my points are gona be well spread anyways<br>
<br>
Speed -<br>
<br>
Max Phy Init, Dodge Rng and Evade ClsC<br>
Nothing on duck Exp<br>
Max Run speed by only if I have enough points for the other skills that are more important.<br>
<br>
Nano Reist, I know this will be a good one but I dont know how much to put it in as its Blue.<br>
<br>
Trade &amp; Rep -<br>
<br>
Comp. Lit only. And Max this but to what level I dont know I do know what a Bonus it is tho to have a good NCU. other than that I dont know what this will allow me to do heard soemthing about a Grid but I thought that was the Whompers.<br>
<br>
Nano &amp; Aiding -<br>
<br>
This one im not shure on also.  There is so much to pick and there all as blue as can be.<br>
<br>
The Types of Nanno that most intreast me are -<br>
<br>
Healing - Its nice to take some strain off the Doc at times (being I used to be a Cleric in EQ I know how bad it is when you cant heal everyone at once)<br>
<br>
Damage Buffs/ Controlled Destruction (More damage = Dead mob faster - less life lost)<br>
<br>
Evade Buffs - (less damage, need I say more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Crit Hit Buffs - (Never been high enougth to use em but I understand there importance)<br>
<br>
The MA Skill Buffs - This will help boost the main Skills im going to use so thay seem to be a wise investment.<br>
<br>
Now the ones im not shure on are AC Buffs, And the MA Str Buffs. As if i do go for all the others im going to be pumping points into T&amp;S, Sens Imp Psyco, Bio Met.<br>
<br>
Now thats a lot of Blue skills and Im really not shure If I can afford another one for AC and Str buffs that from all Ive heard add such a little amout there is no point in puting the poins there (there beeing Matter Cret)<br>
<br>
ok now what i think on them are done....<br>
<br>
First Aid and Treetment.<br>
<br>
More in them the better the packs i can get, now do I max em, or do I just up them as I find I need better healing packs.<br>
<br>
Spying,<br>
<br>
Ive been told I should up my B&amp;E, its a blue skill that will let me get into chests. but I also heard it needs to be almost three times the level of the mission your going on to be any good, so that seems way to much.<br>
<br>
Navigation,<br>
<br>
Not gona get a car, Planning to be able to run like the wind and not have to use one. but Map Nav, I think this is the only one EVERY agrees on, get it to 130 so you can get the Monster locator. Well im upping right now since it cant be that bad if everyone says its good, but if there is reason for me to not bother let me know and Ill stop before I put to many points into it. <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any information corections, slaps across the faces I get because Im beeing dumb and I dont need to go X and should do Y instead.<br>
<br>
Yours Truly.<br>
<br>
Sal.<br>

Most important thing we need to know right now that you left out is your breed. Different breeds may use slightly different rules for maxing stats and abilities.<br>
I will get to the stuff that no matter what breed you are, you should really do...<br>
<br>
Abilities~<br>
Your ability deductions seem sound, depending on your breed, and what type of armor you will be going with. I would suggest Str/Agi armor (flowers tech is my favorite in this category), or maybe some Sense/Agi (Obtru steel ribbed has good stats too). Unless you are a atrox in which case you can equip better Str/Sta armor than Str/Agi or Sense/Agi. Remember that brawl is heavily dependant on Stamina. The higher your stamina, the higher your brawl skill, the higher your brawl damage. MA skill is dependanton Str/Agi/Sense. I always max Body Dev and use to max nano pool, but as IP's got slim I cut back on nano pool.<br>
<br>
Body~<br>
Max MA-of course<br>
Max brawl<br>
Forget Dimach unless you need for a MA special attack. This skill is great for the first few levels, but as your level goes up, even if Diamch is maxed, its effectiveness goes down. Dimach damage is not scaled properly to the mobs, or players hit points.<br>
<br>
Melee~<br>
I would say hold off on parry until you need that for Blessed with Thunder, if you choose to use it. Blessed with Thunder is my personal fav for MA spec attacks but you can't use it until at least level 30ish and it easy enough to catch it up later on your parry skill.<br>
<br>
Misc and Ranged~<br>
Nothing- bows are getting better but I still don't think they are worth it, my opinion however.<br>
<br>
Speed~<br>
I max Phys Init and all my evades except Duck Xp and Nano resist. Max run speed for a while, it can save you life, but when IP's get tight, let it slide a little.<br>
<br>
Trade&amp;Repair~<br>
Good call- max comp lit when possible, leave everything else alone.<br>
<br>
Nano&amp; Aiding~<br>
Keep these ones high: Bio met, Sens Imp, Psycho Mod, T&amp;S, Treatment. Worry about the others little, only raise em when you need em, especially matt crea. I suggest using first aid at the early levels and keeping it maxed, since our heals are small then. Give up on first aid when you have you nano skills high enough to use good heals, they are much more efficeint.<br>
<br>
Treatment~<br>
Keep your treatment high, the higher you treatment, the better implants you can put in, and for an MA it is the only way to overequip your weapons (your hands).<br>
<br>
Nano Formulas~<br>
You definetly want the heals, MA skill buffs, damage buffs and crit buffs. AC buffs are great at lower levels when you might have little or no armor on your bod. AC buffs are good at extremely high levels when you are already in QL200 armor and need just a little more protection. This is debatable however. Str buffs I went as far a muscle stim and stopped putting points in matt met.<br>
<br>
Spying~<br>
I like to be able open chests in missions, especially since I solo them alot. Usually there is crap in them, but you can find some really cool stuff on occasion, including MA spec attacks that should be about the right level for you to use <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I up B&amp;E just enough to open the chests in solo missions. But you could certainly save some IP here if you forget about locked chests. I caution you, I was in a group the other night WITH A FIXER and was the only one who could unlock the locked doors.<br>
<br>
Navigation~<br>
Max Map Nav as long as you can stand it, you want all the upgrades and all the maps, it does get a bit ridiculous for the high level stuff, but I would shoot for 130 so you can use up to the monster upgrade at the very least.<br>
Vehicles~leave em alone until you've got 6 Million credits for a yalmaha, trust me you want one even though you don't know it yet. No amount of run speed(unless maybe if you are a high level fixer) can even come close to keeping up with a Yalm, plus, they FLY!<br>

<br>
Its certainly the little things like letting me know Dimatch gets a little on the weak side as things pass on in levels also yesterday a Friend was telling me there Dimatch is parryed hald the time anyways, so another reason that not useing it might be a bonus (other than the Pre-Req)<br>
<br>
Thanks for the types of armour recommended, where abouts would I find them tho, are they shop items or loot only?<br>
<br>
gona hold off on Parry till I need it, and use the points into the Nano skills so i can start upping my Treet and First Aid as recomended and also for the other Nannos as req, need to see when that first healing buff of mine is going to come up again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Speed, ok cool. think you said all i needed to know there.<br>
<br>
Spying tho, im still not shure on, but ill keep more of an open mind on the matter, and Navi.... Flying eh.. hummm... hehe I think i better start saving that 6 Mill.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the information, oh and I almost forgot again lol, but im an Oplix... emm bad spelling sorry but im shure you know the one im meening. (also Clan ((on the No 2 server if im not mistaken)))<br>

Dimach just takes so dang long to refresh. I used to max it but I let it slide when IP's got tight, though I still use it for it's possible few hundred damage at critical times.<br>
<br>
Something I left out. You will probably want some Ip in Nano Init to speed up you heals a little. It won't make the recovery time faster, but the initial execution of the program will go faster.<br>
<br>
Flowers tech I have seen in stores but my fav armors are most comonly found as loot, all though they are not very common loot. Look to buy them from other players. Also look for an Organic Combat Suit, they come in different colors with different ability reqs and offer different skill buffs, they are boss loot only, and are available at low levels. At lower levels, just peice together what ever you can find for Sense/Agi and Str/Agi. Having any peice of armor is better than not wearing anything. These are all decent enough to consider: MA suit armor, any steel ribbed, flowers tech, senpai anything (QL25 and up), metaplast is even ok if you can't find anything else. Can clanners wear metaplast? I can't remember if it is omni only.<br>
<br>
You caught me at a good time, slow afternoon at work with no bosses around yesterday <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
(roleplaying on)I just wish I had known you were a clanner, I would have told you to go piss up a rope...<br>
Just kidding, I am happy to help a fellow MA no matter what their alignment. Just know that someday we may come face to face and I will have no problem taking out scum like you.<br>

I agree pretty much with all of your conclusions, grasshopper. You have studied carefully and well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would clarify a bit with regard to Nanoskills<br>
<br>
the following is JUST my opinion -<br>
<br>
(ahem)<br>
<br>
You can't possibly afford to keep up 6 nanoskills, or even 5.<br>
<br>
Therefore, ignore MC totally, and only develop MM until you can do the generic +12 boosts to Abilities.<br>
<br>
You need PM, SI, and T&amp;S for the crit buffs which are the most important MA buff.<br>
<br>
You need BM (with T&amp;S) for the MA heals.<br>
<br>
You need T&amp;S to use the best possible nano kits.<br>
<br>
Following this plan, you will not be able to use the AC buffs. This is no great loss, since they flat out suck anyways. <br>
<br>
You will also not be able to use the Strength buff. Get used to it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Only in this way will you have enough IP. Any other plan will eventually leave you high and dry.<br>
<br>
But the rest of what you had to say was right on the money. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crimhawk>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Martial, Baby, MARTIAL.</span><br>  Posts: 445<br> <font color=#660000>(11/11/02 5:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2151.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hello all! - Im new to the MA and I need some help :)</span><hr size=1> Muscle Stim is only 118 met mat......therefore it would behoove you to reach that magical number THEN forget about met mat forever. +24 str (+12 gen buff/+12 MS) is a great boon for overequipping and the price is not that high to pay if you solo at all. <br>
<br>
It seems the new breed of ppl only wants to group, group, group forsaking soloing for the lure of quick lvls. Big mistake. Learn how to solo first, THEN group, group, group. You will, at some point, need to solo for cash/equipment/quests and if you have not honed your solo skills and learned the ins and outs of going it alone it will not be a pretty picture.<br>
