No, At this time we have frozen recruitment until we are in need of players.  Unfortunately, due to the contraints on raid limits, we have found that we need to temporarily close our doors to new recruits.<br>
<br>
OMG my heart is broken!! I've always aspired to be in Ascending Dawn.. is there ANYTHING I can do??  Yes, get to know our members outside of raids.  Try joining up and experiencing with AD members or doing LDoN raids with us.  We'll be spending more time there in the upcoming weeks and it's certain we'll need players again in the future.  Finding 5 sponsors is a major hurdle to becoming a recruit, take this time to meet people who can be your potential sponsors when we open recruitment again. Make connections in the guild.  We're willing to make exceptions if there is a large enough response from our members requesting we do so for a particular player.  We notice dedication, determination and persistance.  Good luck to you in your adventures and hope to see you in game.<br>
<br>
Our requirements aren't meant to be discouraging, they're meant to be realistic.  In the future, I'm sure we will be looking for dedicated players, people willing to die frequently as we learn new encounters, remain patient and attentive while keeping a good attitude through long hours of raiding, and people who know how to have FUN while playing.  If you're a quitter or a whiner or have trouble following directions, you can stop reading right now.  Otherwise, read over our requirements:<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must be an active player.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If you can only play 1-2 hours a day, once or a twice a week, then AD probably isn't the guild for you.  We're looking for people who can play frequently, for long stretches at a time, and love to raid.  Our standard raiding hours are between 7pm est to 1am est.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must have 5 sponsors BEFORE YOUR APPLICATION IS CONSIDERED.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Your sponsors need to post a follow up to your application indicating their sponsorship. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> One (or more) of your sponsors must be in your class.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Sponsors are currently active, long standing AD members who are willing to vouch for your playing ability and personality, look after you and keep you informed at raids, and take the blame if you fuck up somewhere.  These should be people you have past relations with - doing a /who all &quot;asc&quot; will rarely find you sponsors, and may hurt your chances at joining AD in the long run.  If there aren't 5 people in the guild that know you well enough to want to sponsor you, spend more time outside of events (xping with us, or whatever), before submitting your application.  You will need to be proactive in acquiring sponsors.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Occasionally we will make exceptions for classes in high demand; however a minimum of 1 sponsor will always be needed before attending any raids</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must be level 65, absolutely no exceptions.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Additional advancement through raid-useful AA abilities are now required.  See the next post on additional requirements for your class.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must have adequate gear.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  We don't expect you to have full elemental armor, but there are a number of excellent quests to do and tradeskill items you can obtain to easily advance your character.  Coldain Ring and Shawl quests, Chardok Spirit Wracked Cords, Strength of the Elements, PoP tradeskilled items are all highly recommended.  You should also be able to easily get over 100 in any required resist.  Any lower than that and you'll be a liability to us versus any AEing mobs.  You also need to have some sort of EB item - Fishbone earring or lodizal shield, etc.  Additionally, some sort of right click item is required, *aside* from jboots.  (Coldain ring and shrunken goblin earring are commonly used for this purpose)<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must be unguilded and not currently applying to any other guilds.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  We don't want people who are out &quot;testing the waters&quot; - We want people interested in and committed to joining AD and only AD.  We also aren't interested in people who left their prior guild on a bad note.  If you failed to show loyalty to them, why should we expect you to act any different with us?<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must have a decent knowledge of all zones, including all expansions.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  As we raid almost exclusively in PoP these days, keys for older expansions are no longer an issue.  You must be flagged for Elemental planes or close to being flagged for them.  Additional flags are recommended but not required - we will get you all the flags you need as a recruit, though it may be a long process.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must have approval from everyone in the guild.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  This doesn't mean that everyone loves you and wants to sponsor you personally, but it does mean that you need to work out any past arguements or disagreements with any current guild members.  Additionally you must have a good reputation with the server at large - if you random in your spare time, if you're kos to half a dozen other guilds, if you KS and train whenever possible, we don't want you.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must have a thick skin.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Whats that mean?  We joke around a lot, tease, and call each other names in guildchat, all in good fun.  We've had our share of drama queens in the past, these days we're looking for calm, fun, and easy going people.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must be patient.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Recruitment is a *long* process -  applicants spend a minimum of six weeks as recruits.  We are very careful with who we guild - We find a long recruitment weeds out those who aren't really interested in joining, and helps ensure loyalty.  Our guild turnover is low, and we'd like to keep it that way.  While its fine to ask on occasion how your recruitment period is progressing, excessive and frequent inquiries every day are frowned upon.  <br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must enjoy playing and working to improve your current character class.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If we recruit your necromancer, it means we want you playing and working on improving your necro, not twinking up a warrior, or rogue, or whatever.  If you have the ability to two-box and play multiple characters at raids, that is welcomed, but changing your primary is not an option while in AD.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>  You must be willing to pvp.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  AD has been through several large scale wars in the past, and knowing RZ, will be through more in the future.  If you are the type to log off or hide on a twink instead of fighting for your guild, AD isn't for you.<br>
<br>
Think you have what it takes?  Talk to your potential sponsors, make sure they're willing to vouch for you.  Get to know as many additional AD members as you can.  Once you're ready, post your application here, telling a bit about yourself, your past history on RZ, and exactly why you want to join AD - this will be an important post, be sure to mention anything you feel is noteworthy or special and worth us knowing.<br>
<br>
If you have any further questions feel free to post here, or talk to me or any other officer in game.  (As long as we aren't TOO busy during an event we should be able to get back to you.) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=slithurthemystic>slithurthemystic</A> at: 11/20/03 3:11 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=171.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=171.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.threadControl?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=171.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Somthor's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm31">Beastlords<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5>Recruitment Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
