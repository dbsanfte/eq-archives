I know that US decisions in the past have most likely led up this.  When I was reffering to the support of our troops though, I was reffering to the people who protested out front of a military base(here in the US).  You would think that the people who organize these things would protest outside the offices of their congressman or something of the like.  Why my previous post was long, drawn out is because i'm interested what others have to say, and especially those not in the US.  The Taliban people that are being held in cuba is something I don't know a great deal about.  But I have recentally read about that they are now being offered mental health care in addition to what they receive now(/shrug its a step in the right direction I guess). I'm sure if they were innocent of any wrong doing they wouldn't be detained. What the US has done in the past (playing both ends against the middle) wasn't right and I agree with you.  But noone that I or you know can shape the past.  We learn from past mistakes and try and not make them again.  One mistake that the coalition forces of the first gulf war made was to not remove saddam from power.  I'm not saying that the US support of iraq in the past was right.  But our leadership of that time deemed it a neccesary evil to protect US interests.  Is that moraly right?  No.  We made a bad situation worse by not useing foresight to see the future problems it would create.  I think that the government now is using a combination of foresight, and morality in the decision to unseat saddam.  I'm not saying the invasion is moral altogether.  But mix that in with the US trying to protect American interests and this is what you get.  Not to mention the tragedy of 911.  As for the Governments who have permanent veto power that were against this war from the start.  I'd bet that those Governments have a considerable amount to lose if saddam and his regime are unseated.  Shit look at the reports that are out now about the Russians selling iraq weapons technology.  France i'm sure has alot to lose also.  Pre-emtive war is something that the future has in store for us i'm afraid.  If it was in practice 70 or so years ago half of europe would not have been conquered by the nazis.  The world needs policemen.  Hopefully one day we can evolve ourselves enough to sit down at a table and change things but that isn't in our imediate future.  Sure we went to war, but saddam could have easily avoided this conflict if he didnt blow smoke up the worlds ass by saying he doesn't have this weapon or that weapon.  He could have stepped down and let the people decide on how the fate of iraq should be decided.  And to the guy who said leave God out of all this.  Opinions are like assholes, everyones got one.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=varmaxrz>VarMaxRz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(3/25/03 6:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> o and ebon</span><hr size=1> I was just trying to make a point.

Try to bear with me =p I've tried not to get involved with the WMD issue, since it tends to end up as a yes/no type of argument. I suspect there's a reasonable chance Saddam might have this stuff, but by no means it has been proven, before the war or during it. The plant you mentioned Smawty, was reported to be a WMD factory by anonymous leaks to Fox News and Jerusalem Post, hardly unbiased sources. Silence over the issue has been noticable after the day, one would think it would have been paraded all over. As a matter of fact, here's a quote from NY Times:<br>
<br>
&quot;Fresh concerns were expressed today by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that Mr. Hussein might resort to chemical weapons attacks as allied armies approach Baghdad. Up to now, no such weapons have been found in depots or other military installations taken by allied troops.&quot; [1]<br>
<br>
Considering that Saddam was portrayed as a some kind of chemical madman, he's been pretty restrained in using those things. Not saying that he wouldn't have any, just wondering.<br>
<br>
On the Russian arms exports. Most of the Russian arms industry has been privatized over the years. I suppose we all know what's the business morale over there like, and I would think those companies are doing what every business would do when opportunity knocks, trying to cash in as much as they can. Morally acceptable? Hardly. Understandable? Certainly. I suppose the Russian government's lazy stance in clamping down on it is partly because after being snubbed along the rest of the world by US actions, they aren't too eager in helping out. What I suspect to be a more significant reason though, is that they simply might not have that much say in the issue. I'm not certain how's the situation in Russia like but it seems the mafia and other shady organizations have some power in there, and it may be there's some kind of silent agreement to look the other way, not sure. <br>
<br>
Russians aren't stupid either, and if they wished to save what there is to save from their investments, they would appease the US as much as they can. I don't think anyone has any doubts of the eventual outcome of the war. One possible scenario I can think of is that the Russians might have calculated that the Iraqis would remember them as a party who aided them in their struggle against an attack, however that doesn't sound too likely to me. Finally, someone might even argue (and take this with a healthy dose of salt) that those companies are selling arms not into an aggressor country, but into one that is defending itself. Sure they are under UN sanctions, but if war can be started against the will of UN, what is little arms smuggling compared to that?<br>

The other point I've emphasised again and again is the obvious- the only reason Saddam was emboldened to use chemical weapons in open violation of international law is that the two most powerful countries in the world supported him to the hilt. In the absence of that support you may be sure that he would never have even dreamt of using such weapons, because of deterrence.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Frankly I don't think you can read Saddaem's mind Taranna.  I believe Saddaem would of used those chemicals on his own population without US/UK support.  Saddaem is master of his own universe and doesn't need permission from anyone to do what he wants in his own country.  Least of all you defending him. Are you going to blame the US/UK for supporting every brutal action Saddaem did in Iraq?  For sending his coutry to war with Iran and using chemaical weapons?  For torturing countless suspected enemies during and after his rise to power?  For starving his population while his elite party grew fat on the sorrows of the poor?  For Invading Kuwaiit and having at one time the 4th largest army in the world?  For spawning raping deadly sons who are even more ruthless than he is?  When will Saddaem be held accountable for his own actions and the US/UK don't get blamed?<br>
<br>
If the answer is never.  Then by golly your in luck, the US/UK are going to Iraq and kick this tyrannt's regime out!  To clean up this mess that you think the US/Uk 100% made.<br>

Some people choose to live under oppression, racism, fear, and tyranny.  They have no freedom, yet they do not starve.  They may have safety, yet they can't voice opposition. They may be alive, but they are invisible.<br>

You may find this acceptable.  But others throughout history have repeatibly been willing to die for freedom and equality alone.  <br>

Rather: Mr. President, If-- if there is an invasion, will you set fire to the oil fields? Will you blow the damns? Or your reservoirs of water, to resist the invasion? <br>
<br>
Translator For Saddam Hussein: We have answered - We have answered the hypotheses. I've answered the hypothesis. But to indulge in the details-- Iraq does not burn its wealth. Its (UNINTEL). <br>
(OVERTALK) <br>
<br>
And-- it does not destroy its-- dams. We hope that, however, that this question is not meant-- as an insinuation, so that the Iraqi dams and the Iraqi oil wells will be destroyed by those who will invade Iraq, in their possible invasion of the country. <br>
<br>
Iraq does not destroy its dams or its oil. Iraq protects, defends, maintains those resources, in order to improve life. <br>

But of course I understand what Saddam really meant.  He meant these are MY oil wells and if I can't have em, no one will.  Cause there is no Iraq if I'm not running it, F@#$ the civilian population who voted 100% for me in the last election.  Saddam is dearly loved by the atheltes whom his son terrorizes, by the force fed one sided media whom his son runs, and by all his political friends, since all his enemies are rotting in jail or dead long ago.<br>

There's them (the bad guys) and us (the good guys) and we can do no wrong. Speaking of idiots, welcome back.<br>
<br>
How many times has the west, oh center of the civilized world, &quot;liberated&quot; nations such as Iraq from their evil overlords? I know this won't be the first time that Iraq has been &quot;liberated.&quot; <br>
<br>
But we know what's best, and besides those countries have all that great oil we can use to pay for the war. And look we can also use it to pay for their reconstruction after the war. What could be better, we bring civilization to the barbarians and we make a nice little profit ourselves? <br>
<br>
And all those previous times when we sort of occupied their nation until we were forced out through bloody opposition... those were the past. We've learned from the past haven't we? I'm sure that when we begin appointing our people to oversee the management of Iraq they'll have the best interests of the Iraqi people at heart. Just like when we decided to bomb their cities.<br>
<br>
Saddam's a miserable person. But there were better ways to deal with this problem. And while some simple minds may believe that an overt military response is always the best one, sometimes its more effective to use diplomacy. Even if that means you have to tolerate some things you may find reprehensible. <br>
<br>
Any fool can stand up and make some self righteous speech about liberty and freedom and how we need to bring it to everyone. And the minute they do that by imposing their will on another nation through military force, their words will be meaningless.<br>
<br>
Real and lasting progress will be made through diplomacy. Or does anyone really believe that the Chinese would have been better off if we'd invaded them and forced social change. The only difference here: Iraq has an insignificant military compared to some other governments which we might consider brutal. Oh and that oil bit doesn't hurt either.<br>

I'm glad you have had a more productive and successful time in college than I did.  I'm glad you also know that since I told you all about my educational background.  Oh wait!  I didn't.  <br>
<br>
The only indication of your intelligence to those of us that read this public board is the manner in which you post.  On that note, I find it hard to believe you ever even graduated from high school.  Sorry to be so harsh, but when you start saying stuff like, 'get off my tip... go back to the corner,' etc., you deserve the honest truth.  I've seen you post racist comments, I've seen you accused of harassing female eq players, I've seen you make countless tasteless jokes, and display a generally neanderthal attitude.  It doesn't paint a good picture.  So kindly, get off your own 'tip.' <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/blackscorpionx18/myhomepage/avatar.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hakatri>Hakatri</A> at: 3/25/03 7:09:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spooksmcgee>SpooksMcgee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#333333>(3/25/03 6:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: i know</span><hr size=1> Taranna, they're already starving. One of the reasons so many Iraqi's aren't starving is because of foreign aid from countries like ours.  I guarantee you more innocent people die under Saddam's regime than the numbers killed in this war.<br>
<br>
&quot;No amount of aid will restore Iraq's sons killed defending their country&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, I can't say it's completely their fault since they grew up in a culture taught to hate the West.  Many of the soldiers have been duped into believeing they're fighting for the common good.  But many others are just evil.  We can't change their way of thinking, so I would rather remove their power than have them running around Iraq proividing military support to a guy like Saddam.<br>
<br>
&quot;or innocent women and children who became victims of the bombing (the dehumanizing euphemism &quot;collateral damage&quot; sickens me).&quot;<br>
<br>
Would the life of one Iraqi soldier be worth the life of two Kurds?  What if you knew that by killing one Iraqi soldier you could save the lives of an entire family of Iraqi citizens? Now let's say you could cure every communicable disease in the world, but the research would require the deaths of 100 babies?  How about 1 baby? At what point does collateral damage change from &quot;disgusting&quot; to &quot;tolerable?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, I think the war is justified given the threat of what he can do with weapons of mass destruction, and what his regime has already done to their country.  His son that is in line to rule after Saddam has murdered, dismembered, and raped hundreds of people.  Compared to him Saddam looks like Queen Elizabeth.<br>
<br>
 It's also worth noting that most of the rest of the 8 billion dollars of foreign aid goes to Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey. Thinking of the political consequences, I doubt very much the starving Arab population of Iraq will be very impressed with Israel being awarded 4 times the aid they are. <br>
<br>
As for the discrepancies with the budget, 80 billion is required to eliminate the rising nuclear threat.  That same figure isn't necessarily required to feed the people of Iraq.  Hell, it's not like Saddam is feeding them now.  You'd be taking control of the oil fields away from Saddam and giving those profits to the country.  Do you know how many people you could feed with the money it cost to build just one of his 40 palaces? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kadandrumtally>Kadandrum Tally</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cartooncars.com/images/print/bmw/e46m3silv.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 594<br> <font color=#333333>(3/25/03 7:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cartooncars.com/images/print/bmw/e46m3silv.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> GIMP IT!</span><hr size=1> Now that this thread has stooped to a level of insulting other's intelligence, I support it being GIMPED WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE!  w00p w00p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hakatri>Hakatri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 284<br> <font color=#333333>(3/25/03 7:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GIMP IT!</span><hr size=1> Sorry Kad but I couldn't help it... gimp it if you like <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/blackscorpionx18/myhomepage/avatar.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kron@ascension10244>Kron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#333333>(3/25/03 8:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: GIMP IT!</span><hr size=1> Someone (toolazy to scroll up) asked where i got that american massacre in afgahnistan story from, well from TV.<br>
