<br>
Here it is:<br>
<br>
I apologize for the train in The Grey.  I won't do it again, and have not done so for almost a year now, and have even taken exp deaths since then to avoid training AD people by accident.<br>
<br>
I apologize for the 'talking shit'.  It wan't my intent at the time, as I thought it was the standard &quot;PvP&quot; banter that you'd normally see when two groups are having a confrontation.  I did not intend to make fun of anyone or the like.<br>
<br>
I apologize for the previous attempts at discussion of the whole thing on this board.  I also apologize for anything I might have said that would have offended anyone when those discussions became heated.  I would hope to be able to claim the same type of 'hot headdedness' that we all occassionally suffer from under certain circumstances.<br>
<br>
I apologize for not knowing that Leonxx was the friend of  Ezzelenu and that Ezzelenu's night would be ruined if Leonxx was not in an exp group 100% of their online time.<br>
<br>
At the time I thought it best if I just disband from the group and group my own guildies in a seperate group so that Leonxx could get in the original group and acquire more people for their own group.<br>
<br>
Note:  I think tonight's situation could have been avoided if Ezzelenu just maintained her presence in the group with Leonxx or at the very least had sent a tell letting me know WHEN to expect Leonxx back on.<br>
<br>
I had waited 15 minutes, no Leonxx I invited guildies.  I think we all agree we can't maintain free group spots for unlimited amounts of time on the off chance that someone who LD'd &quot;might&quot; be coming back.  Leonxx was unguilded, obviously a transfer (the xx's at the end of the name gives it away), and I didn't know him.<br>
<br>
I wasn't intentionally being rude at all.<br>
<br>
I was just using standard grouping practices we've all learned since the early early days of being a newb.<br>
<br>
Again, I apologize for not waiting longer, I was unaware that there was any expectation of it.<br>
<br>
I apologize if this ruined Leonxx's and Ezzelenu's night.  That was not my intention either.  Again, I and my guild members got out of the group so the grouping spots would be open.  I thought I was doing the right thing.<br>
<br>
I apologize if Ezzeleu's feelings were hurt or if I offended Ezzelenu when I was trying to figure out what all the hubub was.  Again, I had no idea of anything on her side of things as she was never even in the group while I was in it, nor was anything explained to me.<br>
<br>
I was truly nonplussed that any adult playing this game would have their play time ruined because an experience group got muddled.<br>
<br>
I apologize if my skull dented or dulled Sirdario's weapons both times he killed me (though I'd like another go when I'm buffed and FM, just for fun).<br>
<br>
I apologize that I wasn't able to get in contact with either of the people that Sirdario referred me to.  One was off-line the other was apparently AFK.<br>
<br>
I apologize if any of the AD membership feels neccessary to make fun of this post.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's it.  As indicated I have made the requisite apology.<br>
<br>
I don't intend on posting to this board any more and unless directed to do so by a member of AD in game will not respond to anything posted in response to this post.<br>
<br>
If you have ANY questions and would like to contact me via voice, here's my phone number:<br>
<br>
719-339-7259<br>
<br>
Please don't abuse it.<br>
<br>
I've done my best to be as 'even keel' as possible about this in an effort to resolve this issue between myself and your guild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=casciaad>casciaAD</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>PEEEkAAY</span><br>  Posts: 342<br> <font color=#333333>(7/17/03 4:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=298.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Apology</span><hr size=1> I don't say this often but &quot;fuck you&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thull4ne>thull4ne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AD > PB</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(7/17/03 5:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=298.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Apology</span><hr size=1> Jesus Fucking Christ, suck that dick, slurp slurpidy slurp slurp!  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=malio1>Malio1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mr. Hotkey</span><br>  Posts: 1915<br> <font color=#333333>(7/17/03 6:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=298.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://w3.one.net/~malhavok/malio.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An Apology</span><hr size=1> <br>

Stop being mean, JFC. I was playing Ezzelenu, Dimento did nothing wrong, Dimento its ok he got disbanded, he was having a bad night so he flipped irl. Dimento posted a very good apology and it was excepted, even last night. I didnt really opt to kill you, Sirdario is bloodthirsty. Have fun, if anyone has questions as to what happened, pst me. <br>
<br>
<br>
(Edit for PS: If anyone has issues, see the thread in AD Priv8 chat and read, didnt want drama on this, Again it was such a minor thing, Sird wanted to kill someone, /shrug. I stress that if you have ANY concerns chat with me in game.)  <p>      Feppy Teleport<br>

Didn't care either way, was more the fact of the mis invite. <br>
Also, we're not adults :-P We're 14 and 15.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I guess i gotta explain this, Kendyl (Leonxx) and I decided to get together one night to do a duo group together at his house. So thats why it did sorta wreck plans, that was what it was all about. Packing up my Watacoooooled Puta (TM) takes time and then setting up lan and stuff, well when we finally get online and stuff we don't want to waste time. Thanks again and hope this clarifies everything before you have questions.  <p>      Feppy Teleport<br>
