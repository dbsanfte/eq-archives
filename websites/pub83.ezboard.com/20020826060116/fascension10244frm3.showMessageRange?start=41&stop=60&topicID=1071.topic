Who do you think is going to be more interested in continuing to spend money, to spend more time, to spend several hours of their life to contribute to bettering their character so they can kill monster more efficiently? A huge EQ-PVE guild or a small (10 to 15) EQ-PVP guild with people who couldn't stand the boring hours upon hours of repetition? Well, maybe besides Koss. He was a LW.<br>
<br>
FU was there to PvP mainly, we PvPed over events, we caused more disturbances to your events, we beat your outnumbering odds at many times, we travelled small mostly and rarely even called for help. We forced AD and Synergy to merge for a period of time and add many new members to their ranks, including Insanity's Edge, just because of the devastation the core of Rebirth (FU)caused.  These guilds had people within them that despised eachother more than the hate between FU/AD or FU/tB.<br>
<br>
If you're going to use the excuse of 'yea, we're around, you're not' it's not going to work.  Had we stuck around, things wouldn't have changed much.  Except for the fact that you'd be losing and gaining new faces every day because they can't stand the PvP we dished out to them and the events that two to five FU members ruined on their own, without any training or cheating of any kind.  For the reasons above it's obvious your guild would have last longer.  But it doesn't change the followering facts that you CAN not deny.<br>
<br>
You lost a lot of members in AD because of the PvP.  Had you not merged with MiM/tB/Synregy and whoever else, just because you hated FU and others THAT much, AD as a whole would not be functional to do events.<br>
<br>
FU stopped any and all events that AD tried.  FU literally cleared out all AD events making them unsuccessfull during their last 2 weeks on Rallos Zek.<br>
<br>
The average FU member kill:death ratio was somewhere around 30:1.  However, the kill that you DID manage to get, you profit.  Why?  Because FU wore gear, FU weren't shameless cowards with no pride who would bind rush.  FU went into battle fully geared, every time, and fought outnumbered odds the majority of their stay on Rallos Zek.<br>
<br>
FU forced several people who dislike eachother to band together just because of the power FU held PvPwise.  Remember the Sabbat days when Synergy raped Sabbat? All of the whiners remained within AD, while the PvPers moved on to Rebirth.  The boards are still active and i'm sure 75% of you still have access so go and scroll back a little and read all the angry quitting posts because they can't handle PvP.  <br>
<br>
Adell stooped to the level of teaming with Hoser and Zelnik to gain her Brain of Rallos Zek as a prime example of this.  Adell probably hated these two more than anyone in FU during that time period.<br>
<br>
I can go on and on and on and list several more examples of why FU was more successfull during their stay on Rallos.  Trik simply pasted those kills to give an example of all the AD, no MiM, IE, tB, or any other guild included, of the screenshots we got in a two month span with minimal PvP contact.  The rest is just obvious.<br>
<br>
Once you start ackowledging the facts then you'll realized you lost by far.  Just remember all the miserable people who quit the game during the Sabbat/FU period.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ujoz1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Joz1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>0-2</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#333333>(7/3/02 2:40:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1071.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> spelling errors</span><hr size=1> would fix them cept i'm about to pass out.

<br>
That said, I still hate being left out, so I'm going to throw my pointless post in to the fray as well. Feel free to indulge yourself with my meaningless drivel.<br>
<br>
I believe AD/FU have had a difficult time deciding upon a victor due to fundamental differences in the way they gauged their gain/loss in battle. This is carried over from the very reason they fight their wars. Yeah, I know you're sitting there thinking &quot;No, FU just doesn't want to admit they were owned.&quot; while FU is sitting here thinking &quot;No, AD just doesn't want to admit they were outmatched in PvP.&quot; So, just bear with me for a minute.<br>
<br>
AD fought their wars in order to establish and protect their ability to perform the PvE aspects of EQ. They didn't fight wars for PvP conquest, they fought wars so that they could continue along their PvE path. Their objective in doing PvP battle was to defend their ability to peacefully do battle with NPC baddies. When they went to battle in a zone, their goal was to get the enemies out of the zone so that they could kill a npc for items. Ultimately, their goal was to force their enemies either to peace or off the server so they could have unrestricted access to all PvE areas.<br>
<br>
Broken down, that means AD's idea of victory in a WW battle was them being able to kill Klandicar at the end of the day. AD's idea of victory in an open battle in GD was getting a blue diamond bracer off of an enemy while taking no item losses. The number of enemies slain or the number of deaths taken meant nothing as long as the goals were accomplished in their own seperate situations. If AD is chain killed for 3 hours until their enemies adventually leave, only to have AD proceed to kill Klandicar: that is a victory for them. If AD lost 30 members in a battle who where all in No-Drop, only to slay one single member of the opposing team who was equipped in a fungi tunic: that was a satisfying victory in their minds. (In case someone is getting defensive here, there's nothing wrong with that approach, that's not intended to be an insult.)<br>
<br>
FU's goals, and thus their measure of victory, were drastically different from what AD had in mind. FU was created for the purpose of PvP battles and their goals were focused around killing others in PvP while sustaining minimal losses. FU measured their victories and their losses in PvP by the number of kills they obtained and they number of deaths they took, regardless of what items they gained or lost in the process.<br>
<br>
The differences may seem subtle but they make a large difference in the eyes of each guild. If you reverse the situations, I think you can understand it a bit better. If a FU team had managed to die 30 times over the course of a battle while only achieving 1 kill that got them a fungi tunic, they would have walked away from that battle absolutly devestated, whereas AD is overjoyed at getting a Fungi. At the same time, if AD had fought a battle where they scored 30 kills and had no PvE gain most of them would have been upset about the hours of their life they just wasted and not cared one bit. Chances are, they wouldn't have even fought in the first place.<br>
<br>
That covers the differences in measured victory in your everyday battles, which ultimately describes the overall opinions of the entire war. AD feels victory because they gained items during the war, while losing relatively little, and with FU gone they were free to do all the PvE they wanted afterwards. As I said earlier, the ultimate goal was to get their enemies off the server so they could have free reign on the PvE encounters they were after. FU's goal was never to force their enemies off of the server. That leaves no one left to fight.<br>
<br>
The one disagreement I have here, and it's a bit off topic, is with the AD belief that they were the reason FU &quot;fled&quot; the server. Incidentally, you were the reason we left the server. But it's not because we were continually defeated in PvP, you must be kidding yourself if you honestly believe we left because we were dying too much. FU left EQ because we were bored out of our minds. No one wanted to PvP, we spent our entire days running from zone to zone looking for someone willing to put up a fight. The only times we could get any decent battles going on was by threatening one of your events. At the very start of the war, we had a few really fun battles (mostly from Synergy, who put up a fight in just about any zone for awhile). Then they began to realize those battles couldn't be won, adventally the only battles we had were when we walked in to the middle of 50 of you and &quot;threatened&quot; your event (or vice versa). It got dull extremely fast.<br>
<br>
What's the point of all of this? I told you, there is no point to this entire post! AD believes they won because they measured victory with material gain, FU believes they won because they outmatched their enemies in PvP. Neither side is ever going to agree on which actually matters more, and frankly, it doesn't matter. AD got what they wanted, FU got what they wanted.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to claim victory on RZ, it's silly to even try because we were both after different things. I just don't feel like FU was defeated by another guild, no guild managed to deny us what we wanted (unless refusing to fight as an intentional tactic to bore us, although it probably was). We simply found out that what we wanted did not exist on Rallos.<br>
<br>
New topic: There are only three of us active on legends, we disliked DAOC and we certainly weren't going to go back to running around looking for fights on RZ. There was never any real plan to 'gear up and come back to destroy AD', but we certainly enjoyed the rumors and didn't do much to stop them, we encouraged them in IRC even. It was quite funny watching the reaction. The few of us that went to legends went there to pass time until a better solution presents itself (SB, WOW, etc). And no, even a RZ with no AD is not a solution. I know you like to believe that we aren't going to RZ because we're mortally afraid of what AD will do to us, but the simple truth is that we simply do not want to waste anymore time with EQ PvP.<br>
<br>
Feels like I said nothing this entire post, but I did say I wasn't going to be saying anything new or important when I started, right? So if you've wasted your time reading, don't say I didn't warn you. ;-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ukilyinrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KilyinRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 208<br> <font color=#333333>(7/3/02 4:57:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1071.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/kilyin/hartman.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: spelling errors</span><hr size=1> joz,<br>
<br>
Main reason Synergy and AD formed a temporary alliance was because Synergy had lost alot of their members to the formation of Rebirth. AD was just getting on it's feet as a guild. Compare this to (Rebirth) comprised of Facultas, Peacebreakers, BOK, Ordo Malleus and it was Rebirth that had the initial advantage when the  war broke out. The alliance made things alot more even.<br>
<br>
As far as disrupting events, considering Rebirth was all +cov and most of Synergy and AD were +kromzek, doesn't take alot of skill to destroy an event with small numbers when you have a whole zone full of 57-60+ level mobs on your side and can move about freely. I seem to remember Rebirth taking some heavy losses when we fought in Kael, in retrospect. This eventually changed as Synergy went +cov for that very reason, and the war ended soon after.<br>
<br>
No denying FU had some good PVP'ers and wore gear, but we all know Rebirth took their licks. Alot of Synergy had access to Rebirth's private board as well as PB's towards the end of the war, and witnessed the damage firsthand. FU may not have taken a huge number of casualties personally, but the numbers weren't even as close to being as onesided in your favor as you tried to portray. <p><b>Kilyin, <a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><br>

I love how you guys know everything.  From &quot;how we measure victory&quot; to what we were trying to accomplish any given day.  Does EQ PVP skill give you the mind reading ability?  WOW WHAT A GAME.<br>
<br>
My favorite is Ssok.  He can sit there and say &quot;we played on RZ only for the PVP!&quot; that's how we measured our victory's and we won!&quot;<br>
<br>
Yet all the while playing on his blue server everyday.  What happened to &quot;damn the odds, I'm FU!&quot;, tough guy?<br>
<br>
I think we all know what happened, and you can sit and spin all day, but the bottom line is Rebirth is dead, due to constant pressure from your enemies (which you love to claim you applied so much better).  30:1 kill ratio?  That's fine.  That's close to what I had during the Rebirth war.  I didn't run, I didn't hide, and neither did a lot of other AD.  Look at the kill shots.  /shrug<br>

Fearful Symmetry joined AD in September of last year.  Rebirth stopped ONE event that I can recall.

No one disputes the fact you had good EQ PVP'ers in FU.  No one can dispute you killed lots of people who weren't skilled in EQ PVP.  Yet your guild is forever tainted with cheaters, account gankers, and people who ran to Legends when their sect got the heat turned up on them.  <br>
<br>
I suppose one could say FU may have played the whole &quot;sect game&quot; better, but AD played it smarter.  And I'll take smarter over better anyday.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't understand how there is this idea floating around that it was just FU vs. AD, it wasn't I killed quite a few FU I remeber being KOS to them, I remeber starting the war with them myself(I forget why), Wasn't Syngery against FU too? <br>
<br>
On the flip side I saw plenty of FU corpses, zone pluggers, and gaters throughout the war.<br>
<br>
After playing this game as long as we all have I don't see how any of you can still think that skill is the largest factor in pvp.<br>
<br>
Its like 40% class, 40% Equipment, 20% skill..<br>
<br>
tell me im wrong? <br>
I could hit stynkfyst 2 times for every 1 time he hits me and I bet I would still lose, a) he has many more hp, more ac, twice the regen (prolly). <br>
likewise <br>
stynkfyst who is a good player but a monk, could still lose to a levitating caster class, or even one that isnt but runs up and down hills until stynkfyst's client loses him.<br>
I have killed 5 peacebreakers at the same time before, but thats because they were all melee, for an SK thats doable.  In the guild botb back when, it took forever for those 5 syngery people to kill me because they were all melee, if they were 5 casters I would have dropped in seconds.<br>
<br>
anywho..just bored sorry for posting :P<br>
<br>
so is FU going to shadowbane? anyone going to shadowbane or planetside? just curious.<br>

Let me break this down to you in a way you'll understand.  You suck at PvP.  You suck at PvE.  tB turned to shit after Zyrino and crew left it.  It's now left with maybe 5 original members and a bunch of gimps who never played the game to PvP untill they put the tB tag that Zyrino, Cyffon, Nalear, Xein, Nizno, myself, and several other 'tB members' back when it was in its prime.   Half of the ex-tBers left because they don't like the way tB was ran.  Dictatorships are shitty, especially if the person you're taking orders from doesn't step foot in battle or even play the game, or tries to hide behind the scenes.  In short, tB was pathetic and was never a factor in the war vs FU or Rebirth.  The only thing you were was numbers and the only thing you had was zerglings with no gear.  If we had to fight the tB 3 or even 2 years ago they might have played a factor but only because they were full of actual PvPers.<br>
<br>
Kilyin about the Alliance.  I specifically remember Ascending Dawn getting a boost start over Rebirth or FU/PB sect.  Might of been started two to four weeks before we anyone in Rebirth stepped up and started organizing shit.  I remember this because Relg went pussy and said he'd rather join Ascending Dawn because they're already up and running and everything he's heard so far about Rebirth was just a rumor.  I also specifically remember us devastating members of the earlier Ascending Dawn, which was an extremely weak roster.  This was when your best tank was Cyane, while Rebirth had Kaukaz, Gestahl, and several other backup tanks.  I do remember at one point Ascending Dawn was at such a low point in time that they couldn't do events on their own, because they only started with 50 members and they dropped to maybe 40.<br>
<br>
The events we disrupted..  We didn't really focus on that really often because it caused too much damn ruckus on the message boards.  Too much &quot;wahh, fu are cheaters, we want a no pvping at event truce&quot; shit and we most of the FU members, who were the core of Rebirth, wanted to keep shit low key.  However, whenever we wanted to disturb an event, we did.  Granted, yea, most of the time we had faction advantage, but atleast we'd stick our necks out and take those Kael 'beatings' which averaged out pretty much even casualties on both sides, and fight for the zone instead of just running and not PvPing.  Was one of the main things about Rebirth/FU, that's why they were considered more of a PvP guild.  They'd rather fight than do events.<br>
<br>
If you want to compare the success of both sects during that time frame, Ascending Dawn didn't do anything too special untill they teamed with Synergy.  Rebirth group was doing shit like Dozekar for the first time and spending most of our time gearing up the people in HoT for PvP purposes.  We would raid HoT with like 15 or 20 people just to grab a few pieces so we'd be capable of more things because we didn't start with everyone having good gear already.<br>
<br>
Ghouldan, yea FU has died, FU has gated, FU has zoneplugged before.  Personally i've never zoneplugged intentionally, EVER, and I'd never sink so low as to cheat like that in a game.  But yea, there were actually a few members of FU who did indeed zoneplug and we weren't proud of it, but certainly we zoneplugged far less than any Ascending Dawn did, and hell, they didn't even wear gear so they had shit to lose except pride.  FU pulled far less than they were pulled on I guess you could say.  Doesn't make it right, but that's the way EQ is.  Both sides had assholes, both sides had pussies, both sides had decent PvPers, both sides had spies.  Not really any way to prevent such a thing.<br>
<br>
The skill level of EQ back then was higher than it is today, I know this because I played for a week or two up on Legends to get adjusted to Luclin expansion and nowadays it's all about gear.  EQ PvP was never great, but during the beginning there was much more skill involved, and as time went on, the skill percentage just dropped and dropped and dropped.  I do believe that gear wasn't that big of a factor.  When I see someone like Rienne drop Reefman who has over 1000 hp's and better gear in every slot dies to a standard, run of the mill level 60 rogue with great PvP skills.  These are the instances where skill does matter.<br>
<br>
As for Shadowbane,   FU has no solid plans of any game, so I can't really answer that.  I'm sure some FU are going to buy it just because it's been built up and shit over the past few years, but personally I don't think I'll buy it unless I hear its amazing.  I heard so far the beta was shit and I guess they squandered away the past three years of development on God only knows what, so who knows.  I'm sure some FU plan on purchasing WC3 today so if you want to get a game or something, look us up on irc.stratics.com.<br>
<br>
And to my bestest friend Malio, you take this shit way too serious.  I can tell just by the tone of your posts that you're getting bugged by this shit.  Lighten up, this argument has been done before and both sides think they won, and there's nothing you can do about it but laugh at us and ban us from your board when we try to show some evidance that we did indeed cause some problems to Ascending Dawn during that period of time.<br>
<br>
Cheaters?  I can personally guarantee you, NO ONE, yes this includes Rienne, used any cheat programs such as Speed Hack, SEQ, or anything of that ilk.  Zone plug? Occassionally we had a gimp who'd do that (TRIK) or someone who just didn't feel like walking back at 3 am, but it was a rare occassion.<br>
<br>
Account Gankers?  Yea we have some jews in FU and I definitely disagree with that shit.  For the most part, we have good and respectable people.  Mike finally came around and realized what he did was wrong and returned the account in better condition than it came in.  Not trying to justify anything, just saying he was a tad impulsive on taking the account when it didn't belong to him and I agree with you there.  I've never sold my account and I don't plan on doing it unless I plan on NEVER playing EQ again.  Because I know how low people will go to change a decision they regretted and I never want to stoop that low.  So i'll agree with you there, but we're not &quot;full&quot; of jews.  I think if you looked through each member of FU personally you'll find out that most of them are young and stupid (such as Mike, Rift) and are still learning what's right and wrong, while others such as Nalear, Xein, and Koss have a set of morals and ethics that they'll never break, not even to benefit themselves.<br>
<br>
About running to Legends? you seemed to have left something out. Something very important.  FU left EQ for DAOC.  FU took a 8 month break from EQ as a whole, and only partially returned for Legends.  We were invited by DoZ to return to RZ and ally but it's something we turned down because it's something we've been through before and it takes too much time to get our characters up to par, so we decided to kick back and see how things went on Legends.  As of today, I believe six people in FU actively play EQ.  One on Sullon, the rest on Legends.<br>
<br>
That's pretty much all I got to say about the subject, I'm looking at this from now only our PoV, but i'm trying the best I can from past experiances to remember how hard it is to say we got devastated in PvP and almost collapsed (Sabbat) and believe me, it's hard to say that.  Especially when you're over a year away in the future, but you can't change the way things went down and you can't change the shit that happened.  Oh well i'll probably get mocked by Malio because he's too much of a punk to form a post without bringing someone down, but it's all good.  Malio and Grayrage would make an excellent duo. Peace. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ufaamarki.showPublicProfile?language=EN>faamarki</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 392<br> <font color=#333333>(7/3/02 9:36:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1071.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Few Things</span><hr size=1>  joz, im not sure who your char in game was but u r wrong.<br>

rienne did admit to using seq in 1 of his posts somewhere a long time after he was banned. i personally saw bhark and several others doing things that simply arent possible.(running super fast and so on).<br>
to say u guys didnt cheat is simply absurd.im not saying everybody did. but simply saying u &quot;guarantee&quot; nobody cheated is straight up retarded(which u dont seem to be) or a lie.<br>

<br>
I find it interesting you know so much about ADs intentions and ideas of victory/defeat.  Glad you replied though, gives me something to do at work!<br>
<br>
Your initial statement, that &quot;AD fought their wars in order to establish and protect their ability to perform the PvE aspects of EQ.&quot; is actually pretty accurate, but the conclusions you draw with it are flawed.  ADs purpose, its goal from day one, was always to be a successful PvE organization, similar to what sabbat had been, but better.  PvP was regarded as a necessary evil in order to, as you said, protect our ability to perform the PvE aspect.  We wouldn't seek it out, but we would defend ourselves when necessary - and very soon after your formation, FU threatened our existance and made it a necessity.<br>
<br>
FU, on the other hand, was primarily a PvP organization, that engaged in PvE at times as a change of pace and to obtain loots and whatnot.  Your goals were always to fight (and kill) people.  If they fought back, good; if they didn't want to fight, too bad for them.<br>
<br>
Okay, so what does all this matter, and why do we think we &quot;won&quot;?  Well, consider this (extremely long and unnecessary) analogy:  AD is a medium-sized medieval town, surrounded by a sturdy stone wall, fortified with a castle in the center of the town which houses a small troop of soldiers.  A peaceful town, isolated, and content to remain that way.  FU is a small but very fierce barbaric horde, cruel and hungry for blood.  A trail of pillaged and burned towns lie in their wake, villagers all slaughtered.  One day, the FU horde comes across AD town, and attacks.  Villagers spring to action, climbing the town walls, driving the invaders back.  AD town suffers heavy losses but, fighting for their lives and their homes, they continue fighting, not giving up.  After a long period of fighting, the FU horde grows weary, and the town walls still stand, so the fierce horde gives up and moves on, in search of easier prey.  AD town, battered but still standing, celebrates its survival, mourns its dead, and begins to rebuild.<br>
<br>
Long and overly dramatic, but I think it gets our point of view across: Your goal was to destroy us, ours was just to survive.  We did, so therefore we won.<br>

<br>
I just gotta tell it from point of view.  From when I joined AD,  Rebirth (nor FU) weren't owning much of anything.  But  everyone will have their little say.  I just like to look at the end of the day and see I'm still playing on the server I started my original EQ character.  I think Legends is a scam and a waste for people who couldn't make it on their previous servers, for good or bad reasons.  It really ruined what little integrity EQ's pvp servers had.  Now fools can run and hide to level in peace (sup guznuk) or go to get their names changed and lie their asses off (sup teralonis/adelll), and get 100 fucking hit point earrings that JEWELERS can make, and then bring them back to RZ...that's what gets me going, not the old AD/Rebirth thing.<br>
<br>
p.s. The Grayrage comment hurt.  You're KOS! ;p<br>
