To review, an explanatory quote from the piece:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Static Dungeons are on its way, and we will be using a system where we can control the amount of people allowed to enter one dungeon before its considered full. What happens when a set amount of players is inside a dungeon, is that a new copy of that dungeon is “spawned”. This in itself makes a dungeon more playable, but on the other hand you may not end up in the same dungeon as your friends. If any in your team is already inside, you will be able to enter the same dungeon no matter the limit.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
To make sure we have all the information to argue about this, this is an idea that came up a lot in EQ.  For those of you not versed in the issue, let’s assume you have a 5-room dungeon.  Each room has a special mob that can spawn there, and a few regular spawns.  What would happen is a group would set up “camp” on 1 or more rooms, and then just sit there “camping” the NPC’s for experience and for gear from the special mob … most of EQ’s dungeon-zones, in fact, are set up on this principle.<br>
<br>
The problem is that say you and your friends want to camp Philip Ross to get his +10 Executive Washroom Towel of Doom one night.  You get all grouped up, tromp over to the dungeon and unfortunately, another group’s already camping it.  Granted you could go kill-steal for it, but in general you just have to move along.  Given a limited number of good spots to level at in a static dungeon for your level, this quickly leads to a lot of issues with crowding being at the top.  I remember as a monk in EQ being able, after a while, to walk from the entrance to Lower Guk to the King’s room and never see a mob because every single camp-spot was taken.  Not only does this suck, but it causes player conflicts, gets customer-service involved in camping disputes, raises the issue of “farming” (basically, camping something for multiple copies of a piece of gear to sell, either in-game or on like eBay).  It’s a mess.<br>
<br>
What Funcom is proposing is a possible solution wherein a dungeon would have a maximum number of players in the zone, and if that max were reached the next people in would enter a clone of it.  Verant refused to do this for a variety of reasons, including that it just didn’t seem “realistic” (that always cracked me up), but foremost I would imagine are the coding difficulties involved and the possible exploits of the system it can create.<br>
<br>
So at lunch today I’m pondering this, and I decided to put on a game designer’s hat and think about how I’d solve the issue.  My solution may be naïve, perhaps, but it is workable I think and solves one or two of the problems I’ve encountered personally and/or I could foresee in this multiple/static environment being suggested.<br>
<br>
what I was thinking was why not just use the group mission terminals?  So let’s say there are 5 static dungeons in Pleasant Meadows.  To get in, you go to the group mission terminal in Pleasant Meadows and after the usual 6 random missions, there are 5 extra missions, one for each of those dungeons, with the same goal – kill the “boss mob” at the end of the dungeon.  When you go to the location, it spawns you the same dungeon it always does but your group’s the only one inside of it – if you want multiple teams, you simply dupe the key for whoever you want inside.  Then your group or your entire guild or whoever can enjoy a static zone all to yourself.<br>
<br>
How do you deal with the uber-loot issues?  In EQ, dragons and Gods would spawn roughly once a week.  What would happen is the uberest guild would get there and whack it.  It got so ridiculous that there were, and probably still are, schedules for which guild was “allowed” to do it that week, and everyone was supposed to take turns … i.e., take a number and wait in line.  Not only was it frustrating and laughable, it wasn’t fun.  The only way I can see implementing uber mobs / loot is by making their appearance timed, and random, so you don’t know if it’s loaded until you are in the actual dungeon, have fought all the way down, and see it.  Whether it spawns or not would be decided when the key is generated, so you could not just leave someone down there to wait for it to spawn.  Then if you need help, you get on the ‘com and get the guild to rally the troops.  It’s not a perfect solution, but it is workable.<br>
<br>
What is your solution?  Or do you dislike the whole cloned-static-dungeon concept altogether?  Discuss.<br>

It got to the point where the high level game consists of racing other guilds to a_uber_mob_01 to try and get your phat lewts.  I got sick of it and so far, bugs and all, AO has been a breath of fresh air as far as gameplay is concerned.  I think funcom's ideas for implementing the static dungeons are great.  On EQ terms, imagine going into Sebilis to kill Trak.  Now this is usually a guild force raid, and the lag created by an entire guild coming in to kill Trak sucks for all the people camping mobs at the various camps.  What this would do is allow a raid force to go into a dungeon and have the whole dungeon to themselves, and any other guild that wanted to raid could do so also.  This eliminates the stupid rotations and ganking that plague EQ... Everyone gets a shot.  If EQ was smart they would do the same thing but we all know Verant has been anything but smart about a lot of things.<br>

<br>
It's a good idea but all it does is change the nature of farming. To wit:<br>
<br>
Team missions give key to dungeon. Easy enough. Have, say, five teams. Each team pulls one of those missions each in the same place, pulling over and over until you get that exact spot. Dupe the other four. Slaughter your way through with 5x the number it's designed for. (If there are population limitations, players will quickly learn how many people are max and have that many.) Also to note is that teams have to hit the same occurrence of the mission; otherwise, why have keys.<br>
<br>
If you scale mobs for the 5x overkill expectation, people do 10 teams with half the numbers. Or 20 teams with 1/4 the numbers, so they'll have a ton of keys. Because a single team alone won't be able to do it without the overkill. And how do you know if they're overkilling or not?<br>
<br>
Yes, you won't have competing teams any more, which is good. You'll only have a flood of &quot;uniques&quot;, which can be bad, depending on the nature of the unique/rare. And if you don't make it rare or unique--and valuable besides--you run into the same problem as mission terms have now. &quot;Wtf, they want me to go to Perpetual for a red cloak hood?!&quot;<br>
<br>
It seems to me there is no way to balance the risk/reward of a static mission against camping against exploitation/farming. Not unless the mission itself is dynamic and adjusts <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  after everyone with a key is inside</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and even then you've got the issues of farming and adequate reward for risk... one of which feeds into the other.<br>
<br>
You'll pardon me if I don't believe the 'Com has the coding savvy to pull anything remotely like that off. :)<br>
<br>
Oh, and edit: I've nothing against static dungeons, in either concept or execution. My favorite solution to camping (I didn't make it up, and I don't remember who did) is simply gradually increase the respawn of mobs in that area/region/zone/what-have-you as more people get there. At some point, it will become so overwhelming that you'll have to flee or die. And yes, this opens up the possibility of &quot;grief spawning&quot;--jacking up the spawn rate and then running, leaving the uber spawn rate for the next group to hit that area--but no solution is perfect. Besides, if this jacked rate were common knowledge, you'd be wary entering a new area anyway. Which, to my mind, is as it should be. :) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=alianna>Alianna</A> at: 10/2/01 3:34:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ualloca.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alloca</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#660000>(10/2/01 3:56:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Erm...</span><hr size=1> Are we discussing the right way to do it?

This code is already in the game for shops.  When shops become too crowded, people go into a newly spawned shop.<br>
<br>
Except in a group, then you go into the shop with group mates (although I've seen this fail - that's how it's supposed to work)...<br>
<br>
This is more or less how the apartments are handled, and why you are supposed to be able to bring friends in by being grouped.<br>
<br>
The mission thing sounds cool - but I'd rather see that be the general implementation of the group missions regardless of anything being static.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (edit:  Ok, it's another long one...  You have been warned.)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
First off, I think everyone is getting a bit confused about the nature of these static dungeons.  Well, either everyone else is, or I am, whichever.  I don't think they're talking about MISSIONS that you get in areas that are always the same.  I think that what is being proposed is essentially in-door hunting grounds.  They would always exist, whether you had a mission key or not.  You'd be able to get in and hunt any time, just like in EQ.  Just another hunting zone only most probably with a z-axis.  That's the angle I'm coming from below.<br>
<br>
I would have loved to see some static dungeons in AO.  As a rule, missions are bland and boring.  Once you've done a few missions, you've pretty much seen the layout.  It doesn't change much, and it never gets more interesting.  The missions just get longer as you progress.  Since missions are generated dynamically, this is somewhat unavoidable.  They only have so many different kinds of pieces (rooms) and can only put them together so many ways.<br>
<br>
A static dungeon, however, would be designed once by the devs, and could be made so that it is actually INTERESTING.  You know, build in multiple levels, some twisting passageways, huge rooms with high, vaulted ceilings, underground rivers, whatever.  To me, it is a great deal more fun to explore a well crafted dungeon than to hack-n-slash my way through yet another mission that is built the exact same way at level 200 as it was at level 1.<br>
<br>
As far as uber-loot in these dungeons, I really don't think that uber-loot could be a problem in AO.  There's a few reasons, and I'm gonna do the numbered list thing here, and compare to EQ since a lot of people will know what I'm talking about, and because it seems to have been one of the worst camp-fests:<br>
<br>
1)  Armor (and weapons) scales so that no matter what you're wearing now, you can get a better version of that same armor 5 levels from now.  In EQ, Banded Armor is one of the first armor types a lot of people use (first metal armor my ranger wore, but I leveled to 9 in full cloth <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  But you stop using banded eventually and go to something stronger.  Well, in AO, when your first set of banded got old, you could get another set.  Or you could go with another type of armor altogether that provides equivalent protection.  Combine the variety and scalability of all equipment with the fact that you have to meet certain requirements to use anything you find in AO, and you have a formula that does not lend itself well to uber loot.  The only way it could be done is if items were of a fixed QL, and the stats were better for that QL than anything else available at that level.  Which leads nicely in to point number 2.<br>
<br>
2)  In EQ, you gained levels very slowly, particularly after 35.  This meant, that if you got a suit of armor, you'd probably be using it for quite a while.  You probably wouldn't need to or be able to get better armor for a few levels, unless you twinked (which is much harder in AO than in EQ).  In AO, you level VERY quickly (some more quickly than others...) so that the gear you have THIS WEEK might very well be obsolete, or very nearly obsolete by next weekend if you don't upgrade.  And anyone who has fought in armor a few QLs below their level knows that it is a BAD FUCKING IDEA.  I did it while I was trying to piece together my Kevlar suit, since I only had Kevlar slightly above what I could wear, and my then-current armor was starting to slip.  It hurt.<br>
<br>
So, let's (for the sake of argument) say that you are a level 25 MA (nice number <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  You're hunting with your group in the Brand Spanking New Tir Sewer Dungeon (and given the condition of the streets of Tir, I'm not sure I wanna know what the sewers look like, but bear with me here...).  You run into a named Nanotech mob down in the sewers wearing a full suit of some funky kind of Cyber Armor.  Doesn't look like regular Cyber, or Bau, or Waitt.  But it's definitely some derviative of Cyber.  He cons red to your group, and you give it a shot.  He dies, you loot the corpse, and you get a piece of his armor.  It turns out to be some QL 35 Mo'BadAssin Cyber.  This Mo'BadAssin Cyber is better than any other type of cyber of that QL.  Maybe it has better AC, maybe it provides an INT/PSY boost, maybe it gives you a direct boost to your nano pool, whatever.<br>
<br>
So what you have here is a piece of Cyber Armor that is (marginally) better than any other Cyber Armor available at that QL.  But unfortunately, the Mo'BadAssin Cyber is only available in QL 35.  Maybe at level 80 or so, there are mobs that drop QL 90 or so Mo'BadAssin Cyber, but for now, once the QL 35 ain't cuttin it, it's back to Waitt or whatever.  This means that when you hit around level 30 or so, that armor is no longer of any use to you (aside from twinking, I'm not going near that).  And you can't get any QL 45 Mo'BadAssin Cyber.<br>
<br>
Given that at level 25 it takes only a couple days to pick up 5 levels, are you REALLY gone spend a week camping the mobs that drop Mo'BadAssin Cyber trying to get a full suit?  I doubt it.  You've got no reason to, since by the time you have a full suit, odds are you'll have gained enough xp killing the mobs that drop it that you won't need it anymore, and it'll be time to move on to something new.<br>
<br>
That's a somewhat simplified example.  Odds are, if the mob is level 35, then a full group of 20's could take it and they'd have a longer window of usefulness for the Mo'BadAssin Cyber, but it illustrates the point.  This combined with the fact that farming the item would be pointless since everyone would be able to get into the Sewers and hunt the bugger that drops it (cuz as soon as one dungeon is full, another is spawned <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  I really like that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
So in case through this rambling post anyone has missed my point, lemme state it here:  I think the Static Dungeon idea is a very good one and the way they're talking about implementing it seems very solid.  Also, combined with already existing game mechanics, I see very easy ways to avoid the problems other games have had with static dungeons (camping/farming).  If anyone sees any gaping holes in my logic, or has a different viewpoint, I'd love to hear it. <p>~Jaqrabbit<br>

And using this as an example, let's say yeah, Mo'BadAssin is only available in these missions, so at 20 it's useful for 10-15 levels. Or whatever.<br>
<br>
But what happens when you hit 80?<br>
<br>
Or 120?<br>
<br>
Or 160?<br>
<br>
Having a full set of superior-stat armor, where you know where it comes from, and you know how it drops... I bet you a thousand bucks people will begin to bitch it doesn't drop frequently enough. Or that the mobs are too hard at that level. Or that the static mission is boring because they see it too much because they've been mission-term camping it for weeks, waitin for that second pair of sleeves to FINALLY DROP.<br>
<br>
Gee. Sounds like Everquest now, don't it? It ain't the game's fault, though--it's people. People are just broken.<br>
<br>
The key to defeating exploits--and making sure they don't happen in the first place--is to assume your players are the most whiny, petty, self-centered, bitter, greedy, selfish little rodents that ever walked the planet.<br>

And this mentality gives me a new insight into why EQ c/s is the way it is. :) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrimhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crimhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 312<br> <font color=#660000>(10/2/01 9:23:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Static Dungeon Discussion.</span><hr size=1> LOL, yep. I agree 100% Ali. Of course the game is broken too in this case, not just the ppl. I left EQ because of 2 main reasons: 1) Verant, and 2) Many of the greedy, socially inept, whiny, arrogant, and just plain rude players that corrupted that game. While I agree that more static dungeons should be implemented, it will one day be just like EQ: &quot;He who has the most time to gather shit is he who rules the roost.&quot; Unfortunately that is going to ring true with every single MMORPG that comes out in the future until someone figures out how to keep the powergamers from directly affecting casual players. THat's a tall order.<br>
<br>
WHo are the first ones that flood the market with higher end items, thus usually killing any player made items (which are generally weaker than game made items)? Powergamers. Who are the first ones to gain high enough levels to explore and camp desirable areas, thus freezing out others until they are ready to move on? Powergamers. In a PvP situation, who are generally the badasses that can literally decide whether or not you have fun? Powergamers. Who normally makes &quot;Uber&quot; type clans/guilds that seem to sway dev teams and CS offcials to their way of thinking.....yep, you guessed, Powergamers. <br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying powergaming is really a bad thing in itself, but powergamers impact the entire game from enconomy to politics directly and indirectly. The casual gamer (4-10 hours a week) is always in catch up mode and even if he is not trying to &quot;keep up with the Jonses&quot; and just doing his own thing encounters the ripple effect of the people who can dedicate 20+ hours a week to a game. I know many ppl in EQ who had limited play time went one of two ways: 1) Got frustrated and quit, or 2) Spent more time than they should have in the game which impacted negatively in RL. I guess there were the super cool #3 ppl who actually lagged behind, did not mind, and continued to have fun, but I would say they were the exception to the rule.<br>
<br>
Again I say, until some gaming company can figure out how to intergrate powergamers and casual players into a single game without the disruption of fun for either you will always have the problems mentioned above. And what gaming company is gonna try and solve that bitch of a problem when they get your money every month anyway? Don't hold your breath kids, this problem ain't getting solved no time soon.<br>

The only way possible to do away with the phenomenon you speak of is to limit people's play time within the game, which is absurd. The people who put in the most time SHOULD be rewarded. <br>
<br>
The people who ruin a game aren't the powergamers at all, but the exploiters. All exploiters are powergamers, but not all powergamers exploiters. Therefore powergamers often get a bad rap, which is really no big deal to your average non-exploiting powergamer. On the contrary, I think many powergamers are delighted when people assume they must have exploited, although on the surface a powergamers reaction is, of course to be offended.  <br>
<br>
In a nutshell the best way to balance the two is to get rid of imbalances in PvP in the first place. In AO for example... it's ridiculous for a level 70 to be able to weild a level 160 weapon. I mean come on! All this does is create powergaming inflation. Everyone HAS to spend obnoxous amounts of time to be competitive. If they would just limit the amount of efficacy of any given weapon based on actual stats, both powergamer and casual player could (more easily) coexist. <br>
<br>
I think rather than static dungeons in AO, I'd rather see random missions that are the equivalent to static dungeons. These could appear in place of any regular mission at any time, and would remain in place as long as the mission key was valid. Boom, none of the problems with camping or griping would exist, and it would encourage people to get missions. They could even put in a variable that disallows one of these random dungeons to appear unless the keyholder has successfully completed 3 or more standard missions in a row.  Then again, we're talking about funcom so I'll be shocked if they ever even get static missions in game and working.<br>

This is one of the few things I agree with the EQ team on when they argue against what you say. You aren't a casual gamer being trampled on, you are a frustrated power gamer without the time to be the best.<br>
<br>
If they didn't want to be top dog, then leveling wouldn't matter to them...<br>
<br>
The reason people felt compelled to level in EQ was largely based on wanting to do high end encounters and see new stuff. In AO, thats not currently relevent as every thing looks the bloody same, and there are no high end mobs that require multiple groups to fight. The latter is pretty fortunate considering how the server lags and then dumps everyone with more than 4 players fighting in the area.<br>
<br>
As in life, those who put the most in, get the most out. Of course those who put the most into these games are directly taking out of real life - its a zero sum rule. So when theses guys get on your nerves just realise that they probably haven't got out of their chair for 2 weeks, and by the time they remember to eat/bathe/etc. you will probably have had kids, had 5 jobs and be earning 20 times what they do selling items on ebay (Mad props to the hobbit king and his AO 'career' farming for ebay (sarcasm intended)). <p>Cassius Runeblaze &lt;Avatars of Discord&gt;<BR>

Or whatever.<br>
But what happens when you hit 80?<br>
Or 120?<br>
<br>
Well, in the case I proposed, it wouldn't be a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  mission</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> per se.  No need of a mission key, just walk into the zone...  Kinda like any other area in the game you can hunt in.  And it would only be available periodically throughout the levels.  Like have QL 35, then say QL 90, then QL 200 versions of the superior Cyber (or MA for that matter).  Just a minor thing...<br>
<br>
Personally, I am not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> REPEAT NOT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in favor of &quot;uber loot&quot; armor in the game.  I feel like my toon was fairly personalized in full kevlar, as I saw a VERY small handful of other players wearing it, and nobody that matched me exactly (different helms, different breeds, whatever), so one of the primary needs for &quot;unique&quot; (gee, you mean like the epic weapons in EQ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) is pretty much eliminated right there.<br>
<br>
And after 12.5, armor was all pretty well balanced out.  I don't see any reason to start making a bunch of armor that's even better than the rest, and put the imbalance back in the game...   That would be a step in the WRONG direction.  And considering that level 80 players can already equip 200 QL weapons, is a weapon QL 95 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> gonna be an uber weapon, anyway?  There's no reason to even bother putting this in game....<br>
<br>
The situation I proposed above was my possible solution.  After reading Alianna's response, I see that I made the same mistake as Karl Marx and John Lenin.  I failed to take into account human nature.  By which I mean, if there is any way to get an advantage or bone the system, somebody WILL come up with it, and whether they need to or not, someone WILL do it...  If you put rare or unique loot in the game, a lot of people are going to do their level best to make sure it isn't rare anymore.  About the only way to make it work is if it really IS rare...  So only 5 full suits of Mo'BadAssin Cyber EVER DROP!  After that, the mob drops Waitt.  Mo'BadAssin <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  stays</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> rare and unique that way, and people don't have to spend huge amounts of time trying to acquire it.  (NOTE:  Even with the first scenario I proposed, I doubt I'd bother collecting it...  I'd much rather pick up a couple levels than waste hours trying to get just the right piece of loot.  But maybe I'm in the minority.)<br>
<br>
I think we can safely remove players bitching about the drop rate from the equation, since players are gonna bitch no matter what.  You make it drop all the time, people are gonna bitch that it's too common.  You make it drop rarely, other people are gonna bitch that it takes too long to get it.  You make it drop for a few days only, and people are gonna bitch cuz you nerfed a great item.  You could make it RAIN FROM THE FUCKING SKY and I'm sure someone would bitch about it...

<br>
And that's why I asked. If you cannot even comprehend it being any other way, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you cannot even tell me why</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then yes, there is an argument here.<br>
<br>
Everyone in the game pays the same exact fee to play.

<br>
Yet the assumption, from you, is that they should.<br>
<br>
So. Again.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Note: I have thought a great deal about the mechanics of these games and their structure, and I have very good reasons--both economic and social--to have come to the conclusions I did. I am very interested in your reasoning as to why players that play more should somehow enjoy more benefits from the same game, paying the same fee, as anyone else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=alianna>Alianna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Martial, Baby, MARTIAL.</span><br>  Posts: 448<br> <font color=#660000>(10/3/01 11:03:41 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Static Dungeon Discussion.</span><hr size=1> &quot;About the only way to make it work is if it really IS rare...

Right. So what you'd have then, once word about this facet got around, is Patch Day Power Campers. These folks would log out with characters at every single static mission spot--possibly with two or more accounts--and the INSTANT the server came up, they'd gank every single piece of anything the moment it appeared. They'd operate in teams, groups, guilds, whatever, to make sure they--and only they--got the phat lewt. (And if you make it not worthwhile to have, why even have it in the game? Two-edged sword.)<br>
<br>
Then they'd start duping it and selling it. Or hit eBay. Or whatever.<br>

Actually most of the time I spent in EQ were trying to keep up with friends and such so I could group/hang out with them. Heh, in a 2 year span I must have went through 3 sets of &quot;friends&quot; who outleveled me. Sure I still talked to them sometimes, but as ppl became 50+ they began to get more and more distant and eventually I lost contact with them. THe old saying &quot;out of sight out mind&quot; is a perfect example. Finally I just gave up trying to hang with the ones I had started with and made new friends, and so forth and so on, until I got sick of the whole mess. I wasn't aiming to be the best, I was aiming to survive and function in the brave new world of 50+. I finally saw the light and left that world, as I will be doing with this one next week when my account runs out. <br>
<br>
I've been playing Deus Ex and it rocks.....best thing about it? No lag, no nerfs, and no whining/bitching. I'm looking more and more into just staying with single player games because these last two MMORPG have left a sour taste in my mouth.<br>
