Legitimate concerns are now misdirection?  Please tell me how I have tried to misdirect people in any way- all the concerns I have voiced have been echoed by tonnes journalists, political thinkers like Chomsky/Smithson, leading politicians from all countries, international leaders, religious leaders including the Pope, elder statesmen like Nelson Mandela.<br>
<br>
If I am misdirecting arguments Kad, I suppose all these respected figures are too in your eyes.  Their opinions are all a global propaganda conspiracy designed to bring down the US are they?  Please.  Voicing legitimate concerns and criticizing deeply flawed and short-sighted policies that create long-term problems is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> misdirection sir.  It is the duty of anyone who believes democracy isn't just about turning up to vote to get involved and stay engaged.  Speaking up now encourages us not to let our leaders make the same mistake twice.  An election result isn't a blank cheque- Nixon found that out the hard way, as did Thatcher in this country.  If politicans can act as they choose, democracy suffers- if people allow their liberties to be eroded at will, that will continue.  If people allow themselves to be bludgeoned with fear and cajoled with false humanitarian promises to go to war, the world is a far less safe place.  Here's a great article on how democracy is becoming a casualty in the US(and the UK) because of this war:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You discredit, misdirect, and insult the policies and elected representatives of the United States to such an extent that you will not believe a word that is spoken from them<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Rumsfeld, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Armitage and Rice are not elected officials btw- I know that much about American politics.  And I have the utmost respect for Colin Powell it has to be said- who has tried to internationalize a solution, but has largely been shouted down by the miscalculating hawks in the administration.  It is they who I think are hurting America and global security through their indiscriminately short-sighted policy.  <br>
<br>
As to not believing a word a politician says- lol?  That's the sensible approach surely.  Forgive my common sense on this- but I was always taught that proof was always more effective than rhetoric alone.  Especially if politicians who have wanted regime change since 1997(read the PNAC) are concerned.  That the truth was a more powerful argument than lies.  I haven't seen a shred of proof from this administration that justifies war- moreover I've seen greater economy of the truth in foreign policy than any time since...Reagan was president and Rumsfeld + Cheney were around!  Coincidence Kad? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you don't have enough trust to believe the statements of the President or his cabinet or representatives of the government because of historical reasons, then I believe you to be an untrusting extremist bent on undermining the existing hegemony of the United States of America or for whatever political reason you believe in.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Bullshit, it's not for historical reasons, it's a simple matter of trust- not for &quot;whatever political reason you believe in&quot;.  I have little love for the Bush administration hawks, but if they bloody well did the right thing I'd be the first to praise them.  But they haven't, and I won't.  As for the &quot;historical reason&quot; crap-  I'm not talking about past administrations with no links to the present one- we're talking about the same people who made terrible miscalculations of policy in the past being allowed to do so again.  Can't you see how that's a harmful thing Kad- or do I have to spell it out for you again?  Rumsfeld sold weapons + WMD that killed Iraqi civilians to Saddam- and tells us he cares about these same civilians and about disarming the weapons he supplied(though he has never shouldered blame for this).  Cheney, Wolfowitz and Armitage were all closely involved with pro-Saddam policy that killed Iraqi civilians and we're now supposed to be convinced they care about them now all of a sudden.  You might be willing to believe such dangerous hawks had a sudden change of heart, but I don't.<br>
<br>
This isn't hegemony of the past, it's a dangerous miscalculation of trust about to repeat itself, and killing thousands of innocents in the process.  They've miscalculated yet again, on so many fronts.  Not least of all putting the US economy in dire straits- the health of that economy affects most of the developed world and they're putting that and international law in jeopardy:<br>

<br>
And for what?  Suspicion, unproven terrorist links, the unproven threat of WMD in an environment of containment + deterrence.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>That</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is misdirection Kad, so was linking 9/11 to Saddam's regime, and so was a lot of the codswallop we've heard from Rumsfeld's war propaganda regime.  Here are just a few examples:<br>
<br>

<br>
I'm not suprised that Saddam is using propaganda to further his own ends- misleading is a way he holds on to power.  But surely we should be better than that right?  Wrong!  We're being misled as well- and have been, even before the start of this war.  The administration has been very reluctant for example, to discuss WMD, which after all is why we supposedly went in.  Now all the talk is of removing Saddam and toppling the regime.  Only now do we truly see what surely was their goal all along.  This isn't some political conspiracy theory btw- the declared intent of Rumsfeld, Cheney and Wolfowitz has always been regime change in Iraq.  Wolfowitz has written many papers on the subject- and I advise all who haven't already to check out Project for New American Century(PNAC)- it makes for some chilling reading.  After an excuse reared its ugly head- they've grabbed it with both hands and steered America to war.  <br>
<br>
If I can spot that from the other side of the Atlantic, why can't you Kad?  The fear around the world is- if such a slim excuse can be turned into support for a war, where will the Bush administration strike next?<br>
<br>

I'm not going to lose any sleep over offending Donald Rumsfeld- he's certainly offended enough people overseas, it's about time he got a taste of his own rudeness.  Although that's not who I'm attacking at all.  Anyone with above average reading comprehension should be able to see I'm attacking decisions and policies not people.  If citizens are offended by me speaking out for their liberty and their interests, I'll happily take that on the chin with a pinch of salt.  <br>

If you think that by attacking me personally you'll get me to respond in kind I'll have to disappoint you.<br>
<br>
Further, if you think personalizing this debate will help you win it, you are also mistaken.  Attacking my motives rather than my arguments won't help your reasoning, nor will it make this war or the lies of your government's officials any more justified.  So a little less personal attack, a little more legitimate argument please- just a request.<br>

<br>
Before the war, Iraqis depended on government rations distributed under the U.N.'s oil-for-food program. The 7-year-old program allows Iraq to sell oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. The proceeds from oil sales are deposited in a U.N.-controlled escrow account. <br>
<br>
The war has thrown the future of that program in doubt. <br>
<br>
Because the United States and Britain failed to get U.N. backing for the war, Russia, France, Germany and China want to ensure the immediate humanitarian costs of the war are paid by the United States — and not the United Nations (news - web sites). <br>
<br>
Annan wants to revive the U.N. aid program. A resolution giving him authority to run the program for 45 days is stalled because Russia, Syria and others are insisting the United Nations must not sanction the war or give the United States control over the U.N.-controlled account, which holds billions of dollars. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>somthor</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - i would not deny that most countries will be jockeying around for lucrative contracts after the war ends, specifically, i am sure that france along with uk/us will be seeking profits out of rebuilding iraq. In terms of hypocrisy you said that those not involved are hypocritical in decrying the war but yet seeking to make cash out of it. I see more hypocrisy in blowing up the infrastructure and then making profit in rebuilding it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>kron / kadandrum</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Broader point here on employing iraqis to help rebuild. As in alot of 'development' deals with the developing world in general, cheap labour from the country in need will be used, but the main profits will belong to the developed world.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>welfare of, and humanitarian assistance to the iraqis</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->iraqis are hungry and thirsty as we speak. in basra the UN has major concerns about a humanitarian catastrophe. Let me break it down into 3 steps<br>
1. &quot;something bad&quot; happens<br>
2.  people go hungry thirsty with risk of disease<br>
3.  they need helped.<br>
Of step 2, there is no doubt, these people are in a bad way.  Of step 3, it is good that coalition forces are bringing some humanitarian aid (although of course for some reason coalition countries or others that US is trying to influence in the region get more aid than does iraq itself).<br>
There seems to be a blind spot though over step 1. Why are they hungry and thirsty? They are hungry and thirsty because they are being beseiged by the US/UK and their water supplies and electricity supplies have been blown up by the US. Talk about hypocrisy - i blow up your power supplies, your food goes off and you expect me to thank you when you bring me some food? Hey! i just beat you up, but here's a bandage, be grateful to me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>kadandrum on misdirection etc</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
firstly, no, i don't believe entirely your elected representatives. let me give a couple of specific examples of reasons why.  They are 'historical' in that they are not in the process of occuring, but have happened over the course of the last 6 months.<br>
1. terrorist grenade attack in qatar. Reported as terrorist attack.  Then it turns out to be 'fragging' type incident by disgruntled US soldier.<br>
2. saddam dead  / injured at start of campaign. On and off we get these stories peddled out by various official sources. then we see him on tv. the govt says, ah, but that is probably just prerecorded stuff. then journalists point out him making contemporary references.<br>
3.uprising in iraq will happen. official sources again claiming that people are anti saddam and will rise against him. specifically big talk of uprising in basra. this has fizzled out and seems to be more exaggeration and propaganda.<br>
4. market place bomb in northern baghad. we are being told that it couldn't have been a us or uk bomb, it was probably saddam himself who did it. how much do they really expect us to swallow? After killing their own troops, british journalists, syrian civilians on a bus, do they really expect us to believe that their cruise missiles don't go astray and blow up civilians in a market place?<br>
5. reasons given for war. this changes so many times i am not sure what the current reason is. kill the evil dictator, no, how about, remove the WMD, no, how about liberating the innocent and protecting democracy, no, how about severing links with terrorists. i genuinely don't know what the official reason for this war is, i have heard so many reasons put forward and denied over the last 6 months.<br>
6. the break out from basra. first of all 70-120 tanks and armoured vehicles broke out and were headed south. now, it is 10 tanks and a few cars.<br>
Secondly, on 'offending' you/your country because i don't believe the statements of your leaders. Let me be frank, i am more concerned with iraqis dieing than i am with american hurt feelings.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Liberation</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Hurray for liberation.  I am sure those iraqis who were liberated yesterday in that market place in northern baghdad will be overjoyed that it was an american freedombomb that killed them, and not some peacehating iraqi soldier who killed them.

Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks said there was an Iraqi missile battery near the neighborhood and that Iraqi has been using old missile stock fired with guidance systems turned off. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We think it is entirely possible that this may have been an Iraqi missile that went up and came down,&quot; Brooks said. <br>
<br>
<br>
He the United States had an air mission in the area but not in the neighborhood that was devasted by the explosion. <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;We did have an air mission that attack some targets, not in that area but in an another area, and they did encounter some surface-to-air missile fire,&quot; Brooks told the daily briefing at the coalition headquarters. <br>

After all, he's about the only person in this thread with enough patience to painstakingly present the facts, neatly laden and accompanied with sources, and hammer them over and over on the average Rush Limbaugh- saturated American until they see where he's coming from. It's hardly a secret that when necessary, the US media plays the American public like a violin, with the government providing the notes. If you want to find misdirection, see the amount of misconceptions abundant even on this board, where the audience seems to be above averagely informed. Here's one enlightening example of misdirection: US media declares that a suspected WMD factory has been found. The wording is such that the reader almost certainly believes it has been confirmed already. It turns out the place has nothing to do with WMD production. Is the correction published with as big headlines? Hell no, even if it's published at all, it's 2 ambiguous lines, and that only in some of the most respected publications. Result: public believing that 'See, we found WMD already! What evil, evil people they are in there!!1' <br>
<br>
The examples like the above are numerous, and usually follow the same pattern. 'Allegedly' this or that happened, or 'sources' tell this and that happened. Later it will turn out that the claims were patently false, but that doesn't get much attention since it's buried deep on page 23 in a small article no one reads anyway. As a little field exercise if you're interested in another perspective of the media, read or listen the news and observe this: How many of the articles are written or worded in a way that aims to infuriate the US public? It would seem to me that the aim on press is now on Iraqi atrocities, and I don't think I'm too wrong if I guess it's to entice rage in US public to better stomach own casualities (and of course to win the world opinion, but they're smart enough to realize that barring Iraq using WMD, it's lost already).<br>
<br>
As a little detour, one of the more hilarious details I've noticed is the emphasis many publications put on the gas masks found on Iraqis. If they have gas masks they must be preparing to use gas oh my god! I mean, even in our army which takes the ABC-threat so seriously that the main means of protection is basically a camouflage raincloak (called affectionately the magic cloak), everyone carries a state-of-the-art gas mask. If Iraqis didn't have gas masks you could knock them out with tear gas. I suppose if one was to conduct search among US troops, one would find a lot of condemning material, ie. ABC-protection suits etc.  I'm sure the US also has some kind of incapacitating agent similar to that used in that theatre hostage episode in Russia. It would be pretty stupid for the Iraqis not to have gas masks. If they really do use gas, then by all means cry foul, but trying to convince public with this kind of 'proof' classifies straight in the propaganda section of the magazine.<br>
<br>
Sadly, Taranna's efforts seem to have been blocked on some fronts by the 'stfu'- or 'I don't want to listen'- attitude, or by attempts to silence the conversation altogether. That reminds me of a kid caught stealing apples from the neighbour, and when scolded, he clamps his hands over his ears and shouts 'la-la-la-la'. Seems the need for reassurance and security, the need for being right by default, triggers powerful self-defence mechanisms. I don't have near the patience or skill with words Taranna has, and I might (well, I probably do) come out as offensive. However, take it from me, if you want somewhat moderate European view, his is a good example and you would do well not to dismiss it casually, unless the picture he paints is really how you want the US to look like in the 21st century.<br>

If someone from the country who is your closest ally thinks like this, I would not be so quick to knock down what he has to say.  You can all read taranas links to the military, to UK soldiers actually fighting in the gulf. Even with that difficult emotional attachment and loyalty, he is still able to cut through the propaganda and analyse what is actually going on.<br>
<br>
And as for this nonsense put forth by our respective governments. Are people really taking it seriously? The explosion in the baghdad market place. Somthor, do you really believe this garbage that is being peddled forth as truth? <br>
I take a quote from the BBC<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> A US military spokesman at coalition Central Command said: &quot;Our early intelligence report provides no conclusive evidence that we have caused the damage in the civilian marketplace. <br>
<br>
&quot;One possibility and high probability is that it was caused from the fallout from the regime's anti-aircraft fire.&quot; <br>
<br>
But the BBC's Andrew Gilligan in Baghdad says that explanation is &quot;unlikely because we simply haven't heard any anti-aircraft fire in the city for the past four days&quot;.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
It probably wasn't us, so it must be them that did it. We don't miss and hit civilians. <br>
Except for that ITN/British journalist we killed, Terry Lloyd.<br>
And those syrian civilians sitting beside their bus. <br>
Oh and that time we blew up our own plane with a patriot missile when it was returning to its base. <br>
And those 18 British soldiers who died in either friendly fire, or accidents (my last figures, 20 dead british soldiers, 2 dead due to the iraqis, the others by their own side). <br>
Oh yeah, and that firefight we had the other day between two sets of american soldiers with 30 wounded. <br>
Yeah, apart from those incidents, our liberationbombs are spot on accurate. <br>
Except when we blew up that al jazeera station in Afghanistan.<br>
And the chinese embassy in yugoslavia.<br>
And the air raid shelter in the first gulf war when we killed 400 people. <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1119969.stm#">news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world...19969.stm#</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> for that one, or quoted here as:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>On February 13, the allies bomb an air raid shelter in a residential area of Baghdad. At least 314 Iraqi civilians are killed. The allies say it was listed as a military installation. Iraqi officials take the BBC's Jeremy Bowen to see the aftermath.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
So apart from those times we hit the wrong target, we are 100% accurate, and definitetly don't kill innocent civilians.<br>

<br>
<br>
1.) Iraqi soldiers are using *women and children* as human shields, this has been noted over southern and northern Iraq.<br>
2.) Iraqi soldiers are *acting* like they are surrendering and then killing *our* soldiers.<br>
3.) They executed five of our soldiers as they were trying to surrender.<br>
4.) If your an Iraqi citizen, and you have a family and you say something so much as *I think Saddam should have done this instead of this*, Iraqi soldiers will come to your house, rape the females in your home, and video tape it and send a copy to the commanding officer, family relatives, and the victims.<br>
5.) Saddams own son was put in charge of shredding human civilians who spoke out against him.<br>
6.) I would like to see some of you liberals go to Iraq and say even one word about Saddam and get either murdered or have your family tortured.<br>
7.) Russia has been selling Saddam Anti-Tank missles for the war<br>
8.) French have been selling jet fighter parts for the war.<br>
<br>
<br>
I can prove all of the above if any of you wish it be so, I have multiple sources for each of my statements above.  If you hate Bush that bad, there are several other countries you can live in and be as happy as you can be.<br>

One more thing, assume there was a revolt in Florida against the U.S. and Bush gassed Americans to put down the revolt.  He then proceeded to declare himself dictator of America and would kill anyone that dissented against him.  I would hope France would invade America and kick his ass even if I got bombed on accident in the process.<br>

This gentlemen started out as a human shield / anti war protestor, and look what he says after he *went* to Iraq and witnessed the terrorists first hand.<br>

You sir need to actually read and get this comprehend what people are saying before you respond. You have repeatedly demonstrated your inability to understand what people are writing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What exactly do you think I don't comprehend or understand?  The anti war stance?  What disability do you think I have?<br>
<br>
I question points that people seem to take for fact.  I question broad liberal bias.  I question the bashing of America, the blind support of Iraq, Saddam, the UN, and the bashing of our President and those who think the world will be a better place without Saddam.<br>
<br>
So again I ask WTF do you think I don't seem to comprehend.  You want me to be a Taranna groopie?<br>
<br>
Hi, I'm a Taranna wannabe and I totally support whatever me mentor Taranna says.  Here are the yummy yummy Taranna doctrine points.<br>
<br>
1)  The US diplomatic policy in the Middle East is biased towards the Israelis and not fair towards the Palestinians.  The 1/2 billion to the Palestinians is not enough, they need to give the Palestinians the same treatment as they do the Israelis.  This means aid, arms, political influence, whatever.  America should force the Isralis to the 1967 pre-border.  <br>
<br>
2)  The US should stop propping up regimes in the Middle East.  Stop giving them money and arms.  But most important, settle issue #1 of the Palestinian/Israeli issue so there will be less terrorism.<br>
<br>
3)  Terrorism in the Middle East is a direct result of US foreign <br>
policy.  The bad regimes in the Middle East is a direct result of US foreign policy.  The US past history of arming and training the Afghanistan rebels against the USSR was bad.  The US supporting Saddam in the Iraq/Iran war was wrong.  YOu know that al-Qaeda and Bin' la din guy?  They are the flowers of the seeds that the US planted. <br>
<br>
4)  Pre-Gulf War 2:<br>
Deterrence is working.  There is no need to invade Iraq.  <br>
Sanctions was working, the UN inspectors got rid of 90-95% of the WMD in Iraq when they were there.  War never gets rid of additional weapons.  Iraq doesn't have nuke capabilities and any chemical weapons roaming Iraq are unproven.  The UN inspectors are doing a great job of demanding that Saddam comply with inspections and Saddam is cooperating fully.  Containment and deterrance works, and the UN has a almost flawless track record in disarming nation states.<br>
<br>
5)  War is wrong without UN backing and world support.  Without a full UN mandate, the US unilaterally invading Iraq will damage the already poor US image in the middle east and will only cause more terrorists to resent and rise up against America/UK.<br>
<br>
6)  France has no agreements for oil with Iraq.  But the US in it's invasion of Iraq sure will.<br>
<br>
7)  Bush is a bad cowboy President.  He has unwisely, stupidly, pulled out of treaty upon treaty that Clinton had painstakenly made.  This would be the Land mine treaty, kyoto treaty, International criminal court treaty, abm treaty.  Plus did you even read that uber PNAC document.  The PNAC without a doubt proves that the Bush cabinet members wrote, supported and are now implementing it's doctrine.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Provide me proof that Saddam is guilty.  Provide me proof of the WMD that Saddam supposedly has.  Saddam is entitled to a right of due process to prove his guilt.  The burden of proof lies on the US to show the international community without a doubt that he is guilty.  Until then, there is no argument that will validate a war.<br>
<br>
9)  The gassing of the Kurds was with the Support of the US.  The US provided Iraq with the means and incentive to gas the Kurds and Iran.  The US was the biggest supporter of Iraq and now they aren't.  What hyprocrits.<br>
<br>
10)  People who oppose this view are idiots, muppets, and that lurker dude has not a clue.  Especially since he won't tell me his real in game name.<br>
<br>
11)  The French socialist system is far superior to that of the US.  We will guarantee free health care and great benefits.<br>
<br>
12)  Regime change doesn't work.  Never has, never will.  The Iraqi people will not say thank you to their liberators if they are starving, dying, being bombed, and being forced to accept a puppet US regime.  Only the UN can save these people.  A war should only be issued through the UN, no matter what the circumstances.<br>
<br>
Was there anything else that I missed?  I know there is, but I think those were the broad general points.  So again I ask WTF about the opposing argument do you think I don't understand or comprehend with my pre-school education?  Every single one of the above points are not facts or statements without opposing views or differing prespectives.  If you think they are undeniable truths, then let me be blunt and say your WRONG.<br>
<br>
God Bless America, our troops, and our Allies.  May Saddam and his sons rot in hell. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lurker555@ascension10244>lurker555</A> at: 3/27/03 11:01:18 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a> <b>7</b> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showMessageRange?topicID=1939.topic&start=181&stop=191>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showPrevMessage?topicID=1939.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showNextMessage?topicID=1939.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=140><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/addReply1.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.threadControl?topicID=1939.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1939.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1939.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm25">Gimp's Gallery<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm27">Friends and Family<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Knights<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3>Public Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com">Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
