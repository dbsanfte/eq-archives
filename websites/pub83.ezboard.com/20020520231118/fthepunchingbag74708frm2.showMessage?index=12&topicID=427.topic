Thats the clan advantage, and its more then they need.  When the patch comes out and clanners will be able to capture bases...just think when you can't raise your twink in Lush cause the clanners have captured the outpost in Lush.<br>

No more complaints about clan advantage...<br>

I've seen MANY high level omni's in Newland - among them our very own Nutbar, who's well over 100 - but not many high level Clanner's.<br>
<br>
Sure those clanner's I see of high level's is close to the Big Ding, but there is a long way from 90'ish to a 100.<br>
<br>
The real strenght I see of Clanner's is number's.<br>
Go to any of the &quot;usual battle zone's&quot; and the clanner's rule in number's.<br>
<br>
Just my two cent . .<br>

<br>
We have the Borg camp in Avalon, The Tooth in Aegean (what a laugh), the Temple area in GTC (I laugh harder), but in Athen Shire..... er.... nothing, how about Tir county.....er nothing, and then there is..... uh.... er.... crap, there are no places to hunt.  We have to got to 20K, Lush Fields, Varmint Woods, that's Neutral, with Omni and Clan outposts, oh yeah, Mort........er......25% zone.<br>
<br>
The Omni advantages are:<br>
<br>
1) Lots of money for selling loot<br>
<br>
2) OT only armor &amp; weapons, there are no clan only anything<br>
<br>
3) Tons of hunting areas for all levles.  That's why you seee Clan hunting around your areas, cuz Clan don't have anywhere to hunt.  I've played both Clan and OT, the clan hunt spawns were destroyed with patch 12.7 I think.<br>
<br>
4) Typical Omni day....Omni, getting bored,&quot;Wanna camp the grid or a whompah?&quot;   &quot;Which one?&quot;  &quot;2HO?&quot; &quot;Okay, we can kill some clanners as they grid in for a mission.&quot;<br>
  <br>
5) SomeOmni hunt/spawn areas have little caves you can duck into if the going gets too tough, like the shades area.  For those of you who don't know, these caves are not mission areeas, the are a cave anyone, at any time, can just waltz into.  Really cheap.  <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I don't say to nerf Omni advantages, I just want the clan hunt spots/spawns returned.  I just am hoping, before the year 2003, that the Clan will get more then 2Hand Blunt and No Atrox advantage.  I don't bother with PvP, it stinks of cheap Omni grid camping at the moment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uellmaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ellmaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#660000>(2/21/02 1:14:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Faster leveling?</span><hr size=1> Watch as I refute your arguments!<br>

Uhhh...sorry maybe 1% more....<br>
<br>
&gt;2) OT only armor &amp; weapons, there are no clan only anything<br>

Omnipol armor isn't that great.  Elite kinda bites cause its terrible at chem dmg.  Only reason its good is cause its easy to buff...<br>

Uhhh Tons of hunting ground?  We have to hunt from lvl 10-65 in lush....gets kinda boring...and all you clanners come to lush anyway...<br>

Clanner camp 2HO just as much (if not more) then omni do<br>

Its called NW mines, and thats why everyone hunts there...everyone... meaning there will be plenty of clan there...one friggin mini dungeon...big woop...ohh and that mini zone is kinda far away when your a caster with a lifebleeder on ya<br>

Just wait till you can capture outposts in 13.8...considering the lvl and number advantage clanners have...omni may lose many outposts<br>

I have to disagree with you.<br>
<br>
Er.......... 1% more????  You are joking of course.  I can see you really have not actually tried this. So, to test this for myself, because I was hearing people say that Omni buys stuff for more credits, and I'm always a skeptic..... I took a Battle Suit to a clan shop, they offered me 150K, went to Omni trade, at the newbie terminal east of the grid, and got 200K.  Was offered 10k for some weapon, I got 15K in Omni trade.   Dude, you actually get 50% more credits.  Not only do you get 50% more cash, but you can also turn around with that extra money and buy EVERYTHING cheaper, including Omni Med suits, which the clan have to be lucky enough to find in a mission.<br>
<br>
I swear that if you are clan, and you are above level 30, there is nowhere to hunt in ANY clan held territories.  We have no choice but to go to Neutral or Omni held terrotories.  We have to go to 20K/Pleasent Meadows, Lush Fields, etc...which are death for Clan now, unless you have a plane.  The only place in all of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Aegean, Athen, and Athen Shire</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Tooth</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, where the vultures hang out, and there is only enough for one team to hunt at a time.  So in other words.... one team can camp all three zones, which would be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Tooth</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, laughable isn't it.<br>
<br>
My joke about the Omni campers, well it's all in fun, I know that both sides do it, I just couldn't resist having a little fun at your expense. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
As far as the NW mines area goes, Clan get shot on sight once again, so prob not many Clan will show up there anymore.<br>
<br>
The thing that I was glad they fixed were those damn Scooplets not giving up XP, especially when the whole dungeon was loaded with them.<br>
<br>
13.8 and the ability to take over an OP, well, it's just another example of FC trying to push us all into PvP.  I swear they want the conflict between Clan and OT to widen, why else make more 25% zones and the ability to take over an OP???? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uautumndawnfire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Autumn Dawnfire</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.melanierawn.com/images/bunnie.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 142<br> <font color=#660000>(2/22/02 9:02:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=427.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Faster leveling?</span><hr size=1> low level hunting areas... bfd.<br>

you do mission from 100 to 200.  And generally you don't care who's on your team, just as long as they do their job.<br>
<br>
Clan advantage:  sorry arse FC gave em access to OT areas to level up to mid levels, and made them more appealing by so doing: result FC artifically inflated the numbers of clanners:  result the Clans are going to with the war.  But not wihtout one hell of a fight &gt;)<br>
