 <br>
 I am a 65 druid named Lndi wishing to apply to your guild. I have 112 AA's, 7 of the 10 shards and all but the insignia of the ring. I am also currently flagged for POV and POS. I have all required equipment and resists.<br>
 <br>
Now a little about myself. I started playing eq about 5 months after it was released. I had always been an avid rpger. That accounts for me doing what I could to make my character sort of of it's own trademark ie. pant less. I started on the Karana server where Neomorchius and I and leveled a 49 druid named Lndi and he a 53 wizard named Neomorchius. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So I am very into playing my class. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  At that time the game became boring to me in it's repetitiveness so I decided to give RZ a try. I have been here on RZ for over 2 years. My char was leveled the hard way. I was very fortunate to have met some great people along the way. At level 10 I was in Silent Reign and remained there until my 40's even though Neo and I were the only ones wearing the tag. I just kept hoping everyone would come home. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I was in Tribunal of Gods for about 2 weeks when I realized that the guild was not for me. My next guild was Knights of No Remorse which was a very positive experience. Very good people in KonR but my char outgrew them in time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I still hold friendships within  their guild and have the utmost respect for them. I was in Temerity for about 4 days wanting to be with some old friends from SR when I realized that I conflicted with some of their rules and my way is to just leave if I see we are not on the same track rather than cause problems. I am still friends with my friends from Temerity. I was accidentally brought into Insanity's Edge after giving some of their members teleports. They were looking for people and an invite was extended. I was not even looking for a guild at the time but decided to give it a try. I learned a lot in my time with IE and went into MIM with the merger. I was in MIM for about 8 to 9 months. During my membership there I backed them completely in whatever calls they made. I was also a part of synergy. I am loyal to whatever guild I am in and if I feel I cannot be for any reason I quietly leave harboring no ill feelings. I was then in a friend's guild for a day or two when I realized I was not prepared to be guilded yet. I am sorry but I do not recall the name. It was a spur of the moment thing which I corrected right away. I have been unguilded for about 4 months now. Should anyone have any questions about my leaving MIM I will be happy to speak with you in private about it.<br>
 <br>
I am not aware of any problems between any of your members and myself but should there be any I would like to be made aware of them and have a chance to work them out. My rep is in pretty good shape as I always try and be fair and helpful when possible. But someone may have run across me on a PMS day. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> I am a quiet person for the most part but will stand up for myself and friends. I value my friends and any affiliations I make greatly.<br>
 <br>
Now for my reasons for applying to Ascending Dawn. After leaving MIM I just needed to have some time and find out what I really wanted out of my EQ experience and what I could do to be a value to others around me.<br>
I realized what I missed most was being a part of a family, Backing one another and celebrating in one another's accomplishments. I did not think I would ever want to be a part of a large guild again but as I have seen people I know and a few friends join your ranks it made me stop and take a look at Ascending Dawn. I saw you are a finely oiled machine on the outside but inside you are friends and family to one another. That commitment you have to each other appeals to me more than any other factor. What you have accomplished does indeed set you apart from the rest of RZ. How could I not wish to be a part of the best?<br>
 <br>
I have no problem pvping should my guild call me to it. I have never logged in a war even at the cost of an exp loss or death. I have always tried to pvp fairly and not make a lot of noise about it usually having great respect for my opponents. I may take a dirt nap here and there but I have gotten better at taking care of myself as well. I am always willing to die if it would save another. That is just part of my makeup.<br>
 <br>
I play more than your requested amount of time and see that as not a problem. I am pretty self sufficient and not one to rely on others to get things done. I am more than willing to help whenever I can.<br>
 <br>
I thank you for your consideration and would consider it an honor to be allowed to enter your initiate program.<br>
<br>
