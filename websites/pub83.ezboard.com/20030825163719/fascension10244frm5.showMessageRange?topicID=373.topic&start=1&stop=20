Clerics always free c3 at my Mana Emporium!<br>
<br>
If that sounds familiar at all... you've heard of me =)  <br>
<br>
My Char Name is Slavebecca Currunir (Currunir is tolken elvish for &quot;one of cunning&quot;).  I am an enchanter almost 64th level.  Ive aquired 9 aas at the time of this posting.  placed in run 3, Regen 3, Total Domination level 1, and an unspent point.  <br>
<br>
When I started my Char at level one I was told that Chanters are very hard to play.... the most difficult to master.  When I started playing eq my first char was a cleric.  It was the most difficult hard class for me.  I have total respect and admiration for anyone that is a cleric and can play one... they are a bigger tougher person then me.  Its also the main reason I c3 clerics of all levels for free... I know from first hand expericance how hard it is as a cleric.  In addition all people seem to appricaite it as groups benift from the added healing and it generally adds to the quaility of play for all people.  That make me feel good personally.  But as people told me Chanters are totally unsoloable I set out to prove people wrong (I soloed to level 60 with only occasional grouping for fun and being social).<br>
<br>
At level 9 I became one of the femmes fatale.  That guild will always have a part in my heart.  Slowly though the guild grew smaller and smaller untill there were only two people that played.... a 20th level mage and me at level 16.  Aaedary became guild leader and I became second.  within 4 months femmes had grown greatly (not just in numbers but in good fellowship as well at least I hope).  It was during this time in femmes that I met a cleric of your guild Tarrana and she became a member of femmes.  I gave everything I could for femmes... they were like my family and really still are.  I think I was a good leader and I tried always to be fair and just not only to memebers but to those outside the guild.  I continued in the capacity of second untill I was about 46th level.  The guild leader and I had a falling out.  Essentially Aaedary thought that a good guild needs one strong leader.  I disagreed and we went our seperate ways.  After that I founded a very short lived guild named Arisen Pheonix.  That experiance taught me a very important lesson.  That Aaedary was correct... there MUST be a stong single leader not a guild Council.... someone has to lead and people need to follow.  It was a hard lesson for me to learn.  eventually the guild disbanded almost as soon as it was made.  I have been guildless since.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have only a OS key. but I am flagged for Valor and I am a very hard and fast leveler...  If a day goes by that I am not on it is very rare.  The fact of the matter is I love to play... Im addicted =).  Im not epic... Femmes never was strong enough to do those types of raids and as I grew in level and power I began to develop the opinion that epics generally (with the main exceptions of cleric and mage) are fairly useless.  My spells are better the Shizzar and I can easily buy items that are as good as the serpent staff.  I havent really raided but I am very good at crowd control.  My gear is pretty crappy... I dont think I have an item that is over 200pp other them my recently bought shield of valor (for selling c3 and c4 extended).  But  if my gear is not adaquite I can easily sit and sell a few days and get it up to snuff.  My jewel craft is maxed out but thats probably not overly impressive at this level and all my tradeskills (except flethcing and smithing) are over 150<br>
<br>
Now for the reason I have choosen to apply to AD.   Believe me... this was not a entered into lightly at all.  For a long time after I left femmes i had a very low opinion of joining a guild (and even up untill about a week ago) and vowed to not join a &quot;greedy arrogant uber guild&quot;.  That was my true and honest opinion of high end guilds (and in many cases still is).  But as I am meeting more and more AD people mostly in trials and Valor my opinion has changed.  I am very very close to Aleki and Exquiste,  Tarrana will always be my sister femme regardless of any other things goning on.  But those are people I have known a long time.  Even bad guild can have good people, as how I saw many uber guilds be abusive to unguildeds and lower levels I thought AD was no different.   HOW WRONG I WAS.  As I meet more and more AD people I grew more impressed and my fear of joining and guild and being used and tossed aside when no longer needed has gone.  The First person to start me on this path was Stynkfyst.  In many ways I think he and I are cut out of the same mold (no insult intended stynk *kisses*).  If I am asked to help with a trials.  I will leave a group in valor to do it.  It doesnt matter to me if I have met the person or not.  Its the right thing to do.  Many times I have run though trials side by side with Stynkfyst.  Neither of us had to be their but I think we but felt the responsiblity to help others with a hand up.  Helping peope without expecting anything in return I respect more then I think I can really express.  Then yesterday I was again in valor and got the tell.... hey... do you want to get flagged.  I said that I was already flagged and grouped in valor.  I was offered 500plat to come help for 30 minutes.  I told the person I would come immediatly... but only for free.<br>
The person that asked me was a cleric named feppy.  I hate to say I do not reacall meeting him before that day but I  must have worked with either him or an alt in the past as he told me he looked for me specifially because he knew I was a good chanter.  That was a nice complement I thought.  During the trials (which we won heh) I also met Meowser both AD people were flagged and helping people in other guilds and people that were unguilded.  After we won... I actually gushed with praise to feppy and Meoswer on the behalf of the others.  I know first hand how truely rare that type of person is to find.  Feppy made a comment that I should apply to AD... before that I really would have never thought much of it.<br>
After a few hours... I realized I was just like the people I have met in you guild.  Untill that time I thought that if I was not asked to join a guild it ment I wasnt needed.  Knowing what I know of people in AD.  I dont believe that anyone in your guild isnt an essetial member and its not a thing of shame to ask (I used to consider asking to join begging) to join.  Ive never been one for loot (LOL do a quick inspect on me for a good laugh =D ) the only thing I have cared about loot wise in pop are my spells.  AD to me is an oppertunity to be with friends (like aleki, Exquisite),  Old dear friends (like Tarrana), and ones that even if they dont know it yet I count among my friends (like stynkfyst, feppy, and Meowser).  <br>

I've always known her to be a competent enchanter always looking to improve her class and play it to the maximum.  We used to pvp a fair old bit too, and she's more than able in that department also, really switched on when needs be.  We all have bad days I guess Vorge- I've always known becca to be reliable in an exp group, despite lacking gear.  Msg me in game if you have concerns about her, I'm sure we can work it out or at least understand it better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Vorge is however right about our AA requirements becca- check the sticky on our recruit board for full requirements.  Once you meet those, I wish you the best in your app, hope to see you on events soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I am of course hugely biased in saying this(she's a good friend), but I think 'becca would make a great addition to AD- both driven and sensible in equal measure.  Playing a raid enchanter isn't always fun, especially not if you're leading the event, but she always seemed to do it with a smile, and that made all the difference when you tried to raid kerra isle as we did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

As far as leveling up goes Im not worried about that.  I will and quickly.  I spoke a bit with Loh a night or too ago and I feel like I am at the bottom of mount everest.  Part of this application is a genuine plee for guidance and help.  I really dont know how to do some of these thing.  Another part of this app is that I want people to know that this is a goal I have set for myself.  I dont want to be a flash in the pan recruit that tries for a day or a week.  When I commit to something I put myself into it. At the time of this logging I am half a blue bub from 64.  I expect I will be 65 either friday or saturday at the most.  To those of you that wrote kind words I thank you much and I will not let you down.  Your Faith in me will not be misplaced you have my word.  I feel an application is more about numbers... its about seriousness as well.  Im sorry for the postings in &quot;old Forums&quot; I didnt understand it was a dead line.  I wanted to read people who succeeded and people who failed.  I didnt mean to post in places I was no supposed to.  I just wanted to be part of the group I guess.<br>
<br>
To Vorge.  I dont know what to tell you... off the top of my head I dont know what you mean but sometimes I have very bad weeks (with me it usually is a week not a day).  I truely think you have the wrong impression of me.  and if you let me, I would like to show you who and what I am about.  From Loh i have 3 clear cut goals.  get to 65,  get to Mistress title, get a Thunder key.  But I have a goal now for myself.  And that is to show you that I gave you a bid first impression<br>

<br>
I've never encountered Slavebecca first-hand... out of preference. Recently a guildmate of mine was accused of training her group in PoV (or PoN?), when in actuality he didn't, yet she wouldn't stop harassing him about it. It started with shouts to the zone every 30 seconds that he trained her, then threats of self- and guild-KOS (thing is, she wasn't guilded... I'll get to that). She was so stubborn about the whole bit that it turned into a multiple-day deal with a fairly long thread on my guild's officer board (as stupid as some claims are, we try to investigate them and solve them as best as possible, and unfortunately this made our lives hell for a few days). An officer decided to group with her to make her cool down, at which point he said &quot;she's extremely hot-headed and accusatory.&quot; Apparently, while he was grouped with her, she accused some other guy of training them (he also didn't) and excised the exact same annoying-bitch /shout punishment on him. Finally, an officer of Revered managed to get in contact with an officer of the guild that she claimed would KOS the member of my guild, and their reply was &quot;lol, Slavebecca is literally insane, we do NOT back her ridiculous statements.&quot; Calling her bluff shut her up.<br>
<br>
In her spare time, Slavebecca's hobbies include leveling, moonlit walks on the beach, and arguing with any- and everyone in PoV ooc. Apparently she enjoys &quot;making friends&quot; and her list is growing rapidly.<br>
<br>
From what I've seen of her, Slavebecca would cause AD officers some HUGE headaches unless they chose to simply ignore her insane antics and empty threats towards people. For some reason, I don't think AD would appreciate it's members threatening people with guild KOS, but I could be wrong.<br>

He knows it far clearer then you do on that.  The guild in question was revered.  Thank you for you opinion... But I dont think that as you have never really grouped or worked with me but going on 2nd and 3rd hand accouts you really dont have alot to add here.  Now if you would like to group with me I think you will Find I am very nice and am extreamly easy to get along with.  I do have MAJOR issues with trainers... I dont deny this.  I refuse to even train pkers.  It is an act that has neither class nor merit.  As an enchanter Its my job to control mob... sometimes I can be a little overzelous in my opinion that other should control them better too.  I do understand accidents happen... but they should happen 5 times in a row in the same half hour.  I also have several witnesses to the person training... I note that the name of the &quot;trainer&quot; was not mentioned.  AS far as that goes... I will not be as classless as to point the finger.  But if you would like a long discussion on the issue I will certainly be fully co-opertiver with names Sceeen Shots and logs (I still have them).  AS for my conduct... Lets group some time and maybe your mind will change.  But if your not interested in giving me a chance... well there is very little I can do for you and I am sorry I lost a potential friend.  Have a good night.<br>
