I'm not totally sure where to begin but, I'll try to give you guys the basic run down of my current situation here. <br>
<br>
During my short time of being here, and with the help of Rogzilla/Sabarx and many other AD members, I've been able to gear up Digrx to the point where he's just about ready for full raiding. Currently, we've managed to get nearly full SS armor (minus bracers / bp), 2 champions bracers (thurg) and at the moment, I use one of Rogz spare breastplates during your raids, only cause a rygorr tunic on a 60 warrior is a tad embarassing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Resist gear is being gathered as I write this, I'm only shy in this department by about 3 pieces I believe, all of which should be taken care of within the next day or two. Right click item is taken care of, Shrunken Gobby Earring. Keys, almost done with those aswell, shouldn't take me longer than an hour to finish up with those.<br>
<br>
So far, in the time that we've had, and with limited funds, Rogz and I have been able to get me 60, and nearly equipped up to par enough to be of use to you guys on raids. I imagine within the next 2 days, tops, I should be able to meet each requirement without a problem, I'll update here as soon as it's all completed.<br>
<br>
Now, a bit of history about who I am incase any of you are wondering. I'm a long time RL friend of Rogzilla, I've known him basically since March of 99. During this time, we've played together off and on Tunare. I've had several characters over the span of time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Some deleted, some I just simply quit, some I made during my times of being guildless. On Tunare, at the time, the server did many things as a whole and guild only raids were frowned upon. So, being guildless was rather easy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'll try to give you a run down of each of my characters, only the ones 50 and above;<br>
<br>
Serk - 60 Warrior (currently 59) - My first character on Tunare and the longest played out of all. I had quit him shortly after the release of Kunark, maybe 3 months after it being out, tops. When I stopped playing him, he had approx 224 days played.<br>
<br>
Jenjuro - 60 Monk - My favorite character to be honest. The last active character I had on Tunare.<br>
<br>
Ramek - 56 Rogue - My second attempt at the game, this character came not long after the creation of Serk, he was the 3rd barb rogue on the server to hit 50 pre-kunark.<br>
<br>
Vylin - 52 Necro - Played him only because I felt I *had* to try a caster, only one I had enough patience for. I eventually deleted him after I wasn't able to retrieve his corpse out of fear. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Tyrak - 50 Warrior - Second attempt at a warrior, I was confused, totally. I didn't know what I wanted, I just tried to make a better warrior than what I had originally. Although I did succeed in that, it didnt interest me enough to continue the character.<br>
<br>
Rahul - 50 Shadowknight - Loved this class but, I couldn't continue it at the time because I was too busy raiding with my monk.<br>
<br>
I had various other characters that I either don't remember, or didnt make it to 50 yet. I've been playing this game consistantly since it's commercial release, I had quit back in March, recently, with Rogz's suggestion, I've come back as this character you see me as now, Digrx.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I have a pretty good knowledge of all the expansions minus Luclin. I know how to get to each and every zone but, once I'm in some of the dungeon's, I do get sort of clueless as to it's details. Raiding? Been there, done that. Been raiding since old, old fear, when you could have lvl 1's parked in there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I've done all the older raids, NToV, Sleepers, etc. Mostly Velious stuff. Luclin was still too new at the time for any real big raids to be going on, so, I have no real experience in them as of yet.<br>
<br>
Hmm, I don't know what else to cover here yet but, I've got a lot of time on my hands, I'm working to get my real estate license, so, there will be some testing dates where I can't show up but, generally, I can be on every single day and make every single raid as long as I know that they are happening in advance. Although, I must point out, that my modem doesn't appreciate large numbers and I'm hoping to get a cable modem soon, with in a month or 2 tops. So, other than that, you can pretty much count on me being there.<br>
<br>
That's it for now, thanks for you time, I hope you actually read this all and didnt get bored out of your skull but, I'm sure some of you are curious. If there's anything else you'd like to know, please, ask.<br>

<br>
Finish up your resist gear and keys, as you say these are easily knocked out.  If you dont have one already, get a zone connection map of luclin and learn how to get from nexus to ssra and akheva.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing you on raids, you should join our chat channel whenever you are on so you can hook up with (thus get to know) AD members and recruits.  Plus this keeps you up to date on raiding schedules.   Try to hook up with ore and emperor key groups as often as possible, these should be high priorities for you right now.  The exp is not great, but it's exp while getting unpleasant business done.  You'll learn to hate snakes as much as we all do.<br>

So, it may take me a little bit to snag the last few. HS key is basically complete, just have to find the time to go to the froggy and turn it in. Seb key however, I know literally, NO druids well enough to come ask them to help me out in trak. So, hopefully soon I'll figure something out with that.<br>
<br>
Everything else, as far as I'm aware of, is pretty much fulfilled. Although, as a reminder, I am working towards getting my real estate lisence and seminar/exam dates are unknown to me at this time. So I may be popping in and out of game frequently, once it's all taken care of, I'll be online at a steady rate.<br>
<br>
Until next time ~_~<br>
<br>
edit: resist stuff taken care of ~ down to needing only seb key<br>
