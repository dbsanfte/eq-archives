I have heard that a couple members  dislike me, Biguss, Crystana, Adell?, although I've made it a point to try to make up any discretions i've had with those people.  Although Adell has me on her ignore list and refuses to listen to me.<br>
    I have a fairly long history as ex-synergy, so I know  my way around Norrath and how to play my character.  I've currently got my Sebilis key, Charsis key, all the teeth from velius and I only need Verix   Trakanon for my VP key (Which I went ahead and completed by myself to help me out here =)<br>
    I tend to be less vocal then most unless I really feel strongly about something. I am also not afraid to pvp, i've done it with Ascending Dawn throughout the Sect war and I am an ex-member of The Regulators. (Before they fell apart, I was in it back in the day with Kringe, Jakkard, Beld etc)<br>
   Furthermore, I'm not one to jump ship, guild-hop or otherwise be unfaithful.  I've only been in one guild in my two and a half years of EverQuest and the only reason I left Syngery was because I had strong personal feelings against someone who is becoming a member, I'd be glad to discuss the details of you want to contact me via email or in game.<br>
              ( Gemm_Eq@Yahoo.com ) <br>
   So hopefully I can get a shot with out being shot down by members who remember me only for some jackass action that I made or said when I was angry.  I can be a good friend, and good member, if I am given a chance.  Thanks for reading, later.<br>

    Oh, Lisa, if that is you're reason for thinking I am &quot;Phat loot whore&quot; sorry, but I just really want that BP, and I dont even know every member of AD, I really didn't ask you all.  But MB raves are horrible, so all im going to say is look at my Synergy hours, I had like 180 when I *quit*, meaning its not always about loot, otherwise wouldnt I have dried those up and then quit?  I have morals that I follow and loot isn't going to make me break them. I have been invited into guilds, i havn't joined any because either did not want to or didnt like some of the members, one guild for 2.5 years, wow seems I was after all there loot. /sarcasm off. Not liking me is fine, and not liking something I chose to do also fine, but It wasn't every person, you know it wasn't I know it wasn't, so why'd you say it?<br>
   I'll also let Luadian, Kringe or Praxx on my account to see how great of loot I really have if you think my 2 and half years have been whoring it all. Because in comparison to all other level 60 rangers im not so great.<br>
   I asked for a chance and for people to look past something they dont like about me, especially from 30+ levels ago..<br>
<br>
  Glad I finally realizied why you hate me so much that you choose to ignore me Lisa.<br>

Do you also remember that during this day, we were doin King Tormax, and you KEPT asking me to lead you into the quest hall... Even after you ackknowledged that fact that i was totally kos in kael, and that i said, the storm giants see invis.... Do you remember ASKIN me repeatedly for 3 hours straight while we were doin this Tormax event? <br>
<br>
Now after 3 hours of asking someone the SAME goddamn question in the middle of a raid anyway... KNOWING that IM Not gonna SUDDENLY GAIN faction with storm or frost giants.....You would think u would get a clue.. <br>
<br>
Get a clue Gemm... The answer is NO<br>

You wont be able to join this guild, I think its mainly because you have insulted a good many ppl in this guild throughout your EQ life. <br>

Wether or not you did this on purpose or due to some sub councious(sp?) thing I have no idea. Fact remains tho, you have hurt people with your, in lack of better words, big mouth.<br>

However, I feel that its that much resentment in the guild that you would need to work pretty hard AND need a great deal of luck to get a spot. Knowing how these things usually end I think its fair to say that you should try looking elsewhere, unless you have really set your mind at going for AD.<br>
