As the ambassador of Temerity i'd like to share with Ascending Dawn, and the rest of Rallos Zek Temerity's version of what happend and how this war started.<br><br>How it started:<br>One day, not too long ago on Norrath, Temerity went to the Plain of Growth to hunt and exp.  Dynasty of Shadows (DoS) was in the Plain of Growth prior to Temerity arriving, with approximately 11 members.  Temerity politely asked if their small group could zone in and share the zone with DoS.  DoS refused, saying no its our zone.  Temerity zoned in to kill a few mobs and persuade DoS that sharing wouldnt be a problem.  DoS subsiquently trained and exp killed Temerity for zoning into PoG (very reminicent of how PB's used to handle things).  A fight erupted after this and members of both guilds were killed.  After the dust settled Temerity awaited an apology which never came.  No war was declaired by Temerity as Temerity is not a waring guild, we sought to settle this dispute  amicably.<br><br>The second incident:<br>A week or so passes, while negotiations are going on to try and resolve this dispute between the guilds.  Durring that time a DoS member Attacks and Killed a Temerity member.<br><br>These two events could not be seen as anything but a declaration of war by DoS on Temerity. <br><br>The beginning of the War:<br>Sunday Night Temerity struck back in force in the Great Divide.  Initially DoS got a few kills, and begain boasting.  However, when Temerity arrived in force, the /ooc taunts and trash talk abruptly stopped as Temerity Claimed the Dragon ring and subsuqently the rest of the Great Divide, killing all DoS that they saw and that didnt gate / flee. The fight moved into Velks Lab, and a few more DoS's were delt with there.  Unbeknownst to Temerity DoS had formed an alliance with Xex Xerex, and a few of them attacked Temerity members, but were defeated.  Temerity moved to CS to kill and chase off a few more DoS members.  And thus the war has begun.<br><br>The reason im posting this here is to keep the record straight and have all that read this know why Temerity is fighting in this war.  We have had a rather good reputation on Rallos Zek, with the exception of a Highly embarrising incident that happend in the recient past.  I'm speeking of course of the PK that got into our ranks via a name change.  He has (and his alt's have) subsuqently been removed and banished from Temerity. Hopefully something as embarriing as that never happens to AD or any other guild for that matter.  However, as is becoming apparent (IE Adelll with 3L's) the Legends Server and Name Change policy have severly altered and affected Rallos Zek for the worst.<br><br>If anyone has any questions reguarding this matter, please send me a /tell in game as I welcome all coments and questions you may have about this war.  The war will conitnue untill DoS appologizes for its conduct, and the appropriate actions are taken against the offending parties involved.<br><br>Thank you for your time, and good hunting to you. =)<br><br>Whirln Bombs<br>55 Wizard<br>Officer<br>Temerity <br>Rallos Zek <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umoffonfurryhealer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moffon Furryhealer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 309<br> <font color=#333333>(6/25/02 4:41:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1059.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Temerity at War with Dynasty of Shadows</span><hr size=1> If someone came into a plane I was raiding and started killing things I'd kill them too.

That is what Rallos Zek is for, PvP to solve disputes.   DoS had indicated they didn't want to share since they had 2 more groups coming, when those didn't arrive in over an hour, Temerity decided the plane was big enough to share.  And the two guilds disagreed.  No biggie, happens, fight it out, be done.<br><br>But, would you exploit using exp trains to kill the other group and expect them to not war back?  Especially when you blame the training on another guild (blamed on CN) when it turns out the person from that other guild is actually one of your own officers as well (Rhidyn / Rhyden)?  Thank you CN for removing Rhidyn!<br><br>The PvP was fine, dont think Temerity had a problem with that, it was the trains (yes plural) and the taking advantage of those exp deaths, following it up with corpse camping to rub in the fact you won by breaking huge rules.  <br><br><br>That may have had something to do with the anger on the Temerity side.

All the stuff about training is peripheral in the sense that this war would be occuring whether or not that happened (and I wasn't there, so I don't know whether that happened or not).

Something sounds wrong there.  <br><br>And besides that side arguement, which people keep getting stuck in:<br><br>- They exp trained 3 times if not more during the fight.   Why not have a clean PvP fight if they disagree.  Afterall, disagreements happen on the server, so duke it out if need be.  But being cheap about it?!?  BTW, did you know they trained within 2 minutes of Temerity zoning in and that the only mobs Temerity attacked were from trains (so there was no zoning in and killing mobs, there was zoning in and reacting to Rhidyn/Rhyden's quick training).<br><br>- DoS guild members were in arena fighting along side PK's and luring people there under the pretense of needing help, then turning on them and helping to PK.  Unrelated to anything in PoG, here goes DoS ganking and it's ok because?<br><br>So Temerity went to war with them.  Dont know why they posted here, but probably just to notify all those that kept asking why they were at war.  Makes it easier if you are a bystander to know the situation.  <br><br>I'm confused what PvP is for if things like the PoG incident dont fall under why we have PvP on Rallos.   I'm also confused why everyone excuses blatant crap from DoS.  You're all being appologists for them which is fucked up.  Fine, Temerity should not have zoned in, but DoS had a chance to give their stance on that and fight it out, DoS exp trained to win the fight, which they should not have done.  Both guys didn't behave so well.

Superman, Spy v. Spy whatever.  We'll allways war you guys and frankly that's what makes this server fun for both groups.  The DoS incident however is completely different.  <br><br>We may have been wrong zoing in to PoG, i dont disagree with that.  I think at the time we did zone in, we truly didnt think that we were in the wrong, but that's beside the point. Point is WE DIDNT want this war with DoS, they wanted it with us and put us into a position to have to fight them.  They attacked us after the fact, when we were trying to settle this amicably (in a frindly way). The reason I've posted on AD's website about it, is because this is &quot;frankly&quot; the spot where people on Rallos Zek go to see what's happening on Rallos Zek.  If you read my posts about this incident, not once have i disparaged (talked shit) about DoS, other than to explain why we are warring against them.  <br><br>As far as XX is conserned, the only reason we're fighing them is because they're allied with DoS.  We have NOTHING at all against XX, in fact as far as Temerity is concerned, they are a good group of people.  Right now our Enemies are DoS.  DoS is allied with XX.  XX will try and fight us, but it doesnt necessarily mean that XX is our enemy.  It just means that they are supporting a friend, which we respect.  However, if we are to fight XX so be it, i hope they keep in mind though that we've got nothing against them personally as we do against DoS.<br><br>On a side note, Guz you crack me up, reading your posts makes me laugh.  Get back to RZ so we have a decient PK to fight against.<br><br>Whirln Bombs<br>55 Wizard<br>Officer<br>Temerity <br>Rallos Zek. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ufrawg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Frawg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ribbit</span><br>  Posts: 312<br> <font color=#333333>(6/26/02 10:18:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1059.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guz</span><hr size=1> I think Temerity is wrong.  They were there, and POG is on a LONG respawn, and a smaller group cant always do much east of the river.  A two group raid can clear the west side before respawn, so why share?  It's a big zone, but that doesn't mean there are unlimited mobs.  Don't try to take a plane that someone else is occupying.  You got what you deserved.  Training is wrong, but that they fought you to keep what was rightfully thiers is right.<br><br>Temerity should be the one issuing the apology.<br><br> <p>Tohde's army</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tsudanosh>Tsudanosh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#333333>(6/26/02 10:28:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1059.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Temerity at War with Dynasty of Shadows</span><hr size=1> Moffon's give-a-fuck-o-meter is a just a bouncing of the scales!<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.seanet.com/~mwyatt/tsudanosh.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ualrecrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlrecRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(6/26/02 10:43:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1059.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Temerity at War with Dynasty of Shadows</span><hr size=1> In my years on RZ I seen more people point fingers for trains then anything else and they Great majority of trains is a byproduct in fighting in zones where kos mobs live.<br><br>If you move you agro if you agro you run.. if you run around kos people mobs will agro them trains happen.

If you'd like, come to www.xex-xerxes.org or www.dynastyofshadows.com and discuss this on our public boards.  DoS has a nice board without pop ups. <br><br>I am glad however to see after reading this that most of RZ feels that it is wrong to continue trying to take spawns in a Plane after you are the second one there and asked to leave.  It's common knowledge on RZ that planes go to the guild there first.  I've been on the receiving end of this in the past as a member of XX and have always respected the claim.  The training is completely besides the point because you chose to war DoS before that even occurred.  I believe a DoS person (the leader Tekas) was the first person killed after he went over to your group to try and talk this matter out.  I've heard from many others that Temerity has no respect for other guilds in terms of raids going on.  For that I am happy that XX is supporting DoS in this war and I look forward to killing Temerity on the battlefield until Temerity apologizes for attacking our raid partner.  Again - this war would continue regardless of the training since Temerity drew blood first.  How can you say DoS wanted this war when you came into their territory and attacked them?  By the way - i'm digressing again - please take this to one of our websites to continue the argument. <p><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~nmenasch/kyle.gif"><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~nmenasch/Bow_Shot.jpg"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=102444">My Gear</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucykubisghettohealer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cykubis Ghettohealer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Nobody's bitch</span><br>  Posts: 543<br> <font color=#333333>(6/26/02 11:06:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1059.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://server3002.freeyellow.com/thearabianmagician/portal.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Temerity at War with Dynasty of Shadows</span><hr size=1> i suppose you could go to another board or settle this elsewhere, but my advice is to fuck yourself.. <p><center><img src="http://server3002.freeyellow.com/thearabianmagician/cykubisig.gif"><br>I am Yulaw!
