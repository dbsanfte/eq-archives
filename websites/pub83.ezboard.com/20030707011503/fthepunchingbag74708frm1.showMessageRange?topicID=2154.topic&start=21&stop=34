I haven't played much, just fiddled around with my ENF, trying to get her reorganized for the new nanos and weapons. <br>
<br>
I'll stick around long enough to play her some and see just how she works now (assuming I can stay connected). Otherwise, I think I'm about done with AO. <br>
<br>
I never was intending on buying NW or SL. There were some neat ideas in SL, but since it was delayed, I basically consigned it to the Shadowbane mental folder, i.e. it'll never ship. I'm willing to bet I'm right, too. It'll never ship as SL. <br>
<br>
I'm enjoying my Gamecube immensely. PSO Ep1&amp;2 is just a blast. Far better community (for some reason) than the DC one. Aside from a few clueless forces, just about any pickup game is a blast. With friends, well, funfunfun (and I'm serious about the fun, unlike what I posted on the AO boards). Metroid Prime for the GC is just mindblowing. That game alone is enough reason to buy a GC. Simply amazing. You don't see these special effects on the Xbox (not yet anyway...Halo 2...Halo 2...).<br>
<br>
I, too, have an Xbox and Halo is one of the all time great games. Unfortunately, it's one of the only games worth playing on the 'box, but there looks to be some good stuff in the pipleline heading our way. Still, my 'box does yeoman service as a DVD player, so no real complaints about MS's pathetic release lineup for it. <br>
<br>
Meanwhile, back on the PC, I've been keeping a weather eye on AC2. Despite fanboy complaints of it being dumbed down (and if you played AC, you know how ridiculous a statement that is), I&quot;m beginning to be intrigued by what I see. It looks fantastic on a high end system. Character development is very Diablo-esque, but I don't consider that a bad thing. It might be a very good thing if you can develop subclasses as rapidly and effectively as D2. As for EQ2, well, I&quot;m there, but I'll still bet it turns into a powergaming cesspool inside a year. Still, a year of more dark-elven fun is no small thing, so I'll drink the Verant Kool-Aid one more time... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viirruss>Viirruss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#660000>(11/27/02 4:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2154.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: advice for new MAs</span><hr size=1> /me reaches for a cup.<br>
<br>
I think I'll try that flavor too.<br>
<br>
I was a big EQ'er for almost 2 years. I spent way too much time playing that game, and loving it. But that was when it was fun and before it had become a &quot;powergaming cesspool.&quot; I am excited to try EQ2, but it means I have to buy a new puter. This one won't even run EQ1 anymore, not that I would let it.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Unfortunately I am not lucky enough to know anyone with any of the new consoles, so I haven't even tried one, other than in Walmart, and that doesn't really count. <br>
Metroid prime is THE GAME that has me seriously considering a console now, I have been playing Metroid since the original Nintendo. But I have to choose, new PC or new Console....I choose new PC. I may go for AC2 also, until I can get my hands on EQ2.<br>
<br>
Until I find another PC game that will actually run well on this POS system and that I really want to play I am here. I am not spending money on an expansion that will likely have more things wrong with it than right from day one. That goes for either of them, NW or SL, if it makes it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/character/bio/d/1/name/viirruss">Viirruss</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Actually, I think EQ2 won't need THAT big of a machine. Not a horse of a computer like DOOMIII or QuakeIV will require. Since EQ2 will be (mostly) Galaxies on Norrath, if you can meet SWG specs, I think you'll be ok for EQ2. <br>
<br>
Right now AO is about the hardest thing I run on my own machine. It's a 1ghz PIII Coppermine with a nVidia G4400 video card with 512mb of memory. That's not what I consider high end these days, but it's enough. Enough to run with all detail on at 1600x1200 with little slowdown, aside from being in the vicinity of Tir or OmniT grids. <br>
<br>
I think such a thing will probably be acceptable (barely) for EQ2. Of course, this spring I&quot;ll be building a new box for DOOMsday (peculiar industry where id's releases drive hardware sales for home use). That should give me two capable EQ2 machines...one for my shadowknight and one for her cleric healbot...=P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=viirruss>Viirruss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Training Dummy</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#660000>(11/28/02 3:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2154.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: indeed the new changes make me wonder</span><hr size=1> Heh, I am not joking around, my system is OLD.<br>

Grab a Geforce 3 (which is pretty cheap these days) and you'll see a world of difference as far as games are concerned. But you are correct, in that your old computer doesn't have enough ass to run most of the newer games coming out. When you do upgrade go for an AMD processor over an Intel....they are much cheaper and are as fast or even faster in some cases. Also, it's much cheaper if you buy all of your components online (pricewatch.com) and assemble them yourself. Hope it helps.<br>

I've seen the 64 meg version of those for about $99 now. It's potent. And VERY overclockable.<br>
The 128 meg version is about $120. Either of these will cure what ails you, graphically. <br>
<br>
Pricewatch is a great tool. This machine I type on right now was mostly assembled from stuff garnered there. EMS computing was one of my favorite vendors. <br>
<br>
One thing I wouldn't scrimp on is memory. Do some research here and get GOOD quality memory. You'll need memory bandwidth, and lots of it. Critical decisions that most overlook for saving a few bucks. Buy Corsair or Crucial. You won't be sorry, especially if you're inclined to overclocking. <br>
<br>
AMD is still probably your best bet for a GAMING CPU. The P4 is a hellacious chip...but only if you have massive memory bandwidth, which means the latest RAMBUS modules that your mobo (and bank account) can handle. Nevertheless, the AMD Athlon XPs are far faster in floating point calculations, and that's what 3D games are all about. <br>
<br>
Motherboards are critical. Right now the nVidia nForce2 is probably the best thing going. It's not cheap, but the 2S (I think that's what they're calling it) forgoes the onboard video acceleration, so you can slap that Geforce FX on there without having excess silicon you'll pay for and never use. <br>
<br>
As for accelerator cards, you'll want DX9 compatibility. That means nVidia or ATI. Personally, I think ATIs drivers suck. They have in the past, they do now, they will in the future. It's great hardware, but bad drivers are the norm. Buy nVidia.<br>
<br>
And lastly (hehe), get a GOOD monitor. All the greatest graphics hardware and tasty eye-candy in the latest games aren't worth a damn if you go blind squinting at some piddly shadowmask display screen. Get out there and get a Sony F520! Don't have $1600 for a monitor? Well...hmm...get a good aperture grill 22&quot;. Sony and Mitsubishi/NEC are the only vendors that make their own tubes. Get one from either. They've both very good (and I have both, the Sony is better, but hard to beat the mid to high-end NECs for price/quality). <br>
<br>
One of the advantages of building yourself is ensuring your subsystems are adequate to your needs. You won't have to worry about what garbarge Dell's vendors are lowballing them that month. Also, you can spread costs out over some time. I'm beginning to buy compenents now to complete a machine by July. Course, if you're made of money, just get something from Falcon Northwest or Alienware. Can't lose with those two (aside from devastating your bank account).  <br>
<br>
Good luck and see you all in EQ2 (unless you're a filthy, dirt-grubbing halfling...in which case all you'll see from me is: YOU writhe in pain, taking ungodly damage from some ridiculously overpowered shadowknight innate ability). <br>

DDR has come a long way over the years and with today's new (and tomorrow's) games, you will need the fastest memory pipeline that you can get. Alecto is correct in not scimping on the memory. It's very important for graphics intensive games. My two current machines each have 512 MBs of RAM. The one with the highest processor speed (P3 933) runs SDRAM and a Geforce 4 Ti 4200 but sports less fps than my P3 866 with a Geforce 3 Ti 200 simply because the lower processor machine is running PC800 RAMBUS (I've been too lazy in switching the vid cards between machines).<br>
<br>
Here's what I will do when I build my dream machine (next year):<br>
<br>
Black Aluminum case with black Floppy and 500w power<br>
AMD Athlon XP (Probably 2600 or 2700)<br>
nForce2 motherboard (with 8x AGP)<br>
512mb-1gb PC2700 DDR memory <br>
Geforce FX vid card (unless the price is too outrageous, then  <br>
    at the very least a 128 mb Radeon 9700 Pro)<br>
80 or 120 GB 7200 rpm HD<br>
16x DVD ROM (black)<br>
48x 24x 48x CD-RW (unless they have something faster by <br>
    that time) black<br>
SoundBlaster Audigy 2 Platinum sound card.<br>
<br>
That, of course, are just the core components. I already have a good monitor (LCDs are NOT the best monitors for games) and a good set of speakers (although I might upgrade simply because of the new sound card), so if I went for the low end version of the above machine, it would cost me about $1600 in components. The high end, probably around $2.2k or a little more. Those are machines that will last for 3-4 years (with maybe a vid card and memory upgrade or two), and play all of the games coming out within the next two years with no problems. My P3 866 machine cost me over $3k brand new 2 years ago (It's a Dell) and I have upgraded memory and video cards since then. So it pays to shop around and know how to build your own box.<br>

<br>
If you go nVidia nForce mobo, you don't need an add-in soundcard. The nForce has full Dolby 5.1 built in. From all reports, it's very nice. Just add Klipsch 5.1s and wait for the cops to show up...<br>
<br>
Hard drives. Go BIG. Also, get serial ATA. By DOOMsday, this'll be almost mandatory and it'll be standard on mobos. May as well use it and keep HD thrashing to a minimum. <br>
<br>
As for quitting AO, well, by this time next year I'm sure I'll be history. As for now, well, I was just tooling about northern Rubi-ka with my pistol ADV, and those towers...those are kinda neat really. You see them...and just want to fiddle with them yourself. Then you realize...well...I dunno. I want to like this stuff, but sooooooooo many annoyances getting into it. I still think PvP is a gross mistake in these games. It just doesn't balance well with PvM at all.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aomunkie>AOMunkie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#660000>(12/2/02 11:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2154.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://munkiesuthorn.freewebspace.com/aosig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: indeed the new changes make me wonder</span><hr size=1> “We are all quiting AO…”<br>
<br>
Nah, I am not.  The only gimped MA’s in this game are the ones that are behind the Avatars. <br>
<br>
I have played an MA since day one of the release, and I am taken back by this level of negativity.  I enjoy playing an MA, and HELL NO, I am not gimped.  I can take out my fair share of people that are 20+ levels higher then me.<br>
<br>
You are not playing the profession correctly if you are having that much of a problem.  And if you want to break down AO to formulas you are F’d from the start.<br>
<br>
Last night…<br>
<br>
In a fight with a 188 Adv, I am 152.  We are going to toe to toe for 2 or 3 minutes.  I was lining up to attack a tower when he jumped in.  I needed him out of there so we could proceed with our plan.  What did I do.<br>
<br>
He was down to 40% life, I was at 50%.  All I had to say was…<br>
<br>
“Get ready for DiMach BITCH!”<br>
<br>
Turned in to a bird and left.<br>
<br>
Again, if you want to play by the numbers, you might as well quit.  But get this…<br>
<br>
You are playing against people, not NPC’s, use your brain.<br>
<br>
No, not quiting.  Played EQ for 3 ½ years, DaoC for 1 year…  AO is the best of them.<br>

DAoC and EQ have soooo many egregious problems with gameplay. AO does as well (with more coming every day now), but it still has the most to do of all of them for the average player.<br>
<br>
The problem is the average player is getting forced out of the game. <br>
<br>
I don't have any problems with my MAs (no more than usual anyway). My problem is I don't want to PvP, I don't want to be part of some so-called guild, and I don't want FC dictating my behavior ingame. <br>
<br>
PvP is a waste of time, period. If I want to shoot up other people online there are many far better ways to do it other than AO. AO, like most MMRPGs, is stat-driven. Stat driven PvP is all about equipment and subject to the worst aspects of creeping featurism. I didn't like it in EQ (though I was fairly good at it), I really didn't like it in DAoC (because it was so unbalanced), and I don't want to do it in AO because of all the past exploits, present and past nerfs, and I'd need to be part of some rapacious pack of uber-guild powergaming vermin to keep up with the feature creep. No thanks. <br>
<br>
Still, FC insists on forcing all of us in that direction. And I, for one, don't want to go there. So far, I still don't have to, but my ADV wanderings show me the writing on the wall. <br>
<br>
Wandering around towers and overlapping 25% zones...it's an org world now, and that's exactly what I came to AO to avoid. The chance to adventure in small parties, solo, or whatever. Now it's becoming Velious, where you need 20 to 40 people to do anything. Without guild support...forget it. I've had enough of power guilds in EQ. Been there, done that, have the t-shirt and the action figure. <br>
<br>
I don't want to do it again. I don't have time or the inclination to make time. That's why I've about had enough of AO, MA or no.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=2154.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=2154.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=2154.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2154.topic&index=34><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=2154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.threadControl?topicID=2154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2154.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm10">Polling Corner<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market - Rubi-Ka 1<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm9">The Market - Rubi-Ka 2<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm8">Past Humor Links<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1>Main Dojo</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
