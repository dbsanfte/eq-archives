And thanks for the info on the clusters, I may actually get my cluster shopping done before the end of the year. I'll definitely contact Psiraven to make my next and final set of implants. I'll gladly pay whatever because that will be the last think I buy aside from Nano and Health supplies.<br>

<br>
My guild (The Praetorian Guard) which has quite a few 120+ engi's, had been lvling with slayers for the last few weeks.  Unfortunatley, we have discovered that you lvl much slower with this method (though it is obviously safer...just much slower).  I have almost completely stopped lvling with the pet classes unless they want to cast a Demon or Wardroid and blitz the mission with the rest of us.  The problem is pet pathing kinda hinders them unless they are very good at dragging a pet through the missions.<br>
<br>
Ideal team for myself and most others I have grouped with lately<br>
<br>
x1 Trader (&lt;--me of course..=) for wrangles and buffing, extra healing, makes it so you dont have to have the MP, but MP can be substituted here<br>
<br>
x1 MA for heals/crits buffs/good average dmg....this one cannot be substituted, you guys bump dmg output and survivability of the group at least by a factor of two...I think you just see the crits of weapon users and get depressed.  Its like you cant see the forest for the trees <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
x1 Doc for heals, though this spot can be taken over by an adven if needed....not really necessary if you have the MA as well....actually a group with 3-4 secondary healers works out great and eliminates the need for a doc, but having a doc just makes it that much better.<br>
<br>
x1 Enforcer for the sole purpose of mongo....essence is nice but not needed...the enforcer is really only needed to help trade aggro with the trader and any others that might have huge crits and draw aggro from an ace enforcer... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
x1 Crat/NT for the sole purpose of additional dmg output, but mostly the job of crowd control....calms can help a team immensely, tho the trader can do this as well....but I know I have enough to worry about when being pounded on, so its nice to have a dedicated calmer/nuker....plus humidity extractor or Baton exp bonus is always a well liked buff from one of these classes.<br>
<br>
x1 Anything else....the sixth spot is just a luxory as extra dmg output/meat shield/extra healing/calming/etc......so just take anyone that is around that needs a group here, doesnt really matter.<br>
<br>
So there you have it, the ideal group for myself and most of the people I group with.  As you can see, there are multiple professions that can be interchanged with each other to help fill a role, but only one that cannot be replaced....thats right, the MA.  Most of the time, havng an MA in the group can mean the difference between struggling to stay alive and kill things off in a timely manner, or breezing through missions on autopilot.  I know that for me, if I can just get the MA/doc in the group....the rest is all icing on the cake.<br>
<br>
Take it for what you will, but at lvl 100+, MA's are one of the most essential professions to have in a group....I would prolly rate you above even docs for team play<br>

<br>
i should pay more attention to your offer of buffs that will enable 1) loading of LMA and 2) buff LMA.  i commented in-game that i was more inclined to go the healing route, this will at least give me the edge against a &quot;gree&quot;  lol.  well i did just that, and also the Muscle Booster and AC (Titanium Skin) route, since i had ~100k IPs burning a hole in my pocket so to speak (the Booster may yet turn out to be hasty, after ignoring it for so many lvl, lol).  the excess IPs was the result of hitting title cap at beginning at lvl 125.  in retrospect, Treatment should have been the skill raised, but oh well.<br>
<br>
your insights are indeed very much appreciated.<br>
<br>
this thread may yet turn out to be the ray of sunshine in an otherwise dark and cloudy day in the life of an MA.<br>

<br>
The AC buffs are a nice addition the evades very welcome, and of course the crit hits increase survivability by reducing fight times.  My normal three some actually consists of myself, and enforcer and a doc that I consider rare, she's martial all the way, including using bwt, she's still able to solo pve herself but man... i have gotten so spoiled by her damage output that being with other doc's i tend to wonder why things are dying sooooo slooow.  ( HUGS fer Aeryyn my personal fav doc <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I do just adore what I can do for another profession that has choosen to prosue martial arts for their primary form of non-nano damage.<br>
<br>
CheeChee's buff list:<br>
1) crit hit ( best i have even if takes 3 minutes to get a full team full buffed into just this buff )<br>
2) AC ( if their is any other class that can do it, i'm more then happy to let them, MA AC buffs are ncu hogs )<br>
3) Evades ( this varies in place of #2 depending on class, doc's I want this on prior to ac if i'm unsure of their ncu space )<br>
4) Dirty fighter for any one brawling<br>
5) Muscle Booster ( haven't dumped ip for the upgrade )<br>
6) init buffs ( if the people I'm with understand about the slider and init, if not it's wasted on them )<br>
7) anyone else using MA's gets the works <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
1-3 I view as the most important to team survivability, the others are nice, but i won't bitch to much about folks that don't have ncu for full buff.   If i can't 1 - 3 on, I will bish about them needing more ncu, and no i don't give a rats hinny that they only use X amount when solo'in.<br>
<br>
<br>
MA = buff factory  ( something they left out of the profession description <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>

so here is what im gonna work on next: already got ql200 armor (can finally take on and off w/out any outside buffs), ql200 implants, and ql 200 NCUs so not much esle. am basically gonna max sense again, max psy for the nano and it ads i think 20% of the MA skill, start working on my first aid to get the ql 125s and evades. then..when im maxed on all that (figure by lvl 170 maybe a bit sooner) am gonna pick a ranged weapon...bow, sg, not really sure. was thinking of SG and fling to use a Krutt (i think thats the one). just max out SG and see what ql krutt i can get on and off w/out buffs. that way...if i get rooted (cuz we really do suck at pvp for the most part) i can at least maybe take out those lowly agents (fopus u know im talking about you) and with my crit buffs, low light scope and heals..being rooted wont be a big deal anymore lol. <br>

I found all my clusters for my QL 200 implants. I tried contacting psiraven, but psi was offline. So after some hours of searching, I found one person that had 1000 in Nano Programming. He was a lvl 160 something MP. He was kind enough to do a temporary QL 175 implant for 250k. But when I asked if he can do my QL 200 implants, he said the going price was 1 mil per implant.<br>
<br>
1 mil to click three clusters into an implant! I know there aren't a lot of players in AO with 1000 in NP, but 1 mil an implant? So 10 imlants would cost 10 mil credits. I paid 1.5 mil to have my QL 175 implants built. I pay 100k for the +80 treatment buff. I've paid 100k for a small buff to put on my scope (would have paid more for the higher trader buffs). But 10 mil is a lot of credits for an MA.<br>
<br>
Now I know what some people are thinking - that 10 mil isn't a lot of money for a lvl 143 character. Well in my case, it is. Only class that can solo missions to get money at high lvls are MPs and Engies. I heard that some agents can sneak them too. For an MA to fight through a 50% mission doing min damage on every mob, it takes around 3 hours. And I'm not one of greedy people that tries to sell rare items for extraordinary prices. I have 4.8 mil on me, and I've never had more than 6 mil on me, ever.<br>
<br>
I'm a little pissed, and I probably won't ever get my QL 200 implants built because I'll never have 10 million credits (maybe I can just the most important ones built now), but it's ridiculous that the profession that has the easiest time soloing missions also has the best trade skill.<br>
<br>
I'm gonna post this on the official forums to see if I can get an answer. But most likely I'll just have to suck it up until I can come up with 10 mil credits.<br>

I've said it before, they are grossly over-powered in combat. <br>
<br>
As you pointed out, they also get the best money-making trade skill. In fact, the ONLY trade skill with which one can make any money worth mentioning, as things currently stand.<br>
<br>
I was talking to my friend Bazooka last night, of Dark Carnival.<br>
<br>
He's an L143 Soldier. He also has an MP in the mid-80's range. He told me bluntly, and illustrated with examples, that his MP can outfight his Soldier.<br>

Solo missions better, and PvP better.<br>

<br>
the reason they charge so much is because as it is..there is only like maybe 5 players that can get 1k in NP. and its usually a pain for them to get it..switching out plants, getting doc buffs etc. so imagine you are one of the 5....getting tells from the 200-300 peeps that can actually put on ql 200 plants. fortunately for me..i got mine done by raven during the hollidays and she only charged me a little bit. also...what u do is get someone with lower NP to do your other ones....they usually wont charge that much..then get someone like raven to do the 1-3 implants that take 1k in NP. so now u went from 10 mill to maybe 3-5 mill in costs.<br>
<br>
plus..its a good investment...get a bunch of different kind of implants done on top of your main ones..like one for treatment, 3 for complit (210 in complit comes in handy when u get your 64ncu chips later on), ones to equip a weapon, ones to equip a new low light scope etc. that way..they are all done in one shot.<br>

Like I said before, I'm not even gonna worry about QL 200 implants or QL 200 armor until I'm lvl 190. If I want more AC protection, I'll play with the deflection shiled instead of paying 10 mil for a 200 coat. Maybe by the time I'm lvl 190, there will be more people that can do QL 200 implants. Or maybe Funcom will balance this GD game.<br>

I have read quite a bit of posts on the main board that seem to point toward some kind of shotgun nerf. As a former soldier this certainly wouldn't surprise me. So I would be careful about investing in shotgun as an MA. At least it seems that hammer users will be safe after MA weapons are fixed as Funcom has stated there will be NEW MA weapons for these skills.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucelestiness.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celestiness</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#660000>(1/27/02 3:14:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1604.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Get your 200s asap</span><hr size=1> Id say dont wait to get your ql 200 plants. by lvl 155is or a bit before even u can get the 200s in asuming u have maxed out your treatment and meet your base stat requirements. U should have intel/stam/str maxed for breed right around that lvl. put a few into psychic (if some plants end up needing the 404 is psy or make a psy plant) and agilty should be maxed anyway and sense semi maxed.<br>
<br>
with around 620 in treatment u can get in the ql 200s with 100 from treatment center, 100 doc buffs, 64 (74 i forget) from med suit and a ql 165-170 treatment head its very easy to get them in<br>
<br>
here is why: pvp- more dmg, more ac, more life etc. <br>
                 pvm- more dmg, more ac, more life etc<br>
<br>
even now..im finally not hitting for min dmg on the toughs-vets as much as i was with 1k in MA skill buffed and 200plants. Yes i do hit for min dmg often..but now only like 50% of the time instead of 75%ish.<br>
<br>
so its worth it. if needed i can even list my implant make up here so u can kind of see what i did (have to wait till wed for me to do it cuz i wont be back on the game till then).<br>
<br>
of course everyones will be different but at lvl 160 i can cast LMA, partial diamond skin, ma master (of course way long ago), muscle booster (way long ago) and lightning first with the +20 sense imp expertise.<br>
<br>
i can cast fists of kali and uvc with MP buffs or a trader wrangle if im grouped with either of them. need about 100 in all 3 to do it so its not that bad. can also cast inertia and of course the last 2 heals (team and individual)<br>
<br>
I basically have all 3 life clusters, all 3 MA, 1 or 2 dimach. 2 or 3 brawl, some chem/rad ac, fire ac, str. stam. agil. sense (a bit of each), think i have treatment in my r.hand (i forget), all 3 parry and am using a 197 BWT, think i have 2-3 bio met, and in my eye i have P/M, T/S and map nav. i have a S/I cluster or 2 somewhere<br>
Thats w/out actually looking at my implants cuz im at work.<br>
<br>
Its what i think is the best set up for a non weapon using MA (i use a ql 200 parry stick in missions for the 1k crits after i hit BWT).<br>
<br>
So that leaves any extra IP i get to go to evades, some nanopool, some nano init (for healing) and the rest im gonna put into either Shotgun (if our crits go self only..ill be god even with a low ql sg) or Bow.  <p>If you are going to Hell, you may as well have fun doing it.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=marwyn>Marwyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#660000>(1/29/02 4:50:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1604.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> implants for nano / fists based MAs ;)</span><hr size=1> My implants...<br>

LOL, second of only two times I have been buffed with Wrangle in all of 140 lvls.  As you might guess, I'm am currently using low ql implants.  <br>
<br>
As soon as motivation can be found to upgrade my implants, I should be able to self buff LMA without any outside buff.  Plus perhaps one level, or two for IPs to pour into Treatment.<br>
<br>
My implants are very similar to that of Marwyn -- it is biased towards Nano skills, Life/health and MA specific skills and then ACs -- in that order.  NanoNanny is used as a tool in the design.<br>
<br>
I've been doing solo missions recently taking advantage of solo mission is BS Home.  Completing solo missions is time consuming as I have to 'guerilla' tactics in taking down yellows, but I get to open all chests and loot all mobs.  The intent for solo missions is for finding MA NFs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1604.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=1604.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showNextMessage?topicID=1604.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1604.topic&index=35><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.emailToFriend?topicID=1604.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.threadControl?topicID=1604.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1604.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1604.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm10">Polling Corner<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market - Rubi-Ka 1<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm9">The Market - Rubi-Ka 2<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm8">Past Humor Links<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1>Main Dojo</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://www.thepunchingbag.net">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
