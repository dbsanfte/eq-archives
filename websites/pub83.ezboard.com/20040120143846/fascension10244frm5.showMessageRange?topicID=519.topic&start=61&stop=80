Fine, im flawed, I can accept im a bad leader, but do you need to hate me for it? Its not a choice I make its just a quality I lack.

Its a completely different job.  If anything, him being dedicated to his guild and being a good competitor with the other guilds is a good thing.  It shows hes dedicated to his guild.

down before I tossed my comments in, but it seems I might<br>
wait forever before that happens, so I decided to just go<br>
ahead and have my say since now's as good a time as any.<br>
<br>
From my experience, Ghouldan is an excellent player and<br>
knows his class extremely well.  His ability to apply his<br>
knowledge of the capabilities, strengths, and usefullness<br>
of a shadowknight in any kind of situation, new or old, is<br>
a tremendous show of his understanding of the many<br>
facets of this game and the roles that he can play to best<br>
benefit the raid/group.  He is a very focused player who's<br>
always directing his attention to the task at hand and<br>
keen to do his best to be part of a successfully coordinated<br>
effort, whether by following instructions or assessing what<br>
to do on his own.  And, even though he's been playing for<br>
quite some time, he seems to always be open to new, or<br>
simply different, ways of thinking and methodology<br>
suggested from anyone, and is also willing to offer his own<br>
thoughts and experience to anyone seeking some advice.<br>
<br>
Ghouldan's show of loyalty to anyone fortunate enough to<br>
cross paths with him, has always been immaculate in that<br>
he'd never let anyone down that was counting on him.  <br>
Unfortunately, from some of what's been said, the<br>
interpretation of that loyalty seems to be heavily bent upon<br>
the standpoint of the individual witnessing his actions as<br>
influenced by his convictions.  The fact that he was fighting<br>
for your cause or mine was important at the time, but what<br>
I truly believe is the most relevant issue at this juncture, is<br>
that he stuck to his guns and represented his family.<br>
<br>
As for Ghouldan's ability to lead, I think the only appropriate<br>
and relevant comments are that I don't think that it's an<br>
issue that needs to be considered given the position that<br>
he's applying for.<br>
<br>
Considering these points, which I believe are the qualities that<br>
AD is looking for in a member, I could not believe that<br>
Ghouldan would be anything less than a very useful member,<br>
that, given the chance, many will come to respect and many<br>
more will count as a friend.<br>

Whether he bullied someone out of an Emperor Crush spawn when he was lvl 10 is completely irrelevant.

<br>
You other people bitching back and forth need to make your own thread on another board or something, because this thread is about Ghouldan's application.<br>
<br>
I stopped reading around page three because I've read enough.<br>
<br>
Ghouldan is a good guy and is worthy of AD imho.  Yes he can be self-involved, yes he can be an asshole, yes he can be &quot;less-than-nice&quot;.<br>
<br>
People have equal things outside of AD to say about Adell, Lohengrin, Yslaathx, etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
Leadership of any guild is a lot of work and is very stressful.  Ghouldan is applying to AD as a MEMBER, not a leader.  The majority of people who are posting in negativity only know Ghouldan the leader.<br>
<br>
Which is why there is a recruitment process and probationary period there-after.  It's very easy to see if someone isn't going to fit into the guild during that time.<br>
<br>
The fact remains:<br>
<br>
Ghouldan knows his shit about Encounters<br>
Ghouldan knows his shit about Shadow Knights<br>
Ghouldan knows his shit about PVE<br>
Ghouldan knows his shit about PVP<br>
Never have I seen Ghouldan ninja-afk<br>
He is a positive person in-game and IRL<br>
He's friendly and trust-worthy<br>
<br>
To those people with negative comments to say about him in terms to loot, you were lucky to get loot - period.  His duty is too his guild, and if you're not a part of that... don't feel betrayed if you're helped one day, and pushed aside the next.  <br>
<br>
All ancient grudges and stupid shit aside, give the guy a shot.  You'll be impressed with both his skills and his personality.<br>
<br>
That's all I really have to say.<br>

All who know ghouldan as a player recognize his skill as an outstanding shadowknight.  Everyone sees his abililty to play EQ well, and make a significant contribution to a raid.  This thread was started by an everquest player to request an opportunity to join one of the top end guilds.  In my opinion there are very few SK's on this server that can match ghouldans performance in terms of efforts put forth towards a guild.<br>
<br>
I know that I can take some of if not most of the hatred that morb may have for ghouldan and or reverant.  If there was one person that someone can say that started the shit storm between reverant and revered people can point that finger at me.  I infact did leave revered to join reverant in a period of turmoil that revered was going through at the time.  Revered's main tank was in and out of play times and was mostly boxed,  when I left that put a heavy strain on the guild officers at the time.  I am explaining this because alot of people where very upset with that, relationships between reverant and revered went swirling down the toilet at this point. After I had left a lot of hate stemmed from it. I do not speak for morb on this matter but I do know he was pretty pissed as where a lot of people, most of which I was able to fix friendships. So if there is someone that you want to hate morb hate me, Ill take that blame. <br>
<br>
Once again this post is ghouldan's request to join this fine guild.  What is there to lose by giving him a shot, from my standpoint its a win win situation.  By having ghouldan around you will gain trust, loyalty, vast knowledge base, and most importantly friendship.  If ghouldan is not amongst your friends list now, trust me when I say that once you get to know him I'm sure that peoples views will change.  Ghouldan will always be looked up to by many in this realm and certainly and always by me.  Good luck ghouldan lets hope the flames die down and you get your shot.<br>

Lunar, if I ran Revered terribly, the one thing I wouldn't do is bully other guilds. If I was the leader of a guild that stepped on the toes of every other guild out there, then I'd expect people to say fuck me. You don't bully people around then expect them to get you loot 3 months down the line. No thx. <p>-Morb</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=morbrz>MorbRZ</A> at: 7/13/03 1:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draaxxrz>DraaxxRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(7/13/03 2:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=519.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Application for Recruitment (not a bump!)</span><hr size=1> hey morb for being done with this thread 3 pages ago you sure still have alot of nothing to say.

<br>
Ok im gonna ask this cause nobody else has and this time gonna stay totally on subject and not post my opinion of your attitude and opinions.  Give us proof.  Give us documented proof of ghouldan being this asshole that u wanna call him.  All you have shown us is heresay and what i heard from no names.  If it was so bad how come your the only person that is saying he was this tyrant of a leader that squashed evey guild in our way.  Hell SoD and Es where our Biggest adversaries for mobs and all the posts from there members where he cares about his guild and knows his class ect.  I dont know what your vendetta is about but show us proof.  give us some logs screenshots whatever of him being some scowdrel to you.  Cause far as most people are concerned he has a 10x better rep in game then you could ever hope to have. <p>Hunter <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=205547">Draaxx</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Sabrethorn</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dupre35>Dupre35</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#333333>(7/13/03 2:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=519.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Everyone needs to stop...</span><hr size=1> We're only hurting Ghouldan's application by creating all this drama under it.

<br>
in any case you hosers I just want to say that the group of players that doesn't want a guy like ghouldan/deric on their team will be missing out eh.<br>
<br>
the dude is a stand up guy eh<br>
<br>
i've known most of youse guys and how youse have played this game for how many years eh.  most of youse are over 9 years of age eh.  <br>
<br>
Far be it from me to give my two cents but wtf is this an application to be a recruit to be a recruit?  The guys been playing for how long?  Look at all the things hes done for people in that time...   sure maybe some people were disatisfied here and there along the way-- but if you can tell me you're completely satisfied all the time about everything in this game i'll eat my hat.  EQ is filled with angry people lol... Hell I used to be one of them :P  He just wants the chance to play FOR you people... jeez... instead of discussing 1001 and one reasons why or why not he should join or not like hes a warcriminal or some shit... why not give him the chance to do what he wants?  i mean give him the shot to play for you and then make your decision then ....  <br>
<br>
i dunno this is the first time I've seen good character, loyalty, determination and experience be completely overlooked :P<br>
<br>
in any case ...   yeah   nuff said lol..<br>

It's unfortunate that some people feel he was a bully, but don't forget that a lot of lower tiered guilds say the same about AD.  At the end of the day ghouldan is a standup guy who puts more into his guild than anyone I've ever seen.  And I used to be scared of the guy.  It's not hard to figure out why the guy has a reputation as a bully, but with his job he had to be.  AD is lucky in that it is kind of sheltered in the ultra raid newbie's, but guilds like reverant were the ones that took these people and turned them into suitable AD/mim recruits.  How many times have AD's officers flipped out on people fucking up events, now imagine a bunch of people fucking up an event that you've done a million times with a million other newbies who geared up and moved on.  If I was ghouldan I probably wouldn't have been the most cheery guy either.  <br>
<br>
So in conclusion, give the guy a fucking chance.<br>
