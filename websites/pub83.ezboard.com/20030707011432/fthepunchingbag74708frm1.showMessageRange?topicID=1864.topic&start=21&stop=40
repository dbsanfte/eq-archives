<br>
- No, we cannot automatically blame his caretaker. There are mental disorders that are physically based, no human being can cure that with being a good parent. There are also psychical conditions that the best parent in the world could not help against with all their love. We know too little to blame his caretaker. Maybe Everquest was the only thing that kept this guy from beating up old ladies or smoking crack? I wouldn't blame the parents for letting him play then... Besides, he was too old for the mother to &quot;force&quot; him to do anything against his will anyway.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree to a degree, but the context in which I made the statement &quot;If he was incapable of regulating his excesses, then we can only blame his caretaker,&quot; I think the caretaker is to blame _if anyone, given Hogmaster's argument which was basically that EQ pushes instable people over the edge, and is therefore liable. We are to told that this fellow was indeed incapable of regulating his excesses. He had a history of instablity.  Were the mother not taking EQ to court we would never say she were at fault for her son's suicide. In the context, however, that she IS taking them to court using Hogmaster's version of the argument- she put's herself in the position of such scrutiny. The argument being, if indeed EQ is such a pusher over of &quot;the edge&quot; (such a potentially harmful influence) why did she let him play, especially given his history. <br>
<br>
She to that will reply, &quot;out of ignorance.&quot; Should video games therefore be required to display warning labels stating that this game may be addictive, etc?  Pfft. <br>
<br>
I just don't see that she has a case, assuming her case was based on Hogmaster's argument, which was that EQ caused her son's death. Look at it this way. Even if she were to get a panel of experts to say that EQ was potentially dangerous, she'd have to prove 1) that EQ caused her son's death and  2) that EQ was somehow negligent. As has been pointed out, knives are sharp, and don't come with labels. Nobody takes knife manufacturers to court because their products can potentially kill.   <p><p align="center"><a><img border="0" src="http://home.attbi.com/~drdeathbane/images/migsig1.jpg"></a></p><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uhatchetao.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HatchetAO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#660000>(4/9/02 7:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1864.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get a clue?</span><hr size=1> I'm curious...

So mom knows that her son is a whakco (schizoid and depressive) yet he lives by himself in an apartment - alone.  So we got a mom that doesn't watch over her whacko son and pays for his apartment - because remember he quit his job as a Pizza Boy (oohhh  big money there - how'd HE afford the apartment before he quit?!), pays for everything else - INCLUDING HIS ADDICTION TO EQ. <br>

How can she sue Verant/Sony when she was supplying the drug?  <br>

I do think it's a little sad if that will be the result of the case, but it will be even sadder if the mother gets any money out of the system for this - not because money is not a solution, but because it is the wrong solution. <br>
<br>
The one to blame is mainly the son himself - he took the decision and he did it. The mother will have to live and deal with the sorrow. Nomatter how much money she gets it will not replace her loss. Anger and feelings of revenge are &quot;natural&quot; reactions to death, and the mother is nurturing and directing them in the wrong direction instead of adapting. The wisest thing she can do is canceling her lawsuit. In my view.<br>
<br>
Sidetracking:<br>
- Quote Sensei: &quot;People like Bill Lerach (your personal idol, I'm guessing) and the burnt pussy woman have destroyed our legal system's credibility and done more damage to the morality and ethics of our society, in my opinion, than all of the violence and cursing and nudity on tv combined.&quot;<br>
<br>
The way nudity, cursing and violence is put together here is not uncommon, but I still think it's a weird practice, especially concerning nudity.<br>
<br>
For me there is an ocean of difference between the expression &quot;nudity&quot; and &quot;porn&quot; (which I assume you really meant to refer to). You can be naked without having sex, and you can have sex without being naked. You can enjoy looking at a naked, human body without thinking sex - and some can start thinking sex by watching a pair of boots. Nudity is not bad, but much of the porn industry is, for many reasons. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=xer>Xer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#660000>(4/10/02 7:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1864.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get a clue?</span><hr size=1> Nobody forces anyone to play the game.

If a game ruining someone's life, what is stopping that person from closing their account and leaving the game?  NOT A DAMN THING!<br>
However, since this guy was known to be mentally unstable (and probably unable to make sound decisions on his own), the fault clearly falls on the mother.  She knew he was playing.  She was most likely paying the bill for the game as well.<br>
The mother obviously doesnt want to take responsibility for her sons death (because she neglected to care for him properly).  She found a scapegoat to sue, just like the parents in Columbine tried to blame Doom for their kids shootin up a school.<br>
This is getting too common these days.  Parents dont pay attention to their kid's lives then blame someone else when they do something wrong.  <br>

A minimal of &quot;research&quot; (read google search) turns up the fact that Stella Liebeck was rewarded $2.7 million, and that sum was later reduced by a judge to $480 thousand. <br>
<br>
It could of course be argued that MacDonalds was not very smart in the way they handled that particular case, seeing as they had plenty of oportunity to settle the matter before it was brought before a jury. <br>

I agree with the point you were making, Julei, but the way nudity is presented on television is not done so artistically for the most part, it's done for prurient reasons.  As such I think the trend it helps to set (along with so much violence and the glamorization of it and criminal behavior) has had a very negative effect on our society.<br>

And I love nudity (hence all the porn references in my work).<br>
<br>
This is something I could debate for hours, but in the end everyone has their own opinion.  I do see a very significant slide in the morals and ethics in the States, something I've witnessed personally over the last 31 years (at least since I started remembering things, I wasn't really tracking the decline of Western Civilization from year 1).  And there are an infinite number of reasons for this, but the media as a whole is a prime cause.  And I'm first in line to say I'm not real happy about the slide -- we've become a bitter, cynical society overall that is more willing to be less educated and allows stupidity and corruption to become commonplace.  <br>
<br>
It's one thing to be an adult in this world and be able to make my own decisions about porn and other morality issues ... but children are growing up now thinking this is the way things should be and not realizing what it used to be.  That's a big fucking problem.  If you don't understand what I just said, simply ask yourself if the things you enjoy you would be so fond of if a child of yours was to partake in enjoying -- and I bet all of a sudden the porn, wider acceptance of drug use, violence, hip-hugger jeans, tatooes and clit-piercings, rap lyrics so foul they are embarassing to listen to, Howard Stern antics and a million other things we ignore will suddenly bother you a bit.  <br>
<br>
Or maybe your just immune to thinking these things aren't really good.  In which case you should probably do some thinking outside the box for a while.<br>
<br>
There's a great book on how the media relates to this topic if it interests any of you (and it's a cheap one, paperback) ... Neil Postman's &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death.&quot;  If you want a truly educated opinion on what I'm talking about that is a phenomenal place to start and I guarantee you that the book will change the way you view our culture here and how the media has modified it.  Other good books on the topic are Marshall McLuhan's &quot;Understanding Media&quot; and Howard Rheingold's &quot;The Virtual Community,&quot; but Postman's work is the definite one to get of the three.<br>

<br>
hypocrites, stereotypes, and liars are all that comes close and even in those cases i can find them amusing in the right situation.<br>
<br>
I don't know, i hear people say all the time about how people's morals and standards are getting worse every generation. You know what though , its been like that for hundreds and hundreds of years. I don't mind the change, it's beyond my control and I never want children so I care less. Theres only a few basic rules I live by and if they aren't broken then I'm happy. <br>
<br>
Until children turn 18 parents have total control over them. Thats 18 years to teach someone right from wrong and whats good and whats not.18 years of monitoring what that person eats, wears, watches, and listens to. Thats like giving John Candy a time limit of 5 hours to walk a mile. If people can't properly raise their children or their children turn out fucked up its their fault , not televisions, not radios, not video games.<br>

From early age, kindergarten and school, children learn much of their ethics, ideals and behaviour from their teachers, classmates and friends. How much time does an average child actually spend with their parents? After spending hours at school most do leisure activities or solitary homework until they go to bed or fall asleep in front of the unsociable TV-screen (or computer). Parents offer a safe home and solid care, but I'm not too sure about their moral and ethical role... Personally I believe children should be recognized more as a collective responsibilty of a society, not _only_ each indvidual parent or parent couple. It's too hard (or too easy) to blame society though... if putting blame is any point (blame and forget). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udragonflyao.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dragonfly AO</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#660000>(4/11/02 2:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1864.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Regarding that post on your newsboard Sensei...get a clu</span><hr size=1> thats the problem julei, people dont invest enough time in their children so when something goes wrong they blame someone else, video game companies, that persons friends etc. my mother has been the biggest influence in my life, every time i might do something wrong i can almost hear her voice. <br>
<br>
example ive only ever stolen once in my life. when i was 5 years old i stole a baseball glove from someone cuz i was a lil runt and got mad. i STILL feel bad about doing that 17 years later. yes believe it or not im not as much of an asshole irl as i am in ao <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

when parents do the things theyre supposed to do for their children they want all types of praise but when the shit hits the fan they point the finger at someone else. in this case verant. <br>

yesterday. (and u?)<br>
<br>
On the topic of parent's not being there for they'r kids', and the fact that what we treasur as childhood memories is impossible to pass on to our kid's, there's a few thing's to think about.<br>
<br>
We as parent's (for those of us who are) willingly/knowingly give our kids choices thruout their life, and with it the responsebility. <br>
<br>
Think of your self as a ten year old - what did you do, what was your world like - and then look at any ten year old today - they are us when we where fifteen or something. They grow up in a free and unlimited world, with the capability of being in one place of the world one second, and the next second another place. <br>
<br>
The choices are so much more complex, so much more demanding, and have so much more consequenses.<br>
<br>
And we let them loose - yes we do - we even provide the meen's to do so. you know I'm right. . .<br>
<br>
Parent's (us) today have a much better economy (usually) today than what our parent's had, and we all want our children to have the best we can afford.<br>
So we give them want they'r indexfinger is pointing at - is that learning them responsability?? - the value of money, of thing's or of life??<br>
<br>
The thing is that we let our kids be exposed to thing's we have no controll over what so ever, and we &quot;hope&quot; thing's will work out for the better.<br>
<br>
And along come's some underbrain'er and has the nerve to blame other's.<br>
<br>
Kid's today are smarter, more adaptable, more egoistic, than what we ever where at that age, and we think we can leave them with the chioce's to deal with them alone???!?<br>
<br>
We as parent's really need to wake up of our &quot;la-la-land&quot;, and actively get into the life's of our children, to help and guide them as best we can.<br>
<br>
Anyone stupid enough to blame other's, or agree with the one's that does - WAKE UP!! - and grasp the chance to really, really make a difference in the world of your children.<br>
<br>

<br>
anyway's, ont he society has to raise kids, you guy's are forgetting something.   To many kids/fellow/ex friends that were students, they did the thing that was expect of them.<br>
 &quot;achieve success&quot;<br>
<br>
at school (or at least the few i went to) the teachers say, your all here to learn, to graduate, to go to college, to be abelt to get a good job that will pay lots of cash and you will be a SUCESS!   wheres the mention of things such as moral? or happiness?<br>
<br>
going to school i once knew a girl, her parents where like, get a 4.0 or you are nothing (we all read about this type of parent or watch on t.v.) so from 4 in the afternoon to 11 she studied 7 day's  a week, either with her parents or one of a host of tutorts they hired to help.   welp after hs graduation she made it to stanford, then about 3 months into the first quarter, break down.   thats about the worst of the things that have happened that i've known=p (sheltered life).    But i know as an abc (american born chinese), it was all about, get good grades, get a good education, get a high paying job, and then you will be happy.<br>
<br>
wheres the teachings that, get a good education , so you have the known how to choose what you will be happy doing, and in that way be a success.   Not everyone can/wants to be a highly educated worker at some job, but thats what we seem to push our kids to as a society, and thats how society seems to rait us .   how much money do you make at your job?.  <br>
