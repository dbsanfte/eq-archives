Seems you should hold off on your assumptions until you have definitive proof.  I've seen proof both ways on these boards and they seem somewhat evenhanded.  Letting the evidence to come down to the word of a Guide seems somewhat skewed since that is not the word of a payed eq gm but rather someone who plays eq somewhere and has 10 hours a week of their time to give.  Not to mention that the evidence presented against Tera has been from the word of 2 pks - Voltaic and Guznuk.  There may be hidden motives there and certainly they are the last people that you should be trusting.  He showed screenshots of Teralonis from more than a year ago in PoG with your own guildmates.  Your own guildmates have said that they remember Teralonis being there and have defended him.  That may not be conclusive proof, but it's certainly enough to withhold judgement.  If it's true that there is a system coming out to identify name changes, what's wrong with waiting for it? <p><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~nmenasch/kyle.gif"><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~nmenasch/Bow_Shot.jpg"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=102444">My Gear</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uhakatri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hakatri</A> at: 6/20/02 9:35:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uruhi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruhi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 628<br> <font color=#333333>(6/20/02 9:44:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1037.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> hakatri...

Kinda sucks eq brings out the worst in people.  But like I said all I ever owned was Trik.<br><br>Biguss your logic makes somewhat sense but there is difference between a random player aquiring an account and a guild which you never had problems with.  Had she just bought the xbena account and not been guilded I agree its to suspicious to hell with her kill her.  But temerity ?  Gimme a break they have done nothing to nobody they do their own thing and both no one.  Personally if your gonna be hipocritical as far as reps go you might as well take it case by case =/<br><br>-trik <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uyzzt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>yzzt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 294<br> <font color=#333333>(6/21/02 2:05:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1037.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Grim</span><hr size=1> We dont suport Bhark , its simple,.. all his acounts former or present is KOS ... capish?<br><br><br>-- <br>yazzt<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utelaise.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Telaise</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#333333>(6/21/02 2:52:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1037.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Yzzt</span><hr size=1> Trying to stay of tera topic, and asking generally...<br><br>What if you are punishing everyone BUT bhark?
