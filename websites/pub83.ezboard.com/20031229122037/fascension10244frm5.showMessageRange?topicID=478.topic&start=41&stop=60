About the accounts, he stripped every twink and every nodrop. Bags, gems and all. A GM is looking into it to prove that this guy did it, but the proof is overhwelming. He is KoS if he ever logs in again, unless there is some wildly great explanation. But seeing as how he most likely will be banned, don't see it happening.<br>

<br>
I've known Fisdantantalus since he was around level 20'ish and was very excited to see him apply to Ascending Dawn.  He has always been a cool guy and very passionate about his guild... <br>
<br>
The evidence continues to pile up.  Dmorg's Tormax boots were missing shortly before Lilspoonforky (Fisdantantalus' twink) was selling the helm in the bazaar.  Tremor gave the Dmorg information to quite a few people, however the Tremor account itself was given to very few people... only people I know that had access to it were Fisdantantalus, Kinthaf, and myself.<br>
<br>
Kinthaf and I have had access to it forever and a day, never any problems before.  Fisdantantalus also had access to Gilraen, which was also compromised.<br>
<br>
When I approached Fisdantantalus about it, he ignored my tells and logged off shortly after.  <br>
<br>
To Fisdan,<br>
<br>
You had an actual friend in EverQuest and it's quite sad to see that pixilated worth is worth more to you than friendship.  You have stolen years of work from one of my real life friends to advance yourself further, as if the 10000000's of ornate patterns you have on Lilspoonforky weren't enough platinum for you,  you had to go off and gank that little worth which belonged to someone else.  Selling his horse and keeping the platinum also...<br>
<br>
I'm glad your true colors have come through and I hope you get run off the server.  You made a lot of enemies and there's just no way you're going to be able to do the &quot;high end&quot; game that you told me you wanted to do.  If we had independent KOS lists honored, just know that you would be on mine.  Personally, Rallos-Zek doesn't have the time nor patience for scumbags like you and I hope Ascending Dawn KOS's you for your actions.<br>
<br>
Pretty stupid move to dick over a very prominent player of Rallos-Zek history.... <br>
<br>
If you have a good explanation for all of this, I would love to hear it.  One that doesn't include your little brother doing it.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, it's really sad to know that people out there value EverQuest platinum over friendships. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=carnagexx>Carnagexx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#333333>(7/15/03 10:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dmorg/Tremor</span><hr size=1> fisd,<br>

I am so shocked by this and also extremely disappointed in you bro.  Im really bummed out that a friend would do this to another friend and reaffirms my fears about people in general.<br>
<br>
There are 3 types of people in this world (if all peeps had 5 dollars to their name)<br>
<br>
1) those people who would gladly give you their 5 dollars and go without<br>
<br>
2) those people that wont give you their 5 dollars but wont atke yours<br>
<br>
3) those people that would just steal your 5 dollars<br>
<br>
the point here is that you are a 3 and i choose not to associate myself with somone who is in that 3rd category...good day to you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Tremor quit EQ, but that doesn't excuse Fisdan's actions.  Dmorg belongs to Drosenj, so I wouldn't be surprised if MIM KOS's him.  Tremor account is pretty much mine, so we'll see what happens.<br>

 Man, ive known Fisd for a long time, he is one of the best players in everquest that I know..and he wont let you down. He is always nice and willing to give more and more, such as always getting me spec parch's in BoT so I can get some spells =D<br>
<br>
<br>
He is a great guildie and I know he wants to move on. I value his friendship very highly because he is one of the people who care's for others and puts others before him. He passed on loot god knows how many times for me..and a few others, my respect for this guy on my &quot;Respect-O-Meter&quot; is about..oh say (100%-&lt;&gt;----------------0%).<br>
<br>
<br>
He is just that good. Good luck Fisd...Im crossing my fingers for you =) /cheer<br>
