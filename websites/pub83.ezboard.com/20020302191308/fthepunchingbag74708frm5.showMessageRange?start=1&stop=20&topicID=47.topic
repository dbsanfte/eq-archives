This will be long, so if you're not interested, go clean out the belly button lint or something.  But for you prurient types who care, here's the whole deal.<br><br>First, some history.  Sherman, set the Wayback Machine to July/August.  TPB opens, the successor to my EQ site (The Dojo), one of the widest read EQ pages at the time (even though it was just a *small* profession-specific site, right?).  We have high hopes, E and I, seeing as how AO is a pretty cool game ...<br><br>... with a management company who had no concept of the damage you could do launching something unplayable, unfortunately.  So we sit and watch as fansite after fansite, profession site after profession site and news-site after, you guessed it, news-site, closes its doors.  But we remain hopeful, just like those of you still reading here, that Funcom will come around and wake the hell up, and we try to keep it positive, patch after patch after patch.<br><br>One of the things we do as a site, mostly because I (Sensei) am a former journalist (a real one, believe-it-or-not, with a degree and everything -- not that I consider TPB in any way, shape, or form to be journalism, mind you, but I mention it here because hey, I actually do know a thang or two about the business), and see a value in doing them, is interviews.  God knows no-one addresses real questions from the company on the public forums, and it allows us to get answers for the profession's community that are needed.  So we do one.  Then we try to do a second one, and get blown off for 2 months.<br><br>Somewhere during this time I asked April Jones, the 'Com's US PR tool, to get us on the list for press releases, etc.  It's sort of a logical thing, being a news-site that covers ONE SUBJECT.  Makes sense, right?<br><br>Anyways, back to Rintrah blowing the MA community off for 2 months.  Maybe Funcom was busy, you say.  And you'd be right.  Doing 2 live dev chats and an interview with, you guessed it, AO Basher.  *gasp*  Also during this time, I noticed a press release on, you guessed it, AO Basher , (*gasp*) that we, oddly, didn't get.  <br><br>So I email again.  This time a bit angrier.  Here's the email, and the response (my letter was sent 9/26):<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   OK.  I've been pretty patient about ya'll not replying to the questions in an interview I sent in August 31.  I still say nice things about Funcom on my site, one of the few sites left who does so.  I asked something like 10 questions of you guys.  Simple questions.  Not even very probing questions.  Just things that our class, as players, really wanted to know.  I didn't think this was brain surgery, or that big a pain in the ass.  Apparently I was wrong.<br><br>In the time since I have sent those questions in, you have done 2 2-hour chats with AO Basher and now I log in this morning to find out they are doing a closed interview with Funcom employees tonight.  Um, what in the fuck?  The questions I asked are barely relevent at this point, and it<br>takes a month to get 10 of them answered while you just cater to a single fansite with 3 frigging live interviews?  That's a bad joke.<br><br>I had high hopes for ya'll, but I'm having real second thoughts about how Funcom deals with the fansites and the promises that were made.  So here's one question for you -- should I even bother sending interview reqs in anymore?  It's pretty obvious that you cater just about exclusively to AO Basher, a site hosted on your own servers no less, so should I just not waste my time?  Because this is beyond the limits of professionalism and credulity at this point.  Just let me know because my time is worth more to me than to waste it by sending thoughtful questions your paying customers want to know, and giving you free PR to boot, just to be blown off.<br><br>For a little background, I am former professional journalist who worked in the Colorado daily / weekly news for almost 10 years.  I have interviewed everyone from United States Senators to little girls in beauty pageants and their overbearing mothers.  And I have never, in my entire career, been treated as ridiculously as I am being treated by, of all the frigging things, a video game company -- much less one I am actually helping support.  Maybe ya'll should think about that.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>And the response, sent the same day:<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Hi,<br><br>I am very sorry to hear about your frustration and will do everything possible to address that tomorrow when I have everybody in the office. This includes the amount of time we use on AO-Basher. Other fan-sites have similar concerns. Our goal is to help fans in a way that ensures that there is a wide selection of fan-sites that caters to different interests. It is obvious that we will have to react quicker to requests from more fan-sites to accomplish this.<br><br>The Punching Bag is an important site in the AO community. We really enjoyed the last interview. I hope that we will be able to find a way to reply your requests, now and in the future, in a better way.<br><br>In the short term I will ensure that the interview is finished as soon as possible. Without talking with the people that is working on it, it is difficult to give a specific date. I believe the end of this week is the last estimate you received from us.<br><br>In the long term the Community will work to give The Punching Bag and other fan-sites quicker responses and a better idea about what to expect from us.<br><br>Tor André Wigmostad<br>Funcom Community Manager</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>Shortly after this, April gets back to us and gets us on the PR list.<br><br>In the meantime, I keep noticing crap like this, even while TPB, ridiculously enough, is chosen as the AO Site of the Month or something.  I hear about Funcom employees hanging out in Basher's IRC chatroom on patch days.  I see the CR guys posting replies to their news.  I see little insider things like the 2 screenshot thing the other day *seemed* to be (more on that in a bit).  And while all of this is going on I see our profession's concerns getting totally ignored.  We get blown off on bugs that have been fucking up our profession (MA's, for those of you playing the home version of the TPB game and wearing a helmet for your own safety).  We get fed line after line, ETA after missed ETA.<br><br>Then one day I'm reading one of those interviews mentioned in that email to Rintrah (Tor) that Basher did, the closed one I had read about.  And in it I see at least 2-3 times the Basher people stating how they are journalists, etc., and I start laughing, because I've always found that funny (explained below), and maybe a week later I mention it in the news.  Incoming Chaos (from Basher, Senior Editor at the time) email, 11/2:<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Hi Sensei,<br><br>i read your page and had the impression that your in some way &quot;hostile&quot; towards us.  I would kindly ask if we have made anything to make you angry on our site and would like to clear it up because in the actual time the &quot;diversity&quot; in the AO fansites community is very &quot;tight&quot; and we would like to keep a good relationshipt toward other fansites around Anarchy Online.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>To which I responded.  By the way I'm reposting this private correspondence only because I think it's valid, isn't divulging anything private the individuals would not want &quot;out there,&quot; and it saves me from explaining myself 18 times.  Anyways ...<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   &gt; Hiyas;<br><br>I don't know that we're any more hostile to you than anyone else we come across on a daily basis, really.  In fact I could point to a few places where I've given you personally, and your site, props for a good question asked, etc.<br><br>However TPB has most definitely taken a few shots at Basher for:<br><br>(1) Being hosted on a Funcom server.  You can argue this until you are blue in the face with us, but it destroys, or at least severely damages, your credibility.  I'd be more than happy to relate to you all of the lectures about conflicts-of-interest that I had in J-School or send you the links, but it shouldn't be neccesary ... I mean ya'll tell us often enough that you're real journalists (tm), so you should know it, right? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>Here's the thing ... we're not accusing Basher's editors of being tools of the MAN -- although I have noticed you have bent over for them on at least 1 occassion (the ARK event thing the other day dissapearing, even though it was completely irresponsible to post that in the first place).<br><br>But the question remains: is a conflict of interest, or the risk of one, a big deal in covering video game news?  Yes.  The topic doesn't matter - you either cover something objectively, or you do not, and it doesn't matter if you are running a fansite for a video game or a multinational daily news site.  Now, does Basher seem to be kissing Funcom's ass, as you would expect from this relationship?  Not really.  In fact if you showed me what I consider the three most heavily trafficked AO sites, which are probably Basher, AO Vault and AO Stratics, and asked me which were hosted at Funcom, I'd bet a lot of money that it would have been Stratics and/or Vault.<br><br>Basher, at least recently, hammers Funcom when it's needed, as opposed to the others.  So don't get me wrong here - I'm not accusing Basher of anything more than maintaining a relationship which is a serious broach of ethics in terms of conflict of interest.<br><br>But until you guys are hosted elsewhere, we will most definitely call you out when we think it's appropriate.  If you don't like the stigma, get another host, because you seem intelligent enough to know that issue will not go away.<br><br>(2) We're not big fans of the fact that Funcom has shown you guys preferential treatment in terms of access to Funcom employees to answer questions.  Granted, that's a bit of sour grapes, but it's relatively annoying to us when we have 10 questions emailed to Rintrah (this happened in late-August / early- September) and it takes over a month to get them answered, but in the meantime your site has two or three hour-plus live chats with developers and an interview to boot and E and I are still getting &quot;any day now&quot; from those chuckleheads doing community relations at the 'Com.  <br><br>Not that it's your fault, but you better believe we're going to come out guns blazing on that (aimed at Funcom, which we did), because it's ridiculous -- we've got readers we're responsible to as well.<br><br>(3) I always notice when I see someone say &quot;I'm a real reporter&quot; in news coverage.  As a former reporter and editor I just find it funny (and therefore a valid target for satire).  If you have to tell someone this, especially 3-4 times in the same interview, you're not one, you're just roleplaying one.<br><br>Honestly I think that pretty much summarizes the only things we've ever nailed Basher on in the daily news thang.  Personally I hit Basher daily, use the site's map database exclusively and even hit your forums occasionally.  And E and I have pointed to your site several times for our readers to check something out.  So don't take us laughing at you occasionally the wrong way, Chaos -- we're hostile to pretty much everything at some point or the other.  It has nothing to do with good/bad relationships with yours or any other site nor is it our stance that &quot;j00 suxx0r&quot; or that we pick on Basher -- we simply call things the way we see them as they occur.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>So that's about where we stood until last week, when I'm running through the usual 10 sites I check to see if I've missed something newsworthy and the Offical Forums for news for you bums.  I hit Basher and lo and behold, they have 2 screenshots of a new dungeon which I had assumed was the one mentioned in the 13.4 patch notes I had just finished copying in.  I read the comments and there's Cz saying something about them.  So I check Vault.  Nothing.  Stratics.  Nothing.  Lore?  Zilch.  TPB's Inbox?  Bzzzztt.<br><br>Now if that doesn't look like an exclusive, I don't know what does.  Apparently the other sites did get that mail, we're just the whipping boy or something.  And I'm seeing fucking red, man, bigtime.  Same shit, different month.  Then I notice that one of TPB's own forum-dwellers, Dragonfly, has gotten roasted on Basher too, which pisses me off to no end.  If you don't get that, how would you like it if you opened your daily newspaper one day and Joe Blow down the street was being lambasted on the front page in some kindergarden-esque rant for no other reason than there was no better news?  Dragonfly may be a class A asshole, but who cares?  He didn't deserve to be singled out like that, period.  It's unprofessional at best and downright inexcusible at worst.  <br><br>And no, Dragonfly having a website doesn't excuse it.  You don't do things like this if you purport to be a &quot;professional news site&quot; run by &quot;professional journalists.&quot;  That is, unless, you do it to people regularly.  But Basher didn't -- Dragon was singled out of the crowd and hammered, and as far as I'm concerned that's disgusting.  And just stupid, given the fodder of AO Basher's legions of regularly posting dipshits like CaptFallout who just beg for the treatment.<br><br>But I'm digressing.  Anywho, I go off in the news, because, hey, I go off in the news every day.  Friday it was Funcom's turn.  Not Basher's, if you read the news.  I even checked myself on how annoyed I was at that Dragonfly thing.  But you better believe I t'd off 100% on Funcom, whom I think deserves it.  But Sion got a bug in his ass that someone was attacking Basher, and so I get ridiculed by a small host of uneducated kiss-asses.  Sniffle.<br><br>So let's get started, shall we?  First, Sion, thank you for whatever you did to get us on the PREMIERE VIDEO GAME NEWS DISTRIBUTION LIST.  Nice to know Funcom listens to at least one website, because they sure as hell don't listen to ours.  Secondly, Cz, since I replied to your private email about this (which I won't reprint here, since it's repetitive and doesn't shed any new light here except you wanting to know why you were the victim Friday) with this url, feel free to jump on in here, because I'm really dying to know, as I'm sure the 2 other people actively interested in this thead are, why it takes 5 frigging months to get something accomplished like being on a distribution list.<br><br>Third, if I offended anyone at Basher, Funcom, this community, AO players in general, the almighty CaptFallout or the company that makes those tongue-like vibrators, GOOD.  Be offended.  Buy tissue, it will happen again.  That's what I sell here.  If you don't like it, feel free to hit that door over there like a bat out of Hell.  I don't sell news here and not only do I not promise to be unbiased, I promise to be so biased that if you don't read at least one of the daily updates and go &quot;what a complete, total asshole&quot; you're not reading the friggin things right.  <br><br>Then again, you might laugh too, and hey, guess what?  THAT'S THE POINT.  IT'S A WEBSITE ABOUT A FUCKING VIDEO GAME, FIGURE IT OUT.<br><br>Love ya, mean it,<br><br>- Sensei<br><br>PS: Vibrator people, if you guys sell any based on my news I want my cut. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uthesensei.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The Sensei</A> at: 12/10/01 10:40:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uenchant.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Enchant</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I'd rather be Quakin'.</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#660000>(12/10/01 10:47:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Sensei</span><hr size=1> It's ok, honey, someday someone will make a game that doesn't end up pissing you off.<br><br>~E <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=publius>Publius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#660000>(12/10/01 11:26:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Sensei</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>Third, if I offended anyone at Basher, Funcom, this community, AO players in general, the almighty CaptFallout or the company that makes those tongue-like vibrators, GOOD.

I have had no formal training, I write for a non-profit unprofessional fanpage. You on the other hand claim to be qualified and professional yet cry about what is undeniably the busiest page getting that little bit of extra TLC, its like crying about the Times getting an interview with the Prime Minster over the Sunday Sport, please do go get a clue (excuse the English analogy, but you get that point).<br><br>Now as I have already stated, after reading your assumption, which on this occasion was incorrect (although it may have been correct on occasions in the past) I took to it in an unprofessional and direct manner, which is well, what I do, don’t like it then go find a new URL, I don’t force you to visit me. At the same time I posted a comment in to the comments thread directly stating that I visit TPB daily and find you to be a talented individual and said that your job in fact is far harder than mine. I also stated in the editorial it self that it was not a retaliation but rather a correction of an assumption that has been made several times before. In the same breath I sent a message to Funcom asking why you were not mailed the screenshots and asked them to include this page on any future mass mails of this nature, evil am I not?<br><br>Now your gripe, yes we are Funcom hosted, after closing due to financial reason we were offered the opportunity to be hosted by the same company who produce the game we write about, well duh, like we are going to say no? We are hosted for free, Funcom hosts us and we do tend to sometimes show them a little more love, if they ask us nicely. But you can not for one-second claim that when the going gets tough that we don’t kick in also, as we have done in the past. But you are right, we are hosted, again do we twist your arm? Do we claim differently? We have never even made it an issue, if the best possible reason you can come up with for feeling so bitter is that ‘but  *sob* you are hosted by Funcom’ then you need to seriously rethink your arguments.<br><br>In regards to the Dragonfly thing, like it or not I have previously singled out other pages and individuals, it’s not a regular weekly ‘lets annihilate this person’ column, but it is something I have done occasionally. Its not the main selling point of the page and the feedback on this has been bad to say the least, I will not be doing it again, my reply to a reader of our page who said “my god Sion it was a personal attack, you cant do that” was:<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   I plead guilty your honor, and I will do it again to *any* one who claims to be 'the greatest pk0r in AO', and justifies his actions with ‘When people try to smaktakl me i defend myself with much superior smaktakl if that makes me an idiot so be it’ <br><br>Where do I go for redemption?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>It was personal, and it was directly targeting someone, it was my opinion as is most of what I write, managing the page actually does give me the luxury of being able to do that, you as a reader do have the luxury of going somewhere else. <br><br>What this all comes down to is you feeling pissed off, you work hard here, you put a lot of effort in and what do you have to show for it? I have been there before myself, working on a small UO page and watching stratics taking all the meat while I was left with the veg, it sucks, but its life. You have a relatively well used page here where you get to stand on your soap box, the fact that you were highlighted somewhere else should go to prove that it is not in vain. And if it really bothers you I would be more than willing to help this page in any way I can, I am more than happy to host guest editorials on your profession or to highlight posts you make. Standing over here all alone with a small user base and screaming that a page with over %50 of the AO players registered gets a little more attention (and it really is a little) is a little bit sad, its rather obvious that’s going to happen on occasion don’t you think?<br><br>Best of luck to you and your page, feel free to take me up on any of the before mentioned offers, you know my mail.

Reply, don't reply, it's really all the same to me.<br><br>What E and I have to show for &quot;it&quot; is more than we had hoped for ... we're the pre-eminent profession site for MA's.  Period.  Just like in EQ with the monk site we ran.  As for what I get out of this personally, and the only reason I do it, it's exactly what I've gotten already -- the satisfaction for providing a place for my profession to be able to come to, kick back, trade info and just shoot the shit in general.<br><br>Mission accomplished.  The rest is just icing on the cake now.<br><br>If you think a smaller audience justifies shoddier treatment from the same source we all cover, you're simply justifying.  Am I asking for dev chats like you and Stratics do?  Bzzzzt.  Do I need Cz and Savant in our threads saying the same non-informative dodge-answers we can get on the Official Forums?  Bzzzzzt.   All we've ever asked for, which is a pretty reasonable request I would think, is the same access to base materials and to have our questions answered in a timely manner.  So don't sit there and justify to me like we're both trying to get the same golden apple and you've just got longer arms ... I just want a fair shot at the MA info.  You can have the rest of the AO world to do with as you please.  If I wanted a big bad news site, I'd probably run one now, wouldn't I?  Zero interest.<br><br>Why does this bother me?  FYI, if I send an interview in to Funcom's department in charge, as stated, of community relations, and they're too busy &quot;relating&quot; to Basher to bother answering our questions, I'm not the one who gets fucked, Sion.  I'm not losing subscriptions or ad revenue here if we don't have &quot;the meat.&quot;  It's the MA's who asked those questions in the first place.  The one's paying Funcom salaries.  But that point never seems to get across, and it boggles the fucking mind.  It really does.<br><br>&quot;Hi, I'd like to devote a good amount of my free time to expanding the community feeling and interest in your product, which is not doing well in the market, for absolutely nothing in return except long hours, headaches and grief from idiots.  Could you give us 5 minutes of your time in the next 2 months to potentially keep even more people from quitting your game in frustration?&quot;<br><br>PR people really never made sense to me.<br><br>Anyway, lastly, that lil' thing about &quot;highlighting posts&quot; is fine, but don't stay up too late waiting for me to email you something after this whole debacle.  Because while we may have to wait 1-2 months for some answers from the 'Com while they are busy kissing the dirty onion ring of another site who's obviously a higher priority, we'll get 'em, and we'll show 'em to the people that want to see them.  And if you want to provide real AO coverage you'll have to quote it, just like I have to if you scoop us on something.  That's how real press operates.  Welcome to news coverage.<br><br>I'll tell ya, Sion, and you can definitely quote me on this, if you keep up this looking down on us attitude that you keep sligning around I guarantee you that you'll miss the upper left cross when it comes.

Jesus H. and Mary, what color is the sky in the world you live in?  Friday's news was not about you, ego-boy, can you see it yet?  Re-read the goddamn thing.  It was a slam on Funcom for showing favoritism.  They favored your site.  That's not a dig, genious.  It's not a bait to you, or an insult to you, or taking your holy website in vain, it's a frigging fact.   Do the research.  Read Rintrah's response to me back when I bitched to them about this.  This is not news to people.<br><br>I'm telling you this as one human being to another.  Step away from the box, Sion.  Breathe.  Go outside.  Breathe some more.  Think, for a few minutes.   Question you're role in this.  Think about what you are saying here and what you've said in the last 3 days on this issue.  Maybe you won't get it, I dunno.

Did I need you to contact Cz for me and get me on some distribution list?  No.  Do I appreciate it?  Obviously, why wouldn't I?  But I'm fucking furious over it.  Why?  Because I should have already been on it, because we're a website trying to get news to the community paying them and we've asked for it 100 fucking times.  This has nothing to do with you, and you really need to comprehend that.  If for nothing else than for yourself, man, because this is downright ridiculous at this point.<br><br>In terms of the one thing, up until you opened these floodgates, that I've bashed Basher for, I very clearly told Chaos via email a ways back that I have no intention of backing down from calling you guys out for what, whether you want to justify it to the moon or not, is a very serious conflict of interest issue with your host when I feel like it.  Hey man, I host a site too, and I pay bandwidth costs just like you all do.  I know the issue, and I know why ya'll are hosted there -- any idiot can see that.  But don't try to sit there and tell me it's OK, because it's not.  Even at it's worst level what you do is considered journalism and you are operating under a conflict of interest.  <br><br>You don't have to look further than the ARK event posting incident to figure out why.  And yeah, I do know what went on behind the scenes with that one.  We get email too, believe it or not.<br><br>You think it stops there?  Do you honestly believe, if you had something Funcom absolutely did not want you to print and you did it, that they would hesitate for a Mississippi minute and pull the plug on your site?  Yes, that's the point.  You think you're fine because you've tickled them a few times and they've still been OK ... just wait, Sion.  It's an old, old story.  Read up on the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Dallas Morning News</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and Bell Helicopter (think that was the company) someday, you might learn something.<br><br>Here's the question ... have I ever, in the 5 months or so we've been live, called out AO Basher for something beyond that?  No, at least not to my recollection.  Have I given you guys credit for a good question, or a good scoop?  Often.  And this is the thanks I get, a day of arguing with someone too immature to read and think about the issue, and his moronic sheep to boot?  Has to be a Monday, just has to be a Monday.<br><br>For the absolute, penultimate, last time ... I didn't call out Basher for being anything more than favored and maintaining a serious conflict of interest relationship with Funcom until one day you can't find something better or more productive to do and take on first one of the MA community members and then myself.  And you better fucking believe that won't be tolerated.<br><br>And one last time, for the record, while I'm thinking about it ... that Dragonfly thing?  Piss.  Fucking.  Poor.  And you owe him an apology.<br><br>I don't need a bigger audience, Sion, because the MA's are already here and there's not a hell of a lot more here, except my occasional fits of outrage, for any other profession.  do you see ads here?  Do you see me setting up Paypal accounts to pay for my bandwidth?  Bzzzt.  I do this for fun, period.  1 reader, 10,000 readers, 100,000, my goal's exactly the same, the rewards are the same and the gratification is the same.  It's not a job, it's a hobby.<br><br>And if the only way Funcom would see something I or anyone else here writes is if it's on AO Basher then (1) you need to get a grip on your own self-importance and (2) that pretty-much damnwell proves the point I was making Friday that you apparently missed, hero.  FUNCOM APPEARS TO BE SHOWING YOUR WEBSITE FAVORITISM.  Duh.<br><br>You want to end this?  Great.  Drop the condescending attitude and act like a peer, which believe it or not you are, and stop picking on people like Dragonfly, who asshole or not didn't deserve to be trashed on what is, as you so often make sure you tell us, the most popular AO site.  Or go get fucking bent.  Either way, my day's the same, pal.  Just less fuel for the bored masses to feed on.<br><br>Lord God, I need a Frappuccino now.  Mocha please.<br><br>- Sensei <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=alianna>Alianna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Martial, Baby, MARTIAL.</span><br>  Posts: 506<br> <font color=#660000>(12/10/01 5:40:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Brevity.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We are hosted for free, Funcom hosts us and we do tend to sometimes show them a little more love, if they ask us nicely.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You could have saved yourself a lot of typing if you'd just said:<br><br>We are whores.<br><br>Because it amounts to the same thing, really. &quot;But it's only a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> hobby</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!11!11!1!
