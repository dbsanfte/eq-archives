Wizards mad b/c they can't 1shot kill someone?  YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO 1SHOT KILL SOMEONE!  That wasn't manaburn's intention and you know it.

Does that mean you win the fight? Or you hope they get bored before you? It's pretty obvious that melee are not SCARED of casters, because they know the eat them alive, and that they have HP to take a blast or two. Don't you think that's abnormal also? Why should casters be the only ones to fear?<br>
<br>
Sure MB is unbalanced, but please explain to me what I should do so warriors fear me, apart from changing my sig? Oh wait I don't have MAD PVP SKILLZ. Woops, WTB level 60 war with NTOV gear I think I've just notched up my madskillz a crank or two.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Why remove MB from PvP and leave in primal weapons that were meant for hitting on mobs with 2 gazillion HPS not a caster with 1500? In this completely unbalanced environment, you have to fight with whatever weapons they give you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, just get rid of manaburn, and come and tear me a new one with your PvP-balanced sceptre of destruction!<br>
<br>
<br>
PvP is just completely unbalanced, and it's just about what lobby is the strongest at some given time so you are playing the best PvP class. Good PvPers play good PvP classes I suppose!<br>

Nope they are mad because they can't kill anyone with over 1500hps who has half a clue of what they are doing. And even so that person they killed was probably another wizard.

<br>
Primal has something to do with winning a fight but it's not the whole picture. There is nothing a straight Melee can do to stop you from leaving a fight if you want to, or avoiding the hits by wall running/strafing.<br>
<br>
Melee's don't have that luxury always, often times (especially when facing wizards) the casting time is too quick to get out of range.<br>
<br>
Not to mention epic shields and spell shields likely give wizards more hitpoints vs spells then I have, and they can recast them.<br>
<br>
Certainly the story is a little different indoors. Straight melees have much better odds in tight spaces but outdoors, its rough to get a kill on a caster if they want to get away they can. Outdoors mostly all I ever see is &quot;your target is out of range&quot;, because casters are running up and down walls until they lose me then fire up a nuke.<br>
<br>
It's not terribly hard for me to get away either but certainly casters have the upper hand with a method to escape any melee and there is nothing we can do about it.<br>
<br>
In my opinion:<br>
<br>
I think the fix is to let wizards manaburn, but don't allow the target to be looted.<br>
<br>
That will still allow them to play a huge part in group level pvp, allowing them to take out strategic targets without allowing all the 1 shot bazaar afk loot wizzies.<br>
<br>
But either way, wizzies kill alot of people, indoors and out without manaburn. I dont think they are as underpowered as you make them out to be.<br>
<br>

I like manaburn... When Xanthala MB'd me in EJ I was laughing for like 10mins straight cause 5k damage when i had like 2k hps was such overkill I found it hilarious.  And for you people that think we all are ND I was wearing gear and I always wear at least some semi decent stuff that is lootable, and will continue to do so (Though I ain't putting on no fungi tunic anytime soon lol)<br>
<br>
What I do think is very cheap is golem metal rods and prenerf pumice, not against me but against most casters.  These are what really unbalances PvP because SO many people have and use them (including myself but not to a large extent only use it to get away most times or on levitate) Manaburn only maybe 20 or so have atm, but everytime I PvP there is someone or many people goleming, and its cheap.  <br>
<br>
BTW Aurore... If you think wizzies arent good at PvP im laughing so hard, wizzies are VERY dangerous pvp especially when there are hills (everywhere), if a melee finds where u are and starts pounding on u just run up the hill so u ghost on his screen, re apply epic than solist spear and lure some more. <br>
<br>
There are some classes that just can't kill other classes, or it's very difficult for them to do so.  You saying you can never kill a warrior? Well i can NEVER kill a warrior and probably cant even drop them 50% hps (unless they suck at jousting than they're toast ie. using 1h weaps lol) Cause my AC aint too hot and they got many many more HPs.  Cleric cant kill any melee played right, so?  And seriously when do you PvP? Far as I've known SoD don't kos anyone except like HiV... who IMO arent wearing scepters of destruction :P, this aint to diss you I just dont think you have much experience in PvP.<br>
<br>
EDIT-Sorry I'm not usually like this but your post was quite funny so I need to comment some more. A wizzie cant kill someone with over 1500hps and knows what they're doing.... ARE YOU CRAZY!? lol a wizzie can drop 1500hps in a few seconds.<br>

So caster vs. melee is balanced when we can run away (or use l33t hill circling tactics and hope he doesn't catch me with his Centi Bonking Stick hitting for double 300s? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Moffon, you seem to have 2 major themes in your posts (and yes, I read those at Graffe's too) First, manaburn should be nerfed and second, since clerics don't have offensive abilities manaburn should be nerfed. I'm picking on you because I honestly don't think clerics are / should be death dealing offensive killing machines. On the other hand, you have godly defensive abilities, going as far that at pre-manaburn age it was impossible for a wiz to kill a smart cleric, a fact which many clerics, you included have let me know. If you want offensive power, you probably shouldn't have picked the caretaker class <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As to my suggestion on what to do with manaburn is that I too think it would be the best to remove the loot ability on manaburn PvP kills. This would probably limit the one-shot artists yet leave manaburn as an useful tool for us in small (and bitter!) guilds <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
manaburn as of now, is without a doubt massively unbalanced, however.  with the combo of the instant gate, it makes wizards dominate over every class, where they simply shouldn't be able to, there is nothing in the game that could counter-act it.  the idea of no loot would be decent, but it still wouldn't do much about the fact that they are able to kill anyone with it.  <br>
<br>
i think it would make more sense to just make it do way less damage in pvp, for example, a VERY well geared wizard could do 1400-1500 tops with it, increase the cast time be 2-3 seconds, shorten the range, and have a 5-10 minute delay afterwards until they could use any of the instant abilities.  i figure that would be a decent compromise, they'd still be able to DT a small portion of casters who are fairly poorly geared, but it wouldn't be worth it since a few lures would have the same effect and leave them with more mana(thus getting rid of people who feel the need to be completely naked while doing it), and they would need to have a ton of mana to do it anyways.  the longer cast time/shorter range(not too short, but apx the range of bonds of force) would also add the option of running if the person saw it being cast near them.  the time it would take for them to instant gate would get rid of the problem where someone just kills, loots, and gates, long before the victim's group even realises that they were pked.  since the cap would only apply to pvp, none of this would even effect where it was meant to be used - pve, an extra 2-3 seconds cast time wouldn't matter, nor would the range issue or delay between instant gating.<br>
<br>
note: i'm not completely ignorant about wizard abilities, i've played one up to 53 so far. <p><center><img src="http://server3002.freeyellow.com/thearabianmagician/cykubisig.gif"><br>I am Yulaw!

The only spell wizards can use in pvp is lure of ice which is doing aproxx 500dmg in pvp with a cast time of 4.5 sec (when solo pvp). All the other spells arent that useful in pvp because its easy for a melee to get Fire/Cold/magic resist over 130. Sure, if youre bagged like 99% of all Peacebreakers you can turn over to normal spells. When i see sunstrike hitting for full dmg...rofl...<br>

When i see Rangers doing 800dmg with their bows, Warrior slashing for 400dmg quad (not to mention crit hits) and rogues backstab for 1000dmg not to mention monks with their dmg output, compared to 1600hp a wizard has i can only laugh at ppl saying wizards rocks in pvp against melees. The truth is: pumice bomb, 4 sec later dead wizard if you cant escape early enough. And even without pumice bomb the wizard is dead in no time...<br>
<br>
Melees vs. wizard in hill area... sure, a melee not doing that well here but ghosting and running like mad (melee) makes a wizard life not easier. A wizard CANT kill anyone who keep running.   <br>

<br>
lol, wear resist stuff ?!!! huh?<br>
<br>
fact is, wizards doing best in groups if they are casting from the back and hiding from enemies eyes. They are very dangerous in groups. I agree verrant must nerf manaburn but only because of lame ppl like xbena and not because of the &quot;one-shot-death&quot; ability. Cast time on manaburn is 6 sec, time enough to run oor? Watchful and knowing which ppl are in zone is a prerequisite.<br>
<br>
get off that 66% dmg at high lvl pvp would help much against melees. Why arent melees getting that 66% dmg shit? Also nerf manaburn and decrease the resist check would help a wizard alot to get back to a fearful AND respectable class. Not to mention the pve ability of the wizard which will hopefully get a fix soon. but hey, we got reduced mana on evacuation!!! whoott!!!<br>
<br>
when i read this all and when i think that i never wanted to discuss about pvp in eq again but i must say i wrote pretty much *hehe*...Anyway, i love my wizard and wont ever play another char. Its a challenge to play one and not that easy many ppl thought.<br>

But remember it's almost impossible for a cleric to kill a wizard.  The only strength of having a very efficient line of defensive spells is that you hope to win the fight by running the wizard oom.  After that, you'll probably kill him with your p3on melee skills before you kill him with a cleric's horribly inefficient nukes.  <br>
<br>
Cyubkis- in my post I argued for changes similar to yours, I do think however, that 2-3 minutes of being unable to use your spellbar/instacast is very excessive.  Have manaburn do 70-90% of total hps assuming equal level and a full manabar for the wizard.  Also, no crit manaburn in pvp.  Then make it so using manaburn stuns the wizard for 7-10 seconds.  No instagate, mod-rods, conflag wands, pumice, nada, can't click them if you're stunned.  If you don't manage to kill your opponent, you're severely disabled, a necro will stack his dots, a melee will give you a friendly hug with his favorite 2-hander, and clerics will er...gate :P  If you're not at full mana when you cast manaburn, it does proportionate percentages of full hps based on your mana pool.  This forces wizards to not rely SOLELY on manaburn as a death-touch, which would bring it along-side harmtouch in terms of pvp power.  Lure, sunstrike, manaburn, 3 spells, not one 6-second casting deathtouch.  <br>
<br>
I think shortening the spell range just makes it pointless as a pvp ability, but placing the stun restriction is fair risk vs. reward.  If a wizard takes the risk of using *only* manaburn and being certain of not killing his/her target, then they might well pay the price.  If they use their other spells *then* manaburn to get the kill...surely that's fair enough isn't it?  This wouldn't completely discourage Xbena/faikus from their  gank/gate strategy, but it'd be a step in the right direction as I've said.  It'll also require the wizard to play with a ounce more skill than is currently required when manaburn is up.  <br>

What many people don't know is that /feedback gets read on a REGULAR BASIS.  So my advice is to send as much /feedback about the spell as possible.<br>
<br>
Now when I say /feedback, I don't mean &quot;NERF MANABURN&quot;, or &quot;FIX MANABURN WTF&quot;<br>
<br>
Offer your opinion on the spell, and ideas on how to make it more fair in PVP.  Otherwise they'll just throw it out.<br>
<br>
I've never actually been on the receiving end of Manaburn, but a naked wizard should never be able to drop a fully equipped cleric in one spell... ever.<br>
<br>
So the suggestion I've offered to them was as follows:<br>
<br>
&quot;Manaburn is the expenditure of all the wizards mental energies, this should take great meditation and no interruption to have a succesful release of the power on the intended target.  <br>
<br>
If a wizard is disrupted at all, meaning even hit for 1 damage... to remove the channeling component on the spell and cause it to interrupt.  There is no regaining conciousness on the spell Manaburn at all then, which would cause them to have a risk involved in casting the spell.<br>
<br>
Also, the wizard should also have time to focus their energies before beginning to cast the spell.  Thus needing to be &quot;standing still&quot; for a period of time to prepare for this massive burst of power.  The two hour timer still applies, and another possible addition to the spell is that IF it is interrupted at all, to NOT allow the button to pop back up... keep it disabled for 2 hours as their mental preparation is exhausted regardless if the spell landed or not.&quot;<br>

<br>
What I suggest for manaburn is to increase the cast time to something ridiculously large like 30 seconds.  And then make the recast a lot longer.  I'm actually quite surprised it is as fast as it is.  This won't any way stretch or form balance out the fuck ups they have already done to the pvp system.   But that would be an easy fix that is up verants ally.  Just change the cast/recast time in the database.<br>

The issue here isn't whether or not wizards are balanced vs. other classes in pvp.  It's clear they are not.  It's clear <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> casters</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in general aren't balanced, and everyone agrees to this.  But we're talking manaburn in specific - because it is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> over</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->-&quot;balanced&quot; in one direction.<br>
<br>
Mach:<br>
Changing the cast time isn't going to balance anything.  The only thing it'll change is only melees standing a chance against a one-shot kill nuke.  The spell could be two minutes long and I'd still run from a manaburn wizard because I'd lose (unless I feel like wasting 200pp in pumice, or whatever.) <br>
<br>
It would be a very easy fix, programatically, just to give a message that says &quot;this spell does not work against player targets.&quot;  Change the cast/recast times and bluebies are gonna bitch that it's an even more useless skill now, and VI isn't going to do anything to disappoint bluebies for the sake of pvp servers.<br>
<br>
There isn't a doubt in my mind that this is the answer to the manaburn problem (pve only).  It doesn't belong in pvp, and there's no way you're going to convince me that any variation of the spell belongs in pvp. <p>--<br><br>

<br>
Thus, you have 3k HP, you get manaburned for 5k, you have 1 hp left.<br>
<br>
Mob has 19k, 4 wizzies manaburn it for 5k each, it has 1 hp left.<br>
<br>
Both cases the wizzie at least needs to run up and hit it or have a partner.<br>
<br>
Alternate - replace manaburn with a LOH for mana, on a similar timer as LOH, and if you are cruel, make it usable on others so they can feel the necro's pain on raids.<br>
<br>
As for all those saying no one should have an insta kill means...  SKs with egg pumice or golem wands = 1 shot on most casters, who then hide while HT recharges.  Limit HT to also be unable to take that last HP (thought they would be in a better position than the wiz to inflict the last point in other ways (swords or spell or pet).<br>
<br>
Gating back to Nexus is now 1 sec via skill... much like DA, zone, plug.  Similar result.<br>
<br>
Still think Verant needs to add one step to their balancing equation before releasing stuff &quot;How will this effect PvP?&quot;<br>
<br>
Or just make MB NPC only and watch Trylun go back into hiding.<br>

Even if the amount of damage is reduced substantially you still have a death touch for at the very minimum casters and for all classes if that spell happens to do critical damage.<br>
That said I believe the only way to 'fix' this is to remove it from pvp and I doubt you could convince me otherwise.<br>
