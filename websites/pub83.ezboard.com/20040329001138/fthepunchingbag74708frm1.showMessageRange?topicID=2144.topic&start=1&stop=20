<br>
Have things changed at all?<br>
<br>
1) Did they fix defensive skills like evadeclsc, or evade-range<br>
2) Do we still do minimum damage after about level 60<br>
3) We ever get a helm to match our armor <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
4) How are the special attacks now?<br>
5) I think i read that the &quot;fist&quot; line finally does change our damage type, is that true?<br>
6) Is phys-init still worthless (i.e. the change is so small ya dont notice it)<br>
<br>
Whats the overall opinion of the MA? Are we still basically a back up doctor, who can buff a crit bonus, and then do subpar damage? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uiccusion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>iccusion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#660000>(10/22/02 3:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2144.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another Returning MA</span><hr size=1> Welcome back!  I think the OFFICIAL &quot;Patch From Hell&quot; was 12.6, btw.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Here are the answers to your questions, and it is almost entirely good news (from an MA perspective):<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Did they fix defensive skills like evadeclsc, or evade-range?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Mostly.  Evades <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> work, and they work even more effectively when you modify your settings with the agg/def bar.  Now you even get visible confirmation of evades with messages like <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Veteran Thug tried to hit you, but missed!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> each time you evade an attack, and vice versa.  Parry now works the same way.  The bad news is that many Mobs have ridiculous Evades and Parry skills that are WAAAAY out of line with their effective &quot;level&quot;.  (In other words, Mobs are incredibly uber compared to players of the same level.  This is supposedly to help make up for AO's utterly lacking AI.)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Do we still do minimum damage after about level 60&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Nope.  Thankfully, those days are long gone.  MAs got some serious lovin' from FunCom in patch 13.8/13.9 (IIRC), and when running our crit buffs we are now pretty much the profession with best damage over time...as the game designers have always claimed was &quot;the way it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be&quot;.  MAs can solo better than nearly any other profession (IMHO), and we are coveted in teams for our superior damage.  If you do come back, be prepared to tank when teaming (in other words, keep your evades and ACs up to date...).<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;We ever get a helm to match our armor?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->If you are talking about the decus armor which is very popular among MAs due to the Agil/Str requirements, then, Yes, there is a helm.  If you are talking about the Martial Artist Suit armor type, then, No, there is still no helm.  The MA Suit armor is, surprisingly, not really the best armor for MAs anyway (IMHO), with Flowers Tech and Decus armor being the most popular for Agil/Str types, and Obtru being the most popular for Opifex MAs using Agil/Sense armor types. But your own mileage may vary. (Many crusty old players may remember when Decus armor was SOCIAL armor only.  It is now &quot;regular armor&quot; and very common as a mission reward.)  Recent additions also include some really nice MA &quot;Organic Combat Suits&quot; for back armor (superior in many ways to the ever-popular Decus Armor Coats), and they come in a variety of colors, with each color adding a bit to different stats.  Finally, Servants of Eight MA armor pieces were also added recently, and they were supposed to be really nice MA equipment with skill bonuses for each piece, but they have some really dumb-ass level requirements which are WAY out of whack, rendering them pretty much useless (since by the time you meet the level req, you can wear MUCH MUCH better &quot;standard&quot; armor).  MA Organic Combat Suits and So8 armor are Boss Loot only.  (Bosses are found at the end of Team missions as well as in special outdoor camps.)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;How are the special attacks now?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Not all that different.  Due to the length of skill locks on most of them and their effectiveness, BwT is still pretty much the special of choice for PvM.  Shen still kicks ass in PvP, and Attack of the Snake and Bird of Prey are useful until you can start using BwT at around 30th level.  Flower of Life is STILL broken except for exactly Q60 and Q200, and nearly all good MA special attacks are now mission loot only (Yup, they took the good ones out of the shops).  I saw some slight changes in the test database for 14.6, but it mostly looked like they FINALLY got around to making each special's icon slightly different.  Didn't really see any major changes to the attacks themselves or the length of the skill locks.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I think i read that the &quot;fist&quot; line finally does change our damage type, is that true?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yes, but it's really not THAT big a deal.  It helps some in PvP if your opponent is especially vulnerable to a particular damage type, but in PvM it is mostly a wash.  Also, it makes any MA become a real &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, since you need to have and use the correct Power rings in order to add anything to your fist damage.  Wearing a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> +12 Ring of Power: Melee</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ring doesn't do anything for you if you are running Fists of the Lightning Crane, for example.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Is phys-init still worthless (i.e. the change is so small ya dont notice it)?&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Phys Init has never really been &quot;useless&quot;, just very misunderstood by most.  Inits are part of a very complex AO combat mechanism, and as such, are still not completely understood by even the serious game-mechanics-oriented players (myself included).  In short, however, MA fists are a 1.25s attack/1.25s recharge &quot;weapon&quot;, and since AO does not ever allow a weapon to strike faster than 1s/1s for attack/recharge, at about 150 Phys Init or so MAs &quot;top out&quot; at full speed when at 100% aggressive on their agg/def slider.  But although having, say...650 Phys Init will never let you hit faster than 1s/1s at full aggro, it DOES allow you to still hit at full speed at about 50% on the agg/def bar, which enhances the effectiveness of your green evade skills, and is thus a very good thing.  See lots of Init discussions in other posts for the full scoop.<br>
<br>
To summarize, MAs are no longer the back-up doc, and our standard crit buffs were too uber when cast on other professions (shotgun-toting support classes, anyone?), so they were nerfed to self-only. We were then given a much less-potent but still usefull series of crit-other buffs called the &quot;Mark of [x]&quot; line: &quot;Mark of Risk (+2%)&quot;, &quot;Mark of Danger (+4%)&quot;, and &quot;Mark of Peril (+7%)&quot;.  We still have all of our old crit nanos for ourselves.<br>
<br>
MAs are now coveted in teams due to our superior damage, and the added bonus of a heal now and then when things get hairy.<br>
<br>
I highly recommend anyone who USED to play an MA back in the days of MA ultra-gimpdom to check them out now.  We pretty much kick ass nowadays.<br>

That also got added in 13.8/13.9 I believe.<br>
<br>
An additional note: there have been some significant changes in MA Special Attacks of late.  I don't have time to go into them here, but Flower of Life now works for all quality levels (and is definitely a MUST HAVE), and BwT is still the special attack of choice for dmg/time.  When missioning and mowing through mobs quickly with a team, 'Snake and Bird' are both viable for shorter encounters.<br>
<br>
Also, Chronita has further expanded on her amazing inits research, and has demonstrated that MA attacks go from 1.25/1.25 to 1.45/1.45 (iirc) as your MA skill increases to 1000.  So the age old &quot;150 Phys Init is all you need at full agg&quot; should be modified slightly, since you really need closer to 300 if your MA skill is ~1000.<br>

Gotta have 'em now.  They use 1st Aid and Comp Lit, so usually Comp Lit is gonna be the limiting factor for most folks.<br>
<br>
They knock X seconds off of the various root/snare/mezz lines, and the amount of time they reduce goes up as Q level goes up, obviously.<br>
<br>
As for them hitting you with the damn roots/snares right before they die...yeah, that BLOWS.  I recommend you do what I usually do...open the fight with Brawl and continue to wail away...and then as the mob gets close to death (&lt;25% health) don't immediately hit brawl again when it refreshes...save it for when the bastard starts to cast that crap or once you think the brawl can take them out.  A lot of the time you can hit brawl and finish them before they get it off.  Works pretty well.<br>
<br>
And as mentioned, if you set the mission slider to full Physical (rather than mystical), you'll get mostly melee types and few casting mobs.  But the melee types typically hit a LOT harder, so keep that in mind. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Anyway, it was great to see some of the additions.  I noticed that there are now combat medical and nano clinics, which is really sweet.  I spent most of last night resetting a bunch of IPs and re-inserting all of my implants (left before the IP resets).<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what to make of the new armors.  I did notice that everyone on RK1 stopped listing prices with items, so I'm kinda clueless to how much armor is running now.  I feel kinda piddly with my 3.5 mill, the economy seemed pretty flooded when I left, so I'd hate to see it now...<br>
<br>
I've heard that there are new team crit increasers, but I haven't seen them in the stores that I've checked.  Anyone know where to find these?  Also, are the new special attacks (BoP, the snare removing one, flower of life) mission only now too?  Any other new MA nanos laying around somewhere I should know about? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And weapons.. are weapons/fists still a usable combo for MAs?  Flowers tech still the best stuff around at q130ish or so? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, been lookin for something cool to do, maybe AO is up to par and better than before.. thanks for any info you guys can give!<br>

Yes, FC has stopped screwing with proffession balancing for the most part. If you check the last <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/content/game/inproduction/live/" target="top">patch notes</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, the MA got a little tweak to crit damage, the halved crit chance in PvP has been removed for fist attacks, but not MA weapons.<br>
<br>
If the constant change bothers you, there have been and are still many game mechanics changes taking place.<br>
<br>
The shadowlands are going to be like a completely new game. Much of our current technology ceases to function there. Of course, you don't have to go to SL's if you don't want to, but I think it could really make us old timers to feel like we are getting a new game! Notum wars is neat, but not really all I thought it would be. They did seem to balance tower fighting though, I think. Outside buffs are much harder to get and keep now. Also, teaming does not change the Pvp level range you are allowed to attack. Hopefully making the battles a little less one sided just because one org/side has a bunch of L200 characters at the battle, who are actually way out of level range to participate fairly. I think this is a good change, though it does lower the probability of being able to defend your towers:/<br>
<br>
Also implants can now be made in excess of QL200, they are a bit hard to put together since you cant buy ANY of the components. The parts all must be <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aodb.info/search.asp?Search=True&amp;ItemName=refined&amp;ShowPage=1&amp;ShowClusters=True" target="top">Refined</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->. There are alot of neato new clusters out there though. Including but not limited to heal delta, nano regen delta, NCU, % damage Boosts, etc.<br>
<br>
There also may be some new armors you are interested in. There is <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aodb.info/search.asp?Search=True&amp;ItemName=armed+forces&amp;ShowPage=1" target="top">Omni-armed forces</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, if you are omni. <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://home.c2i.net/ellusion/armor_omniaf.html" target="top">Here's how ya get it.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->Then there's all the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aodb.info/search.asp?Search=True&amp;ItemName=azure+reveries&amp;ShowPage=1" target="top">Azure</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> stuff. /me drools<br>
<br>
Oh and for StorminSAO and anyone else who has recently come back and maybe lost some item from their inventory. FC now tracks and reimburses lost items if it can be proven. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/character/bio/d/1/name/viirruss">Viirruss</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
