I'm about to return to Rubi-Ka and have read most (if not all) posts here and many more elsewhere. It has been both entertaining and very usefull to me.<br>
<br>
BwT<br>
Can one still buy BwT in superior stores (sorry if this was answered elsewhere)?<br>
What's the lowest quality I can expect to find (I know this has been mentioned, but was unable to find it again) and what's the approximate req's for that?<br>
<br>
Pulling with bow<br>
Does any of you use low ql bows (with long range) to pull mobs one at a time in missions? Is this a good idea?<br>
<br>
Boosting Strength<br>
I noticed that Carrier Crafts are both cheap to buy and relativly easy to use (low req's), and they boost strength. A ql 50 Craft was reported to take 80 in vehicle ground and give a 50 boost to strength. Can one use theese to meet implant and armour req's? Implants are maybe the most interesting part, but impossible because the vehicle can't be used in shops...?<br>
<br>

It is all mission reward or dropped in missions. The lowest ql BWT is ql 50, so unless you are in a team that can do missions way above thier lvl don't expect to gt one until you are in your mid 30s or higher (assuming of course that you can do solo missions 15-20 lvls higher than your current lvl). Hope it helps.<br>

<br>
Bows...well, I like the idea of them, but they're not worth a damn in missions, at least for pulling. Up on top (the surface, for those of you physically grafted to Home), they have some utility. You can pull without getting proximity aggro from other stuff nearby. Just depends on what you like. They don't give any particular advantage, though. Handy in some situations, not so hot in others.<br>
<br>
Haven't seen a carrier craft in months. I don't think they're available anymore. Instead, I'd just score a few low level (ql10-16) Concrete Cushions. Two will give you +16 to STR and STA. Not bad, though they're sort of expensive to buy from other players. Worth the investment though, either in credits or twink playing time. <br>

<br>
If several mobs are in the same vicinity, that is, if they are close enough to one another, to detect whether or not one of their buddies has taken damage from a player (i.e. you), they will most likely &quot;add&quot;.  So if mobs are close together it makes no difference whether you stand right next to one and punch him or hit him with an arrow from long range... they will &quot;add&quot; and assist each other in each case.<br>
<br>
If your aim is to separate mobs close to one another, you have several options:<br>
<br>
1.) The best method I think is to carry a calmer (i.e. a crat, NT, or trader) in your backpocket and have them try to calm the mobs prior to the pull.  This also works great if you've pulled many... the calmer can mez the adds while you or your group concentrates on killing one.<br>
2.) This method is not as reliable but you will get better at it over time.  I call it the &quot;stick-and-move&quot; pull.  Basically it consists of finding that invisible line in the playing field that, when stepping over it, results in your grabbing the attention of only one of the several mobs nearby.  In order for this to work, you must remember that you cannot damage the mob that's aggroed on you until it is well out of sight of its friends... otherwise they will add.  This means removing your reflect bracers if you have any and/or running away from the mob (after aggroing) fast enough so that you don't automatically punch back in defense.  Remember this method requires a lot of caution in order to be effective.<br>
3.) My lastest method, and this is funnest (IMO), is using your handy-dandy MA-only fear nanos.  I'm currently using Presence of the Overlord and so far it works really well... when the nano lands and ends up fearing one or more of the mobs.  Usually what ends up happening is that only one of the several mobs will not be frightened while the others run off to lala land.  In effect, it separates mobs from one another when they are grouped together.  Just FYI, the mobs on which you landed fear (and caused to run away) will not remember that you feared them until you get close to where they end up.  This means that you can concentrate on the one that doesn't run away without being bothered by those pesky adds... and since the mobs run off in random directions when they run in fear, chances are when they do remember they're mad at you, they will not be next to any other of their other buddies that you'd feared previously; i.e. you usually *only* pull that one when drawing near.<br>
<br>
Anyway... just a little FYI on separating mobs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uaomadrid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AOmadrid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tiny Grasshoppah</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#660000>(9/4/02 8:05:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2121.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Using carrier craft for +str outside</span><hr size=1> There is actually a treatment labratory the is outside, in clondyke.

<br>
Reqs for Q55 BwT are 181 Brawl and 171 Parry.<br>
<br>
If you triple implant Parry (which doesn't conflict with anything else important for an MA except run speed), you can use the Q55 BwT very easily by 30th level (with Q50 implants).<br>
<br>
Getting that Q55 BwT, however, when you are only ~30th is now the tricky part.  My friends and I have discovered, however, that if you pull a team mission and BwT shows up as item reward #3 (for example), if the MA wanting the NODROP BwT item is in fact #3 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> on the mission owner's</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> team list, they have always gotten item #3.  We will often use ClickSaver to roll up a BwT mission, and then juggle the team so that the MA is on the mission owner's list in the same spot as BwT, and then accept the mission.  That approach hasn't failed yet.  (Please note that if YOU are the one pulling the missions, then the NODROP BwT item MUST appear as item #1, or you won't get it...you can't effectively shuffle teammates around when you are the mission owner, since you will always show up as #1 on your team list.)<br>

As long as you are of lvl to get a ql 55 mission, and have Clicksaver (it is a must when looking for a specific item), AND have 1 or more high lvl friends running it with you (Remember the good ole days of key dupers?) it shouldn't be a problem.)<br>
