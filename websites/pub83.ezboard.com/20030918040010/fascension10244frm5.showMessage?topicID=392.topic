Some of you know me as Kaminie Moonbeam, 65 enchanter, a few have known me since the beginning of EQ as Freiya Dragynflayme, wizard.  (I also have a 59 cleric, Kiizze,  who I 2 box with on occasions).<br>
<br>
I ask for feedback for two reasons; firstly, because I applied to AD previously and then withdrew my application to join Wudan, which I would understand if people were uncomfortable with.<br>
<br>
Secondly, whether any of the guild would have doubts about my loyalty as a guildmember because of my post about the situation at Wudan.  I maintained my loyalty even after I deguilded and was called some pretty horrible things. I have some friends at Wudan who I love dearly and the decision to post was difficult..  I explained to the guild before I deguilded that I felt loyalty to them and would have fought alongside of them in other sircumstances, but that I could  not fight for Shaggy and Jnr, and I did not believe in being in a guild and not fighting. I was 99% sure that Moehx and Kurleyx were those two.  My true friends were okay with it but others were not.  <br>
<br>
When it came to trashing Pinaduz, who is a good friend, I had to weigh up my feelings of loyalty, and the people I respect understood.  There may be some people in AD that don’t understand this  completely. I would like the oportunity to try to make it clearer if needed.  I am a very loyal guildmember and go out of my way to help in any way I can.<br>
<br>
The major problem I see as far as my application is that I live in Australia ….I don’t get on at night until about 3am EST and then there are only about 10-12 AD members on.    However I am a hardcore raider on the weekends, , holidays etc. when I run on EST time (from Friday morning 3am EST until Sunday morning 6am EST,  and Monday morning 6am EST when we have a public holiday here on our Mondays).  I am a reasonable  enchanter and I think an asset in raids , and given the oportunity I hope you would feel the same.<br>
<br>
I enjoy the challenge of high end raiding and being in a high end guild..  I loved being with AD for the short time I was with you, and everyone was friendly and kind and fun.<br>
<br>
I have fairly decent gear (I think) have all my spells except the ancient and have my character flags except Rallos Zek and MM(/sigh..  A few of your members spent time making sure that I had done all the right steps because MM was showing but a GM has since confirmed that my MM character flag is bugged but atm they can’t do anything about it.<br>
<br>
 I also have over 100 AA’s (50% extendeed buffs., run speed 3, project illusion etc.) and the required right click EB stuff, resists etc<br>
<br>
My history began at the beginning of time on Rallos Zek as a human wizard (Freiya) who was a co-founder and council member of Knights of Brightblade.  From there Freiya joined Wild Hunt, then a short stint in Fusion when 10 of us started Xex Xerxes, which became my family.  <br>
<br>
Xex were really short of enchanters. So I decided to level up my baby DE enchanter who had been 22 forever. Kaminie became my passion and I experienced her every chance that I wasn’t raiding, until I finally got her to 48 in Sebelis when I told the guild my wizard would be a jet only.<br>
<br>
People starting leaving Xex, including most of the other officers, for DAOC, and I joined PB for less than 2 weeks, when I realised quickly who was in it, and that they were not right for me.  Then followed some time in Seekers of Divinity (whom I still love dearly), but hardcore raiding is in my blood and when Xex Xerxes people came back to RZ, I rejoined them.  Alas, the call of Legends was too much for some, and once again, Xex Xerxes dwindled to a mere handful.<br>
<br>
Wudan followed, and I again experienced the thrill of difficult raids, and hardcore guild events.  The true friendships I made in Wudan I cherish, and I was sad to leave because of the circumstances.<br>
<br>
Why do I like playing an enchanter?   I get a real buzz out of helping people and buffing them and I love the adrenalin rush of crowd control..  New challenges and new zones excite me; I was the second enchanter in POS (/bow Alrec) where Elder Ornette (/hugs) taught me the way of the frog.  Doing tower bosses in BOT with one group was exhilerating, and the time there resulted in me being the first enchanter in Wudan to have VQ, C5, charm, etc..<br>
<br>
I know quite a few people in Ad already, and like and respect them, I hope those of you who don’t know me will ask whatever questions you need to to make a decision about me guesting with you, to see if if  I’m the type of person/character who would fit into your guild.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time<br>

She's a well seasoned hi-end raider, quite capable at mezzing multiple mobs, buffing, and doing whatever it is chanters do on raids.  Kami has been one of my regular XP partners, we've probably done over 100 aa's together just in POS alone - charmed frogs own.  <br>
<br>
Kami is trustworthy, loyal, and true.  She left Wudan on her own terms, believing in her principles of right and wrong, rather than defend Moe and Kurley, whom she was fairly certain were Shaggy and Shaggyjr.  She expressed her dissent, and rather than be a disruptive force she deguilded herself.  <br>
<br>
I remember countless hours Kami spent helping others, camping shards and emperor keys, long after she had hers.  Her dedication to the guild was selfless.<br>
<br>
Kami and I discussed her previous application (and withdrawal) from AD.  Some of her reasons for withdrawing were personal, but at the time she had not been on many hi-end raids.  In part I think she felt not that she was incapable, but rather wanted to take a slower approach and master her skills.  She joined Wudan and proved herself many times over.  I think in the end Kami was/is looking for a group of mature, hi-end raiders she can call friends and family.<br>
<br>
IMHO Kami is an asset to any group/guild in which she participates.  Her friendliness, wit, charm and maturity would allow her to fit nicely with the people I've met and grouped with from AD.  <br>
<br>
Just my humble opinion.

For the future in game and life: if you give your opinion on a topic, expect others to voice theirs as well.  It's not putting you down or &quot;bitching,&quot; I already said that I was not putting you down on that board and if you were offended I didn't intend it but you probably didn't see it since your access was cut off and I told you that before too.  Selective memory is a wonderful tool isn't it?  Anyhow, this is the last I will speak of this topic.<br>
<br>
I really hope you have fun Kam and stop worrying so much about people &quot;attacking&quot; you because we aren't, at least I'm not.<br>
<br>
I don't know you very well Xblade, but Pyro is a nice gnomer.  He's cool and he makes me laugh!  lolz. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> P<br>

<br>
There were a number of ppl in Wudan who I thought were my friends, including you, until I got incredibly nasty tells from some of Wudan, and time showed that my decision was right to deguild, especially seeing there were posts saying that some Wudan members didnt care if Moehx and Kurlleyx were who I said they were, they would fight to the end for them.<br>
<br>
Seems funny you said you would try to defend me when you were one of the people that bitched at me for not defending Shaggy etc.<br>
<br>
That sunk it for me because I could see that some of Wudan either were such new players that they didnt realise what scum they were, or simply didnt care about it.<br>
<br>
 I applied to AD because I think theyre mature, dont bitch, and know that this is a game to be enjoyed, and I know some people there who I respect a lot.<br>
<br>
Not saying anymore on the subject<br>
