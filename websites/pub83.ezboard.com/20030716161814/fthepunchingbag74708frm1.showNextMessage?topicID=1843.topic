<br>
However..in RL im a firefighter/paramedic for the past 6 years and 2 years before that on an ambulance. (hence why at age 30 i can have a lvl 176 MA lol..time off rules).<br>
<br>
What I want to say is this: as alot (not all) of the people who play mmrpgs are younger and emotions/hormones etc are crazy at a younger age...suicide is NEVER EVER EVER NEVER the answer. <br>
<br>
I can read the posts here..everyone seems stable lol.  Im not a psychologist by any means..but maybe you KNOW someone who isnt...maybe you are the kid who is shunned in school..know someone like that etc...<br>
<br>
DO something about it. please. make a new friend. help someone out. get away from the computer for a while. <br>
<br>
Its way way to final.<br>
<br>
There is nothing worse then the tones going off at the station..for a possible suicide. Getting to someones house and finding a 19 y/o male who hung himself in the garage. neck 6 inches longer, tongue black, pissed/shit himself, eyes bugged out.  <br>
<br>
Or going to a 13 y/o house who decided to use a gun to the roof of his mouth...its just like the movies...we have all seen &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;.  <br>
<br>
They are dead. they will never have kids, they will never go to another concert, they will never see how life plays out.<br>
<br>
The worst part is who finds them...its not the kids at school they are mad it..its the parents. The anguish I have seen on suicide calls is just insane. I actually cried at the hanging...seeing the Mom..who found her son in the garage with motorcycle tie downs around his neck.  <br>
<br>
Its the families who suffer. the friends. the people at school who didnt even know him/her.<br>
<br>
I have been an many suicides...and attempt suicides..and just cries for help. It is never the answer. EVER. <br>
<br>
ok..sorry about my post. but some things just hit home. <br>
<br>
now go have fun and drink a beer for god's sake lol.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uautumndawnfire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Autumn Dawnfire</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.melanierawn.com/images/bunnie.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Peking Duck</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#660000>(4/4/02 8:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1851.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suicide....by a person close to it...</span><hr size=1> Mad prob's from an ex'cop.<br>

If you can truely find nothing in this world that interests you, and you hate everything about being alive, then death is a pretty good way to go. <br>
<br>
Everyone dies sooner or later anyway. If you're not enjoying your life, might as well find out what happens afterwards. <br>
<br>
There are what? 6 billion humans crawling on the planet. A few less makes no difference at all.<br>

Just my opinion, as a chronically depressed person. I look forward to death, and everything until then is just killing time.<br>

<br>
It seems to me that you're saying someone who wants to die should stay alive just so others won't feel bad. Isn't that incredibly selfish of those people? If I hate life, if I know there's no hope for it ever getting any better, then why should I stay alive, just so a handful of people won't feel bad for a little while.<br>
<br>
It's like a band-aid. My death my cause some pain for a few people, but it passes. They get on with their lives. <br>
<br>
No matter what you do (in that situation) someone's going to be in pain. Either the people who care about you and are hurt by your death. Or you yourself are hurt by having to continue to live a life you don't want. <br>
<br>
the only difference is time scale. Their hurt is shortterm, yours is a lifetime.<br>
<br>
Again, just my opinion.<br>

You are perhaps the most self centered non aware person that I have ever met.   That or you are a teenager.<br>

<br>
The impact of a suicide is something that never truly go's away.  I don't know how else to describe it.  Perhaps if you save this thread and look back on it after you have grown you will understand.<br>
<br>
Some people..  never reach adulthood.  Even if they are 40 years old.<br>
<br>

The mark of an adult is understanding your place and live and the perception of the world on yourself.<br>

<br>
It's your life. Do use, or discard as you see fit. There is an unfortunate radius effect of your life (or death) on others, but at some point, you have to consider yourself first. <br>
<br>
It's no different than people who stay in loveless or abusive relationships because they feel an obligation to another (usually children of the relationship). The result of this is often more damageing to the people who were supposed to be 'spared' pain. <br>
<br>
Which do you think would hurt more, a sudden lose of someone you cared about; or a long, slow process of watching them suffer and grow more and more miserable?<br>
<br>
Sometimes, ifyou really care about someone, you have to let them go. Demanding they remain just so you don't have to feel bad is selfish, and cruel.<br>

(note, while im thinking of it: this thread needs to go into the misc category I'd say.)  I agree with the idea, but at the same time I disagree with suicide completely based on depression. Like I said, life isn't always pleasant, but I feel strongly that it can be enjoyable. I've been there emotionally, and have seen all of the people in my life that I call friends and loved one's go through their fair share of pain as well. I would go as far as to say I've saved a few people from suicidel. Self termination based on depression is a state of mind. It's a self-esteem implosion. It feeds upon itself. I consider it a disease, and cureable. If a person has lapsed into this state, I can only treat it as such, and try to repair them. It's their right to do it. It's my right to help them find an alternative.<br>
<br>
On a sidenote nature can be cruel. Not all organisms are fit to survive. This is the harsh reality we are given. This awareness keeps me strong when the pain borders on unbearible. I don't want to give in. I want to beat back the things that would kill me. I see life as a struggle, not a walk in the park gone awry. Civilization separates us so far from this reality, that I feel many are depressed simply because they have no awareness of this. It's like they see the world as lacking where it should be more instead of being greatful for what they have. They don't want to be burdened with choices. They don't even want to think. They just want it to stop. Every little pitfall is  like being in a deep hole, tied up, unable to move and suffocating once in this state. That's why I feel while it is their right to die, but it is also my obligation as their fellow human to help them out. Those who do make it out are often not only able to deal and be as happy as the next guy, but are sometimes even stronger for it. Not always. It's not a  Disney story where after the evil spell is broken they're fine, but I've seen it happen.  That's not selfish. That's helping a person become a fighter. That's an advanced stage of evolution if you ask me. <br>
<br>
 Life isn't a given. Finding even a semi-harmonious relationship with all of life's choices and ups and downs is not given. It requires maintenance. We do this maintenance through art, friendship, creativity, imagination, and exertion both mental and physical. We develop self-discipline. We develop tolerances. We maintain some level of hygene. We maintain some level of social position, within various heirarchies from friends, to games, to communities, to the economy...to where-ever others are concerned. We study. We eat the right foods. We wack off. We do whatever it is we need to do to live. We find whatever rythm.  It isn't however a gimme.<br>
<br>
As was said there are a zillion people and one less is more air for the rest of us. I'm fully fine with executing those who would shit in the worlds easter basket, and I'm also fine with those people offing themselves. It's those who are simply confused and miserable that I commiserate with, and will assist in surving. It's especially sad when kids kill themselves, but horrible when any once functional person falls into the aformentioned downward spiral. I don't think it's selfish necessarily to want them to be around, unless of course we're talking about forcing them to stay alive without offering them real help. Here johnny we're going to put you in this protective bubble, but not going to help beyond that. <br>
<br>
Sorry about the long post. Well, no I'm not. hehe. If you read it and didn't enjoy it, that was your choice. The key to helping yourself or someone out of suicidal straits is restoring one solid belief in them. There is one belief at the core of everyone, or so I believe. From this stem all other beliefs in a complicated matrix. Think of them as dots connected by lines, forming a web. If one fails, other that are attached cave in. This leads to confusion, frustration, and depression sometimes, and at other times exulatation.<br>

 Example one: Your spouse dumps you. You believed everything was fine. This belief was torn away. It left a hole. Eventually you reform your matrix with new beliefs to attach the one's that were stable to. It all meshes. You were just missing some serious information is all. The oberservable physiological and psychological symptoms are called names  depression, confusion, sluggishness, etc. People are actually looking for answers when staring off into space, or resting after a long period of doing this.<br>
<br>
example two: You believe that all matter and energy are interchangeable and one say you see a snail moving across a leaf and eurka...you invent the teleporter and lightspeed. Ok ok better example... You beleive your spouse is about to leave you, and suddenly you realize the guy you thought was dicking her is actually her gay friend Steve from work. The old belief gets ripped out and all of those sub beliefs re-attach to new beliefs based on new information and it all makes sense. <br>
<br>
(Then of course you later learn that he's not gay, she's a liar, and your a gullible fool, and you stare at the wall for three days)<br>
<br>
The impending suicidal person has lost the belief of all beliefs, i.e that being alive is a kick ass thing. From there the whole shithouse goes up in flames, because there's no way to re-allign the matrix. It gradually disentegrates, as the other  beliefs need something to support them or they die like leaves on a dead branch. Far enough along and you have a big hollow hole in the center of the matrix, and it just implodes. <br>
<br>
So anyway, I've got games to play. I'm off.<br>

The band was called Neglect.  Every single song they did, and I mean every single one, was about suicide.  This guy truly hated living.  This guy didnt just want to cry for help, he totally wanted to die.<br>
<br>
He wrote such memorable songs like &quot;From the Womb to the Tomb&quot; and &quot;Fuck Life&quot; and &quot;Hang in There&quot; which was a lovely little ballad about hanging yourself.  <br>
<br>
I lost touch with this guy when I moved out west, but I heard from some friends that he was finally successful and took his own life.<br>
<br>
In my darkest days, when I thought life wasnt worth living, I would listen to Neglect, and it would make me think about what killing myself would entail.  It forced me to look at that very final decision.  Listening to a band who sang about suicide in every song, didnt make me want to kill myself, it made me want to live.  It showed me that things may be tough, but its not worth throwing your life away for.  Things always get better.<br>
<br>
Now if I can listen to a band that openly preached about suicide as the only answer, in my darkest hours, then I can honestly say, its not the music, or the games, or anything else that drives someone to kill themselves, its the person.  If the person has it in them to kill themselves, then its not cause they played a game to long and lost some phat lewts, or anything else.  People kill themselves because the people in their lives didnt see the warning signs.  The fact that this guy lost himself in EQ is not what led him to kill himself.  Losing himself in EQ was but a symptom of the bigger problems this kid had.<br>
<br>
If this woman wants to sue anyone for her sons death, then she should march into her lawyers office and they should file a suit against herself.  She is the one who dropped the ball.  She is the one who missed all the warning signs.  She is the only person alive who can be blamed for her son killing himself.  Trouble is, this is America, where no one wants to take responsibility for anything.  Something bad happens in someones life, and people dont call counselors or priests first, they call lawyers.  Its pretty pathetic if you ask me.<br>
<br>
But hey, I stuck it out and Im glad I did.  Thanks Neglect! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=hidro>Hidro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#660000>(4/6/02 1:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1851.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> going off on a tangent here a lil but...</span><hr size=1> life sux for sum because they don't have sumthing they want or they can't get sumthing they want. And those desires will never end for alot of ppl and i guess sum try to find it in video games. Be happy wit what u have, know yourself, u have better then alot of ppl if u think about it. <br>
also, from a person who lost a close friend unexpectedly(not suicide tho), life means alot, and his death touvhed alot of ppl, lot more then what he thought....<br>
