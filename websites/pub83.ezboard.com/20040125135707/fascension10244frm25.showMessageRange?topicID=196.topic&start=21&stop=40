What, the way the US administration did in the 1980s- with men like Wolfowitz, Cheney and Rumsfeld in the Reagan cabinet?  These are the last people to lecture us on duplicitious evasion, they're experts in the practice.<br>
<br>
I'd also add:  Codswallop.  With that kind of reasoning there is no legitimate criticism possible of government policy in any field.  With that kind of reasoning speaking out against McCarthy in the 1950s was &quot;supporting the evil commies!&quot;.  Similarly, anyone who spoke out against government policy in the 1960s was supporting the agenda of civil rights demonstraters- I suppose anti-Vietnam war protesters were wrong to speak out too?  It's only a shame they didn't speak out sooner- a quarter of a million Americans and two million Vietnamese lives might have been spared.  If policies are blatantly wrong in their approach (sup pre-emption) and will encourage terrorist activity (a far bigger threat than rogue states)- then why on earth shouldn't I speak out against something that affects us all so profoundly?  <br>
<br>
What you're effectively saying is that either I'm with you or against you- sorry, but I don't buy that.  The world isn't divided into black and white, good and evil.  If I see a policy that threatens our security being put forward by the Bush administration, I will speak out against it.  If, in denying terrorist groups another reason to mobilize against us I'm seen by you as &quot;supporting Saddam&quot;- then that's something I'll gladly accept, erroneous and nonsensical as I find it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You may not want to, but you are making his case for him<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ha, that's hilarious.  By speaking out against a harmful policy that could well destroy the foundation of international consensus I'm somehow supporting a bloodthirsty dictator?  You'll have to explain that one to me...I don't follow your reasoning there at all.  <br>
<br>
If what you're trying to say is that the disarmament process is being delayed somewhat by Sadaam and that it's taking slightly longer than it should- then my question to you is:  so bloody what?  If the inspectors, the experts on the ground say they are able to continue their work relatively unhindered, then who the devil are we or our governments to question their opinion?  Sadaam isn't a threat- he's being deterred and contained by the overwhelming force the UK and US governments have deployed in the region.  Enough nuclear weapons to destroy the entirety of the Middle East ten times over is within easy striking distance.  Saddam's regime isn't a suicidal one- and inspections are working- so where is the case for war Kadandrum?  The answer is that there isn't one- the threat of force is producing results- not comprehensive results- but where's the almighty rush?<br>
<br>
The inspectors should have as much time as they feel they need to do their job properly.  If they come back to the UNSC and say- &quot;Sorry, we're unable to do our work, there isn't enough cooperation to proceed with disarmament&quot; in clear and uncertain terms- then I will support military action.  Until the diplomatic route has been exhausted Kadandrum, I don't see why anyone should.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>He's playing the UN showing that it truly is a worthless world government incapable of dealing with anything except minor regional conflicts<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Read my last post and then tell me again with a straight face that the UN is a &quot;worthless world government&quot;.  As for &quot;playing the UN&quot;- all countries are guilty of that- when Yemen decided not to back the US position in 1991, 70 million dollars was slashed off their aid budget.  Representatives from your government and mine are currently arm-twisting Angola, Pakistan and Cameroon to fall into line for the next resolution.  Fact remains- it is the only credible international institution that is perceived as impartial.  Despite its failings, it is the best forum for diplomacy in history, especially since the end of the Cold War.  And it is here that we and the US in particular need support to win the war on terror.  How do you think the next terrorist attack will be prevented Kad?  The only sure way you have is international cooperation amongst intelligence agencies, police forces, and the governments in charge of them.  And it's not going to be easy to get that cooperation from the people you need it from most if you ignore international institutions- I've said it before in all my posts, but people keep refusing to acknowledge it.  Ignoring a crucially relevant point like that doesn't make it any less true.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I find it simply amazing that a council of governments, elected by no one mind you and in turn not accountable to the electorate, with a myriad of interests that they are beholden to, can usurp the sovereignty of a country by giving a handful of socialist countries absolute veto power<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Good god, what drivel...where to begin.  How about by pointing out the obvious- most governments in the United Nations are elected and at the very least fully representative.  Even governments that are unelected need to be dealt with- if people only practiced diplomacy with nations they got along with, we'd be back to a hundred years ago with power blocs forever poised on the brink of war.  <br>
<br>
Also, the fact that 10 members of the security council are rotated rather than elected (at that nation's own choice mind you)- doesn't detract one bit from their effectiveness.  Electoral systems often have far less credibility for me than appointed positions.  Case in point- how much credibility do you think a lot of your fellow citizens had in the electoral college system after the last presidential election Kad?  The man with the most votes lost- and the final run-off was farcically decided by the brother of one of the candidates- surely a conflict of interest.  My point is simple- a Supreme Court Justice in the US or a Chief Justice in this country are NOT elected...but I would trust the institution they stand for far more than the one Bush stands for, given the way the election was conducted vis a vis the appointment.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;myriad of interests&quot;- I should bloody well hope so- a single dictatorial position is far less preferable surely.  If you love freedom and democracy- the clash of ideals in a civilized atmosphere- you can't help but believe in the UN.  The US is *part* of the UN Kad- you can't talk about them as seperate entities.  In fact, the US is the most powerful member of the UN, a co-founder and a signatory to its charter and declaration of human rights.  As a key member of the UN- the Bush administration needs to engage with it, not dictate policy to it. <br>
<br>
Now to something you said that offends me- a handful of socialist countries given veto power?  First off- what the devil are you talking about?  The UNSC and the UN itself were formed by these 5 countries, the victors after WWII- no one *gave* them veto power, they agreed by consensus that they themselves should have it.  Next, you rubbish the UK and France as &quot;socialist countries&quot;.  Sorry to spoil the party, but I'm actually quite glad I live in a country that's pursued socialism as a cornerstone of public spending.  My children no matter the size of their wallets or social background will have guaranteed education up to and including university, health care, social services and public transport of a high standard- <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>free at the point of delivery</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Doctors instead of insurance companies in charge of my health, considerbly less judgement of a person's worth as defined by their income and greater social justice for the poor and disadvantaged.  If the price of pursuing that system is slightly less competitive business, then I'll take that instead of WorldCom/Enron thank you very much.  <br>
<br>
I'd rather my tax money was spent on those things rather than defence to be perfectly honest.  Since the end of World War II America have spent 19 trillion dollars on what they call “defense”.  Which they spell differently.  And define very differently!  If you were to spend $26m every day since the birth of Christ, you would have spent less than the Americans have spent on defence since the end of the Second World war.  If you were to spend a tenth of a penny for every one of those defence dollars- that would have fed and clothed the world's starving in the same time period fifty times over.  At a time when the world economy is faltering and the spectre of terrorism threatens us all- from Bali to Baltimore and London to Lucknow- why is this costly and detrimental war being pursued by the Bush administration.  A fraction of that cost spent on intelligence and police resources would be better spent- a fraction of that spent building a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>willing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> international coalition to fight terrorism would make us all safer.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why should a country scede their sovereignty to the UN? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
A very important and pertinent question for any nation- it has just as important and significant an answer.  First of all, because it's a good idea, it makes sense.  Why does the US sign environmental concessions to reduce pollution (except Kyoto, but a lot have been signed)?  Because it secures a better planet for future generations.  Every time a country commits itself to a treaty it surrenders its sovreignity- for something it believes in.<br>
<br>
You indirectly pose the question- what good is the UN and what do we get out of it?  Credibility, trust and a platform for peace is the answer.  Credibility- individual nations lack it desperately.  Bush and Blair will *never* solve the Israel-Palestine conflict on their own, their present policy is unconditional support for one of the two sides.  They just don't have the credibility to solve that crisis- Israel is in violation of 64 UNSC resolutions, *all* telling it to pull back to pre-1967 borders.  Until that issue is satisfactorily resolved, none of us are safe from the threat of terror, and without that international credibility we will never have that.  <br>
<br>
Next:  Trust.  There is deep distrust of individual nations meddling in other countrys' affairs.  From colonial states carving up the cake of Africa and drawing lines in the sand in the Middle East- to US and USSR willingness to set up surrogate states facing each other- individual nations cannot possibly be trusted to do the right thing.  The UN brings multilateral credibility to a solution- and a willingness to see it from both sides, more or less free of the confines of a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>single</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> nation's interests.  It is a forum for cooperation that has accomplished great things- and it is the only platform we have to build consensus and fight terrorism with.<br>
<br>
Lastly- it's a platform for peace.  Without a forum to discuss and resolve issues before they flame up into conflict, the world fought bloody and terrible wars.  From the Napoleonic wars, to the Crimean war to two world wars, costing millions of lives- nations drew an important lesson.  That if there was an institution set up designed to tackle disputes and resolve them before the bullets started flying, lives could be saved and conflicts avoided.  Without the UN we'd see a war a week and a world war a decade.  Deterrence, containment and aggressive diplomacy are its teeth- with force to be used as a last resort.  These three measures of containment, deterrence and diplomacy are producing results.  Force can <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>always</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be used at some stage in the future.  Diplomatic positions and stances can be reversed in the blink of an eye- but you can't put the use of force genie back into the proverbial bottle.  <br>
<br>
And that is why the US and other countries <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>did</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> cede a portion of their sovreignity by signing the UN charter.  It is also why any military action should be in accordance with international law.  The US/UK administrations have permanent members seats and are making the case for war to 13 other nations.  Now if there is a case for war, they'll win the argument, pass a resolution and we go to war.  If people aren't convinced, and say the experts should decide for themselves when they can't continue their work, then that's what should be done, simple as that.  <br>
<br>
Read my last posts carefully Kadandrum- call it dissent if you will- but actually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>read it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Simply telling me I'm a dissenter accomplishes nothing, it's name-calling.  Dissenter, pacifist hippie, art poufta, anarchist- they're just names and stereotypes- I'm none of those things in position.  If you think there's a case for war instead of containment- let's hear it.  I've certainly heard nothing from my government or the US government that makes the case- if anyone thinks they can do better I'm all ears.  We all want to feel safer after 11/9- attacking Saddam isn't the way to do it- if anyone thinks I'm wrong on that, let's hear why.  Saying I shouldn't be speaking my mind isn't debate, it's a dismissal of the issues raised.  Exactly how wise is it to dismiss these arguments when pursuit of this policy would bring about disastrous consequences?<br>

<br>
&quot;As the intra-western war continues, his prediction may yet come true.  'No doubt, time is working for us,' Saddam told the Egyptian weekly al-Usbou in November.  'We have to buy some more time, and the American-British coalition will disintegrate.'&quot;<br>
<br>
Hussein is counting on the very principles of a free society to preserve his regime.  I do not know how much clearly I can make the point that dissenters, with intention or not, are helping to preserve Hussein's regime.  In fact, he is counting on YOU to help delay military action.<br>
<br>
But that is the way of our society and our rules.  So be it.  I just wish people would see the consequences of their words.  But isn't that what dissenters want after all?  A peaceful solution?  Right, thanks for allying with the enemy.<br>

The US can NEVER be Switzerland. Switzerland is a tiny European country the size of Iowa which does not nor ever has the people and the resources to be a military power.  The best recourse for a small European country (which can get slapped around by anyone) which happens to be smack in the middle of where WW 1 and 2 exploded geographically is to stay neutral if it is let to do so.  They were smart enough to find a way to do so.<br>
<br>
ON the other hand the US is not small and thus can claim and has claimed a strong position in world politics.<br>
<br>
The US should have let the Europeans handle WW 1 and 2 cause it was a European war??   Japan and the Soviet Union which are two major participants in these wars are not very European countries...<br>
<br>
The US simply cannot even if it wanted to be isolated from the world policies, since its a dominant power in the world. <br>
<br>
Trust me bilions around the world would cheer if the US declared that it would stop getting itself involved in external political issues with military power.  Champagne would be flowing and people would be dancing on the streets of most international cities...that however will not happen.<br>
<br>
The US is the 1st power among powers and the only way to be that is by BEING actively involved in all that happens in the world and making it its business.<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
How about we start by being absolutely *clear* about the source of this dispute.  The point of dispute is to do with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Weapons of Mass Destruction or WMD</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  The issue is NOT about whether Saddam's regime is preserved or not.  Let's be absolutely clear about this- there are lots and lots of unsavoury regimes in the world- going around toppling heads of state is not practical, realistic and will create far more problems than it solves.  Say, the possible collapse of international law and a whole list of treaties connected with the UN charter?  It's also a policy of pre-emption founded on fears, suspicions and possible threats.  Rather than good intelligence of clear and imminent threats- you have superpowers acting as judge jury and executioner with insufficient information.  I can think of no better way to destroy the world order and throw the door wide open for terrorists.<br>
<br>
The sensible alternative is to engage these regimes and soften their approach with diplomacy rather than threats. This approach is working in China, Myanmar, Russia and other repressive states- it takes time, patience and adherence.  Not a quick in-out and left out to dry a la Afghanistan.  It's vital that if military action ultimately proves necessary that there are plans to reconstruct the shattered infrastructure. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I do not know how much clearly I can make the point that dissenters, with intention or not, are helping to preserve Hussein's regime &lt;snip&gt; ...But that is the way of our society and our rules. So be it. I just wish people would see the consequences of their words<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Oh I see- my posting on this messageboard helps preserve his regime.  You're saying I take it, that Saddam might be cynically exploiting my altruistic arguments by reading this message board and pandering to key nations' representatives opposing this war.  Who also read this message board, amazing!  Hey Saddam- if you're reading this board- cooperate 100% k?  Not 60 or 70%, that last 30% seems to be awfully important for some reason.  Oh, and if any other amazingly important diplomats are reading this- I'm sure you all know Saddam is an evil repressive dictator, but that dealing diplomatically with him saves lives and effects peaceful change.<br>
<br>
Returning to the real world for a moment, why is anyone who favours a peaceful path to disarmament a &quot;dissenter&quot;?  As I said, name-calling gets us nowhere.  On the other hand,  people with the moral character to advocate force as a last resort- if by labeling them &quot;dissenters&quot; you salve your consience re:  the innocents inevitably killed in a war you advocate, then feel free.  In a civilised exchange of views there should be no need to label people as &quot;warmongers&quot;, &quot;hippies&quot; or &quot;dissenters&quot;.  The term itself is completely subjective- if I wanted to apply it to you dissenting from a peaceful path to disarmament (what most of the world wants)- then I could.  However, I choose not to, it adds nothing to the debate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In fact, he is counting on YOU to help delay military action.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why do I feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall here?  Let me be blunt:  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Military action should not be our primary goal- our goal should be to avoid it and disarm peacefully</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Yes that's right- military action as a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>last</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> resort instead of shooting first and asking questions later- what a novel concept that is!  I want peaceful disarmament, and so does any sane individual on the planet.  I don't care how long it takes- there's no flaming rush is there?  Saddam is being contained, he's a rabid dog in a bloody effective cage of military hardware and personnel.  He has 0 airspace, electronic surveillance painting his country like a christmas tree and inspectors patrolling his factories- <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>there is no imminent danger</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.   <br>
<br>
As long as Blix and El Baradei, the experts on the ground with the relevant information at their fingertips- as long as they believe peaceful disarmament is possible and achievable then that's what we ought to do.  I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times- if they come back and say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;We can't do our job any more&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> then I'll back military action.  If that were to happen then the peaceful route will have been exhausted, and the war can go ahead in all its glory, collateral damage *cough* I mean civilian casualties and all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But isn't that what dissenters want after all? A peaceful solution? Right, thanks for allying with the enemy<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
A peaceful road to disarmament is allying with the enemy?  I'm nearly speechless to be honest, don't know whether to laugh or cry.  You seem to think that war is the beginning and the end of the solution- nay- the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>only</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> solution to this crisis, you make peaceful solutions sound like failure.  If peace is your true enemy Kad, then I can only pity you.  <br>

I'll tell you why.  Sadamm is playing a game of international chicken where, if he can show partial compliance (destroying six (!) al-Samoun missiles in one day? WTF is that?  There are hundreds of them and it takes a whole day to destroy six?) he buys time.  And time works in your favor when a force of several thousand are sitting at your door step and in a matter of weeks the temperature, where these forces are located, will reach 120 degrees.  In fact, anything that anyone can do to prolong military action works in the dictator's favor.  Do you see the connection between protestors (I'll stop using the term &quot;dissent&quot; since it clearly takes away from our little discussion) and buying time?  May I remind you of the quote above from Sadamm saying time works in his favor and further saying that in time the US/UK coalition will disintegrate?  Can you see the similarity between his quote and yours saying &quot;I don't care how long it takes.&quot;  You, my dear online friend, are playing the enemy's hand.<br>

Saddam's pretty low on the list of threats the US. Hell I think Bush's a bigger threat. He's used his war on terror to give the government the authority to strip american citizens of their rights without trial by jury. Hell, its now legal for CIA operatives working overseas to murder US citizens suspected of terrorist involvement. Suspected, not proven.<br>
<br>
If you absolutely have to see it terms of supporting some annoying foriegn dictator who may deal with disidents in his own country brutally, or our national officials who day by day attack the freedoms our country claims to represent and the very laws our constitution sets forth... well sorry self interest wins there. <br>

Sorry, the vein of your last post lead me to believe that you didn't believe in the idea of peaceful disarmament.  Simple misunderstanding, my apologies.<br>

I put the question again- what does it matter how long disarmament takes as long as it is peaceful?  We both acknowledge and accept that he is being effectively contained and deterred- in his present situation there is no possible circumstance in which he could pose a threat.  So the issue of time is a moot one, for this and other reasons.  Give the inspectors as much time as they want while they feel they can do their job- it's not as if Saddam is going anywhere.<br>
<br>

Heh, I find it interesting that experts have made a lot out of the temperature rise.  Although it bears pointing out- it wasn't as if the 8th Army, Desert Rats and Rommel's Afrikakorps took a summer holiday when the temperatures rocketed in 1942.  Personally, I don't believe it'll be a huge issue- our respective forces will operate at night I think Kad, when the already vast technological edge we have will become insurmountable.  I don't care how well-trained the Republican guard are, lacking basic and essential modern equipment to fight at night will cripple them terribly.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>fact, anything that anyone can do to prolong military action works in the dictator's favor<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again you say the &quot;dictator's favour&quot;.  And again, I respectfully point out that the type of government Iraq has is irrelevant to the issue we're discussing, which is how to best disarm Iraq.  Whether he's a dictator or not is ultimately immaterial- the stated goal is disarmament not regime change.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>May I remind you of the quote above from Sadamm saying time works in his favor and further saying that in time the US/UK coalition will disintegrate?

No I don't see how it does actually- he may say time works in his favour...that couldn't be further from the truth.  He may put on a brave face in public, but deep down, in his heart of hearts he knows that how long the process of peaceful disarmament lasts will have NO bearing on the final result.  His weapons arsenal is doomed Kad, no matter how long he delays, as long as the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>threat</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of force is imminent he will disarm.  In bits and pieces, perhaps.  Over months rather than weeks, probably.  <br>
<br>
It really does not matter how long it takes, as long as it gets done, and peacefully if possible.  I am saying I don't care how long it takes- Saddam says (erroneously) that time works in his favour.  It clearly doesn't work in his favour in any way for a start, and we're saying two completely different things.  Look carefully at what I said and then consider the game Saddam is playing- his goal is to divide us, how easily you misunderstood the gist of what I said is testament to that success.  We both want the same thing Kad, you just seem to feel for some reason that it has to be resolved tomorrow.  I don't see why we're in a rush at all- there's no deadline of any kind constraining the peaceful route.  ALL that matters is whether the inspectors feel they can continue their work.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You, my dear online friend, are playing the enemy's hand.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Nothing could be further from the truth- his hand holds out the hope that he'll keep his WMD, giving the inspectors more time will not achieve that.  If anything, giving the inspectors more time is more likely, as time goes by to turn Arab opinion against him if he's seen to be resisting the peaceful route this time around.  Kuwait and a number of other arab nations called on him to step down this week- keep the diplomatic pressure up and we might even force him from power without a shot being fired.  Arab opinion is hugely against a war of aggression- if he can be forced from power with that opinion onside, then much disaster could be avoided.  Disarmament is a matter of time- the judge of how much time is needed is not yours, or mine, or President Bush's, nor is it prime minister Blair's.  It's Blix and El-Baradei who should make that decision, independent of any military plans.  That is the only sensible way to proceed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>PS For God's sake don't patronize me with the &quot;Hey Sadam if you're reading this board&quot; bullshit.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The point was to illustrate that posting my opinion on this board has no effect on how people perceive Saddam's tactics.  He is playing for more time, everyone knows that, everyone can see that.  It'll all be for nothing in the end, one way or another.  No politician of importance would read what I posted, and even if they did, they wouldn't change their minds.  It was intended to be facetious, I apologize if it offended <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   As for my posts being too long, no one's forcing anyone to read them, truncation isn't my style.<br>
<br>
The fact remains- you fail to convince me how listening to the inspectors, the experts on the ground, and allowing them the time they've requested is in any way bad.  Disarmament will happen peacefully given time- if they the experts don't feel that at any stage, the military option can always be exercised.  The reverse isn't true at all. When war is declared there's no going back, that option will have to be carried to the end, with all the consequences it entails.  Think about that, all of you.<br>

<br>
Yes, I believe Turkey's legally elected parliament voted slightly in favor but not enough for the proposition to go through. You shouldn't be worried though, since the country's military has great influence in the workings of Turkey, and will likely 'advice' the MPs better on which button to press in the re-vote. <br>
<br>
I find it quite ironical that the US seems to face most resistance from the countries with democratic systems, and is quite vocal to complain when their leaders act according to public's wishes. That's democracy in action. You know, the one US declares to be spreading everywhere it can. Only, the problem with democracy is that sometimes it can produce unexpected or unwanted results. Dictatorships are usually much more reliable, one way or another. Might that be why most of the US allies in the Middle-East and Asia are 'friendly dictatorships'? <br>
<br>
I would take the claims of US working for the good of the common Iraqi much more seriously if they were a bit more consistent in their rush to democratize and liberate. I don't see much liberating going on in the poorer parts of Africa, even though things are really nasty in there. In this case, it might be a side product that the surviving Iraqis lead a happier life but then again, probably not. Make no mistake, the upcoming war has nothing to do with welfare of the Iraqi people, nor US homeland security, it's purely a move to secure power in the region, not much unlike what Iraq did to Kuwait back in the 90s. Current plans outline a US military government for Iraq until someone more suitable (read puppet) can be found to govern Iraq. Friendly dictatorship incoming? Even though I'm aware that in the current torrent of propaganda from the US it's near impossible to separate facts from fiction, too many things seem a little out of the picture here.<br>
<br>
Regarding the UN, it saddens me that even people I know to be highly sensible see the UN as some kind of bureaucratic monster where everyone tries to gobble as much benefit as they can. Of course there's part of truth in that but I'd like to see it as a compromise machine, which in my opinion is preferable to the alternative, which would likely be some kind of strong-arm politics. If you want to see where <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>machtpolitik</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> leads, see Europe in the first half of the 20th century. That's why I resent the emerging hard-line trend in the US which might be caricaturized as &quot;We do what we want, and you'd better be with us, because if you don't we'll do it to you next.&quot; Future will tell how this will turn out, but with an attitude like that, the US will be picking it's future allies from a scarce supply.<br>

In 1930, the Hoover administration passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff act which was the most protectionist isolationist legislation in US History, causing an international trade war.  Problem here, is that agricultural products, wines, beverages, wool, cloth, consumable goods and commodities were affected.  Automobiles that require 800 imported parts were affected.  60,000 people employed in US plants making cheap clothing out of imported wool went jobless.  If foreigners cannot sell their goods in the US, then they cannot earn the dollars they need to buy US exports.  People lose jobs, and new jobs are not reappearing.  This makes the recession turn into a depression.  So yes, I think a US isolationist policy is bad.<br>

Weapons of Mass Destruction or WMD<br>
Does anyone deny that Saddem used biological and chemical weapons in the iran/iraq war?  Against the Kurdish population in Northern Iraq?  <br>
<br>
Where in the world did all those chemical/biologicaly weapons suddenly disappear to?  Yes, UNSCOM was able to destroy lots of Saddem's arsenal.  But Iraq failed to completely comply with the UN 100% without playing games.  We were not asking asking Iraq for 50% or 75% cooperation.  But 100%, pure and simple.  And the regime led by Saddem is based to fear and terror.  If you so much as look at Saddem wrong, you get a beating along with your whole family.  Saddem won the last election with a 99% or 100% majority.  Do you know how @#$# silly and ridiculous that sounds?  Just think about it.  Human beings by nature do not vote 99% or 100% on anything if they are free and allowed choices.  Who wants pizza or tofu?  Who likes red or orange?  Who likes EQ or pac-man?  Who want to join LV or AD for free?  There will always be a dissenter, that's what's so great about America.<br>

I love how you seem to characterize &quot;Middle East opinion&quot; as one giant clump of opinion.  There are lots of countries in the region, a great diversity of opinion- they aren't mindless automotons all possessed of the same opinion.  Your talk of a &quot;silent majority&quot; is ludicrous and unproveable- it'd be like my saying there is a huge &quot;silent majority&quot; in the US that say, wants less icing on their donuts.  The fact that a few people demonstrate in the streets is no indication of anything significant.  <br>
<br>
To be frank, I'd probably protest too if the US unilaterally supported Israel and propped up surrogate undemocratic states in the region.  If I was a poor Saudi citizen, living in an oil-rich country governed by sheikhs given red-carpet treatment by the US in exchange for oil while I starved...I'd probably be pissed off too.  The reason Iranians consider the US as &quot;The Great Satan&quot; is because of the farcical and violent regime change the US brought about there- sup the Shah of Iran?   <br>
<br>
Wouldn't you be peeved if another nation replaced your government with a puppet that served their interests?  Besides, saying that a minority of Arab opinion hating the US is a good reason to invade Iraq is utterly absurd.  Those opinions need to be won over with even-handed policy in the region- it's crucial if we want to win the war on terror.  You think invading an Arab state with the full knowledge there will be civilian casualties helps these people to like the US more?  Please.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/04/14/me101.tuchman.1967/">www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/me...hman.1967/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Yes that's right- it was Israel that launched the war!  They launched pre-emptive strikes on Egypt and the other nations surrounding them.  The end result was that Israel to this day controls East Jerusalem, the rest of the West bank (which belongs to Jordan)- the Gaza strip (which belongs to Egypt), and the Golan Heights(belonging to Syria).  <br>
<br>
As for your farcical talk of l00ts...try to take this seriously for a moment?  This isn't a game we're talking about- it's open defiance of UN resolutions and international law.  Israel is in far more serious breach of UN resolutions in its occupation of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>another</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> state's lands several times over.  Saddam invades a single Arab neighbour Kuwait- a coalition is formed to throw him out.  Israel invades and occupies territory of every single one of its neighbours- they're given 2 billion dollars of aid a year.  Saddam violates 17 UN resolutions on disarmament- he's being put under scrutiny and will likely be invaded.  Israel keeps nuclear arms and has violated 68 UN resolutions and 8 protocols of nuclear arms treaties and can do no wrong in America's eyes.  See what Arab opinion means when they refer to double standards?  Until we stop propping up one side of the issue there will never be peace in the Middle East, we'll never win over Arab opinion and thus will not defeat terrorism.  <br>

Read what Senator Byrd said- then ask yourself who you should be blaming for these weapons lurker.  You're talking about suspicion, and a lot of maybes- Maybe he has the materials still, maybe they're in a useable state, maybe there's a delivery system that's workable.

In spite of all this, he is being contained and deterred with a huge military contingent and nuclear weapons.  Saddam will never use these weapons even if he had them- he wants to survive.

<br>
To address your last point- I stress again, what kind of government Iraq has is not the issue at all.  The issue is WMD and disarmament, there is no mandate under the UN to remove governments at will and replace it with a puppet government friendly to the agent of change.  And I'm bloody glad we don't live in a world where that sort of behaviour is acceptable anymore.<br>

If you even looked at the link properly you would of seen &quot;The Arab Invations of 1948.&quot;  On the day that Israel declared its independence, the Arab League Secretary, General Azzam Pasha declared &quot;jihad&quot; he said, &quot;This will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades&quot;.  The Arabs then proceeded to attack Israel from all sides.<br>

As website CLEARLY said the following if you looked at the 1967 link, &quot;On June 5th, Israel decided to launch a pre-emptive attack on Egypt.&quot;  <br>

And let's not forget the 1973 attack by Egyptian and Syria.  Are you gonna say that didn't happen?<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.jajz-ed.org.il/100/maps/egypt.html">www.jajz-ed.org.il/100/maps/egypt.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
So check yourself, mullet muppet master.  Your strings and mullet have been cut.<br>
<br>
Even your own CNN link stated the following,<br>
&quot;In June 1967, Egypt, Syria and Jordan massed their troops on Israel's borders in preparation for an all-out attack.  Israel launched a pre-emptive strike on June 5, targeting Arab air fields and destroying the Egyptian air force on the ground.&quot;<br>
<br>
If I'm Israel and I'm about to get gang-banged by several Middle East countries, you better believe I'm coming out first, swinging all fists-fulla-fury.  I'm not gonna lay down to hi-ho-hitler like germany did to france and expect some other country to bail me out.<br>
<br>
And stop with the 1967 already.  There are 3 dates, 1948, 1967, 1973.  Israel gets jumped in 1948, in 1967 they strike first at troops amassing on it's borders, and in 173 they get jumped again.  The Middle East countries aren't no peace loving doves here gents.  But brutes who declared a jihad against Israel to run it into the sea.  And you know who the biggest loser is here?  The Palestinians.  The Palestinians got played by the Middle East.  A people scattered across the Middle East reduced to being refugees in ghetto camps in <br>
countries of their fellow breathen.  1967 is gone and past.  Israel won the war, now deal with it.  Israel needs it's security guaranteed.  Left unprotected with false promises of non-agression just isn't gonna work as 1948, 1967, and 1973 clearly demonstrate.<br>

I don't deny the US backed Iraq in the Iraq/Iran conflict.  I don't deny the US probably trained terrorists in the Soviet vs Afghanistan conflict.  I don't deny the US has a very shady history when dealing in the affairs of the Middle East.  Heck, the US might even still have a Phoenix Program per Vietnam still in effect.  <br>
<br>
The point is, the US does what it has to do to keep America safe.  When it makes a mess, as Iraq might be, then sometimes we go in and clean it up.  The time table is ours.  America's leaders are human.  They make mistakes.  We <br>
try and learn from them and move on.  If your going to hold America accountable for every nasty thing it did, look to Europe first. They had a pretty fooked up history when they were the reigning superpowers.<br>

Few things, one US only lost around 50000-60000 troops in Vietnam (still too much in my opinion) but thats another war that let politics get in the way of doing things right. (see the end of Desert Storm as another example of letting politics get in the way of doing things right)<br>
<br>
The only thing i see from your posts is a lot of opininion that may or may not be right.  If 10+ years isnt enough time to comply with destruction of WMD's and NBC's then i personally do not know what is.<br>
<br>
Im neither saying it is right or wrong at this point if we go into Iraq.  My personnal views on the matter desire a swift disarmement of Iraq.  I would LOVE to see Saddam say &quot;OK guys, im sorry, lets take care of this stuff and get Iraq back in the swing of things&quot;.  I personally do not see that happening unfortunately.  Saddam has been using Iraq as his personal playground for many many years.  Hell, if he would just do as the UN said and disarm and stop killing off his own people i think Iraq could definitely do some good in the region.  If not for our children and the good of Iraq as a whole then what else?<br>
<br>
I sincerely hope that we as a nation do not go into Iraq.  I will go and do my duty if required because i believe in the oath i took many many years ago.  I am one of the few that didnt come in the military for stability or education or any of the other myriad benefits offered.  I came in simply because i believe in what our nation stands for.<br>
<br>
NOW, that being said, i will restate that i hope if we do go in that we have a plan for Iraq, going in without a plan is stupid.  What i mean by plan is something that benefits the Iraqi people as a whole - religously, culturally(sp?) etc.  See my first post regarding this a bit more.<br>
<br>
As for ignoring Korea, i dont believe that is true either.  Having served over there I've seen first hand how prepared we are and i dont believe we are ignoring the threat N. Korea poses.<br>
<br>
Anyway, i appear to be rambling yet again and theres so much to read about and i doubt anything i as a fighting american can do to change your minds that its probably pointless.  All i ask is that you reach your opinions OBJECTIVELY by reading different viewpoints out there.  Dont just look for ammo to spearhead your own agenda or argument.  I find that there are great points for both sides of the coin.  Its finding that small point in the middle that makes everyone content thats the hard part.<br>
