<br>
Well I'm a 60 wood elf bard I have 6aas at this point in time, working on more. My gear is pretty much low qual but i can get enough resists to meet requirements (gotta love BD gear). Still don't have an insta clicky item but shouldn't be a problem picking one up asap. As far as my epic goes (big thing for a bard, and thank you Vansessalynne and sliv for all your hard work on my epic.) I gotta keel the big Trak Monster... then i'll be done =). <br>
<br>
I started this char about 4 months ago or so on RZ after playing on Morell Thule for like 2 years. My chars on Morell were all mid level, not sure if you want me to list them so i'll pass on that =). Anyhow, I started this guy on Rallos and leveled like a mofo so i could experience the high end game. I got interested in AD when my brother (Aurron, some of you know him) and i became friends with Lelu, Vanessalynne, and Slivur. I would really love to join you guys and see if i can get to know you all. I might not be the best bard but i try really freaking hard.. guess you guys can make that call =P.<br>
<br>
K, thats about it... Any of you guys got questions or something I forgot to cover (GOD FORBID!!, ok i prolly forgot something) just post it and i'll be happy to reply.<br>
<br>
ohh yah as for sponsors i know i got slivur... think lelu is inactive at the time and Vanessa has been away from home of late.<br>

If it were my call, he would be a recruit post-haste.  Probably one of the better people EQ, just below Coltrane (/hug colt).<br>

<br>
I vote hell no on neverending.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time in dawnshroud peaks back when mr neverending was a lowbie he thought it was funny to train the entire contents of dawnshroud to the ME zone. While thats not a big deal in itself cause it happens often, what is a big deal is the fact that he came back to laugh at all the people he trained... i believe when confronted on this issue his reply was &quot;call me daddy&quot; among your other insults to the &quot;lowbie nobodies&quot; Myself Gilthad praxx and a few others who were on twinks at the time were present for this. I am sure you recall talking so much shit and then getting your ass handed to you by my shadowknights.  You ran around the zone shouting that I was a random pk and convinced a guild of some knights of nocturnal or some dark roleplaying guild to attack me cause they believed you that i was random. Five people from that guild died because of what you said and you didnt even apologize to them, yet after speaking to me they understood the situation and apologized for attacking me.  You also sent multiple tells to Silene &lt;AD&gt; who was being played by me calling her a bitch for healing &quot;random pks&quot; and saying you were gonna get me kicked out of AD.  Never once did you apologize for your train, you laughed and made fun of the lowbies you killed in your train, you proceeded to talk shit, you got your ass beat and still wouldnt admit to your wrong doing.  Sorry people like you have no place in ad. I will vote against you.<br>
<br>
<br>
by the way... if i were you i wouldnt come back and try to spin some story... 2 ad members were present as well as a RL friend....i think our guilds gonna believe us over you..maybee its time to finally own up to what you did.<br>

I am a close friend of Never's and have been waiting for him to apply.  I have never seen any attitude like this from Never nor heard of any until now.   Not saying who is right or wrong, but I will look into it.  From my vast experiences with Never and his brother Aurron (a ranger), they are both very good and competent players with good attitudes.  I am going to be sponsoring Never as well.  I will talk to Never in game and Gsam as well and see if we can't find some reslove to this issue.

<br>
and.... onto the nasty subject,<br>
<br>
I do remember the confrontation in dsp... BUT and a big butt ( | ) I honestly don't remember training anyone, killing them, and laughing. Thats definately not my style or even close. To be quite honest all i remember is a high elf wizard with a bad attitude, who claimed i had trained him. He quite arrogantly DEMANDED that I apologize and was altogether rude, thats when i began to insult him.<br>
<br>
 Then a druid and shadowknight showed up and proceeded to (since no hostile action was taken by myself or any of my friends) attack, pk (whatever you wanna call it..) us. Hehe and yes we got beat down... badly, very badly =(<br>
<br>
The issue with me insulting Silene was only because she was healing the sk and druid that were killing all of my friends for no reason other than me having an argument with the wizard... All the people helping me were fighting because they knew i did nothing wrong. The guild was Knights of Brightblade and Disciple's of Hate (sounds pk but isn't). It pretty much ended in everyone realizing it was a big mistake, with everyone leaving and wondering how it started. Except apparently you.<br>
<br>
I never trained anyone and my insults were matched with the insults i received. Should i have just apologized for the false accusation to start with and ended it then.... probably. I don't hold any grudges and I am appalled that you would place full blame on me for what happened. I really hope this clears this mishap up... and I honestly would never treat anyone like this if I mistakenly trained them. Honestly no hard feelings Tiig... If I somehow unknowingly trained you I totally completely am sorry and I apologize whole heartedly. <br>

<br>
train was pulled was not your average dawnshroud train, it had a lil bit of everything from the zone in it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Moving on..... The high elf wizard you talked about is a mage,  he said if your going to train us you should at least apologize to us,  you then began the shit talking.  I get trained all damn day on all my characters, it doesnt bug me, cept when people pull an attitude like you did.<br>
<br>
You straight out told him you didnt care and that you had an idea and that was that if he (the high elf mage) wanted an apology from you that he would first have to call you &quot;daddy&quot; you kept talking shit, you refused to apologize to your train etc... and kept taunting the lowbies.  i logged in my sk, I attacked you, you ran off at warp bard speed.  your friends in those disciples of hate etc... did not jump in until you shouted to zone that i was a random pk,   Another lie...after all your allies died attacking my sk you continued to talk shit running around the zone saying that AD is supporting random PK's.  If my memory serves me correctly also (gilthad can confirm this) but i dont think most of the disciples of hate etc.. were even present for the train and ensuing shit talk, i believe they were headed to that dungeon off of DSP when they saw us fighting.<br>
<br>
I know for fact that battle (a pally in knights of brightblade who was grouped with a few of us was present) and he was also disgusted by your actions as was praxx gilthad and myself.<br>
<br>
slivur posted something on the private board that reminded me that you also told me that you were gonna speak to Vanessalynne and have me disbanded from AD for my conduct.  If you recall i told you to go right ahead.  I talked to VL the next day about you and she said that she barely knew you... more empty threats from you.<br>
<br>
<br>
its funny cause the high elf you claim insulted you is one of the most passive people on rallos zek,  Gilthad is not a liar, nor does he start problems with random people for kicks.  Everyone in AD who knows him knows this. Those insults you claimed you recieved were nonexistent.<br>
<br>
As for everyone leaving that day with problem resolved thats another line of crap, after about 45 mins of you trying to joust with my sk you ended up zoning, i talked with the people i had killed and returned all of the loot that I got from them.  They understood what happened... but you and me.. that was never resolved, nor was it with gilthad or praxx.  You kept running your mouth to the time you zoned....<br>

I was also that halfling druid Tikk.  When playing my other characters I feel no need to name drop (“I’ll get my main!” is a bit trite).  I don’t want people to judge me by who else I’ve played and who I know.  Also, it gives me the chance to get to know people for who they are.  By the way, the only guild Nendel had ever been in was SoD, I unguilded him when Gilthad stepped down as officer and left the guild.<br>
<br>
The whole instance started when I was chasing a PK warrior who had attacked my mage and my group before.   While doing so, someone opened a trade window with me as I was chasing him to the zone.  The PK subsequently plugged with a sliver a life.  Had I been able to kill him without that trade window?  Maybe.  It was kinda frustrating to not get the kill because A) he plugged (they do that ya know) and B) because a random person threw up a trade.<br>
<br>
I confronted that person on why they did that.  The explanation that I got was that I was wearing a robe (a caster) and unguilded and the person I was attacking was wearing armor (a tank) and was guilded.  This was the silliest rationale I had heard in a long long time.  Particularly when you didn’t know any of the participants involved.  The subsequent argument that arose was that I wasn’t owed an apology because your guild was an anti-PK guild.  I was also told that the only way that I would get an apology was if I called you “daddy.”  Even after all involved admitted that you guys had made a mistake.<br>
<br>
You then decided to train us to show how competent you were and how well us lowbies were thought of by anti’s.  I logged on my druid and Gsam logged on his SK to further argue the point.    I don’t shit talk.  I don’t appreciate being told that my opinion is wrong merely because I was unguilded and an intelligence caster (a mage). <br>
<br>
You had a chance then to apologize.  An apology was all that I had wanted.  I tried several times (and talked with several of your guildmates) to diffuse the situation, but at every turn I was insulted.  I was also told that you knew some people in AD and you would make our lives hell in the future (Gsam and I had a chuckle over that).  Your apology now seems to be an effort in brown-nosing.   Personally I think that you wish to get into AD to be more of what you have been historically, a prick, but on a grander scale.<br>
<br>
Your other friends in AD may have a different, rosier opinion than I do.  But I imagine that you’ve been sucking up to them for a long time.  My opinion is based from my personal experience with you as a non-member.  I bet you would have kissed my ass as well had I said I was so-and-so in AD at the time.<br>

During all the initial smack talking, Neverending decided he was going to killsteal us to show us who we were dealing with.

<br>
As far as training, KSing, and Laughing at the dead... it didn't happen...There were insults but that was about as far as it went until some massive SK and a druid showed up and thats when it got bad... I am not taking up for him for the reason that I am his brother but for the reason that i dont think all this stuff that Gsam and Gild are saying is entirely correct...<br>

Since you weren’t there the whole time, nor did you witness all that happened, that’s what your words will remain, an opinion.  I remember talking to you, I remember you admitting that you would have healed the warrior if you could have.  All this based upon ignorance.  Ignorance that once again seems to be going on rampantly.<br>
<br>
Fact is, your brother saved the wrong person.  When confronted about it he acted like a complete and utter asshole (not a term I use lightly).  Since my character was green to him he labeled me a noobie (his words) and that he owed me nothing since he was in an anti guild (once again, paraphrasing his words).  I chose to disagree and stand up for myself.  Obviously accountability is something that is alien to people from carebear servers.   He retaliated by attempting everything a high level person could do to a lower person out of range.  He trained and attempted to kill steal us.  I know this.  I was there.  I’m not exaggerating, lying, or making things up.  I don’t appreciate the insinuation otherwise.<br>
<br>
I’ll let you know why you are speaking up for him.  He IS your brother.  You wouldn’t even be posting a response within an hour unless you were notified that this was going on.   I’m not suggesting that everyone KOS him or you.  I’m merely posting this as a favor to Ascending Dawn.  I don’t know all the peckerwoods on RZ, but I will speak out on the ones I do know.<br>

Like I said I am willing to talk it out but you keep posting bogus things to which i cannot respond, other than calling you a liar. Tiig is not a liar and I hope you aren't either Gildureth but this info is extremely misinterpreted... not sure how else i can say it. I would love to get a chance to talk to you in game and clear this up as I am sure you are both great people.<br>

I am sure a post is going to follow this about how I am brown nosing.. but so be it. Please please please let me have a chance to speak with you in game and clear this up. Gildureth, whatever char you play most let me know the name and i'll get in touch with you..<br>
