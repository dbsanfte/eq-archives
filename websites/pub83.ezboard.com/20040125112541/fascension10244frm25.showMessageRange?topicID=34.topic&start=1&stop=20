I have offered to show paypal reciepts from the auction to prove it was sold, I have offered to let my actions speak for themselves, however no one has taken me up on either of these.<br>
<br>
I was fine avoiding AD's up untill last night. I was exping and saw 10 of you come into the zone. I figured if I left you all alone I might get lucky and you would do the same, and as I had just root/rot 3 mobs I was out of mana and didnt really have a choice in the matter. Well as I expected I was slain by one of your melees, no biggie, I head back to get my corpse and Im rooted and killed again, and again, and again,.....<br>
For over an our I was corpse camped. This is part of the game I guess, no matter how dishonorable I think it is, there isnt and wasnt a whole lot I could do about it. Ibinax (I believe I spelled this correctly she is an Enchanter in your guild)  soley camped the zone to keep me out for an hour. After I managed to Dot her she ran into the zone. I invised up and tried to run past her while she was fighting 4 mobs. She roots me, waves, and runs while her charmed mob still has aggro, she zones and all 4 of her mobs kill me.<br>
<br>
EXP death #1<br>
<br>
At this point Im furious, corpse camping however lame is one thing. Rooting me and exp killing me is another. I head back in and see ibnax but she doesnt move, I fly past her get back to where my body was and she roots me right next to it, mez's me and walks off, sure enough bam<br>
<br>
EXP death #2<br>
<br>
I brought a GM in on it at this point but as she never admitted in chat, threatend in chat, nor was he a witness no exp refund. After bitching about it in ooc Kaycie allowed me to loot my corpses and leave.<br>
<br>
I posted this whole comment to basically say a few things.<br>
<br>
#1 First off I am not the original Balox...in my time I have done nothing but be nice to AD and try and get along with you guys. I have never raised my hand against you unless in self defence.<br>
<br>
#2 Being KoS by someone and then corpse camping them for an hour and causing them 2 exp deaths just for spite is a bit much....Im sure you hated Balox, Im sorry for his actions, but there are few things in game I can think of that deserve what I recieved last night. There was no honor in it.<br>
<br>
#3 I want off this damn list. If you guys are going to corpse camp and exp kill me whenever you see me its going to make life pretty helacious. What do I need to do? I have been told to pay anywhere from 2-10k to pay off this kos list. However I am broke, relatively new to the game, and whenever I do try and cash out I usually end up bumping into one of your guys, who promptly cleans me out. I ask if I must pay a fee that you make it reasonable. Then I ask again that you allow me a week of relief to try and make that. Temp cease fire just long enough for me to make the 1 or 2k that you require. If you want to restrict me to a few zones of freedom so be it.<br>
<br>
The point of the matter is this is a game. I want to have fun in it. What happened last night was so far above and beyond the line thatI was appaled. I want this rectified. Tell me what I must do.<br>
<br>

in most cases the boards are the place to handle most matters.<br>
in some situations like yours too many people get involved and shit talk gets invited.<br>
keep it private. keep it civil listen to what the officer has to say and dont read anything else into it.<br>
