I'm not saying all palenstines are like that, I'd say a good majority aren't, but there are a few bad apples with bombs on their chests that kill 20-45 innocent children, women, and men every couple of months that just ruin any political / peaceful solution anytime soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=everas>Everas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>AD's Iksar Monk_0354</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#333333>(3/28/03 2:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=143>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Its funny, when Palestinians kill Israelis its terrorism. When Israelis kill Palestinians it's a police action, and when its Palestinian women and children who just happen to be in the way they're acceptable casualties. Fucking hypocrites.<br>
<br>
It may sound like a cliche but two wrongs really doesn't make a right. And if someone tries to justify brutality as a response to brutality they're full of shit. <br>
<br>
Anyone who lays the blame for the situation in the Middle-east on Palestine is a fool and a sadist. Nothing excuses the things those people have been put through and if some of them finally give up hope and strap a bomb to their chest we shouldn't be surprised. We were the ones that backed them into that corner in the first place.<br>
<br>
Besides who the fuck needs to strap a bomb to your chest when you can just use a missile, or a tank, or a bulldozer? Best part is you can cook up some bullshit about terrorism and then people don't give a fuck who you kill.<br>
<br>
And of course I'm not saying all Israelis are genocidal racists, just the ones who run the nation. Nothing like kicking families off their land, making them second class citizens in their own nation, tearing the guts out of their economy and leaving them to starve in the streets, then to top it off bulldoze the camps the flee to, shoot them on suspisions alone, and as an added bonus people cheer you on while you do it. Its kind of funny but it does remind you just alittle bit of another event we often hear of.<br>
<br>
Oh and the link between Saddam and terrorism is a joke. Connecting him to 9/11 is the biggest load of political opportunism I've seen. And anyone who believes it just because its what they're told without ever seeing a shred of evidence is gullible.<br>

However, taking Fox News and NYTimes as the two sides of the spectrum is not very broad a view. I concede that there might be some kind of domestic political agenda in NYTimes, but you don't need to go further than British press to find a much much more pessimistic view of the war than in NYTimes. Then comes Europe, Islamic countries and finally Arabs. That article you linked is from my viewpoint like one hippie telling another that he's not flowery enough (or make a better analogy yourself =p). For example, read some of William Safire's columns, which are very patriotic. I read the NYTimes frequently, and I assure you that it's not totally innocent of the behaviour I described above. What I'm getting at is, that while I suppose it's quite liberal for mainstream press (is it mainstream?) it's still somewhat tilted on the 'patriotic' side when looking from Europe.<br>
<br>
I would say the two sides in the 'media war' are US media and Iraqi media, perhaps assisted a bit with al-Jazeera. The US media is much more skillful and subtle in its machinations, while the Iraqi propaganda is like 'US kills women and elderly!' I don't think anyone comes here telling that with a straight face, and it goes without saying that it's a 'bit' biased. On the other hand, Kursten just summed up the latest accusations and objects of ragemongering as per my post, obviously totally absorbed. Just out of curiosity, I was under the assumption that Kadandrum had military background, laying mines in waterways is pretty standard procedure when expecting an invasion, no?<br>
<br>
I assume you did read what the 30+ countries are Smawty? Most of those aren't exactly the world opinion shapers, and in the few notable countries (UK, Spain, Japan, Australia, Netherlands, Turkey) the public opinion is strongly against the war, raising doubts of the longevity of the pro-war stance. On the other hand, many countries on the list are paid to give their public support and sit on the sidelines cheerleading. You might want to keep an eye on the upcoming 'financial aid package' to those countries. Ever heard of the term 'coalition of the billing'? I agree though that correct term would probably be something like oligolateral =p.<br>

&quot;1.) Iraqi soldiers are using *women and children* as human shields, this has been noted over southern and northern Iraq.<br>
2.) Iraqi soldiers are *acting* like they are surrendering and then killing *our* soldiers.<br>
3.) They executed five of our soldiers as they were trying to surrender.<br>
4.) If your an Iraqi citizen, and you have a family and you say something so much as *I think Saddam should have done this instead of this*, Iraqi soldiers will come to your house, rape the females in your home, and video tape it and send a copy to the commanding officer, family relatives, and the victims.<br>
5.) Saddams own son was put in charge of shredding human civilians who spoke out against him.<br>
6.) I would like to see some of you liberals go to Iraq and say even one word about Saddam and get either murdered or have your family tortured.<br>
7.) Russia has been selling Saddam Anti-Tank missles for the war<br>
8.) French have been selling jet fighter parts for the war.<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
1) not iraqi soldiers, but partisans, an bad armed underground organisation, Fedajin<br>
2) look at #1<br>
3) wrong it has been a lie, it was propaganda those soldiers have fallen in combat. UK military says so, all who could give evidence about such a case say there was no execution. It was just propaganda brought forward by blair with backing of bush. Silently it was confirmed by Blair the day after that it was indeed no execution.<br>
4) true to some degree but demonised<br>
5) true<br>
6) expresses the same like #5, probably a sign of bad education<br>
7) not proven and the US doesnt seem to be willing to share their information so Russia could verify it.<br>

This just proves u have no idea, what would u answer if i ask u why Saddam was put into place by the western forces?  Id bet u dont know why. why? because ur comments totally lack of any knowledge, depth and insight. Ur probably one of these 45secs-attention-guys someone mentioned earlier.<br>
<br>
Ur comment about the Palestinians (ye, learn how to spell it from a foreigner) are totally one sided.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now id like to bring few things forward by myself.<br>
<br>
The financial plans for rebuilding Iraq à-la Rumsfeld is finished. EX-firm of VP Dick Cheney gonna get the job for rebuilding Iraq, the money will be provided by the international community and Iraq itself. US insists on only paying 2.5billions, thats ridicoulous my own country that is smaller than florida and anti-war is gonna pay 16billions.<br>
Dick Cheneys ex-firm hallibourton already ordered the material, experts and workers for rebuilding Iraq 2months before the war started.<br>

Restating what I've said is no argument against it, affixing a political label is no argument against it.  Your continual refusal to justify your stance on this war with anything other than speculation and paranoia is disturbing.  Cohesive reasoning and expert opinions are required here- and your side of the argument just doesn't have them.  Misrepresenting parts of my arguments in the hope that you'll discredit them all is also disappointing, but I'm sure people who read your last posts were disappointed in you long before that bit of drivel escaped your keyboard.  No matter, I'll answer the substance of your arguments even if you won't answer mine.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What exactly do you think I don't comprehend or understand?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The most obvious thing is that you have failed to understand that the case for war has never been made.  Not by our leaders, your leaders or any of the nations supporting this war.  <br>
<br>
You obviously are failing to understand that we have been sent to war based on the flimsiest of excuses and are now trying to justify it with a moral case that was never part of diplomatic discussions.  You fail to understand that an honest and substantial effort to explore a peaceful solution has never been properly made.  Four months of inspections is a pathetic gesture- four years of unsupported inspections destroyed 95% of WMD and we are now being bludgeoned into support for this war in the belief that &quot;there was no other way&quot;- what poppycock.  The proportion of war support sentiment has radically shifted from WMD to &quot;an evil regime&quot;- where is the honesty in that policy?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I question points that people seem to take for fact.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The facts where I've pointed them out, come from the people that matter.  Not politicians on either side with agendas of their own- but from the NGOs, religious leaders, strategic thinkers and UN inspectors who have no political stake on either side.  They have been shouted down by your government and mine, the Iraqi regime, brutal as it is, has been scapegoated and painted as the architect of its own downfall.  You haven't presented a single shred of proof of a threat, nor any facts pertaining to how a war is justified.  In fact, no one has- but the manner with which you and other Americans like you associate 9/11 with this war is just another example of the pathetic and flimsy arguments that have been used in scaremongering of a non-existent threat.<br>
<br>
Here's a very real and unpleasant fact for you- the real impact of a war on people who have had no say in it- reported by Robert Fisk, a respected journalist for the mainstream British paper the Independent(a paper which historically has never had political ties).  These are the hard facts, what is happening on the ground- read it closely:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://argument.independent.co.uk/commentators/story.jsp?story=391165">argument.independent.co.u...ory=391165</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
A sobering and accurate account of what happens in a war- those sanitized pictures of explosions in the distance isn't just buildings and vehicles being blown up- conscripts and civilians are dying as well- real people with families.  The same people we're trying to liberate, the same people who's hearts and minds we aim to win.  And we're failing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I question the bashing of America, the blind support of Iraq, Saddam, the UN, and the bashing of our President and those who think the world will be a better place without Saddam<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
What utter bullshit.  I've never bashed America, supported Iraq/Saddam, or said that the world is a better place with Saddam.  I've attacked dangerous policies and suported the rule of international law rather than the law of the jungle.  I've attacked the idea that might makes right in the 21st century, and I'm proud to stand for those ideas- I know the world is a safer place if leading nations stand by them.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I question broad liberal bias<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ha, now you try to politicize the arguments- very glib.<br>
<br>
Is it liberal in your view to:<br>
<br>
-Want the international community to sanction military action, demand that international backing be sought for a pre-emptive war that does not immediately threaten the security of a nation.<br>
<br>
-Care about the sanctity of human life, be it Iraqi, British or American, civilian or soldier, prince or priest<br>
<br>
-Question the wisdom of hasty aggressive policy that is being used to deal with problems <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>caused</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by hasteful aggressive policies of the past<br>
<br>
-Have deep concern about the lives of our soldiers being sent to fight a war in our name and the name of the Iraqi people without truly listening to either<br>
<br>
-Worried not just about funding the war, but funding and winning the peace, and saddened to see that isn't happening<br>
<br>
-Be worried about the fall-out of this war:  Arab opinion, terrorism, regional instability, military occupation of an Arab country by Western powers that has always lead to trouble before<br>
<br>
-Care about security not for the next ten to twelve months, but a lasting security for ten to twelve years<br>
<br>
If all those arguments are &quot;broad liberal bias&quot; then I'll happily accept that label you've applied.  Moreover, I'm proud to hold these views, they represent a willingness for justice, peace, legitimacy and security.  If the price of being human and caring about a lasting peace is being called &quot;misleading&quot;, &quot;propagandist&quot;, &quot;liberal&quot; or any other pigeon-holed terms, then I'll gladly pay it with all my heart.  International law, peace, security and our collective conscience are far bigger than my own sensitivities- those of you who seek to label my arguments and personalize the issue will never know how far you are from the mark of truth in this crisis.  <br>
<br>
Lurker has listed some of the arguments I've presented, some of them accurately, some of them out of context, and one or two I never made.  No matter, all of you on this thread can read my posts if you so choose and make up your own minds- someone else representing (or misreperesenting) my arguments is of little value in a debate.<br>
<br>
I've quoted links showing how propaganda comes from our side as well as the Iraqi side- for anyone who saw the Prime Minister's speech from Camp David, here's the truth of what happened to the two British soldiers:<br>

<br>
Saddam's regime is a tyrannical and oppressive one, lies, violence and deceit are the tools of a dictatorship.  But it would seem the same lies, physical &amp; emotional violence and deceit are being employed by our own side.  It goes back to what I've been harping on about for so long in this thread- how can we claim democracy is a more civilized kind of government if we nod our heads when those governments use the same means as a dictatorship.  Ok, war is a dangerous and bloody business- but for goodness sake be honest with us.  I expect the Iraqis to embellish the truth and use propaganda, I shouldn't expect the same from our own side.  But I did, and it's testament to the paranoia of ordinary people being exploited by governments trying to find any excuse available to justify a war that should never have happened.<br>
<br>
Lurker, here is a quote from a speech Donald Rumsfeld gave at a PNAC meeting describing America's role in dealing with the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Of course the people don't want war. But after all, it's the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger.&quot; </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Reading it carefully- I'd like to know if you agree with that stance lurker, or indeed any of you- yes or no please.  If you ignore the rest of my post I don't mind- just humour me and answer that question.<br>
<br>
Lastly- no one ever doubted that we would win a war, that's not the point.  The point is, how would we avoid war?  If war was ultimately necessary, how do we make it as legitimate as possible?  And if we have to fight a war, how do we win the peace.<br>
<br>
Here are a spread of articles, all from leading broadsheet British newspapers that all say the same thing- we'll win the war, but not the peace.  Iraq will never be the same again after this war.  I supported the war in Afghanistan unreservedly- we had international backing, a truly broad coalition and an alternative government to the Taliban- in situ and ready to implement.  Despite that there are problems, a chronic lack of funding that we've all forgotten about because of the next war.  But Iraq is a whole different ball-game- this is a regime change in the heart of the Middle East with an alternative government that has never governed before.  Aid packages are even slimmer for the task this time, there is no international coalition, no regional support, no consensus on post-war administration.  If we didn't have a sound workable alternative to Saddam's regime, then why did we start this war?<br>
<br>
The articles, all of them make good reading and give a sense of British public opinion, as well as objective analysis of the problem, mostly from veteran writers and journalists who've written on numerous conflicts.  They come from a variety of mainstream papers- from liberal, conservative and first an independent paper:<br>

<br>
Lastly lurker- whatever you believe about my opinions, the least you could do is attempt to challenge them with legitimate argument.  After all, that's supposed to be the strength of the democracy we claim to be fighting for in Iraq- the amalgamation of views.  Kadandrum is someone I disagree with, but I can respect his views for two reasons.<br>
<br>
First, he actually attempts to challenge my arguments.  He may do it using undemocratic language like &quot;dissenter&quot;, &quot;rebel&quot; and &quot;protestor&quot; in some cases, and even says I'm supporting Saddam in my statements.  I find that amusing, but at least he's tried to engage the arguments rather than preach outside them.<br>
<br>
Secondly, he's stood behind his arguments with an identity.  This and the tone of his arguments show that he's passionate about what he believes, misguided as I believe his arguments are, they are made that much more persuasive by his willingness to stand up for them with honesty of identity.  I have no choice to respect his personal stand- its principles may be questionable and its politics distasteful, but he is standing up for them.  Dishonesty of identity may not be the reason your arguments are farcical, but it certainly contributes.  No matter, you'll continue to ignore my arguments and preach outside the issues absent proof, nothing I can do about that.<br>
<br>
I just hope that people think long and hard about what they're supporting and what that public support has gotten us into.  Lives are at stake on all sides, we owe it to ourselves to try and make sure this never happens again.  Peace and diplomacy cannot be equated with inaction, international law cannot be equated with a talking shop,  It's time to make these institutions work- not by talking about them, but through meaningful political participation.  This discussion, however irrelevant or off-topic some of you think it is, is important to that participation.  It might well put some people off the topic, but the responses I've received on this board and in game suggest to me that the opposite is the case, and I'm happy to see it.<br>

<br>
My re-hashing of your arguments was not an attempt to debunk your stance.  I was simply summarizing points that many seem to support, especially the anti-war and deterrence stance.<br>
<br>
Why did I re-summarize?  <br>
<br>
To show that I fully comprehend what the opposing stance is. (aka Ebany) I completely understand YOUR point of view that there is no case for war.  No UN support, no world consensus, bad regime change history, etc etc.  <br>
<br>
But I don't buy it.  And because I question the anti-war stance, supposed facts, supposed conclusions, and defend current policy, many automatically label the opposing side as, &quot;just not getting it&quot;, &quot;not comprehending&quot;, &quot;failing to understand anything&quot;, &quot;mindless drone&quot;, etc.<br>
<br>
This is the view point Taranna and many are coming from:<br>
If someone truly understands their view point and faced with their truths, then there can be no other logical conclusion.  Any other educated outcome other than their own is automatically a failure of others to comprehend.  Well that's a load of crap.<br>
<br>
I can easily regurgitate your liberal bias stance and your views.  But the end result is not yours.  <br>

You haven't said why not.  Nor have you presented arguments backed by evidence of a convincing reason.  Saying you defend current policy without a single properly constructed argument indicates to many reading your comments that you really &quot;don't get it&quot; as you say.  If perhaps you presented clear evidence of a present and imminent danger if we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>didn't</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> use military force, people will believe you are getting the message.  The talk of appeasement, Chamberlain and other pathetic WWII comparisons are nonsense, people aren't falling for it.  The reason is simple- our national survival isn't at stake.  Comparing the blitz in London or the attack on Pearl Harbour to 9/11 is met with howls of derision in this country because people see that Al-Qaeda and Saddam are on different planets, and while we fear terrorism, we can't let that fear drive us to think like terrorists, to use words like &quot;shock and awe&quot;.<br>
<br>
  What is in this war for us, what's in it for the Iraqi people?  The answers so far- to the first question- what's in it for us are casualties, PoWs, heartbreak for the families of those involved.  Their deaths being exploited to push the non-existent case for war.  The prospect of increased instability in the Arab world, governments friendly towards us being caught between the hammer of their need for US/UK support and the anvil of their own people's anger at this war.  The prospect of increased terrorism, now deemed likely by almost any security expert you'd care to name.  The undermining of the UN's founding principles in authorizing military force, and the fracturing of the international community that needs to be united to fight the threat of terror.  That result is a hard sell for a Bush administration that forecast a fairy-tale campaign which has not materialized.  Military commanders weren't listened to, only <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>half</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the forces Tommy Franks wanted were given to him by Bush and Blair.  We've rushed into this war, and our young men and women as well as yours, are paying the price of that and will continue to do so.<br>
<br>
What's in it for the Iraqi people?  Read Robert Fisk's report- indeed, read any journalist who has walked the blood slicks of that market square in the Al-Shab residential district.  Read tomorrow morning's news reports of the other market that was hit as I write this post.  That's the message the Iraqi people are getting- that the war doesn't have Arab support (like the 1991 war did) or international support.  That foreign armies are charging across <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>their</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> country and preparing to attack their capital, and are prepared to dismiss innocents being bombed as collateral damage.  No one disputes Saddam is an evil man nor questions the depravity of his regime.  <br>
<br>
Yet you would do well to remember lurker, that Stalin was no angel, yet a simple exhorting of nationalism was enough to convince millions of Russian soldiers and civilians to risk their lives against a foreign army.  Flinging themselves on grenades, digging trenches for their troops, boobytrapping themselves in the event of interrogation or capture, resisting to the death.  Not for Stalin the dictator, but for the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Rodina</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the motherland.  Many Iraqis might well hate Saddam's rule, but they hate the idea of a foreign army occupying their country even more.<br>
<br>
By the way, you didn't answer my question about Donald Rumsfeld's quote- do you agree with that statement, do you think it is a positive policy to base military action on.  Yes or no.  Just humour me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But the end result is not yours.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The end result is not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>mine?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  I'm not arguing against this war for my own sake alone, but for my fellow citizens who face the threat of violent extremist reprisals.  For the men and women charged with the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>defence</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of this country who are now invading foreign shores.  Those are who I speak for, because they have no choice in the matter, this war has been rushed to by our government in our name and they have to prosecute it.  They have no voice, the Iraqi people have no voice, in particular Iraqi conscripts have neither the voice nor the choice.  <br>
<br>
What good are the values of freedom and decency if we're not willing to apply them?  Actions speak louder than words, Bush and Blair can talk all day about &quot;liberating the Iraqi people&quot;.  But the hard fact is, that innocents are dying because of this war.  Whether blown apart by stray/mistargeted munitions, or bleeding slowly to death in a hospital.  Or starved to death and parched as coalition forces cut power lines and destroy water facilities.  The Iraqi people don't see that as liberation lurker, they see it as the cold-blooded murder of their friends, relatives, neighbours and countrymen.  <br>
<br>
A friend of mine serving with the Desert Rats (7th Armoured Brigade) near Basra told me on the phone that many of his colleagues were close to tears upon hearing hundreds of thousands hadn't eaten or had clean water for six days.  We continue to lay siege to the city and black it out, knowing its people are starving to death unable even to flee.  Aid distribution is proving even more troublesome than it was in Somalia, secure routes are scarce, and people are trapped between two military formations...and starve.  Basra has 1/5 the population of Baghdad, and is about a tenth of the size.  What horrors I wonder, await the people of that city in the weeks and months to come.<br>
<br>
An Iraqi colleague at work today told me that his family in Baghdad reported blood bank supplies, filled to bursting before military action are being quickly depleted, now down to about a fourth of pre-war stocks already.  Our medical bretheren in Baghdad will in the days and weeks likely be standing helplessly by trauma and surgery bays watching hapless innocents dying of blood loss.  Iraqi civilians he said to me have been begged by their health minister and chief medical officer to go to their hospitals and give blood.  But he also told me that most people are afraid to leave their homes after the marketplace attack, even to buy food or give blood.  He's told his father and sister living in the small residential Al-Khar district to stay in their house and hope for the best.  <br>
<br>
What have we become, that we can so easily accept inflicting even further suffering on these people under a flag of liberation?  Collateral damage is what the military calls these deaths, but there is another dimension to this.  Our hearts have somehow been hardened to the suffering of these people, we knew the consequences of war, yet we trumpeted them loudly enough before it began.  The main casualty of collateral damage, has surely been our conscience.  That moral force that should guide us to act as decent human beings, is being eroded away by fear, suspicion, vague threats and military ambition.  And if that compassion diminishes, we all become less human.<br>

See, I dont discredit the war-supportes and don't question their motives (aka anti-american etc). But I'd really like to know what drives you defending this war. <br>
Is it blank patriotism? Do you expect all iraqis to be bravehearts, willing to die for their freedom?<br>
It can't be fear about terrorism since you never took opposite position when the point was brought forward that this action will weaken the anti-terror-coalition and that Al-Qaeda repeatedly tryied to get the iraqi people to drop Saddam because the regime is anti-islamistic.<br>
Do you expect stability for the region? But wait that's not possible because of course you understand that we put Saddam into place to grant stability (sheiits and suniits and kurds etc).<br>
Do you expect that bombing Iraq into a democracy (if it's gonna work) will enforce democratic movements in neighbouring countrys? But why does the US have Iran on the axis of the evil then? They got very positiv democratic movements there (women voting and getting elected).<br>
Or maybe you think Bush is a honorable man and therefor you trust him on anything he does. But of course you'd also know who paid Bushs election-campaign (Energy, Weapon and Israel lobbys).<br>
I bet you have your reasons, but you seem to be unwilling or unable to bring them forward here. You also seem to be unwilling or unable to take opposition towards any of the arguments you quoted.<br>
So please, clear the dust and tell us why you support the war after agreeing (at least you didnt disagree) with the arguments brought forward to you so far.<br>

The West Bank historically belongs to Jordan, and the Gaza strip to Egypt.  The Golan heights incidentally, although not part of the lands ceded to Palestinians for peace do belong to Syria.  Oh, and pre-1967 borders cover a far larger area.  UN Security Council resolution 230, unenforced to this day grants Palestine half of Jerusalem and almost half of what is now Israel Ulriche.  Palestinians are commiting aggression on Israeli soil, and I don't defend or condone it in any way.<br>
<br>
But it is too often overlooked that Israel has defied resolution 230 since 1967, over 30 years and continues to illegally occupy land it has no right to.  Iraq was given 12 years before an invasion...Israel hasn't even been subjected to sanctions or significant diplomatic pressure in that time.  <br>
<br>
This is the source of a lot of anger in the Arab world.  Part of the reason you are seeing a lot of sympathy for ordinary Iraqis defending their country is that their plight in Arab eyes is similar to that of Palestinians.  Palestinians have had land illegally occupied by Israel for 36 years with US support.  Now that they see an invasion of Iraq, the fear is that once again Arab lands will be occupied by a foreign power, in fact that very same foreign power which unilaterally supports Israel.  If I was an Arab I'd be waving a banner and shouting anti-American and anti-British slogans too I'd imagine.<br>
<br>
All of this is playing into Saddam's hands- the end of every one of his speeches is concluded with:  &quot;Long live Iraq, long live Palestine and the intifadah&quot;.  Intifadah translates to:  armed struggle, with a particular emphasis on resistance against an unjust cause.  Suicide bombers have no right to threaten the security of ordinary Israelis, no one disputes that- but the illegality of the occupation coupled with the brutal and violent reprisals by uniformed soldiers helps create the climate for terrorism to thrive.  As long as security is fraught and &quot;barely being contained&quot;, Sharon's position couldn't be more secure.  His strategy is one of self-preservation, at the expense of his own innocent citizens and innocent Palestinians- Arafat is little better, though there seems to be some progress with devolving power.  I'm holding my breath on that, the entire future of stability in the Middle East is threatened by this war, I only hope to god we find a way to put it back together after it.<br>
