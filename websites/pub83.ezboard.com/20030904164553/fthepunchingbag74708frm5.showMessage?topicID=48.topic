When the server came back up I logged on and found all the items I had looted were gone from my inventory. The only items in the reclaim terminal were those I hadn't looted yet when the server crashed. <br>
<br>
I petitioned the incident (and died to a greater anun tearer while I was trying to type the petition) and was told by GM Mordred1 to email and report it using the bug tool. I was also told nothing can be reimbursed. Before I could reply my petition was deleted (removed, whatever) and I got a system message to that effect when I did reply. I had no chance to explain the situation and can find no reasonable grounds that I should lose my items do to something that was so obviously out of my control and in fact a problem on Funcom's end. <br>
<br>
Between the brush off I got with my petition and the loss of my items I have mixed emotions at this time about continuing with this game. ARK Tilday2 was also contacted thru a petition given by an org member when they heard about my being blown off by the GM. I was told by another GM thru him to email support (which I am doing). I'm filing this bug report under the guidance given to me by GM Mordred1.<br>
<br>
I'd be thrilled to get my character rolled back even if it meant losing some of the more recently acquired items. Now I was told that this would have to be investigated and that would take time. As I read with the recent account hacking incident when too much time passes it can no longer be investigated. This greatly concerns me. What follows is the exact conversation between myself and GM Mordred1. If this is what passes for customer support then it's no wonder people are leaving. The volunteer ARK spent more effort, showed more concern, was more informative, and helpful than the paid GM and sadly was only contacted do to the lack of support given by the GM. I wouldn't be at all suprised to find out my official GM response was nothing more than an automated response generated by the server. Here's the dialogue:<br>
<br>
[There is 3 petitions in front of you in the queue.] <br>
<br>
[Mordred1] Hi, this is GM. We are not avle to reimburse lost stuff, but if you please could do alt+ctrl+shft+f9 and describe what happened, then the programmers might find out what caused the loss, and remove the bug so it wont happen in the future<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
[Mordred1]: I'm sorry for any inconveniences.<br>
<br>
To [Mordred1] Hold on, this was a result of the server crash.<br>
<br>
System: You have no active petition with the Gm or Advisor you are trying to message. To get in touch with an Advisor, please file a petition using /petition &lt;message&gt;. <br>
<br>
System: Before you do please check known issues and fixes at <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://community.anarchy-online.com/">community.anarchy-online.com/</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I know Funcom's non-reimbursement policy. I know there are things I &quot;should have&quot; done that **might** have prevented it. Bottom line is I lost my stuff through no fault of my own. I'm not going to make a list of things I demand back. Funcom should be able to know what was there from the logs. <br>
<br>
Honestly, I don't feel much like playing right now. It takes a lot out of you when you realize everything you've done and &quot;worked&quot; for can be wiped out and you won't get it back. My future in AO is uncertain at this time. If my dealings with Funcom continue in this direction I know where my future is headed.<br>
<br>
Show your support if you're tired of hearing you can't be reimbursed and nothing can be done to replace any items you lose. Take a minute and check out a couple of the incidents where this policy hasn't been followed. Obviously they have the ability to investigate and replace items. Why don't they?<br>
<br>
(it's 3am, I'm tired and upset, and I've probably started to ramble, so I just want someone to take a minute and respond to this issue with something more than a canned company line...and give me my things) <p>Bet I can run faster scared than they can mad!</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/udonlok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Donlok</A> at: 5/27/02 1:47:18 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=48.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=48.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.emailToFriend?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.threadControl?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=48.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm10">Polling Corner<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market - Rubi-Ka 1<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm9">The Market - Rubi-Ka 2<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm8">Past Humor Links<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5>Bitch-Fest</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
