It's in the news because I color my AO updates with things like that -- if you do not like it, well, &quot;ce' la vie.&quot;<br>
<br>
In terms of that France crack in particular, if that is what is so offensive, I think the French have a long history of what I personally feel is a very snobbish, holier-than-thou view of world politics and one that is, time and time again, almost always the opposition of however the U.S. votes.<br>
<br>
Why would I poke fun at France, beyond the fact that I poke fun at just about everything?  French peacekeepers helping war criminals in the former Yugoslavia, France's dealings with Iran via the Total Oil Group, France's refusal to allow pilots during the El Dorado Canyon Operation (Libya) to overfly France, the fiasco's of France's colonial pushes which have led, indirectly or directly, to the problems in Vietnam, Africa and the Middle East, France's holding on to a pseudo-socialist system of governing that just digs itself deeper each year, etc.  <br>
<br>
For a country who's ass the U.S. has bailed out of disaster not once but at least twice in the last century, those things irk me and make me wonder where in the hell the French government gets off doing anything in relation to the U.S. except saluting and saying &quot;yessir, thank you sir!&quot; when we have an opinion on global matters.  I'm still actually pissed about the Libya thing, seeing as how I personally knew pilots who had 7 hours of flight time added to their fly-overs because our &quot;oldest ally&quot; wouldn't let us refuel in French airspace.<br>
<br>
I do not &quot;hate French people,&quot; nor am I anti-French or racist in terms of believing and espousing French stereotypes beyond a cultural arrogance that I do believe exists (and we Americans have ours too, I'm sure).  But I can't resist a jab at a country that once again is acting like a small child in a big pool.  As someone who reads up on world history for pleasure reading, it simply occurs to me that France was once a world super-power, and ever since they have seemingly acted like a whiny, resentful baby in terms of foreign relations and their stance on NATO- and UN-related issues, from the votes on Annan all the way back.  My opinion, which is bolstered by the fact that I do not like seeing our allies in the wake of the WTC disaster daring to even suggest diplomatic or non-military action, especially considering all of Europe would very likely be the United States of Germany if it wasn't for U.S. involvement in WW2.<br>
<br>
If you are French, sympathetic or simply wish to argue with me, feel free.  But before you do I would ask you ask yourself the simple question ... would France's opinion be different if it was the Louvre and the Eifel Tower sitting on your streets in rubble today instead of our monuments?<br>

I really cannot for the life of me figure out why, but an American in Paris is probably not going to have a good time.  I suppose that might not be right, but when the majority of the population dislikes me, how can I not return some of that animosity?  At least I would have some sort of reason for disliking French... not that I do. Ah well... c'est la vie, as Sensei said.<br>
<br>
I happened to be in Plockton, Scotland during the incident and only just returned to Atlanta the evening of the 17th (came through Toronto, too, and started remembering some French I learned years ago, hehe).  I got the vibe from the BBC reports that the UK was somewhat concerned that we might fly off the handle and do something rash.  I don't think we have shown a history for such things, but the general feel seemed to be that Americans are that big bald biker at the end of the bar no one wants to offend.  I have to agree somewhat that Americans are arrogant, and we pretty much do what we want, but we are not all like that.  I personally don't think I am arrogant about being an American (mainly because I didn't personally do all those great things that the country has collectively done).  I do believe that I have been insulated from the outside world due to my culture, and I can understand some of those feelings on the part of nations that have been continually dealing with terrorism.  They know we have been virtually untouched until now, and they all remember how we reacted to Pearl Harbor.  Though no one was saying it, I am sure they were all hoping that we would &quot;use restraint&quot;... meaning we should not eradicate all life between Iran and India and saturate the land with so much radiation it glows.  Hey, it pays to keep your eye on the guy with the biggest gun, so I don't get upset.<br>
<br>
It does make my asshole pucker, however, when people who have accepted aid from us numerous times have the gall to be as ungrateful as certain groups have been.  And to get military commentary from a nation that couldn't surrender itself out of a paper bag, that's just insulting.<br>
<br>

I don't think anyone has targeted any French citizens persay with their comments, but in the last few years your goverment has been kind of slacking in the support department and when the official response is &quot;Don't fly off the handle now.....&quot; (paraphrasing of course) it tends to get us Americans even more riled up because that's exactly what most of us want to do......fly the fuck off the handle! Now with that said I'll apologize for any rash statements I may have made earlier, esp to the guy who first posted. Sorry man, you didn't deserve the flak you caught for that one simple question, but understand we Americans are hurting inside like we never have before. I have a feeling if someone just looks like they are are gonna say &quot;peaceful solution&quot; they are gonna find Uncle Sam's size 90 combat boot sideways up their asses but quick. Just realize most of it isn't personal.<br>

Regardless of French foreign policy (don't know, don't much care), it IS a bit silly for a country with a history of accomodating nations that have attacked them to make military suggestions to a country that has just been attacked.  And for anyone interested in military overkill, may I suggest you read up on the French Revolution?<br>
<br>
I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> don't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> think that France should still be kissing American ass for the bail-out in WW2.  Let's be real:  we had a vested interest in kicking Hitler's ass, as much as the French did, and we had to go OVER France to do it.  I'm not saying there wasn't some altruism involved in kicking Hitler out of France or that we didn't contribute greatly to saving France, but it was 56 years ago, and it's not like we didn't benefit from it.  Expecting fawning gratitude out of the modern Frenchman (or woman) is a bit much.<br>
<br>
I'm going to give the French Government the benefit of the doubt and assume that they meant only to advise caution and patience, which we DO need.  Yes, we, as Americans, want some blood.  Yes, whoever did thsi needs to die, and anybody protecting the people who did this need to die first.  But by the same token, ONLY THOSE PEOPLE need to die.  We DON'T want to invade Afghanistan and kick the shit out of the country if it turns out that in fact bin Laden didn't do it.  Sure, he's our prime suspect, but we're not 100% sure yet, and we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> don't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> want to provoke any countries by attacking the wrong people.  That would not only mean more innocents die, it would be absolutely terrible for our world image, and would handicap us in the foreign relations department for years to come.  It would be a terrible blow to US credibility if we DID fly off the handle and inadvertently wiped out the wrong people.<br>
<br>
If, however, the suggestion is &quot;Hey, they bombed you, you better be careful that you don't piss them off and make them bomb you again&quot; then I'd suggest that the French people need to revolt again.  Your government has gotten too stupid to be allowed to rule you anymore.  The average drooling idiot can see the absurdity in that viewpoint, so I'm not gonna bother pointing it out any further...<br>
<br>
And as far as making comments about Vietnam, I'll admit right now that the administration of this country didn't seem to take its head out of its ass for the entire duration of that war.  But lets look at it this way:  We lost in the neighborhood of 50,000 people in Vietnam (not counting the Vietnamese that died, just US soldiers). That's a small fraction of the people that died in World War 2, and Vietnam lasted a hell of a lot longer.<br>
<br>
Last point, since I can't seem to shut up:  This is Sensei's site.  He's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> allowed</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to editorialize a bit on the front page.  You seek this site out.  It's not forced on you.  So there is no obligation other than those placed by good taste and decorum for Sensei to censor himself on the front page in any way.<br>
