Maybe the US should just back out and wait until Saddam or some other fanatical leader starts lobbing chemical nukes around into parts of Europe and Asia and then we will see who calls for help. Ya I think I like the reactive stance alot better than the proactive stance.....<br>

Oh wait shit....everyone will be dead after the first couple are launched.<br>

I agree I think the US should sit back and let the world ignite in a ball of flames and we should go back to watching TV and hope things are going to be ok tomorrow and the years to come for our children. Its not paranoia its reality, the quicker you remove your head from your ass the more likely you are to see it.<br>

Yes I have served in the military and most likely will again shortly, I dont think my opinion has any more value than the next person. We all suffered in one way or another at some point and can bring our own perspective to the table. <br>
<br>
Also wanted to point out that the UN is a contradiction of terms. United Nations....lol when was the last time anything was united in that group of people? When was the last time they actually took a stance and enforced it(12 years and running on those resolutions with Iraq.....gj guys). If you think the UN is going to come in and save the day in the end you are sadly mistaken and under some grand delusions. It is going to be the most resolute and determined nation that will come in and do the dirty work that no one else had the balls to do. <br>

<br>
12year running on resolutions means also 12years no war.<br>
<br>
Does this war weaken terrorists?<br>
No, in all MiddleEast nations radical forces won strongly in weight since it started. Yet there have been no iraqi terrorist, because the Saddam regime saw them as a threath for his absolute power in Iraq. From Marocco to India military budgets have been almost doubled and are trying to get hold on A-bombs, because if the UN cant stop the warmongers this is the only way to secure their safety. Gj, we gonna see how large the boomerang is, which is likely to come.<br>

maybee his daddy didnt belong in vietnam, but maybee theres some things you dont understand about loyalty.  Being an american is more then just a title, its about supporting your country even during its bad times or dark hours as people would put it.  During vietnam there was a draft, many young people were called up and answered that call cause they believe in what the US stands for and want to support their country, not necessarily because they believed in the current war.<br>
<br>
Too many people think being an american these days is about taking all you can from the USA and then leaving her stranded when hard times approach, that frankly makes me sick.<br>

It's ignorant to say what you said about the pancakes because in all honesty, it's inflammatory and just takes attention away from your better point.<br>
<br>
That point being, warring Iraq will do what?  Calm the Arab Street and inspire less people to commit acts of terrorism or inflame the Arab Street and inspire a new generation of radicals willing to die for what they believe?  As much as I may think Saddam Hussein is a dick, as an American, I feel that bombing Iraq will cause America much greater damage in the future than we claim we are trying to pre-empt.  Instead of working towards building a more peaceful area, we are doing a number of things that can blow up in our face.  We are causing a power vaccuum and telling Arabs that the United States deals with them by bombing them.  Your average Arab on the street is not that educated or well off.  It's easy to take poor uneducated people and turn them into terrorists when you have an easy example like we are creating for a cause.  Demigogues that use fear to gain noteriety and followers will have further ammunition for future acts of terrorism.  Honestly, being a New Yorker, I ask myself, will bombing Iraq bring more or less terrorism to New York in the future.  I think it will bring far more.  <br>
<br>
If we were interested in stopping terrorism for good and not just temporarily clotting up the bleeder, we'd be working hard to get Israel and Palestine to settle down and come up with a peace plan.<br>

Criticizing the military or spitting on them in any way is something I have 0 respect for, less than zero respect.  These are men and women that are sworn to do their duty regardless of personal feeling.  To potentially lay their life down for a cause their government believe in but that they might not- to commit yourself to a contract like that requires enormous personal courage.  <br>
<br>
Nowhere in my criticism of the policy of this war have I criticized or do I blame the soldiers- they have my utmost personal support even if the war does not.  Know why?  Because they don't get to make that choice Kron.  I agree with you about the necessity of the war, but if we don't give these people risking our lives- if we don't give them the support and respect they deserve, then why should they risk their lives for us in a war we *do* think is right?  There is no ambiguity in opposing a foolish short-sighted war, yet support the brave men and women who will have to fight it, risking their lives and facing the consequences of decisions <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>they didn't make</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
I've made it clear why I don't support a war policy- I believe it's short-sighted and creates infinitely more problems than it solves.  If we were truly interested in a peaceful stable Middle East, the real priority would be Israel-Palestine, not an insignificant, contained and de-fanged dictator shooting off rhetoric but not a lot else.  However, if I see anyone on message boards or even on the street criticizing soldiers doing their duty honourably and within the rules of war- then I'll give them a piece of my mind.  However wrong the policy, whatever its disastrous consequences, there is no way you can blame that policy's instruments.  That is just wrong to me, on several levels. <p>Taranna Dhossarim<br>

That goes for any country.  But there also comes a time when the people do not feel that the government is doing their duty, and are expected to revolt.  As Taranna said earlier, the central government is a mandate from the people.  When the people feel that the government has not the interest of them in priority, it's time to grab your pitchfork and march into city hall.  Revolution is very common when it comes to history.  We've seen it in France, when the common man was fed up with the aristocracy waltzing on top of them.  We've seen it with the independence of Mexico.  We've seen it in Russia.  And we have seen it MORE than once in America.  I would like to focus on revolutions which have happened in America.<br>
<br>
The American revolution does not count, because that was British colonialists revolting against their own British government because of a conflict of interest and an exploitative tax policy.  Anyway, the first revolution within America against the American centralized government was prior the Civil War.  Essentially the entire geographically bottom half of United States of America seceded from the Nation to form their own.  They called themselves the confederacy.  They made their own flag and elected their own president and even made their own national anthem.  The United States of America did not see that this was in the best interest of the United States of America and had a big war and eventually reunification occured as of the treaty.  Another case of a revolution within America was the communistic sub-culture movement in the 1970's.  Some called themselves flower-children.  I would like to re-direct my argument here.<br>
<br>
The flower children were a group of people who had no intentions of storming the pentagon and holding the President and the House Speaker hostage and demand for radical social and political reform.  They were quite pacific actually.  Not the typical indoctrinized &quot;commies are vicious animalistic beasts&quot; which we got from the cold war, which led to the conflict in Vietnam.  You can see these flower children in movies often typified by sitting in a circle around a bonfire swaying in rhythm with one another and singing kumbaya.  Kevin Arnold's sister in The Wonder Years was one.  Some of you may not know where I am going with this, but I have confidence tha you soon will.  Back on subject, the communist movement in America was a peaceful revolution indicating that the population under American soverignty was not satisfied by the way the central governemnt did things.  As I said before, revolution is just a natural reaction of the people and by the people to let their mandated government body that something is seriously wrong.  The communist-society movement in America was not a small group of people picketing at the White House.  Their numbers grew swiftly, reaching up to 2 million participants.  How did the American government react to this threat?  They simply made it illegal to sue for communism.  Remember the McArthyites?  That was the US's response.  All successful revolutions in the past WERE illegal.  It was essentially looked upon by the government as treason, and with it came a heavy penalty.<br>
<br>
Now Gsam, what I am going to say now is going to cut right through your argument.  Americans are conformists.  We all conform.  You can argue however long you want to about how individualist you are, how unique you are.  But in the end you will only find yourself in utter hypocrisy.  Yes Gsandwich, it is our duty as citizens of this powerful country to support its decisions.  We will go to war.  We will remove Saddam and his regime.  We will set up a puppet government for whatever reasons (domestic economic issues or political redistribution of power in the name of peace.)  That is a whole other issue.  As strong as some people are opposed to this war, they are probably not going to resign their citizenship to America.  Sounds harsh, but honestly, ask yourself(those who are vehemently opposed to this war) if you are going to forfeit your citizenship to this country because of this unjust war?  I'm sure we all know the answer, and it is because we like our way of life in America.  We like that we have high speed internet so we can play EQ without worrying about lag as much as the 56kers do.  We like it that we all have cars and we can all live somewhere and we all have opportunities available to us.  Welfare is a wonderful attraction to those who are not financially secure.  We conform in the direction of our liking.  Free speech is available to all(to a certain extent.)  No where else in the entire world are the rights of every single individual citizen of America more protected.  All these thing are wonderful.  America has the largest number of immigrants each year, because the immigrants want to assimilate into a wonderful environment with wonderful benefits.  Don't get me wrong, there are people who exploit American policies, but the policies are there nonetheless and we all conform. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kadandrumtally>Kadandrum Tally</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.cartooncars.com/images/print/bmw/e46m3silv.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 590<br> <font color=#333333>(3/21/03 2:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cartooncars.com/images/print/bmw/e46m3silv.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: France offers compermise?</span><hr size=1> He Kron:<br>

Using that reasoning Kad, would you liken the US's full support for Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran and the Kurds in Hallabja in the same way as you do above.  Ie- do you think that US/UK rewarding Saddam with financial packages after these atrocities is equitable with Saddam gassing those people?  Because that is exactly what that argument of yours above would infer is the case.<br>
<br>
  In fact, it's even more of a travesty- Saddam doesn't supply the suicide bombers with the tools(the Saudis take care of that and they're our *allies)- whereas the US &amp; UK certainly did supply the materials and the means for Saddam to build the weapons.  <br>
<br>
I think it's important to note Kad, that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Jordan's governments all contribute far more heavily to suicide bomber's families.  Not just that, but Saudi Arabia probably contains more support for fundamentalist terrorism and suicide bombers in terms of arms, equipment, funds.  The Saudi government continues to turn a blind eye to fanatical wahabist elements in their country that support terrorism on an entirely different scale from Saddam.  Has anyone forgotten the nationalities of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>vast majority</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the 9/11 hijackers?  They weren't Iraqi that's for sure.  But the US &amp; UK don't mind because the Saudis, Kuwaitis, Jordanians and others are allies- irrespective of whether powerful forces in these countries harbour terrorists, they will never be invaded.  <br>
<br>
Saddam's support for the Palestinian struggle is a political ploy, no more no less.  He seeks to liken his struggle against US oppression to the Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation.  Yet another example of how solving the Israel-Palestine question would weaken Saddam in the Arab world far more than going to war with him.  Fighting Saddam plays right into the hands of extremists for whom American involvement against Iraq sits very uncomfortably along a backdrop of unconditional support for Israel.  The political and social implications of this war are incredibly damaging to the region in the long run.  It reinforces my belief that action was hasty, short-sighted, with no serious or clearly thought out plan for a post-conflict scenario.  Getting a rabble of squabbling opposition candidates to form a show government a la Afghanistan appears to be likely outcome here- and we all saw where that's gotten us.  <br>
<br>
Any army that stays in Iraq too long to &quot;secure a peace&quot; would be seen as an army of occupation.  Only now do people begin to see the foolishness of abandoning the international consensus- with a UN mandate the army would be seen to be acting in the interests of the international community.  Without the UN mandate the army will be perceived as occupying the nation with UK/US forces.  I fear the disastrous consequences of pursuing conflict in this manner will present themselves far more clearly as time goes on.  Nothing would make me happier to be proven wrong in this regard- but my head tells me that it will be the likely result, even if my heart is unhappy with that analysis.<br>

<br>
I agree with you that most of these protesters will not denounce their american citizenship, and I agree with you that as a whole our country is conformist and has a very short memory overall.<br>
<br>
I havent done much reasearch on the mcarthyism and flower children commie movement your talking about so i have no comment on that matter.<br>
<br>
I even agree that revolution is healthy when done **PROPERLY**   These people out protesting at present have the wonderful right in this country to be able to go out and protest and I love the fact that they can, but most fail to realize that they are the minority in this matter.  I have seen polls showing that 60% on the low end to 95% of americans support this war and the presidents actions.  so at BEST 40% of the nation is against it, thats assuming the 40% remaining is all against it and not indifferent to the matter.<br>
<br>
What bothers me about the protesters is that they go out and scream their chants and have their slogans and make their accusations and when they dont get the results they want they do the same thing that they are condemning our govt for doing.  They say the US has broken international law by allowing talks to break down and are breaking the law by not following the rules and going to war.  Ummm these same people claiming that are the ones who are now breaking our own country's rules by blocking streets, delaying traffic, fighting with cops and basically using the fact that they are a VOCAL MINORITY to act like pricks (in most cases) because it gets the news crews out there to film the fights with cops.<br>
<br>
how can a group condemn our govt for not following world opinion on the matter and yet not follow the opinion of our own country? They are the minority, In no poll i have seen are the anti war people leading.<br>
<br>
Anyhow back to the topic xanthala, I dont think this is one of those instances where a rebellion is called for. Yes its right for people to express their displeasure with the govt if thats what they feel but rebellions are more along the lines of people who are being opressed like the iraqi's and such. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.aladarya.com/tiigsig01.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hakatri>Hakatri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#333333>(3/21/03 2:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1939.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> The rebellion can come at the polls in 2004.

Often people face this choice: Work in McDonalds or go to the infantry.<br>
That said, it hurts to hear that marines died, in my view for no reason. What i am missing in matters of respect for soldiers those who are leading this war are missing respect for life.

<br>
No, I don't.  The difference is that Saddam rewards terrorists where the US/UK supported Iraq against Iran who had, several years earlier, become incredibly anti-American and anti-West.   If you care, Ayatollah Khomeini ruled with an iron fist -- they mass executed Iranians, initiated a religious police, and even executed people for minor offenses.  In 1979 (I think that was the year) Iranians seized the US embassy and took US civilian hostages.  Several years later, the Iraq/Iran war began.  Thank God for President Reagan who easily disarmed the hostage crisis where President Carter had blundered ridiculously.  Point is, Iran hated America so much that it made good sense to arm the Iraqis fighting the Iranians.  <br>
<br>
Point is, Saddam rewarded terrorists.  The US armed Iraqis in a military conflict.  I concede that both contribute to this loss of life which in and of itself is terrible.  I also concede that, in Saddam's mind, there is no difference.  But there is a difference and it is that Saddam has specifically rewarded suicide bombers who target children on busses and civilians while they shop at markets.<br>

Good sense?  Perhaps if you were a short-sighted hawk looking for a quick-fix military solution.  Perhaps if you were able to set aside the qualms about giving WMD and political approval of their use against civilian targets.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Millions</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> died in an Iraqi war of aggression that was largely made possible by US support.  An Iranian colleague I work with (our toxins specialist) treated some of the soldiers and civilians hit by just some of the 15,000 tonnes of tabun supplied to Iraq by the US administration of the time.  He's spoken to me at length about the horrific and permanent effects that it causes, permanently paralyzing intercostal chest muscles, the victims slowly suffocating to death, unable to breathe.  He told me about <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>thousands</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of civilians surviving to this day on iron lungs as a result, many of those affected perishing to opportunistic infections over a period of months.  It's one thing reading about the terrible effects of these weapons in my medical texts, it's one thing being informed on how to brief our local emergency authorities on a response- it was quite a different thing to hear an eye-witness tale from a colleague I work with and respect.<br>
<br>
  Ten times as many human beings met their end, most in terrible pain as a result of the use of this US-supplied WMD than were murdered on 9/11- and you call the policy good sense.  I'm flabbergasted to be honest, appalled by your description of it- not that I haven't heard it before.  As for it being good policy- the course of events since that support show that up for the lie it is.  Arming a dangerous dictator forced us to commit troops to throw him out of Kuwait.  I was 100% behind the first Gulf war, the case was made and a powerful international mandate backed by a huge Arab and international coalition and their forces was painstakingly assembled.  <br>
<br>
Yet I still believe that the first Gulf war would never have taken place without the overwhelming support and arming of the Iraqi regime by the Reagan administration.  We are still living with the consequences of that short-sighted policy of arming a dictator today- both our countries have lost sons in this war already.  If the Reagan administration had considered the consequences of its actions we wouldn't even have the slimmest of cases now being used to put our nations' sons in harm's way once more.<br>
<br>
Lastly- what completely destroys your argument about the US supporting Saddam purely to kill Iranian soldiers and civilians is the attack on Hallabja.  Explain to me how it was in US interests to support Saddam after he gassed 5,000 of his own people, all Kurds at Hallabja.  Those 5,000 might be the fortunate ones- they perished, but about 20,000 survivors of those attacks live on, horribly and permanently scarred physically and emotionally.  A Channel 4 documentary a week ago showed a woman blinded in the attack trying to raise her children (both suffering from birth defects caused by chemical poisoning)- in the absence of her husband who died in front of her that day, drowned by his bleeding lungs in front of her.<br>
<br>
You claim the United States stands up for freedom and the protection of innocents who need that protection under international law.  Indeed our government has been just as vocal about its stance on innocents.  Yet where were we when these pitiable villagers were made victims of a despicable war crime?  We were lining Saddam's pockets, that's where we were- we were arming him with the very WMD we now claim he still has, supporting a military industrial complex we now seek to dismantle by force, killing yet more people in the process.  To this day there has been no international calling to account- no decision taken under international law to pursue a tribunal.  The reasoning for that is simple- our governments don't want to be dragged through the mud for the despicable part they played in the suffering of thousands of innocents, suffering they not only helped bring about, but actually rewarded Saddam Hussein for.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Point is, Saddam rewarded terrorists. The US armed Iraqis in a military conflict<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ok, that's a very shaky distinction in my mind- state-sponsored terrorism is to me no different from one person taking matters into their own hands, or even a few people.  In fact, history tells us that brutal governments have the potential to visit far more death and destruction than any terrorist group in the history of the planet.  Millions have died to single brutal governments before, the same can't be said for terrorist groups- not even collectively.  <br>
<br>
The more I think about the distinction you're trying to draw, the less it makes sense.  The US armed a brutal state regime to fight an enemy for it- they then rewarded deplorable war crimes with credit, equipment, weapons and hard cash.  Saddam is only doing a third of that- he isn't arming terrorists, nor is he giving them operational support- he just pays support to their families.  Understand Kad, that the majority of Arab opinion doesn't view these people as terrorists, but as soldiers, freedom fighters battling against an illegal occupation.  And where in your reasoning is the justification that the US tolerates all its allies in the region providing exactly the same support?  Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Jordan <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> provide far greater individual donations.  Why is it ok for them but not Saddam?  Or- if it isn't ok for them to pursue this terrorist support, why isn't the US government adding them to the &quot;axis of evil&quot; or addressing the issue in public?  If you think support for suicide bombers' families is unspeakably wrong, then why is the US seeking the support of terrorist-funding nations?  That doesn't play at all well with the Arab street.<br>
<br>
They view Saddam's donations (as well as Saudi, Yemeni, Kuwaiti, Qatari and Omani donations)- as support for the bereaved family of a soldier/martyr.  You might label them with a facile swagger as terrorists- but that's not what most in the region think they are.  Personally I don't see any difference between suicide bombers and Saddam Hussein- support for either of their causes is equally deplorable morally:  no policy can justify supporting either and it would hurt us to pursue such thinking in any way.  Past decisions are hurting us today, this war would not be necessary if the correct decision was made 20, 10 or even 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
But since you seem determined to draw the distinction between the two- what about US support for the mujahadeen?  They were terrorists, no question about it- suicide attacks on Soviet troops were a standard tactic in several of the death-squads that were trained by a CIA funded operative called...you guessed it, Osama bin Laden.  The US trained bin Laden, funded mujahadeen operations, and armed them to the hilt.  As for rewards?  It's impossible to say what rewards or to what extent individuals were rewarded, but this much can be said- Osama bin Laden's private wealth increased two-hundred fold during the Soviet incursion of Afghanistan.  Not bad for a guerilla fighter living on the run...and what do you think he did with his rewards Kad, put it in a pension fund?  I think the answer to that question can be found in the extensively funded Al-Qaeda cells buried in cities all over the world.  That is the price of short-sighted policy Kad, look ye well, for we may all see similar costs of the war we currently fight.  <br>
<br>
You can give any justification you like for arming suicide bombers and terrorists- strategic, political or intelligence reasons.  But what you can't do is explain why that's any better than what Hussein currently does that you object to.  Hussein as I said doesn't arm terrorists- the US administration <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>did</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->- and innocents paid a terrible and bitter price for it- especially the people of New York, murdered by the short-sightedness of US foreign policy in the 1980s.  We continue to pay the price- terror alerts, economies torn by uncertainty, diplomatic alliances of 50 years shattered overnight.  Short-sighted and pathetically inadequately thought out policies like that make me think very strongly about its consequences- because I don't see that the lesson of history has been learned.  If we truly hate war, if we truly want to see a safe, stable and peaceful Middle East- then its time we stopped making the same bloody mistakes over and over and over and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>over</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> again.  Otherwise we'll be fighting a war a decade in the Middle East- that'll keep the defence contracters and the terrorists happy, but nobody else.<br>
