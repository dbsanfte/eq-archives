It's a shame my first post has to be on this particular forum, but I'm at my wit's end.  I know there's nothing that can be done (so I have been &quot;officially&quot; informed) but I am so frustrated, I just HAD to vent.  Lucky you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yesterday afternoon, after hundreds of hours and literally thousands of credits, I finally found the Blessed with Thunder attack.  I was thrilled beyond belief.  The quality level was a little high, but at least I had finally found it.  My partner and I head over to the mission site..and almost die getting there (the site was surrounded by very red nasties).  We knew we had to be careful, especially without the ability to zone out of we got in trouble.  We took our time, broke the mission carefully and without incident.  I should mention that this was an &quot;observe&quot; mission.  My partner, who had found the mission, simply had to target a named NPC in the final &quot;boss&quot; room to complete the mission.<br>
<br>
It took nearly two hours to get ready to zone into the final room.  Our primary goal was to target the named to complete the mission.  Depending on how the boss room looked, we would then decide if we were also going to kill everything in it.  We zone in, my partner frantically starts targeting mobs.  Four regular mobs (conning deep orange) and one named (conning light red).  We zone out.  Nothing.  Double check the mission.  The named in the room is NOT the named listed on the mission.  Zone back in and kill two non-named mobs.  My partner is again frantically targeting everything in the room.  We zone.  Again, nothing.  We zone back in, moving directly into a back corner with no aggro.  My partner notices there is a ramp to an upper level and is able to get up the ramp without aggro.  Still no named mob.  He turns to come back down when he hits a bug and falls to his &quot;death&quot; for 138 points of damage.<br>
<br>
Frustration sets in, as does aggro, and I'm dead before I know what really happened.  We both petition the problems and find another mission to do while we wait.  My partner's petition times out after the 4 hour limit, but an ARK representative responds to mine.  Does anyone need 20 guesses as to what the outcome was?  He is very sorry.  Yes, it was a bug.  Yes, he will report it.  No, there isn't anything he can do.  No, he cannot give me the attack (I didn't ask for it).  No, he cannot replace the mission (which I did ask; I asked for a replacement mission with the same reward).  When I again reiterated how rare the attack was, how long it took me to find it, at what cost, and the fact I cannot simply &quot;buy&quot; it from another player, he simply apologized again and said the only way to get the attack was to &quot;find another mission that rewards it&quot; or &quot;find the shop that will, on rare occasion, sell it.&quot;  <br>
<br>
AARRGGGHHH!!!!!!!  What does he think I've been doing for the last three weeks?  Sitting on my hands?  Every time I enter a city, ANY CITY, I check the shops.  I spend a minimum of 1/2 hour looking for THAT attack from the mission booths before I'll even THINK about another mission.  Now I get to start all over.  And the worst part is, it's not something anyone can help me with.  It's not like my guildmates or friends can look for it when I'm not on line or when I'm not grouped with them or if they find it in a solo mission.  I have to be on line; they have to get it from a group mission booth and they have to have room/make room in their group for me and PRAY that I am awarded the attack at the end of the mission.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the place to vent.  I feel a little better but still am bitterly disappointed.  I'm not going to give up, though.  If you need me, I'll be the one standing by the mission booths..searching.<br>
