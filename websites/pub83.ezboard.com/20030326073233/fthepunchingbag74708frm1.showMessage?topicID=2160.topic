I'm a lvl 67 MA Opt. I fight with 2 Halzen Claws and the standard buffs, Sub guidance, MA master, Dirty fighter, etc. I can hit pretty hard avg 200 with buffs and crit tops out at 830ish.<br>
I'm getting some good implants made to bring my physical init higher, its currently maxed and I max it every lvl.<br>
My question is... Is it worth trying to get my Physical Init higher and higher? I understand that I need this skill to hit faster, but I read somewhere that fists attacks have a max speed. Basically, am I already hitting as fast as I ever will? Will continuously raising my Physic Init make me hit faster? Is there a max speed at which I can hit and increasing Physical Init will not improve it?<br>
<br>
Thank you for your help my Masters.<br>

I can never remember the specifics about why other than IP sinkhole, but you attack less often with double claws than claw/fist. You'll also do less damage with claw/claw I believe.<br>
<br>
MA attack speed caps out at 1s/1s and I think you need 650 Phys Init to reach that speed. Fist only is around half that I think.<br>
<br>
I'm sure if I'm wrong, one of the more number knowledgeable folks around here will correct me. Or you can search through the threads for the answers. I know one of the other members here made a post with links pointing to some of the more common areas. <p>Bellerephon<br>

(All tests are with fists/MA weaps that are hitting at full speed - 1s/1s. Also, i used all of the following MA weaps and saw no difference in speeds between any of them as long as they all had the appropriate amount of phys init to have them hit at full speed - Parry stick, Claw, Wall Blade, Taichi, Crescent, &amp; my WW katana for the fists + 1 weap only) <br>

The FAQ post that Ikagawa just bumped has the technical details as to why 1 is better than 2.<br>
<br>
AO &quot;hard caps&quot; player attack speed at 1.0 seconds attack and 1.0 seconds recharge no matter what weapon.  At full aggressive (agg/def slider) you only need ~150 Phys Init to use pure fists at full speed, and only ~300 Phys Init to use fists+claw at full speed.  All of your &quot;extra&quot; Phys Init will NOT allow you to attack faster than 1s Attack/1s Recharge, but it WILL allow you to lower your agg/def bar and assume a more defensive posture (take more advantage of your evades) and still hit at full speed.  Check that FAQ again for more details.<br>
<br>
Somewhere around the &quot;low 110s-120s&quot; you will be better off dropping your claw and going to pure fists, since your claw attack rating will really start lagging far behind your fist attack rating.  And since attack rating has a large impact on your chance to crit, you will eventually reach a break point where the extra damage from your increased fist criticals actually outweighs the increased number of attacks gained from using the claw.  Since all of this depends on where you have spent your IP and what your implants and equipment are like, there is no solid level threshhold I can give you.  Just do what Maxius did: sometime between 110 and 140, try some fights with and without the claw and note the damage and # of crits...if you can't discern a difference there is not much reason to change...once you CAN tell a difference in your crits/damage-over-time it's time to stop using your claw. (There are even some 3rd party damage tracking utilities out there now that can help you make this assessment.)<br>
<br>
If you are nearing level 70 as an MA, your next major goal should be to get into Q125 implants ASAP, and start hoarding/spending IP so that you can self-buff Vulnerability Seeker.  If you are VERY aggressive with IP and implants, you can self-buff V Seeker at level 74.  Less obsessive MAs can get VS by level 80 without much trouble.  But no matter what your pace, V Seeker is your next milestone..the sooner you reach it, the better. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I did some non-scientific tests and discovered that I crit hit much more with at least 1 claw than I do without. Also, with dual claws I have 3 attack bars as opposed to 2 w/ one claw and only 1 w/ 0 claws.<br>
I swear I do more damage with 2 claws and crit more often. When I have just fists I can hit as hard but there is the advantage of MA Attacks like BwT. Its really too bad we can use a weapon and use special attacks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I will continue to use double claws until I find that I cannot find a higher QL. Only then will I go to fist only.<br>
This is obviously a personal decision. It may be wrong but I'm still a padawon so I must learn for myself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Tell me, which attack rating is higher...the one based 100% upon your green MA skill + all of your MA buffs, or the one based 33% upon your blue piercing skill (+ perhaps piercing expertise)?  When you use even one claw, you give up fist attacks for claw attacks.  When you use *2* claws, you give up even MORE fist attacks.  Do you really think your claws do more damage than your fists?  How much LESS damage are your claw crits than your fist crits...have you noticed?<br>
<br>
While wielding a 2nd claw is certainly not costing you all THAT much additional damage at your level, I can guarantee that you ARE better off with 1 claw+fists.<br>
<br>
But as you say, you must learn for yourself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

AODD simply adds up all of the damage that is done by you or anyone who's name you enter into it and spit out a total. It does not care what level you are, what level the monster is or what weapons, if any, you are using, and spits it out the total when you tell it to. So, what you will have to do is go find 2 mobs that you can fight one at a time, that are the same level and type(mutant camp?) and check the total for each fight. I would suggest multiple trials before I made a decision.<br>
AODD cannot attach nano damage to the dealer because AODD gets its info from the chat text. Chat text does not specify who did the nano damage so it just counts all nano damage done to any enemy. This is also tracked seperately from all other damage types. If you are using MA attacks instead of weapons, you should definetly add this in to get a true reading of how much each setup did for damage. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/character/bio/d/1/name/viirruss">Viirruss</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

When doing your testing, I would recommend a mutant hunting ground (best), or an even con mission (not quite as favorable).  The idea is to be able to find multiple mobs with the exact same stats.  Be sure to target them and hit the &quot;t&quot; key so you can check their level (unless they are deep red).  If they are the same TYPE of mob and almost identical in level, you can run your test.  Be sure to run your test alone.<br>
<br>
If you are using MA special attacks such as BwT, for example, be sure and follow Viirruss' advice and add the nano damage to your total...since the special attack damage will be nano damage and not summed into your total damage (AODD has to track it separately).<br>
<br>
Remember, I am not advocating you ditch claws altogether.  My MA used a claw until about 130th level.  They are a great weapon, and I would often use them in conjunction with BwT by simply dropping the claw onto the hotbar for easy unequipping/equipping during combat.  <br>
<br>
But you should typically only use ONE claw, and then only if certain conditions apply: 1) Your Phys Init is 300+, 2) Your Piercing is kept maxxed at ALL TIMES, 3) You implant for Piercing to keep it as high as possible so it doesn't lag too far behind your MA attack rating, and 4) if you ALWAYS have the highest level claw you can self-equip.<br>
<br>
Good luck!<br>

I will be changing to fist only for a while. My attack w/ claw is 375. My attack wo/ it jumped to 450ish.<br>
Is the &quot;Attack&quot; a reliable number? A higher attack directly relates to more damage?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

First off it decides whether you actually hit or not, if you are parried or not (in the case of melee attacks), and how much damage is done if you hit. I am not sure if it increases the frequency of crits or just the amount damaged dealt by them. I hope that helps.<br>
I can vouch for this as I also play an enforcer. Our challenger line of nano's DIRECTLY effects out attack rating, and all of these things happen when we use it. The challenger line is much like the MA's controlled destruction line. It adds damage and attack rating for a short period of time, shutting down nano skills for a bit. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.anarchy-online.com/character/bio/d/1/name/viirruss">Viirruss</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
