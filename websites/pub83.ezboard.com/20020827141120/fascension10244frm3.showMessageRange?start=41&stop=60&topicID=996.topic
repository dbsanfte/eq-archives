<br>
I will give you my stance and my feeling as far as Teralonis goes.  I also know the player behind Teralonis and I know for a fact that the character is not a renamed Xbena.  Her privacy is not one I am willing to comprimise however so that is as far as my information goes, my word and the word of many of our honorable Temerity officers.  Your guild and our guild have a very good relationship I think, we keep to ourselves and come out to help each other sometimes and most of all we have a lot of fun in this game.  Now, some PKs have come, post on your board and have you all stirred up.  If you'll notice, all of the evidince against her has been presented by these PKs which we know to be dishonorable people in the general and extreme.  If you were to KOS Teralonis based on their shoddy evidince, what is next?  The outcome would be that they have manipulated the entire situation, and your guild into KOSing an anti-pk manaburning, Voltaic smoking wizard.  It is counter-productive to say the least and really opens up the question, &quot;Who do you listen to?&quot;  I present my honor in support of this character not being Xbena.  If Voltaic's honor is greater, I am at a loss.<br>

<br>
(yes, another long post from me, please bear with it)<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Im just curious then why absolutly nobody in the high end <br>
&gt;&gt; game knows wtf this lvl 60 femnale gnome epic MB wizzard &gt;&gt; is. <br>
<br>
That is the way she likes to play.  Temerity was actually founded on only doing things we could do as a small number of players.  Doing pog with 4, dying deep in a dungeon that was way over our head, getting epics with pickup groups (taking twice as long, but getting em done) or within our guild only, etc.  Same reason people don't know Zyzzyvar, Zamslam, Maelikai, Metralonis, Esialet,  or other people of Tera's era that are pretty high level, these guys just didn't hang out with people they didn't know.  They have no ego driven desire to be out and about making a name, but rather playing the game in their way, not as defined by anyone else.  How many people even know me?  56 epic cleric that did all that epic without any uber help and with pickup groups only until last step (thanks Whaaagh!).   And I started Temerity (a guild that is what 2.5 years old or more?), TRG, and helped start Whaaagh and I constantly run into people that have no clue who I am.   Sorry, but our guild has a lot of the silent type players, birds of a feather type thing.  <br>
<br>
Your are judging her based on how YOU like to play the game, and that is NOT the same for everyone.  Especially Temerity and No Tears folk.  We are a minority and differ greatly.  One of those differences is that a lot of us just dont do message boards.  Look at Nuciferous, she wont even go to the guild message board, and she is 60 epic druid, and I wonder how many people know her given she solos so much or is powerlevelling her tank that is what 50+ and no one knows but less than 10 to 20 people?  It is very common in our guild.  People keep the game IN the game, not out here where people confuse game elements with real life elements and things get personal rather than staying in character.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; It is really hard to be a complete unknown in such a small <br>
&gt;&gt; community.<br>
<br>
Ah, it is a set of small communties not one community.  And we aren't in yours nor do we interact much until very recently where AD and Whaaagh start to cross zones.  Frankly, we just dont like your version of the game, and you probably dont like ours.  A good reason to stay off to the side.<br>
<br>
It isn't hard to get to 60, really.  It is time in, and as a wiz that time can be solo.  Me personally, I just boot up 5 machines and powerlevel like mad and can do 50 within 3-4 days on more than one twink at the same time, and I can take it up from there to 60 quickly if that is all I wanted to do all day.  It isn't hard to get aaxp, even easier than getting 60, again quad kiting rules as a wizard with almost a blue bub a quad at 59 in the right spots with only enough down time to med to full with C3 and go again.<br>
<br>
And It isn't hard to get wiz epic.  Really.  It is one of the first few Temerity took mobs down for, Ptaah I think took the first one home.  Fear is the tough spot, but there are so many pickup and GM lead fear raids on Legends that its silly to NOT have that fight done, and there is less competition there for epics since a lot of people there had them when they arrived.   Looking at Graffe's, there are a lot more MB wizards out there than most people think, and a ton of epic wizards, even all the ganks are getting outfitted with the epic.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Also it isnt just the words of Volt, and Guznuk... if you <br>
&gt;&gt; have read all of these posts you will see there are <br>
&gt;&gt; observations by several VERY trustworthy people <br>
<br>
but it is the ganks that started it and only after voltaic was slain so many times that day by Temerity (and mainly Tera), it was voltaic who led everyone to believe that was Tera's first day on the server (it wasn't), it is the ganks that provide the evidence that so many people are repeating as if it is proven truth yet provide no substance, it is the ganks that no one is even questioning but taking their word at face value.  That makes me very curious.  The honorable people you spoke of are just listening to these statements and giving opinions, they aren't the ones driving the conversation or claiming to have proof.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; maybe its not, but some sort of proof would be the best <br>
&gt;&gt; thing you could do to clear this up... <br>
<br>
First, I gave some very good reference points that were damn good proof:<br>
<br>
Why hasn't anyone just asked Objective about his alt that was slain by Xbena (his first MB death he said) around the same time he was grouped with Tera in SkyShrine.  I'm pretty sure I posted that there was overlap between the two chars and that Objective was witness to one of them (I was brought in to rez him around that time from another death).  Why hasn't anyone contacted that Township Rebellion person that Tera talked to in early May about being a recruit (damn, now I forget the name, but it is in my prior posts on the Legends question).  <br>
<br>
I'm digging through old Temerity screenshots to find Tera in the early days, so after I rummage through all my machines, I'll pull up one of those.  That is about as good as it gets for proof in this game.  Just have to get a few old computers running.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;  why hasnt the owner said a thing? <br>
<br>
Because this discussion isn't in the game but rather is in an extension to the game that not everyone accepts.  I myself get more tells and messages from friends telling me not to come up here than I do FOR coming up here.  Like I said, different communities.  And there are people that have talked to her in game that seem fine with her afterwards.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utelaise.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Telaise</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333333>(6/17/02 1:22:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Guz guz guz</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt; it's about looking at the fucking situation. <br>
<br>
I really wish you could have a discussion without being an insulting ass.  That is what makes it so hard for us to listen to anything you say.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Is it a coincidence this person has appeared same race, same class, same AA level shortly after Xbena disappears? <br>
<br>
Actually they could have quite different aaxp points and we wouldn't know.  Mistress/Master is a very big range of aaxp, huge even.  Also, Xbena was around when Teralonis got back for at least 2 weeks if not more, and those weeks being BEFORE Voltaic started this thread so dont pull the imaginary level 5 Eurdite Xbena unless you believe that level 5 can manaburn.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; Do we find it strange you guys refuse to post <br>
&gt;&gt; screenshots? <br>
<br>
Of what?!?  Of a /played that means nothing?  You asked for the dumbest screenshot that proves absolutely nothing and you are stuck on it.  Get un stuck, for without knowing the exact Xbena birth date it means nothing.  You dont know if they are the same or different, you are just harrassing someone.  <br>
<br>
And since our lives dont revolve around screenshot kills of victims, we just dont have constant screenshots handy, nor do we expect big accusations like this (although I'm logging everything due to it now adays) to come about that require them.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt; It simply all adds up to the conclusion you're trying to <br>
&gt;&gt; deny<br>
<br>
Jumping to conclusions is rather easy, especially since you can sell almost anything when you dont have to back it up.  Why are you guys fighting providing proof of your accusations so hard?  Why are YOU refusing to provide any proof?  Why do you answer every post with a deragatory post rather than one that provides real discussion?  Are the insults something you use when you dont have an arguement?<br>

Yes, because it is pure conjecture.  It is possible that she is from your view point, but there is nothing to indicate how probable it is.  Its kinda like giving someone the death penalty with the jury saying &quot;I think he did it, nothing was shown to prove it, but he looks like the kind of guy to kill someone and the prosecution sounded so sure that he did it, lets fry the bastard!&quot;  There is a big jump there from being suspicious to acting on suspicions.<br>

Temerity still claims fervently that Teralonis is not Xbena. Despite that you refuse to offer a /played screenshot to clear it up. Now I don't automatically assume that means she is Xbena, however it does lead me to believe that the screenshot would only confirm that she appeared around the same time Xbena was made. Obviously not conclusive in itself, but given the many similarities between the two characters? It seems fairly convincing. Now everyone could be wrong and Teralonis might not have been Xbena. However if that turns out not to be the case I'd imagine people will be pretty annoyed about being lied to and mocked. <br>

Voltaic &lt;U&gt;is&lt;/U&gt; a ganker, a liar, and like his friends, a faggot.<br>
<br>
They have based all their evidence on their opinion as to what &quot;could&quot; be true.<br>
<br>
But lets take a look on the outside looking in.<br>
<br>
<br>
-Telaise could be lying and could have purchased the account Xbena.<br>
-She could have gone to Legends and had it renamed..then come back and join an anti guild.<br>
<br>
But the other side of our entertaining story is that it could be very possible that she isn't lying and is actually telling the truth.<br>
<br>
She could have gone to legends to level up a new character and earn the MB ability there.<br>
<br>
Then return to Rallos Zek to destroy those who are whining now (ironic?)<br>
<br>
The facts are this<br>
<br>
Xbena payed for or not, is no longer around.<br>
<br>
a new MB wizzie, payed for or not..with no facts supporting the case represented by people who are known well to lie, is around and KILLING them.<br>
<br>
Why wouldnt Voltaic and Guznuk be making or accusing this person of this, I mean it is by all means believable and I could myself understand it.<br>
<br>
Unless hardcore evidence is given by the plantiff (i.e. the accusers) then there should be no question that the person accused is innocent.<br>
<br>
It wouldnt hold up in real life, why should it in a game.<br>
<br>
I will leave my discussion at rest here, but for those of you looking for a fight...fight those who have taken your belongings and time, and remember what exactly this person you are acussing is doing for you and what Guznuk and Voltaic havent.<br>
<br>
I put my full support behind the accused..and hats off to the accusers...they have mastered the art of deception and trickery!<br>

That's the fault of the person buying the account. When you buy it, you accept the responsibility of the previous owner.  Sucks to spend that much money and now be KOS to everyone, not to mention buying an account that has at least 2 warnings on it.  But I guess Xbena didn't tell her that.<br>
<br>
Other thing is, if Teralonis lied to everyone about being Xbena, it's possible that she's lying about being Teralonis, and is in fact the original Xbena. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=237266"><img src="http://www.waccamawlandscaping.com/crit.gif" border=1></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#333333>(6/17/02 7:16:30 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> While Guznuk is indeed a big liar and spinner, I think here it's pretty clear that Teralonis has been 'owned'.
