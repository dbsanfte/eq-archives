Once the Legends service, with its <br>premium content and enhanced service guidelines, was announced, a group of <br>us quickly realized our intention to migrate to the premium server. Through <br>aggressive cross-server recruitment, promotion, and planning, we insured <br>that by the time the Legends service opened we had a large number of <br>customers ready and willing to join us. For example, on the day the <br>Stormhammer went live, we had approximately two hundred accounts committed <br>to our guild. The Township Rebellion guild of today still includes at our <br>core many of the 200 accounts present on that first day. Our reasons for <br>moving to the server was to instigate a fresh start and partake in the <br>promised new content and experiences legends had to offer.<br><br>Since that day our guild has consistently demonstrated a high level of game <br>play. Our accomplishments in-game has matched and exceeded that of the top <br>guilds in Everquest. We very quickly became &quot;the&quot; high profile guild to <br>measure the success of your service by. And you will note we always <br>portrayed a positive attitude towards the server, staff and players. Our <br>site and accomplishments were very quickly picked up and viewed by players <br>on all servers in Everquest.<br><br>When the inevitable conflicts over spawns with other guilds on Stormhammer <br>began, we have consistently demonstrated a willingness to resolve problems <br>and issues as suggested by the staff of the Stormhammer service. For <br>example, we delayed waking the Sleeper in Sleeper's Tomb for over three <br>months at the suggestion of the Stormhammer staff. Additionally, for a <br>substantial time prior to the institution of a &quot;calendar&quot; system, we <br>voluntarily avoided spawns more representative of earlier phases of the game <br>(e.g., North Temple of Veeshan) and devoted our guilds focus to new content <br>which was not in pursuit or conflict with any other guild entities on the <br>server. When the &quot;calendar&quot; system was forced upon us, the staff admitted <br>that spawn conflicts were greatly diminished, primarily due to our voluntary <br>efforts.<br><br>We quickly became disillusioned with the promises of new content, events, <br>and enhanced services that had initially prompted us to move to the server <br>and form a community here. It became painfully obvious that even the Server <br>GMs were being held hostage by the fact that they didn’t have the content <br>that was needed to pacify so many high level players on the server.<br><br>Although we did not agree with the calendar system forced upon us, we did <br>accept it in order to work with Sony staff and provide a comfortable <br>community for the server. We also placed our trust in the Customer service <br>staff when they said “trust us it will be OK”.<br><br>After participation in the calendar system, our guild has reached the <br>conclusion that a definite and distinct pattern of biased exists against our <br>guild through repeated acts of the Customer service staff (and principally <br>through decisions made by GM &quot;Bordael&quot;). In short, the calendar system is <br>not being enforced fairly and is currently administered so that it is biased <br>against TR.<br><br>We have considered this previously and did not take steps then, due to the <br>repeated assurances from GM &quot;Bordael&quot; that such favoritism would stop, the <br>inconsistencies would halt, and the Legends as advertised would appear. In <br>direct discussions with Senior GM staff we were assured that certain actions <br>on the part of the GM’s would be “looked in to” and “addressed”. Time frames <br>were placed on questionable GM decisions with promises of direct action <br>items to ensure these occurrences would not happen again. None of this has <br>happened; in fact the inconstancies have grown in number.<br><br>We view this as a &quot;bait and switch&quot;, and as such, fraud. We were drawn to <br>the server under false premise and guidelines of an “enhanced gaming <br>service”. The incidents which support this bias are too lengthy and numerous <br>to recite in this letter, however, rest assured they have been documented <br>and have been submitted in our complaint to the San Diego Better Business <br>Bureau, whom we've been informed has on previous occasion dealt with nearly <br>100 cases against SOE.<br><br><br>Notice<br><br>Given the current environment on the Stormhammer server, the bias <br>demonstrated by the staff, and our inability to amicably resolve these <br>issues through the normal customer service process, SOE is hereby placed on <br>notice that Township Rebellion henceforth withdraws and no longer recognizes <br>as legitimate, the calendar system forced upon the Stormhammer players. As <br>of July 24th, 2002 Township Rebellion will return to the &quot;free-for-all&quot; play <br>style found on nearly every other Everquest server.<br><br>This decision has been made with great sadness. Each one of Township <br>Rebellion's accounts represent players who have dedicated enormous time, <br>energy and money into SOE's Everquest game. Many of our players have over <br>one year of Everquest play time. Many of our players have been involved with <br>Everquest since the beta test. In short, we take our gaming experience in <br>Everquest seriously. Which is why are taking such extreme measures in light <br>of the waste of our time and money.<br><br>We recognize that our planned course of action may cause some friction with <br>the Stormhammer staff. Rest assured that TR members will play Everquest in a <br>manner consistent within the rules issued by SOE for game play across all <br>servers. However, SOE should also recognize that if the Stormhammer staff <br>takes arbitrary retaliatory action against our players/accounts, as we are <br>most certain GM &quot;Bordael&quot; will condone and attempt to influence us with, we <br>would consider such actions as a serious matter. Any such action will be <br>documented, internally reviewed, and publicized if found to be arbitrary or <br>capricious. In this regard please understand that TR's web site receives <br>over 10,000 hits daily from Everquest subscribers and we have reached <br>agreement with other top-tier (i.e., endgame capable) guilds and <br>guildleaders (e.g., www.fohguild.org &quot;Furor&quot;) in <br>Everquest for the use of their web space for additional publicity as well as <br>popular Everquest message boards.<br><br>In closing,<br><br>We are quite unhappy with the situation on Stormhammer. We came here under <br>the premise of an enhanced gaming experience only to have imposed on us a <br>calendar system NOT publicized or accepted prior to the populace leaving <br>their former servers.<br><br>We feel in its current state it, most especially with the lead GM in charge <br>of customer service on Stormhammer being GM &quot;Bordael&quot;, we will never be <br>treated with un-bias toward our guild. If another lead customer service GM <br>can be assigned in replacement of GM &quot;Bordael&quot; perhaps we can move forward.<br><br>Our goal is not to cause problems for any player or staff member. We simply <br>wish to play the game we have grown to love over the last nearly four years. <br>Should the server staff wish to continue with its change in policy and <br>attempt to impose a calendar, TR is willing to consider relocation to <br>another server, under certain circumstances. As you may recognize, players <br>who transfer to Stormhammer must leave behind their friends/guilds on their <br>home servers, and therefore, the current ability to return to our home <br>servers does not offer a solution or the prospect of splitting up the guild <br>we have built here, in good faith, for six months. Nor does the ability to <br>move to a different server without any equipment received through years of <br>hard work make much sense.<br><br>Also keep in mind the premise that people moved here under is quite <br>different than that initially promised by SOE. Thus, TR feels some what held <br>hostage here on Stormhammer and is willing to consider relocation, en mass, <br>to another Everquest server, so long as that server:<br><br>(1) Does not have an existing &quot;end game&quot; guild;<br>(2) Is a server not specifically marketed to non-Americans<br>(3) Players may transfer with all their equipment and skills intact; and<br>(4) Any TR member who is willing to make the transfer can take advantage of <br>the transfer.<br>(5) The server is not subject to a newly created or imposed GM calendar <br>system or restraints outside the normal play policy in any way.<br><br>If SOE would be willing to entertain such a transfer, please contact us, you <br>will find us most cooperative.<br><br>Keep in mind we are happy to stay on the stormhammer server and continue <br>playing as was the intent on our move here and under the guidelines and <br>indications of what the server was to be prior to the move. However as <br>stated we will not be doing so under the arbitrary calendar imposed by the <br>server staff. Otherwise we are happy to discuss the above solution as a <br>win/win for everyone.<br><br>Again, it is in no way our intention to cause friction, problems, or <br>instigate any conflicts on the server.
