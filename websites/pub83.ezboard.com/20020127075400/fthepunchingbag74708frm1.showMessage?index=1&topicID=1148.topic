When a doctor heals someone for a lot the MoB then aggros the doctor... unless the doctor tgts himself with team heal. Also team heal uses less nano and so the doctor can heal more and longer. So maybe next time the &quot;ignorant&quot; ma will complain about his other team mates not doing enough dmg rather than complain about the one keeping him alive.

Team heals make it near impossible for anyone else to  use any nanos (at least during combat)<br>
Team heals do piddily healing and are less nano efficient than a regular heal on a single target.  Healing a target doesnt make the mob attack you, nobody really knows what makes the mob attack a doc.  Playing my doc I can be standing in another room and he will run past my group mates and go after me.  Agro is fucked in this game, period.<br>
<br>
If you want to heal one person, use the single heal.  It heals much more, is more efficient and wont fuck up your teams nano casting ability.  If you have 3 people getting hit at the same time or want to tap off your group's hp between fights use group. <p>- Sepulus</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uticcy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ticcy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#660000>(9/28/01 9:57:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1148.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Groupest thou not with morons</span><hr size=1> Heh, darn, that's useful info.

If the team heal isn't cutting it, it's time to risk the aggro.  It's the job of the tank to keep the mob pissed enough to stay on him.  I usually didn't have a prob keeping the doc safe.<br>
<br>
Not to mention the fact that team heals interfere with EVERYONE'S ability to cast.  Two of my best friends in-game were adventurers (RL married couple, apparently...).  We grouped a lot, and with all of us having heals, we could take a lot of damage.  None of us used team heals in a group, because it interrupts others and keeps them from casting.  We grouped once with a doctor who was all about the team heals (and some other players, their prof isn't really important).  Problem was, they just didn't do enough healing.  Fights were a lot closer than they would have been if the doc had (1) stayed back out of range a bit (aggro seems to be distance based to some degree) and (2) left the freakin team heal alone.<br>
<br>
Here's how I liked docs to heal:  Hit me with a heal when I'm in trouble, and I'll usually hit myself with one too.  My heal would usually do maybe 1/3-1/2 as much as the doc's heal, so I get some aggro too.  The whole fight (if I'm the tank) I'd pound the mob with my aggro enhancer and every bit of damage I could.  I'd use FA stims on myself whenever the opportunity arose.  I rarely had a mob lose interest for the docs or the NTs.  And if they did stop attacking me, it usually wasn't long before I could pull them back.  If nothing else, I'd heal the doc (straight, single-target heals), which would increase the odds of them surviving, as well as piss off the mob and make it more likely for me to be able to hold aggro.<br>
<br>
Sorry if this seemed a bit flamish, but I get pissed off when I hear about docs using team heals cuz otherwise they might get aggroed.  You do your job (keep my ass alive), and I'll do mine (keep the mob off you).  You shouldn't take the fact that some tanks suck at holding aggro as carte blanche to suck as healers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> edit</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->:  Also, what the hell is with Docs not wearing armor???  I've seen lots of docs that simply don't wear any armor.  Same for a lot of other casters.  I know that keeping the best armor possible is expensive and that docs don't always have the cash for it (casters are broke a lot cuz they have a harder time soloing missions for big money and drop a lot of cash on chargers) but that doesn't mean you should give up on armor entirely.  Can't afford to over-equip armor?  Fine, use some your level, or even one or two below.  But to just grab some Miir stuff and look cool is a little absurd and a lot dangerous.<br>
<br>
By the same token, docs aren't tanks, and shouldn't be attacking the mob under any circumstances.  Aggro is easy enough to come by for docs, they don't need the extra of breaking out a pair of Freedoms on a mob and kicking its ass.  Sure, break out the guns to solo, but keep your fingers off the triggers while you're grouped with me....<br>
<br>
(I feel like I should note here that one of the best docs I've ever played with had hodgepodge armor and used his newbie pistol into his twenties.) <p>~Jaqrabbit<br>

<br>
Of course there is.  And generally speaking, there are (for whatever reason) more good doctors than good tanks, even though there are FAR more soldiers and enforcers than doctors.  While I was still playing, I did a pretty good job of controlling the mobs, so I count myself as a good tank (if you want to call MAs tanks, anyway...).  I rarely died because of an incompetent doc, but bad pullers (when I wasn't pulling) frequently caused me to haul ass from the general area of the fight.<br>
<br>
I don't have a chip on my shoulder about docs, nor do I tell others how to play their profession unless they are doing something particularly stupid that they should know not to do, or that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> know to be a bad idea.  A doc starts blasting away and seems more interested in fighting than healing and I will suggest they get their ass back and heal, dammit!  Same for NTs.  They have nukes for a reason.  Soldier decides to shoot something other than what the main puller hits?  I'll bitch him out gladly!<br>
<br>
Now I'm not saying that I know everyone's class better than they do (I don't) but I read forums for other profs and make a concerted effort to familiarize myself with their abilities and common play strategies.  Also, having grouped a lot, I have a good feel for grouping strategies, and I know that there are some things you can do that will seriously fuck your group up.  Team Healing when there are other casters (and especially healers) in the group is one of them.  It pisses everyone off, and the excuse &quot;But I'll draw aggro if I don't&quot; has never held water with me.<br>
<br>
Facts:<br>
<br>
1)  Team heals interfere with other casters in your group<br>
2)  Team heals do not heal as well as single target heals<br>
3)  Team heals are not limited by range as long as team members are in the same zone<br>
<br>
Times when Team Heals are good:<br>
1)  Team is spread out and target(s) in need of healing are not in range of single target heal.<br>
2)  Team is not in combat and the doc is trying to reduce downtime.<br>
3)  Team has pulled a lot of adds and more than one person is being hit.<br>
<br>
In the above listed situations, team heals are good, so long as no one in your group is an NT (and therefore almost completlely dependent on casting for their damage output).  I don't mind docs using team heals in those situations (or any other where it's not going to interfere with other casters), and none of the above comments were directed at docs who know when to use the team heal.  The docs that piss me off are the ones who use team heals, get my ass in a whole lot of hot water, and then get indignant when I have the audacity to question their playstyle.  God forbid I should actually offer advice that might improve their performance. <p>~Jaqrabbit<br>
