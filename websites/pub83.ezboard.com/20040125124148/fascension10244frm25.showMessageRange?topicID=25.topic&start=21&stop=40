<br>
Then, how would you act if that guy starts runing around and /shouting &quot;fuck you asshole&quot; &quot;you are stupids, fuck fuck etc etc&quot;? you will be pissed but will control yourself.<br>
<br>
Now, what will you do if that guy talks more and more shit and oocing he is making a big train to kill your group? I think you will do exactly same thing as i did...root him. so your group doesn't die, no?<br>
<br>
After that, dimento's corps was inside a shissar camp, so i ask him to consent me, he did and i draged corps right near ssra temple zone. Gave him a tell saying i will rez him, but the guy was still pissed off and insulted me again. so I decided to move back his corps where i found it, but i was on horse and corps got bugged lol =/ I could not do anything about that.<br>
<br>
SO! before saying we are stupid and stuff, TRY to fucking know what happened please, so you dont look too stupid(oh, and ask dimento if i didn t offer to rez him if you dont beleave me)<br>

The first time he was rather busy in a Vex Thal raid I believe so I can understand.<br>
<br>
Yes, this is the real Dimento Graven, yes I had a bad day that day, NO, I will not apologize to Cascia et. al, for the train, here's MY side:<br>
<br>
After having done a few chores for my wife's character, after an uncharacteristically boring HoT raid, I decided to go multi-kite in The Grey to regain some experience I'd lost.<br>
<br>
Upon entering The Grey from Mons Latalis, I immediately opened my track window and saw a named up, it was A Shattered Golem.<br>
<br>
Invising up, I ran directly to the mob approaching the pyramid from the lefthand side, which was fully spawned.  I see the golem on the far right corner of the front 4 spawn area, which is also fully spawned and pull.<br>
<br>
Shortly after having applied my root, and dots some people show up from what appeared to be the right hand side and start KS'ing.  At the same time, I somehow get an add, probably from stepping a bit far to the &quot;left&quot;.  <br>
<br>
My first attempt at communication was:<br>
<br>
&quot;/say I pulled that, please get off.&quot;<br>
<br>
Absolutely no response.  Now, having just come from a raid my /shownames was set to 1, which as you all know is first names only, so I didn't see that it was AD people.<br>
<br>
No one has sent me a /tell, as far as I can see, no one has /ooc, /shout, /say'd anything so I get pissed.  I root the add, and start nuking the golem, and still pissed off shout:<br>
<br>
&quot;/shout Get off my goddamn mob, jerks!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
STILL no response, and root breaks on both mobs, both mobs are on me, and a third (not sure how the third golem came to the right side, but I admit I could have somehow pulled it), so I start backing off, especially after realizing that I'm definitely not going to get this named.<br>
<br>
Now at this point, all I know is I've got two mobs on me, I've been KS'd, I'm being ignored by the KS'ers and it's, &quot;/ooc Goddamn assholes that was my pull!&quot;<br>
<br>
I THEN get a /tell from Cascia stating something to the effect of &quot;You don't want to be KoS to AD&quot;, and then at that moment I start getting attacked.  This is the moment I first learn that it was AD apparently KS'ing me.<br>
<br>
Still running from my mobs, no mana to speak of and getting attacked, I do quick /who and see at least 5 AD, at this point I respond back, &quot;/r Apparently I'm already KoS so it doesn't f**king matter does it?&quot;.<br>
<br>
Since I've got no mana, etc., I'm going to defend myself the only way possible.<br>
<br>
Now from what I understand from speaking to other members of AD, AD is allowed to defend themselves in any manner available in these types of situations.  Just for your information, so are members of Fusion.<br>
<br>
The ONLY thing I could do, besides take a potential exp death, was get rid of the people attacking me with mob reinforcements, train, which is what I did.  I've always admited that I did train them.<br>
<br>
After dumping the train off on them, I see an /ooc to the effect of &quot;That the best train you can do?&quot;  So  &quot;big mother of a train&quot; I don't think it was.<br>
<br>
I /shout back, &quot;Nope, I'm coming back with more too.&quot;  This was not bragging, this was an encouragement to leave the zone and leave me be.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I get rooted (very lucky that root, my MR was at least 129 so how it stuck, I dunno) and take an exp death, afterwards Cascia says some things which lead me to believe I can take a chance at consenting her to drag my corpse where later I find that my corpse has been placed under the world.<br>
<br>
(Interesting process on how to do that, thanks for telling me how to do it, btw.)<br>
<br>
Anyway after about 10 Chipped Bone Rod's, and multiple fish gill extracts, the help of an SK, and finally recruiting a necro for a corpse summon, I get my corpse, take the FULL exp loss as it took pretty much most of my res timer to get the corpse (funny the lack of GM's on Rallos lately, isn't it?), and having all my clerics repeatedly dying in ToV still, I figure to hell with it, I can earn it back eventually.<br>
<br>
Yes, I was pissed, from MY perspective the AD in The Grey were treating me like I didn't exist, like I didn't matter, and I didn't appreciate it.  Nor did I appreciate getting attacked by a supposedly, &quot;friendly&quot; guild.<br>
<br>
Also note, I've camped The Grey quite a bit, specifically during the SSRA raids you guys were doing so often.  I'd been trained, and trained often.  Yes, I realize that most of those were probably unintentional, BUT, some of the trains that were run past me, while I was sitting on the BACK RIGHT HAND corner of the temple, could have been just a small &quot;practical joke&quot; some of your more mischevious members were playing on temple campers.<br>
<br>
After all to PASS that corner with a train, you have to take THE LONG way from either Mons Letalis, or Scarlet Desert zones to the zone at the SSRA temple.  It's pretty much a direct shot from either zone to the temple and you either end up in the FRONT of the temple, or the LEFT SIDE of the temple, not the back, nor the back right.&quot;<br>
<br>
Also, while I was camping the temple well before this incident, plenty of times a named spawn would be quickly killed while a few AD'ers were passing through to the temple.  I never KS'd it, or bitched or anything.<br>
<br>
My understanding of the OFFICIAL Rallos Zek pull rules are, if the mob is out in the open and unengaged it's open season.  For the most part we've chosen to abide by a &quot;camper's first&quot; policy as is polite and what not, but that practice is not official Verant policy.<br>
<br>
Anyway, while I am willing to take a portion (maybe even a majority if it makes certain parties feel better) the blame here, I know for damn certain I'm not fully at fault here.<br>
<br>
If your people wish to continue to accuse me of &quot;PB tactics&quot;, let's remember that PB's other favorite tactics were:<br>
<br>
1.  Zerging a single player<br>
2.  Attacking that player while he has mobs engaged.<br>
3.  Attacking a player while low on health or mana.<br>
<br>
ALL OF WHICH happened BEFORE, your people in The Grey got trained.<br>
<br>
Since that point you people have gone out of your way to harrass me it seems.  Annoying and sometimes VERY FRUSTRATING especially when I'm in UP farming elysian armor for my guildmates.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I get pissed and lose my temper and use a lot of curse words.  But let's not forget that time AD was in Kael, and PB came through...  I took a screen shot but it came out all blue from all the curse words...<br>
<br>
Anyway, we can continue this little &quot;perma-KoS&quot; thing if you like, those others outside Fusion and AD I've spoken with about it either say we're both to blame or blame AD entirely (apparently there's a lot of people pissed at specific people in AD and it colors their opinions, I guess), and that's fine.<br>
<br>
I'm fine with being KoS to AD, I'd prefer not to be.  But, I can be KoS to AD because I know that &quot;I&quot; was the one attacked first, not your people.<br>
<br>
I know that each I've been attacked, I FULLY WELL KNEW your people were in the zone I was in, but chose to stay anyway.  I've even gone so far as have let AD entering UP to come kill me, about potential elysian armor rots.<br>
<br>
With me being perma-KoS, you won't get much cash, you will get NO items (so please stop inspecting me guys, it makes it look like you're looking for loot instead of &quot;administering punishment&quot;), and I'll do my best to keep my cool, and not do stupid things like I'd stated in my various angry tells.<br>
<br>
I'm not even gonna fight back other than to get away.<br>
<br>
If we can't &quot;agree to disagree&quot; on this, so be it. <br>
<br>
Frankly it'd probably be more worth while to put me on your &quot;never allowed to join AD list&quot; or something instead of wasting MB's on me and such...<br>
<br>
Again, I apologize those that I spoke with harshly who were not directly involved in this incident.  However, I'm not apologizing to those that attacked me.  I was attacked by them first.  I see noone calling for them to apologize.<br>
<br>
Some of you people keep telling me that &quot;I&quot; should have been diplomatic.  However, I would hope that you would not hold YOUR people to a LOWER standard than you expect everyone else to live up to.<br>
<br>
After all, it seems that some of your members believe an attack, THEN a treat is a diplomatic gesture.<br>
<br>
Anyway, laters, I'm done with this.<br>
<br>
Take it however you want to.<br>

You'll not beat an apology out of me, nor will you extort one either, and don't think I'll let members of AD get away without apologizing to me just becuase they're in a great big guild that does Vex Thal a lot.<br>

About stucking corps under the world like you asked, shrug it s a stupid bug i thought they fixed(but i dont play enouth to know if they did) when you are on horse and going by an hill, corps can just disapear heh.<br>
<br>
Again, lets just get dimento unkos and look at his attitude, that s your last chance tho, one more problem like this one with AD and yes, i think you will be perma kos.<br>

You are starting to get on a Saabin lv of idiocy here.<br>
<br>
Not a single one of your posts here is doing anything to help anyone.  I have seen nothing but childish flames from you.  Not a single person has said here that we went, hey we are AD, we own everything, you must give us all spawns!....if that were even somewhat the case then why do wudan, mim, om, and everysingle other guild on the server have weekly updates on big mobs that they kill.  If we owned everything we wouldn't allow them to have it, which isn't the case.  <br>
<br>
And the post about what else would he do since he is out of mana is rediculous.  I am a warrior, but if I was oom and had people attacking me I would run away like any smart person, and if I happen to agro mobs I go zone.  PB are the only other ones I know of that would just train someone because they have no chance of winning.  VERY few people would actually train someone else(pb being the exception of course), so stop trying to act like everyone on the server does it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ubigbadwailem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BigBadWailem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 189<br> <font color=#333333>(8/30/02 5:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dimento KOS</span><hr size=1> Fawnzin seems so angry.

<br>
Probably like the incident that led up to this whole thing.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, I know from other people that this isn't the first little problem that AD has had either, but then sitting there reliving the past doesn't get us anywhere does it?  <br>
<br>
However, in my own defence, I only remember one other such incident like this, and it was with a moron who I had made SEVERAL attempts to stay away from, but he thought it was funny to keep dragging his pulls on top of me, NO MATTER WHERE I WAS.  That particular incident got me myriads of congradulatory tells from members of that person's own guild, which SHOULD tell you the sort of person that was on the receiving end.<br>
<br>
Yes, I'd appreciate being taken off KoS, and I'd be happy to let you all &quot;watch my attitude&quot;.<br>
<br>
We've ALL OF US done things on this server that someone else doesn't like.  There's no getting around it.  There's quite a few names in AD that I recognize as being random PK'ers<br>
<br>
AD must REALLY hate being trained, ok fine (but reserve to make comments about this later if warranted).<br>
<br>
However, I as a caster, hate being attacked by a group of folks, while I have mobs on me, and am low on mana.  You say, &quot;just run away&quot;, you were apparently sow'd to, and how did I know you'd leave me alone once zoned?<br>
<br>
Am I then supposed to plug too?<br>
<br>
I point out ONE MORE TIME, that the use of those particular &quot;PB tactics&quot; is what brought on the train.<br>
<br>
Bah...  This is getting monotonous.<br>
<br>
I think we've devolved the conversation to something on the order of &quot;pot calling the kettle black.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let us just agree to disagree, and I promise to NEVER apply for membership in AD.  I doubt either of us are hurt over that...<br>

<br>
He also tells me that Adell says I'm perma-KoS, ok, fine.<br>
<br>
But if you're going to KoS me, please take care to NOT train me.  After all, you people are claiming this what started this in the first place (seemingly making a HERCULEAN effort to ignore the fact THAT I WAS ATTACKED FIRST).<br>
<br>
I find it a tad hypocritical.<br>
<br>
What's more, while not killing me, the train ended up killing Liene of The Disgruntled Tinker who was going to try and loot an elysian rot. <br>
<br>
She lost her level, ALMOST lost the loot on the boots.<br>
<br>
While I'm not neccessarily a fan of The Disgruntled Tinkers, I think someone from AD owes her a res, and an apology.<br>

<br>
He's probably yet another person that's had this type of experience with AD before.  You know the type of experience I'm talking about:<br>
<br>
A simple overreaction on the part of both parties causing an ugly situation that lingers like the smell of a wet fart.<br>
<br>
I've asked for no help, and I've pretty much told all of my guild and all of my game friends to stay out of it (even those in AD), not wanting any of them to inherit this &quot;perma-KoS&quot; status.<br>
<br>
He does seem angry, instead of berating him, perchance you could ask him why?<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm not hear to debate the validity of others arguing for me, nor how they do it.<br>
<br>
I'm representing myself now.<br>
<br>
I feel I've done it as fair and as balanced as I can.  Even going so far as to keep a message &quot;un posted&quot; for 5 or 10 minutes and rereading to make sure I don't turn into a troll or get off topic.<br>
<br>
I've raised what I hope would be recognized as valid points as to my side of what's been going on.<br>
<br>
Most of those points have gone unanswered.<br>
<br>
No problem, perhaps you guys consider them not to be germane to the discussion, fine.<br>
<br>
But I want something other than:<br>
<br>
&quot;You trained, you trained, you trained, you trained, oh, and you said naughty words&quot; as a reason to be perma-KoS.<br>
<br>
I've apologized to those that actually deserved apologies.  I've tried speaking in a controlled and thoughtful manner.  I've offered to take on some, if not most, of the &quot;guilt&quot; in this matter.<br>
<br>
I &quot;think&quot; I'm being reasonable.<br>
<br>
So far, all I've seen is stuff that I feel in my very bones that you guys would not apply to yourself:<br>
<br>
You shouldn't have trained.<br>
You should have died.<br>
You shouldn't have trained.<br>
You shouldn't have trained. <br>
You should have been diplomatic first.<br>
You shouldn't have trained.<br>
You should have known those people were camping a named mob.<br>
You shouldn't have trained.<br>
You shouldn't have defended yourself.<br>
You shouldn't have trained.<br>
You shouldn't have trained.<br>
<br>
So, so far, all I've got to say is:<br>
<br>
Oh yeah?  You shouldn't have mass attacked me in the first place while I had two adds, and no mana.<br>
<br>
After all, and I can't say this enough since it is the MAIN POINT of my defense:<br>
<br>
You guys attacked me first.<br>
<br>
So far NO ONE has addressed that fact.<br>
<br>
After all if the situations were reversed and 5 or 6 Fusion came along and started KS'ing an AD, who got angry and started spouting off, you know those Fusion WOULD have wanted to kill the AD, BUT, they would have asked an officer first, then the officer would have said, &quot;Don't do shit, lemme talk to AD.&quot; and the mess would have been straightened out.<br>
<br>
After all, had I seen a tell from a gulid officer saying &quot;Chill Dimento, let's figure this out.&quot;  Instead of:<br>
<br>
AD PERSON hits you for XXX damage<br>
AD PERSON hits you for XXX damage<br>
AD PERSON hits you for XXX damage<br>
AD PERSON hits you for XXX damage<br>
AD PERSON hits you for XXX damage<br>
AD PERSON hits you for XXX damage<br>
AD PERSON hits you for XXX damage<br>
<br>
We wouldn't have be here now, would we?<br>

Yeah, I could &quot;follow through&quot; on my angrily spoken threat to find 'em in their raids and cause them grief with well placed trains, or dispelling of their people, AE's etc.<br>
<br>
I could become a real nuisance.<br>
<br>
But, that would actually just make them right.<br>
<br>
So, as it is, each time there's a confrontation between me and AD, as it has been from the VERY BEGINNING, they have to attack first.<br>
