I have no KOS issues and a clean record. My gear is on the high end side and I really im not looking for upgrades . What im looking for is a guild that i do not have to worry about doing newb raids everytime new members join. <br>
 I was in a guild called Ordo MAllues for over 3years. when Ordo broke up i was very upset and slummed around from guild to guild since then . some of you old timmers might know me from my first char a 61 necro i quit playing some time ago due to boredom name was Sabstone .<br>
Some of the guilds i been in had some nice peeps in them but like i stated above im sick of doing suk raids to help new members.  I play everday close to 3 to 5 hours and would really like the chance to get in a sweet guild that i know is not going away or doing raids i did 3 years ago . anyquestions please give me a tell  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=deaddenaheartbeat>deadden Aheartbeat</A> at: 1/12/04 11:34 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=adellrz>AdellRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Pain</span><br>  Posts: 5004<br> <font color=#333333>(1/5/04 6:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=612.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: application </span><hr size=1> can you be more specific about your guild affiliations since OM <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sirdario>sirdario</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drama Please!</span><br>  Posts: 978<br> <font color=#333333>(1/5/04 7:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=612.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: application </span><hr size=1> Sabstone is a nice guy <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.aladarya.com/Sirdariosig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>

I do not have a problem doing raids if it helps all move forward. I do have a problem doing raids for peeps that say thanks then deguild in a month or 2 .

I hardly ever go LD  and if i do and cannot return it must be becuse i CANNOT. Also a few other points that you made where i do not listen on raids ?? THIS IS ALSo NEWS TO ME FEEL FREE TO TALK TO ANYONE IN COTW and any old ORDO members in MIM to discuess my raid skills. to be completly hounest I remeber only 1 raid with ES and that was a bit of a joke it was a Vindi raid that i sat with you for half the day whirln waiting for peeps and there were peeps on and everyone took there time to get there. I do remember pulling some gaints that i could solo if need be. I'm sorry and  not putting you or ES down but these are issues that you should have discuessed with me in game instead of slamming my app!  the only reason i was in ES was for tomaxx(A very old ORDO guild mate and good old school friend) and some other officer forget who atm  (i'm sure if you name them all i can tell you name) begged me to join and said you were rebuilding. **I figered i could add my services untill AD was recuiting again. **Again nothing agaist ES but you should of discuessed this and other issues you had with me at the time instead of deguilding me one day and adding sorry things did not work out GL . Think it would have been a better way to talk to me about it then posting on my app (sounds like you are trying to do harm to me join AD more then warning AD about a no good jag off rog that god i hope he changed kind of post  )any other issues with anyone else please feel free to post or give me a tell. <br>
