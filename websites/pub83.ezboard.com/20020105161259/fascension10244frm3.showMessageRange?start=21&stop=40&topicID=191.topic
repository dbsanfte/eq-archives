<br>
first of all, do not confuse me with the EQ character RIFT, i have only met him once i am Not him, ive already stated this before but some people cannot seem to read correctly.<br>
<br>
2nd, yo.. endymia, u forgot to mention all the cool times i hooked u up fat, remember iwas your 'goodluck charm' gating you around and u would get the dungeon loot u were farmn for in like under and hour , IE!, u grouped w/ me in runneye, and u got the black crowny thing and sword thingy, forget names, but anyways u remember i bet~<br>
<br>
i remember one time.. Reefman, Sanidar.. and some (ranger i believe?), were in unrest once.. reefman still was a total @$$ to me(he bailed after gettin first pair of workboots and didnt help sanidar!), still hasnt changed overall, but but.. sanidar hooked me up w/ SOW and i KITED unrest as a lvl 24, dood i was elite, thx to my #1 necro at the time 'kainne'. (lol??), who was another power lvlin friend , showed me how to solo many of the unrest spawns because de's like ourselves were outcasts :(, only dwarves got the high end of groups back then, literaly and class a dwarf could play was good in unrest, tank, clr, pally, war whatever.. Another person i met in unrest was Fyrefist. the odd person.. who else besides fist, would believe that full rubicite on a clr, would give them the 'upperhand' in casting undead nukes, hmmm.. oh andysolo was one of those nuke happy clerics in unrest, before he went uber clr style, half his group would fall because he was in midcast of some undead DD during battles and trains.<br>
<br>
someone i forgot to mention because he'z bein a total @$$ to me latly was Luta, before.. really early.. there was a bug w/ the guise mask, where when u used it it showed you completly naked w/out gear (which was elite.), and when u zoned into sol b and he was standing there in DE form.. his head literaly was sticking into the ceilling.. yea.. neat. same w/ teldren, when he was in DE form he looked like a monster.<br>
<br>
and as faamarki , i remember grouping with her really far back in the days, she might have rememberd me from later times when i solo'd but i also did al0t of grouping w/ her and her never ending guildrobe (in red), she was merely 20 -24 when i first came around to meeting her, didnt do much but ran into eachother at gates from time on alot, very cool person, even would evac me from KC to EJ in middle of a super pvp war (which i regreted to inform her about!).<br>
<br>
and finaly kilyin, i remember from early days.. when i was near 50, his wizard twink.. literaly was 2nd top geared wizard on RZ.. (jealous.) he even had all the spells, and still can remember after one PoF run, he had enough runes to combine two spells of Wrath of Al`Kabor, yet.. because the PoF runs back in the day consumed a day and a half of time (literaly), he wasnt aware he put 2 runes of the same type into the tomb when combining and lost his spell!, still remember the tell.. so funny was something like &quot;FUCK JUST FUCKED UP MY LAST SPELL I NEEDED&quot;.. somethin along those lines, very interesting :P<br>

I played EQ beta 4, then bought it when it came out yet I hated the game (UO was &gt; EQ), so I missed out on all the good times... started playing 3 months into it or something, befriended some low level (8 or so) druid like me who had a runed totem staff which he let me borrow, that was badass I was hitting mad fast (compared to my worn great staff!) 18s... later I became friends with Mintal at level 11, who revealed to me and the zone that he was Slathar after he and I got pked four or five times in a row by the same guy. Then some level 50 wood elf druid named Tolaz or something powerleveled Mintal to 25 on crag spiders and I was too newbie for him so I made friends with Platnumkutz (man that dork had so many characters...) then Plat got powerleveled too so I was on my own. I begged Slathar for PL every day but he was too busy gating to Lavastorm and getting owned by all the antis there. Somehow I managed to get up in levels solo (I was bad at soloing) and into my 30s lots of druids with FULL VERM (wow!) started popping up like Botch and Cacaca, I saw them in Rivervale a lot, they were my idols. Then I met an ex-DB 44 wiz named Ivanale who wanted to join a guild for loot, me and him joined Revered and I've been in it ever since.<br>

Those days were fun, heh. I still wish I had played earlier and got a DE mask though =\<br>

I'd say something nice to you jinx, but:<br>
<br>
1. I really didn't know you that well (well, neurox was in Agnostic Front for a week or so, that doesn't really count though)<br>
<br>
2. I would be accused of being an FU suckup if I were to do anything but accuse you of all sorts of illegal/immoral/fattening acts.<br>
<br>
So I'll just send positive thoughts your way.  Maybe you'll get them and play DAoC with us.  Sounds like a lot of the fun stuff that you speak of in your story, without all the griefing.<br>
