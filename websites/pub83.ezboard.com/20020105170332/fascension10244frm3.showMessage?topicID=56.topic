<br>
i will warn you beforehand that i have a bias on this issue since i concider morpho a friend, and i have yet to see any redeaming qualities on your end thus far. i will, however keep an open mind on the issues since, as i said, i was not there to witness what happened: i've only heard from others that were there and what was posted on the board. <p><img src="http://server3002.freeyellow.com/thearabianmagician/cykubis2.jpg" width="131" height="252" align=right><br>-Cykubis Brothaman<br>-58 Templar<br>-Rallos Zek .Ascending Dawn.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Trapped under ice, Comfortably cold, I've gone as low as you can go.<br>Feel no remorse, No sense of shame, Time's going to wash away all pain.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ujojola12210.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jojola12210</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(8/29/01 12:19:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lodizal</span><hr size=1> Leme Clear it up for you there was no PB there nor were we even kos to them.  2 shells droped and they shouted loots twice.  Then they shouted get near me to roll it was me cultar and Kad rolling for the 2 shells Morpho said in guild chat I will not be rolling.  So Cultar rolls a 100,  I roll a 56 and kad gets a 2 so I get a shell and so does Cultar.  I went and did the quest then they told Morpho that there were 2 shells and he rolled this was about 5 mins after it was in my posesion.  But he was blind to see they shouted loots 2 times and shouted to come and roll.  But after talking and dealing I handed it over.  I had the shield for around 10 mins.  I had it for about 5 when he gave me a tell.  To make it fair cause his ass was illiterate and he didn't have a 1k for the quest cash he gave me his sarnak shield.  That is what went on if I was a big ass I would have kept the lod shell shield. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucykubisghettohealer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cykubis Ghettohealer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#333333>(8/29/01 6:48:56 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.uglypeople.com/uglymen/ugly-images/up-men-00274.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lodizal</span><hr size=1> alright, basically, i'm hearing two stories and conversing over the mb is getting annoying and is too slow.. contact me in game sometime. <p><img src="http://server3002.freeyellow.com/thearabianmagician/cykubis2.jpg" width="131" height="252" align=right><br>-Cykubis Brothaman<br>-58 Templar<br>-Rallos Zek .Ascending Dawn.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Trapped under ice, Comfortably cold, I've gone as low as you can go.<br>Feel no remorse, No sense of shame, Time's going to wash away all pain.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ujojola12210.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jojola12210</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(8/30/01 7:36:53 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Revered Web</span><hr size=1> Hey cyk I would love for you to read the msg I put on the line of posts Morpho started.

<br>
Rarmak /gu &quot;Lodizal up&quot;  so we all start assembling.  I go and get an enchanter in South Ro, and port in and get someone else and port in.  Then i go to get Cultar in GD and i unfortunately crash for a while.  I get back and he is at IC so i port there and we start setting up.  We kill the turtle easy and no PB are around for once.  Moordred were you there, i thought i saw epic lizard that i was healing as main assist, sorry if that was you Izzy imitating him, but i was healing some lizard warrior as my focus.<br>
<br>
Ok, some druid that we were being nice to named Follo from some other guild was in my group and he died.  I am working with him with tells and want to get him rezzed, and i do hear that two shields dropped, but i am sorry, i do not even know what these things were.  I know it sounds crazy but i thought they were for melee.  I say i am not going to roll on twinkage.  Then someone says in /gu no roll morpho, so i say ok, heh i got a gnome warrior that could use i figure.  Then someone says you got to beat 100.  I say what i got to beat 100. Yes you got to beat 100. Damm i think, and go back to talking to Follo.  <br>
<br>
Then we set up portage group and i have izzmith and some others in my group and Izzmith is a bit peaved at me for not rolling.  I say what, i had to beat 100 and it was not something for a druid anyways.  He calls me a dumbass and kicks me as i cast GD portal and says roll now you dumbass. hehe, so i roll a 79.  He says u won, its uber for a druid, they sell for 50K, blah blah blah, .  He informs me Jojola has it.  Well i port us to GD and go sit at the guards and talk to jojola.  This didnt go to well, i will not tell you what he said, cause i don't want to put any sheet on him.  <br>
<br>
BTW, jojola did not try to steal this item, the above is why he had it in his possessian.  I am not illiterate tho bro, lol, you don't have a clue about me in RL.  anyway back to the story.<br>
<br>
I am really mad i can't have MY shield, i did win it fair and square, and if anything, lets at least get it too a nice druid like ROBO or something.  So i /guildremove so i can die to a 56 druid but at least i can take out my anger on him.  At that time Morb steps in to resolve the situation.  He says, come to RV, and we will reroll cause that is what i am demanding you do in front of me, do you both agree.  We agree.  I win again.  So i run to bank to get 1K and i get a tell from morb as i open the door.  Will you give him SBS for it?  I figure yea why not, i know what its like when you think you got something and then some other guy gets it, so i trade that.  OH BTW, i got 3K in the bank, lol.<br>
<br>
Jojola trades me and we go on our merry ways, the next day i hear through the grapvine i am kos to Pyrosprial.  He is jojola friend.  I wont get into that one, the members of AD with access to Revered Private board will give you the lowdown if they want.  Also i got a bit angry with Fennin and put him on /ignore cause he said in /gu that i not say anything bad about Pyrosprial, after i told my guild that pyrosprial was auctioning to a zone i was in that i was a gimp and also auctioning for someone to kill me.  I currently have all three on /ignore so i don't hear anything they could broadcast on open channels in zones.<br>
<br>
So, i hope that clears things up a bit, i left alot out so it wouldnt get too long, but i have a really great memory for the events, i never let my illiteracy get in the way, ).  <br>
<br>
I want to repeat that jojola did not try to steal or cheat this item from me, the person that said i needed to beat 100 i have no clue who it was now, i was just speculating in my revered post that it may have been jojola, and i guess maybe they were referring to a first roll, since two dropped.  Sorry everyone to make you read so much, but as i told revered after my discourse on their private board, reading is good for the brain.<br>
<br>
Thanks all and i wish i could heal and thorn you when you war, but Brukat really owns me when he traps me in a corner after telling me, stay out of the BoK-PB business with AD.<br>
