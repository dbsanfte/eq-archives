Now, as a melee, you WILL be able to &quot;see&quot; the guy who is nuking you AND go hit him. That is right verant doesn t seem to care much about pvp(best exemple of all is horse that make pvp suck outdoor).<br>

Sorry, but the fact caster need LOS to cast on someone is more a pvp progress than an unbalance, dont forget casters still have an advantage, you guys ONLY need LOS to cast on us....and melees need to be in attack range.

still that wizard likly has some kind of DS or somthing that will take me time to get through long enought for him to decide is that gnome warrior a threat and what to do about me.<br>

a simple invis will take him of my target a gate will put him out of reach so would souccor or evac even likly to jsut plain run around a bit and get lost in the crapy terain we have.<br>

Im a lousy player so maybe its not true but i feel that im a walking target and any caster with the right spells (no gear but jsut spells) can take me down again and again and again.<br>

It has effectively made epic wizards &amp; druids unkillable in outdoor zones(esp. druids).  Melees have no reliable way of dispelling casters' buffs any more- all a caster has to do is nuke you for 1 dmg &amp; the melee is interrupted.  A melee with buffs stripped has very little chance against a druid, a druid's buffs + dots + the fact they're soe'd gives them an immense advantage.  And for a ganker like Voltaic, even some of the best-geared melees on server will take time to punch through his damage-skin, pumice being removed from pvp is a really poor change.  Hybrids don't suffer as badly, pure melees are royally shafted.<br>
<br>
The LoS issue was always a bug/exploit- after all, you need to see NPCs to hit them with any damaging spells.  The chair/ducking behind issues are very annoying of course, ideally, you should only need to see your target *as you cast the spell*.  Imho, if they run away after that, the spell should still hit them.  Thinking about it, it's only zones like Velks and OS that have forced the LoS change...in Guk/SolB a melee still had the upper hand back in the day- as dungeons got more elaborate LoS became more of a prob &amp; had to go.  But smart casters won't complain, after all, levi &gt; LoS now.  With no way to get rid of a cleverly stacked levi on their own, pure melees should simply not be able to hit you while you have levi on and a fast-nuke mem'd.  VI's basic idea seemed to be to try and make spells/buffs for casters the equivalent of gear for melees in pvp...but it looks set to backfire horribly.<br>

<br>
Sure it helps melee out in a dungeon but not out of doors, you can still cast thru walls in outdoor dungeons same way you can cast on mobs thru walls in outdoors. The geometry for outdoors is far different(Still a bug) Ill see if I can still use one toon to cast on anotehr inside an inn or something.<br>
<br>
The ease at which kill shots are acquired with casters vs melee is a clear indication of an imbalance. OMG melee have no way to stop you from running and so unless you let them kill you you dont die.. now casters have no way of keeping people from running so unless they let you kill them they dont die.. Its so unfair for the casters but not the melee eh?<br>
<br>
Seems to me the game just got a bit harder for casters who *gasp* might have to actualy team up with someone to put people down in places cause they arent the invisible omnipotent gods they were before??? haha<br>
<br>
Everyone who mourns the stripping of godhood from their toons cause they were l33t will have to really start figuring out a few things and maybe get some team work skills that actualy do prove something other then  the infinately important skill to choose &quot;Wizard&quot; or &quot;Druid&quot; or &quot;Necro&quot; when making your toon<br>

casters need mana to cast spells. melees dont. the reason you need LOS for mobs and not LOS for pc's is the fact that mobs dont hide behind walls and chairs everytime someone casts a spell on them. PC's do. so until mobs start running around like lunatics making every possible encounter total and utter chaos, dont speak.<br>

I also think that anyone who says casters are now completely gimped in PvP is seriously overstating the effects of this  change. If I'm wrong, I guess we'll start to see droves of warrior and monk gankers. I don't really see that happening, do you?<br>

Personally I think that most of the recent changes were aimed at forcing people back into cooperative play from the solo and duofest that many of the 50+ areas have become. <p><a  href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=189387">Magelo Profile</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ualrecrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlrecRZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333333>(6/14/02 5:31:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1000.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what if...</span><hr size=1> Casters need mana to cast spells and tanks dont.. ok yes thats a fact.

How is that even relevent?<br>

regardless if your argument is based on defense there are tons of defenses a 'caster' has vs melees<br>
<br>
levitate<br>
magic skin(wiz epic, rune skin, invulns,bedlam)<br>
super regens for health AND mana(KEI, torpor, regrowth, spiritual purity,potg)<br>
shadowstep/yonder<br>
sow/soe<br>
gate<br>
invis<br>
pets<br>
faction spells(visit SZ to see how much this can make a difference)<br>
stuns(mez/rapture)<br>
dmg shields<br>
etc<br>
<br>
If you think somehow that the fact you cant cast around a corner on someone makes your class gimped out compared to melees you havent given it much thought at all. it is hardly a stand still and beat each other contest.<br>
<br>
If your complaining about the the unlimited offense of a melee over the limited mana pool offense of a caster..<br>
<br>
move.. your immune to melee dmg, only thing they can hit you with now is a bow and guess what.. thats LOS TOO!!<br>

You can easily dodge melee attacks, but it was very impossible to dodge caster attacks.   Could you imagine the portals being used against the portal camping PK's now?  Druid ruins have so many LOS blockers, the velious ports you can run in and out of.  Haha!<br>

There will still be 100 caster pks for every 1 melee pk simply because casters have gate and melee dont.<br>
<br>
Yes it adds difficulty to casters getting kill shots, but I hardly see that as a problem, it should be difficult for casters and melees alike to get kill shots<br>
<br>
Things got tougher on the gankers land only and thats a good thing, it adds a minute amount of skill to over come a reasonable obstical that was obviously broke to every person that played since day 1 and finaly just accepted as part of the broken aspect of the game(except by people who get hardons from 1 shotting people around corners in dungeons and looting something off em). <br>
<br>
The whole reason I stopped playing my pk wizard was because it was too damn easy, I had &gt;1000 pics on my HD before I stopped taking em pking all the way from level 1 to 49 and when I got ice comet it was such a joke pking people I quit!! and played a chanter which is infinately different pvp then a wiz, it requires more thought and is best used in cooperation with others.. something I enjoy when I PvP rather then the mindless pounding of a nuke key after hiding out somewhere or having it done to and just gating getting 'Ownage&quot; tells haha<br>
