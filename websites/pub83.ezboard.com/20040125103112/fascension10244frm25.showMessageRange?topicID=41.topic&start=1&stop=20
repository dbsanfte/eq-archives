It's a question based on ethics I would like to post this on Wudans site but evendently they don't care to have a public board so I am posting here to get AD's not LV or any other random pk's opion on the subject. We used to have a Monk in our guild named popermen and was in our guild for a while. Shortly after after getting his epic like a week he decides to leave for greener pastures in Wudan. Ok we weren't happy about it but it was his choice on how he wanted to play his character so we moved on. Well popermen I guess got sick of playing EQ so he transfered his acct to a Revered officer (going back to his roots). So the officer gets a tell that she is KoS to wudan (wudan i guess KoS all transfered accts.). Well the officer tries to work out the situation with Needra and she or he (i dunno) isn't gonna budge on the subject. I find this amazing, 1) this is nothing more than big dick swinging 2) they are huge hippocrits 3) who are they to tell people what they can and cannot do with there accts. 4) Popermen came from revered 5) has any member from wudan ever transfered to AD? if so are they KoS?. I dunno I find the whole thing silly, popermen is not my acct but my friend plays him and think it's a load of shit, that she has to be concerned about them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/utrylun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trylun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(9/29/02 8:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> .</span><hr size=1> Popermen is KOS because his account was for sale on playerauctions after he got hooked up with Warder 4 Robe, uber weapons etc etc, you get the picture. To stop players from using Wudan as a mean to gear up and raise their market price to later sell the character, Wudan will now KOS every char that uses the guild to get gear and then sell (i.e. not tell us way ahead that they´re tired of EQ and consider selling the account but get some more loot to sell for more). <br>
We´ve had cases in the past where this happened (i.e. Kura), and we decided to no more tolerate this kind of behavior. <br>
<br>
It is of secondary interest if you or the new owner of the account like this policy.<br>

That is pretty shitty to get primals/shroud then immediately quit.  Sounds like the original owner was pretty flakey.  I'd be pissed at him mainly, and not at Wudan.<br>

while i can understand the kos thing from wudan... I can see kos for 2 weeks a month whatever but i dont see why it should last forever as its been implied it will, 2) im not the kid u geared  and it sucks that he left revered right after epiced (revered didnt like that to much but we didnt kos him either) for wudan 3) ya it sucks he used u all for loot, well me might not have used u all for loot maybe he just got sick of the game we all will at some point im sure point is it sucks u gave him great gear then he left eq 4) u say im kos because u werent warned he was selling well if u saw him for sell on playerauctions then u knew he was forsale before i bought him. 5) i didnt even know he posted on playerauctions it was going around that he was for sell so i made an offer and he transfered account to me. 6) why wasnt he kosed when he left wudan, he was reguilded with revered for a bit before we even knew he was for sell when we found out he was for sell we removed him from guild, he was then reguilded again after the account was transfered to me. I feel like ur trying to make it look like he just got loot up and sold the account the same day and was guilded when thats not what happened... he was outta wudan a good 2 weeks maybe more before i even thought about takeing the account, which leads to again why wasnt he kosed then? I dunno /shurg i like popermen hes a great tooon thanks to wudan revered and most likey many others , I'm going to try to work this out with wudan and hope that we can come to some sort of agreement ....<br>

Ok it's true that he gained better gear along the way and he didn't all the killing but still hey people can change there minds. Is leaving Wudan a big issue with you guys? Do alot of people leave everyday to seek greener pastures? Common man it's not like the loss of popermen has ruined your guild has it? Can you still get primal weapons? has anything really changed?

Here is a case where the original owner got $200 less on the account because he gave up the dagger WILLINGLY and Wudan still decided to kos the character.  What else was he suppose to do, delete all his items he ever got and sell his character naked.<br>
<br>
Selling your character is the BEST way and pretty much the ONLY way (unless you are a thief) to really quit EQ for good.  Lending characters is bad news (ie Cykubis) and so is unsubscribing because we all know you'll be back in a month.<br>

He might not have planned to quit eq when he looted the robe. A situation in RL the day after could have changed his whole view on eq, and leaving him with one option. To sell.<br>
<br>
If i remember correct, Reefman anounced his retirment 2 days after looting the first primal on RZ. Altough he didnt quit, he still planned to do it in his mind or somewhere.<br>

Hell, i showed him the ropes in lower-guk when he was still camping Raster back in the day.<br>
<br>
He's a good kid, and I dont think he would intentionally fuck anyone over - including Wudan. Some people just quit or sell for many different personal reasons.<br>
<br>
When I was an officer of TF way back when we'd have people get epic and bounce from the guild or sell all the time. (ie: Quaeder - C3+Epic, Coyoteblack - Gear+Epic, Ibani - Gear+Epic, etc etc ad nauseum). It kills me when i see the new &quot;Q&quot; in bazaar doing nothing but being a C3 whore.<br>
<br>
I always pushed for KOSing them - but wasn't my call. Maybe if Wudan puts a fair monetary value on what they think they invested in the toon you two could settle it.<br>
<br>
<br>
(personally i would just pk the fuck out of wudan if i had the levels / gear popermen had and was new owner...but hey thats just me) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ugheckofuryfists.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghecko Furyfists</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(9/30/02 10:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> oh yeah</span><hr size=1> I would definitely pay the 50 bucks and have that shitty name changed to something cooler like &quot;Gawdzilla&quot; or some such.<br>

<br>
Personally speaking I would just let the account rot.  I am firmly against buying of accounts due to reasons like this.  If the original Poperman fucked over your guild once before (epic then splitting), then later on used Wudan to get equipment with the sole intention of increasing the dollar value, then what makes you think he won't gank his account back later?<br>
<br>
And to Wudan, if he got the gear... did he not obviously put in the time to earn it?  I don't really see that as a valid argument, I doubt that Wudan just invited him and decked him out on the first day without him spending considerable amounts of time at first.<br>

This is not an isolated problem localized to Wudan alone. Gearing people to have them go on to other guilds or new owners, is everyones problem. We've had alot of people leave Revered to go to Wudan even. They didnt come to Wudan naked. They got their gear and most of their raiding experience in Revered. We always let them go, never holding grudges. Even when Stormcaster took alot from the guild bank(ie. stole) and joined Wudan. We never KoS'd him out of respect to Wudan. Had he been in a PK guild or unguilded, he'd have been KoS I can assure you.<br>
 It's not your burden to keep our members and we know that. It's our burden to make the game exciting for them. We have to make them want to log in and play. Just as it's not our burden to make your members want to stay.<br>
I've always been respectful and as accomidating to Wudan as humanily possible. I would never stand for a member of my guild attacking someone wearing the Wudan tag. And I used to think the same was afforded  my guild. I understand that guild comes first, and I'll do what I believe is best for my guild. Quedy is a good friend. And those ex-Revered that know me, know if they were still in Revered, I'd stand by their side and fight to the death no matter what the odds. I'm not willing to just give up, look the other away while you kill a guildmate.<br>
I honestly don't know what you are expecting this to accomplish. Any way you look at it, the gear is gone. This solves nothing. Best case senario, the owner stops playing and the gear never makes it past the server login. Whats more then likely to happen, the owner sells to anyone willing to pay 50 bucks for a lvl60 full no drop. Grats LV_monkpkor_02! But thats just my point of view for what its worth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=renix>Renix</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#333333>(9/30/02 1:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hey Guys i want to get your opion</span><hr size=1> LOL Those little circles around the Wudan name make you look real gay Trylun :P <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=renix>Renix</A> at: 9/30/02 1:10:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/umachaveli.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Machaveli</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#333333>(9/30/02 1:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hey Guys i want to get your opion</span><hr size=1> Ummm..
