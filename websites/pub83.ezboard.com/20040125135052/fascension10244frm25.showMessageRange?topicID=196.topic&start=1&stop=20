I found the results interesting, and much as I expected, hopefully you thought it was cool too.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's impossible to draw any conclusion from it, but that wasnt my point either. I was merely curious to see how many of you believed what the president said, and how many that support his foreign policy.<br>

<br>
Isolationist policy is extremely bad.  History has proven the errors of an isolationist policy.   HOWEVER, i think that we as a nation do tend to stick our noses in other peoples business just a bit to damn often.  Isolation only puts blinders on a nations eyes as to the threats that are out there.  I also believe that as a nation we cannot ever be a neutral power either.  We are the most advanced military power left in the world today.<br>
<br>
I am an extreme patriot and believe in our way of life in america and am willing to fight and die for it BUT i am not of the belief that my beliefs are for everyone nor should i enforce my beliefs on another person or nation. (see religion in this aspect as well)<br>
<br>
HOWEVER! (damn im full of contradictions today eh?)  I absolutely believe in the need to remove Saddam from power.  Regardless of my personal beliefs lets look at the facts....<br>
<br>
Saddam is likened to Hitler in his efforts to enforce his rule on his people and kill off opposing factions.  See Kurds and Shi&quot;ite muslims genocide efforts against them in direct violation of UNSCR (United Nations Security Council Resolution) 688 which is where the no-fly zones and no troop buildup zones (UNSCR 949) came from which he has violated over 70+ times since 1991<br>
<br>
Saddam has weapons of mass destruction against the UN resolutions and refuses to destroy said rockets and chemicals etc. per the terms of the 1991 UN resolutions and multiple following UN resolutions. (primarily UNSCR 687)<br>
<br>
He has consistently blocked attempts by UN inspectors  to do their jobs and hidden (apparent) stockpiles of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical war items.<br>
<br>
I could go on and on at how he has consistantly terrorized his own popluation and incidents at which he has clearly violated UN resolutions and picked the US out as a bad guy but we are part of the UN and it is our obligation to meet those resolutions.  I could point out how he has targeted our aircraft in clear violation of resolutions and which are considered hostile acts but i dont believe that is necessary either.<br>
<br>
I do not necessarily believe that it is our job to go over there and take things into our own hands.  But i believe the justification is definitely there.  HOWEVER, i think that before any concrete action is taken we damn well better have a plan of action to take care of the Iraqi people and the region in general if we do go in and take Iraq and that plan better take into account their cultural, religious and other needs that may not necessarily (sp) be immediately apparent.  Forcing our way of life on their population is a bad idea in my not so humble opinion.  <br>
<br>
Will i go over there and die if necessary. Yep, thats what i signed on the dotted line and swore an oath to do.  Its my job.  I do think that people need to look at the bigger picture and be better informed about what is going on around them rather and just spew catchphrases like &quot;kill em all&quot; or &quot;make love not war&quot; more often than not there are varying areas of black/white and gray.  <br>
<br>
Like my opinions or not really doesn't matter to me.  The only thing i wish is that people would do their research before spewing out catchphrases or making unilateral opinions.  All for now.<br>

He's agreed to destroy them, albeit not immediately but he has. <br>
<br>
And the popular conclusion that because we haven't managed to find any other weapon's in violation he must be hiding them is kind of absurd. I don't believe for a minute the Bush administration has anything more concrete than we've already seen. If they did there's no possible benefit to concealing that information.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, going to war with someone because we THINK they're violating a disarmament treaty is a horrible idea. Going to war in general is a bad idea, as fun as it might be to bash the French they were right about noone winning.<br>
<br>
The comparison of Saddam to Hitler's alittle weak. Hes certainly brutal, but he doesn't command nearly the power Hitler did. And some of those groups he's decimated aren't exactly peace loving themselves... not that I'm condoning it, its just not a completely black and white situation.<br>
<br>
And when did we become the beakon of morality on earth anyways? Genacide isn't a crime our own country can claim to be innocent of. Even recently we had no problem turning our back on people like Saddam as long as he did what we told him to. No matter how many of their own people they might butcher.<br>
<br>
That said I certainly don't think we should turn our back on Saddam. While I'm not convinced he's the threat Bush claims he is... not by a long shot, I do think the UN should continue monitoring him. And if they find he's in violation, and if he refuses to comply, then and only then should we take action against him WITH the UN.<br>
<br>
Tired of watching our officials use our nation like their own personal chessboard. Our foreign policy has been attrocious since the end of WW2. And all those poor decisions our leaders made are coming back to haunt us. It'd be nice if we'd learn from our past mistakes and not keep adding to them. <br>
<br>
I'm sure I'm not the only one thats heard over and over again how we police the globe. For or against that policy though, we've done a really shitty job of it. We abuse weaker countries for our own benefit all the time by supporting people just like Saddam. When that fails to get us what we want, we invade... is it any wonder people hate us? <br>
<br>
I don't imagine any of us would appreciate it if a foreign power invaded our country and told us what kind of government we'd have and who would run it. Foolish idea right? Well, we'll see. If there's one thing we should learn from history, it's noone stays on top forever.<br>

It is rather long, don't read it if you don't want to :P<br>
<br>
Suprising that the justification for war has shifted somewhat, from WMD to the so-called &quot;moral case&quot; for regime change.  Or perhaps not so suprising, given the desperate paucity of evidence of Iraq being a serious threat to western interests.  Following are the Bush quotes from the poll thread and my opinions on them.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;Success in Iraq could begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace, and set in motion progress towards a truly democratic Palestinian state&quot;<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The two situations have nothing whatever to do with one another.  Progress towards a democratic Palestinian state does not hinge on removing a secular dictator in a neighbouring country, nor would it affect it in any positive fashion.  The US/UK are not seen as impartial arbiters in the region, particularly the US for its unilateral support of Israel, itself a flagrant violater of UN resolutions regarding the illegal occupation of large portions of land belonging to neighbouring countries.  Not to mention breach of pre-1967 borders.  <br>
<br>
No, the only realistic way to resolve this crisis is with a broad-based multilateral approach that will be seen by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>both</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sides as impartial.  That was the strength of the Oslo accord- multilateral support from an unbiased standpoint.  The first goal in this must surely be the establishment of credible political institutions.  Executive, Legislative and Judicial- the three arms of future Palestinian government need to be established and proven effective in say, a 6 month test case.  <br>
<br>
This is eminently achievable- the current Israeli government quite naturally doesn't desire it- they would have withdrawn to pre-1967 borders if they did.  Neither do the Palestinian side desire this to any great extent- mob rule through the laughable PA funds Fatah, Al-Aqsa and helps arm them.  Much in the same way the US arms the state of Israel- quietly as possible, but in the public domain.  It therefore behoves this multilateral comittee to treat both sides equally- forgiving neither of them for agreement infractions.  This is all academic though, until the institutions are set up properly.  A war in Iraq <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>will not create these institutions</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  In fact, given how much moderate Arab opinion would be alienated in the event of an attack, it would likely make the task even more difficult.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;The passing of Saddam Hussein's regime will deprive terrorist networks of a wealthy patron that pays for terrorist training<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If I wanted to be cynical, the CIA during the 1980s could easily have been described as a wealthy patron of Osama Bin Laden, Mohammed Kaif, Zaheer Musharra Mohammed and other prominent terrorist figures in the world today, one that paid for their training.  Back then they were considered key allies (terrorist allies, but against a bellicose Soviet army you'd take anything I suppose).  But I live in the real world- and if the official line is that distasteful alliances of convenience are the practiced norm...fine- I'll accept that with a heavy heart.  What I won't put up with is the idea that Bush *or* my prime minister are in possession of the moral high ground.  They've both claimed it- but given policies they and their parties have backed to the hilt in days gone by, I find it suprising that they would even try.  <br>
<br>
To the actual point of the quote- the only terrorists that exist in Iraq are in the practically autonomous Kurdistan in the north- a region of the country the Iraqi regime has no control over.  In fact, it's the presence of such terrorist training camps and claims of Kurdish autonomy that has prompted Saddam to bomb and gas them at every opportunity.  Ironically enough- if it was the intention of either my prime minister Tony Blair or George Bush to *support* Saddam's inhuman acts- they would be saying he is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fighting</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> terrorism rather than supporting it.  They're already doing this elsewhere- Russian soldiers firing napalm rockets into densely populated cities in Chechnya is &quot;fighting terrorism&quot; when it suits the US/UK administrations.  Israeli tanks bulldozing entire residential areas in the West Bank is considered &quot;fighting terrorism&quot;, and a regime's soldiers fatally shooting teenage boys throwing stones is considered &quot;a fair and measured response&quot; by our respective governments (I have yet to hear tell of a soldier seriously wounded or killed by a teenage boy throwing a small rock).  There is no clear moral consistency of policy, our governments should not even pretend that one exists.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and offers rewards to families of suicide bombers. And other regimes will be given a clear warning that support for terror will not be tolerated.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Oh, the irony.  Numerous institutions and sources in the US for decades financed rewards to Republican and Loyalist families alike in Northern Ireland, supporting the families of terrorists that have killed tens of thousands of British citizens over decades. US administrations over 50 years have failed to consider it a threat or a grave insult.  How opinions change- Americans donating money to terrorist families in Northern Ireland is a tolerable evil, Saddam tolerating Iraqis doing the same to families of suicide bombers isn't however.  For the record, I'm against the idea of rewarding terrorism in any shape or form- but punish thousands of innocent civilians for the actions of a government they didn't choose?  Especially when you as a government tolerate the same at home and elsewhere.  That's a bit of a stretch for the old moral case for war if ever I saw one.<br>
<br>
As for a warning to other regimes about &quot;terrorism not being tolerated&quot;- that's laughable to be honest.  The vast majority of those 11/9 hijackers were Saudi, not Iraqi- America's most important Arab ally in the Middle East is arguably Saudi Arabia.  The largest source of funding for Palestinian terror groups emanates from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait- supposedly our most important allies in the region.  Last year alone, September 15, 2002 the UK and US governments in a joint deal approved millions of dollars of credit to these governments, who have tolerated the funding of terrorist groups since the late 1960's- way to send the message to terrorist-supporting countries.  A terrible and disgraceful insult to the memory of those thousands of innocents brutally murdered in New York.  The message will never be sent, because to be perfectly honest- our governments need their oil and friendly relationship more than they need to tackle terrorist support seriously in those countries.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;A new regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom for other nations in the region.&quot;<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm still holding my breath- Egypt, Turkey and Jordan don't seem to have influenced their neighbours' modes of government terribly effectively.  If anything it's isolated them within the Arab league.  Besides- since when was democracy something you could impose externally?  It's been tried in Afghanistan, with terrible results.  80% of their country is unrepresented, warlords roam around with fistfuls of dollars and minature armies of former Northern Alliance troops carving out their own areas of dominance.  Iraq's population is even more starkly divided ethnically- imposed democracy is an unachievable myth.  It has to be built from the ground up- a US/British military protectorate government isn't the way to do that.  <br>
<br>
I find it immoral and utterly repugnant that we're rushing into a course of action that threatens so many lives, and has given little or no thought (I suspect the latter) to the post-war scenario.  I may not agree with you whether or not there is moral justification for the war Walks- but I agree 100% that in the event of one, there needs to be a plan for institutions.  The current one is a panel of US/UK generals with totalitarian control over Iraqi administrative organs and national resources.  The US and UK <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>badly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> need credibility in the Middle East, and that can only be achieved by acting in a fair and morally correct manner- that isn't either.<br>
<br>
The moral high ground lies in a peaceful resolution of the crisis and placing faith in inspections.  The results are there for all to see.  95% of WMD destroyed so far in Iraq have been destroyed by inspection teams over 5 years, a mere 5% destroyed by the combined might of US/UK/French forces in 1991 and intelligence/air operations since.  Inspections <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>work</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, if they're given the time and space to do their job.  Whether they have that or not, only they know.  The last regime of inspections went on for five years and destroyed significant quantities of these weapons.  I find it absurd that some nations at the UNSC want to terminate inspections after 11 weeks.  If Hans Blix and El-Baradei come to the UNSC and say &quot;Sorry, we're unable to do our work, there is just no way inspections can continue&quot;- then the peaceful avenue has been exhausted, and there is a moral and practical case for comitting forces.  Furthermore, if the inspectors say they can't do their job, no one will support military action more strongly than I.  Currently, neither of these is true- inspectors, the people on the ground, the experts, still believe it worthwhile to continue inspections.  I'm no expert on arms or diplomacy, but politicians aren't either- they should take expert advice when required, some of them are ignoring it or spinning it in favour of national interest.  I believe their motives for doing this are selfish, irresponsible and a textbook example of leadership decisions based in fear rather than strength of conviction. <br>
<br>
Just a brief glance at history shows that any imposed government or system of government in the Middle East has failed, both in the country it's tried in, and in its efforts to influence neighbours.  The US-imposed totalitarian Shah of Iran didn't encourage &quot;democracy&quot; in his neighbours any more than the Soviet puppet government in Yemen spread the word of the Communist party politik in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>its</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> neighbours.  I use democracy in inverted commas because as I said, an externally imposed system of government is in contravention of the very basic principles of democracy.  Dictators and totalitarian undemocratic states have always been surrounded by democratic states throughout history, that has never influenced their policies.  I don't see Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Syria or Yemen abandoning their systems of government just because we effect regime change in Iraq- putting that forward as a possibility is naive and shows little appreciation of the history of such changes.<br>
<br>
To conclude- several thousand of our troops and American troops are as I type this, preparing to risk their lives in doing their duty.  I wish them the very best of luck, and a safe journey home to their families, it's the least they deserve.  They only await instruction from their political masters.  I long to live in a world where those politicians so ready to risk others' lives on the behalf of morally bankrupt policy listen to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>their</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> masters the electorate.  In the absence of that, democracy has failed, and it is innocent Iraqi people and the people of the region who will pay the ultimate price as a result.<br>

isolationism is of course a bad policy, but im very tired of being the worlds policeman, when there is trouble the us is genarly expected to come to the rescue in humanitarian or military aid.<br>
<br>
forgien governments and their people denounce the us for being a active member of the world comunity.  which rankles me becuse most owe their current stability to the efforts of the us.<br>
<br>
I honesty would prefer to tell them FINE you deal with the world crisis for the next 10 years or so, declare absoulte nutrality and let you all screw up the world like you did in wwII and wwI (totaly european wars that we got dragged into)<br>
<br>
the us doesnt need the rest of the world, we can buckle down and handle our own affairs.  OIL? we dont need it, we got plenty of our own oil and other natural resoures we can use... sure it would be more expensive than the cheap oil that we can get elsewhere but such is hte price of freedom and secure knowledge that some asshole from another nation is gonna come over here becuse we tried to help someone he didnt like.<br>

I would suggest a closer and more detailed study of the history of the region we are discussing, and US involvement in it.  It doesn't make for very encouraging reading, but I suspect if you did- you wouldn't think as you do.  On to the main issues:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>bush wasnt unable.... he was unwilling.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Wrong I'm afraid- I think he would have liked nothing better than to &quot;finish the job&quot; from his point of view.  He was unable- because of diplomatic commitments in the region and the fragility of the arab coalition he'd built to actually effect a regime change.  And that was for the better to be honest...anyone remember the last time there was a US-sponsored regime change in the region?  Didn't end too well as I recall, we're still living with the consequences of that, as are the people of Iran, trying to throw of the shackles of a past blighted by US foreign policy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>to have removed saddam at that time would have cuased a power vaccum and led to even more chaos in the region<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
And what do you think would happen if there was a regime change now Somthor?  That's what is being discussed- and what I suspect men like Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz and Dick Cheyney have wanted since 1991.  Every excuse for going to war has been cynically exploited and manipulated to maximum effect.  These are the men pushing this policy and driving it forward.  They are at the heart of the absurd change in strategy from containment, deterrence and diplomacy to military pre-emption.  <br>
<br>
Let us illustrate it in clearer terms- an accomplished statesman like FDR or Harold Wilson would seek to understand those of a different disposition and engage them.  No matter that they were unsavoury regimes- diplomacy is the art of achieving dialogue irrespective of differences.  By engaging them the hope would be that with deterrence and a policy of external containment they could be reasoned with, and change effected over a period of time.  The entire Cold War was managed without either of the principle protagonists firing a shot at each other in anger because of this calm, reasoned and sensible approach.  As a result- the brutal regime that was the Soviet Union came to its knees, not trembling at NATO's military might, but unable to compete in the arena peacefully and on equal footing.  <br>
<br>
Compare this to the policy of pre-emption, exemplified best by an Afghan warlord- say, Rashid Dostam, one of the northern alliance commanders, who in the last coup massacred fifteen thousand POWs in the city of Kandahar as a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>pre-emptive measure</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, lest any of them take arms and rise up against him again.  To make sure, he took the eminently sensible precaution of slaughtering their families too, most of them innocent Pashtun civilians.  I tell you, it brought a nice warm feeling to my heart when I saw him enter the city triumphantly *again*- only this time with full US/UK backing and special forces from our respective countries flanking his motorcade.  Needless to say, he has since been appointed to the makeshift cabinet and is busily arming his troops for his next pre-emptive action, destroying his potential enemies before they have a chance to &quot;threaten him&quot;.  The shocking irony is, that from his bloodthirsty point of view, he can't lose!  Because if they weren't his enemies at all or had no designs on his position...they'd now be forced into being his enemies if they wanted to stay alive.  Now that's the face of pre-emption- it's a mapped guesswork strategy of potential risk, backed up by a complete lack of evidence and reasonably collected intelligence.  Remind you of anything?  :P<br>
<br>
I've been told Sadaam is a threat to me by several people, my government, and one or two other governments.  Well my answer is clear and simple- bloody well prove it.  There might be materials in there that could possibly in theory be cobbled together to make a biological weapon.  Oh and it gets better- no operational missile system in Iraq can reach us.  Ahh, the warmongers say- but with no inspectors in Iraq for 4 years, who knows what he might be hiding.  Does anyone else find that as excrutiatingly paranoid a stance as me?  Whenever I hear that remark on television- the stark suspicion and paranoid delusional allegations in the absence of proof reminds me of McCarthyism.  I mean bloody hell, if someone walked like a communist or ate communist breakfast cereal in America at that time he deserved to be persecuted.  I can't get away from the feeling that I'm witnessing this on an international scale.  And not even on a consistent basis- North Korea has nuclear weapons and has threatened to use them <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>pre-emptively</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Well gee, wonder who gave them that idea...I think his name is Paul Wolfowitz and it's written down in a strategy document somewhere.  <br>
<br>
No matter, they've got nukes, threatened their neighbours and the entire western world with their use if sanctions are applied- and we want to resolve <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>that</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> diplomatically and do business with the North Koreans.  They are clearly the greater threat- and lean dangerously close towards being a suicidal regime.  <br>
<br>
Sadaam Hussein is definately *not* suicidal- he's a survivor and always has been.  The very idea that even if these alleged weapons were in a useable state that he would fall on his own sword by using them...is so laughable I find myself crying out in despair that some believe that he would.  It'd result in the most devastating retaliatory attack in the history of mankind- the UK *alone* has two (declared) SSBNs armed and deployed- HMS <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Swordfish</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and HMS <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Marlin</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  These carry enough Trident missile sorties to destroy Iraq, and ALL its neighbours...four times over.  And that's just *our* submarine deployment...the US has four to five times our strength in forces in the region.  The only way anyone but a madman would act with that arrayed against him would be say...if he was invaded and had nothing to lose?  Oh...darn.<br>
<br>
Containment works, deterrence works, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>inspections</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> work.  No other process or system has been as effective in disarming Iraq or any other country- the last war in the Gulf destroyed a fraction of the arsenal, 95% of it was achieved by inspectors.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>lastly get us the hell out of the UN <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
...I don't know whether to laugh or cry after reading that, and the other ludicrous isolationist drivel preceding it.  In case you haven't noticed Somthor- communication and the digital age, amongst other things, mean we live in a shrinking world.  Nation states are tied closer together by trade and cooperation than ever before...and you want to stick your head in the sand?  It's not going to happen...nor should it- that attitude is what caused more and bloodier wars than any other stance (other than pre-emption) in the 20th or any other century.  <br>
<br>
The only way legitimacy can be accrued is with consensus and the international rule of law- the cornerstone of that principle *IS* the United Nations.  With great power comes great responsibility- the responsibility to use that power for the greater good...not to selfishly serve national interest.  During the Cold War, the UNSC was a trading-shop of vetos and botched initiatives, wrangling amongst permanent members.  In the post-cold war world we have a chance to make the international system work...and you want to retreat away from that?  <br>
<br>
That kind of isolationism allows terrorists to thrive and flourish, allows legitimacy to be attached to the brutal and bloody murder of innocents.  What makes your government, my government or *any* government any better than terrorists if they knowingly pursue a conflict which they know full well will kill thousands of innocents people?  If we are to have legitimacy, credibility or a lasting peace- if we want any chance at all of fighting terrorism on all levels and winning- we cannot afford to have governments that think the way you do Somthor.  <br>
<br>
Cooperation and consistency of policy- police, intelligence and political forces of all countries working with trust and understanding- that is the only way to win the fight against terror.  After 11/9, the US and the west in general had more sympathy than ever before from moderate Arab opinion in the middle East.  The Bush administration is about to throw that all away by pushing a war policy against Iraq, alone if need be.  That would alienate the very body of opinion you *have* to win over in order to fight terrorism, to secure the future of Israeli-Palestinian peace, that body of opinion is crucial if democracy is to become an accepted norm in that region.  I ask you this- if America does what you suggest and walks away...what on earth is to stop another terrorist attack?  Go on, tell me how Bali was an important strategic target for terrorists.  Doing nothing is no guarantee of safety- in order to stop terrorism you have to engage the issues that fuel terrorism- surely I can't be the only person on this board who seriously believes that?<br>
<br>
To conclude-  without international consensus based on the rule of law, legitimacy is sacrificed- and there is no case for war.  I do believe in the idea of a moral and just war, when the alternative is a clear, imminent threat that cannot be ignored.  Abandoning that stance, we are left with uncaring hawks, whose only chosen international credibility issues from the barrel of a gun.  Reminds me an awful lot of that chap Rashid Dostam.  I sure as hell don't want to live in a world like that Somthor...would you- would any of us?<br>

the UN is a collection of petty people without resolve to work together and truly live up to the idea behind it.  Isolationism is a bad idea, and in my heart of hearts I do not belive in it, however without effective leadership here in the us and elsewhere in the world  whats the point of being part of a dysfunctional club that does little else but bicker and play childish games (US included)<br>
<br>
why cant the US be like Switzerland?  why is it that we have to take a leading role in the worlds affairs, why cant we stay at home and work on domestic issues.  put our efforts into rebuilding our own infrastructures and stop wasting our money on imported goods.<br>
<br>
bio diesel is here(been availible for YEARS) it works its commercialy viable it costs about $2.60 a gallon  why pay for forigein oil?  the us has huge natural gas reserves... many fleet vehicles can be converted and use this cleaner resource.  its intialy expensive but in the long run its proven to be cheaper.<br>
<br>
take the oil nipple out of our mouths..  it will have a REAL effect on terror if the oil countries that sponsor them have a sudden reduction and sustained loss of income.<br>
<br>
hey I know you know what you are talking, about perhaps I haven't made my views clear, maybe my views are simply unrealistic.  <br>
<br>
there is no easy fixes, bush had the best chance to make lasting and effective change when the 9/11/01 event happened  at that time he could have said we need to do X as a nation to prevent things like this from happening again.  instead he took the easy and tried and true option of bombing the hell out of some other country.  sure it was a good thing to do but he should have done more, on the homefront.<br>

The aim rather is to point out the consequences of abandoning long-established forums and ignoring the cornerstones of international law.  I can't think of a single respected expert that doesn't acknowledge the severity of a League of Nations style collapse of the Un caused by a founding permanent member going its own way.  Not everyone is aware of how dangerous an event that such a blatant act- ignoring the UN charter could have on subsequent international events.  Hopefully my posts were somewhat informative and encourage people to read more about the details and history of the crisis at hand.  Let's not kid ourselves here- there is an astonishing level of ignorance of international affairs to be surmounted.  <br>
<br>
Not to mention the seemingly inconceivable notion that to criticize one's leaders is unpatriotic or unseemly at a time of possible war.  This is when we must be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>most</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> critical of our leaders, not pander to their egos.  When young men and women are preparing to risk their lives for a policy- shouldn't we ask why?  That goes for large sections of the US press and other forms of TV media too incidentally, who I feel have been excessively tolerant of their leaders' actions since 11/9.  It should never be unpatriotic to question the motives of our leaders or criticize a case for war- in the absence of such criticism there is no effective opposition and democracy fails.<br>
<br>
On the point of the link you posted Rurik- I fully understand that Sadaam is an evil dictator, and the Ba'ath party is a repugnant and repressive regime.  However, I put it to you that this has been well-recognized and known by NGOs for over 3 decades- and that during the 1980s this tyrannical regime had no stronger supporter than the United States.  Arms, intelligence, communications equipment and anthrax strains were all liberally shared with this regime- he was given credit to aid in the further development of WMDs as well.  So the idea that human rights are even in the calculations of an administration that includes Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney and Wolfowitz- three men <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>instrumental</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in supporting Sadaam during the Reagan years- is a preposterous one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Alot of people in the US (at least where i live, which is a very mixed community) are extremly frustrated with the UN.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I put it to you that the reason that there is frustration with the UN is that a majority in the UNSC do not support the position of your government.  And what is democracy without a variety of ideas and policies that clash may I ask?  Without effective opposition and a willingness to consult with alternative points of view, democracy is diminished.  I believe it was Sir William Pitt who said &quot;In the absence of a willingness to debate issues openly there is no government that can be trusted fully.  Without clear opposition and robust dialogue, politics is diminished, liberty melts away and we are the poorer as a society.&quot;  Democracy isn't about one clear defined policy that is universally accepted and carried out.  That sounds to me like a dictatorship quite frankly- without an exchange of views and attention to consensus you don't have a democratic system.<br>
<br>
The UN is based on a democratic system- a forum where a frank and open exchange of views results in resolutions which carry legitimacy.  I would like to know how anyone who posts here and opposes the United Nations as a principle...how they would propose to tackle the current crisis.  The UN is seen as impartial- this is crucial for resolving the current crisis.  Individual nations and their selfish actions in national interest will never have as much legitimacy in resolving anything.  Granted there is little altruism in the way the UNSC operates internally- but there is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>consensus</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and a reasonably fair division of responsibility.  It still remains the truth, that a combination and compromise of many varying national interests will carry infinitely more credibility than one nation acting alone.<br>
<br>
As for them being unable to decide anything- well that's nonsense quite frankly.  The UNHCR, UNESCO and UNCHR safeguard human rights, the safety of refugees and the rights of children around the world- millions of lives are saved because of their policies.  The WHO has successfully eradicated smallpox as a disease from the planet- point me to a single country on its own that can even come close to doing as much for world health as them.  The UNSC also has a fine record post-Cold War of resolving disputes.  The Balkan crisis was ultimately resolved through UNSC consensus, as was the reconstruction programme that is rebuilding Serbia-Montenegro after Kosovo.  On the issue of disarmament- several former Soviet republics, South Africa, Libya and Syria have all successfully been disarmed by UNSCOM or similar comissions.  We live in a safer world because of the UN- it is the selfish actions of member states and a few in particular...that fuel terrorism and undermine its security.<br>
<br>
I repeat again- the only way in which terrorism can be combated successfully is with international consensus.  Withdrawing from Kyoto, ABM, the UN convention on biological weapons, the ICC, a whole sleugh of other international agreements on the rights of refugees- the Bush administration is threatening that consensus.  There is no legitimacy in backing a unilateral war of aggression against Iraq.  In fact, I have no doubt Al-Qaeda are rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of a war in Iraq- here's why:<br>
<br>
1)  &quot;We keep faith with god that this infidel will one day be struck down by the fiery sword of vengeance, his people liberated and free to bask in the glory of the true god.  His guns silenced and his punishment on earth secured, the land liberated from an infidel who has defiled it with his godless values.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Yes Osama is a dangerous and evil individual- except in that quote he isn't talking about Bush, wasn't even the US, the UK, or indeed the West.  He is talking about Sadaam Hussein and Iraq.  Al-Qaeda and Sadaam are mortal enemies- they'd like nothing better than to see him deposed.  And it isn't just an ideological benefit- they see a weak unstable Iraq, divided against itself and ruled by a foreign general as ripe pickings for another Taliban-esque friendly regime to hide in.  An islamic extremist state in Iraq is a very real possibility- if we drew lessons from history, we know that a regime change in that region drives the population to extremism.  Just look at Iran after the Shah- did a US-led regime change <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>there</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> result in a stable democratic pro-Western government?  Did it hell.  The entire stability of Middle East governments could easily be threatened by such a war.<br>
<br>
2) That instability is another easy target for Al-Qaeda, a spate of attacks on government targets in these regimes made unstable by a war could easily turn the Middle East into an inferno of religious hatred and a hotbed of fundamentalism.  The very opinion the US had in its pocket after 11/9 will melt away in the wake of unilateral action in Iraq.  That opinion is crucial in any war against terror- if public opinion in those countries is behind your policy then terrorists would be shunned and spurned, they'd have nowhere to hide, no one willing to arm them.  If Israel withdrew to pre-1967 borders and was able to negotiate with a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>credible</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Palestinian government(not a collection of mobsters masquerading as one)- if Israel stopped bulldozing palestinian homes...how the devil would Al-Aqsa and Hamas be able to function?<br>
<br>
3)  Last, but not least- a war unsponsoered by the UN would be the best recruiting poster Al-Qaeda ever had.  Unilateral support for Israel, propping up oil rich states while the people in those states suffer- those are harder issues to sell to reasonable people. They are still important issues, one the current US administration has yet to confront.  But a war in Iraq would draw the battle lines far more clearly, and make it far easier for terrorist groups to stir up discontent and hatred for unilateral American action motivated by selfish national interest.  If the action is carried out under the umbrella of the UN- it isn't American aggression but the will of the international community.  See how important UN approval is Somthor?  Legitimacy pulls the rugs out from under the terrorists- unilateral wars of aggression strengthen their case for recruitment.<br>
<br>
Lastly, just to make my stance clear- my argument is not with the people of the US, it is with the right-wing collection of former oil men masquerading as the executive branch of its government.  A government spearheaded by a man who won fewer of your votes than his opponent...and still became President.  11/9 moved me and many others to tears- it'd break my heart if we actually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>encouraged</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the terrorists to come at us by pursuing as morally bankrupt and short-sighted a policy as this.  We would almost certainly, the US and the UK win any war in Iraq- but would we win the battle of hearts and minds needed to fight the threat of terrorism?  I very much doubt that we would.<br>

obviously politics being what they are the us cant withdraw from the un.  But you know I'd like the world opinon of the US to be a favorable one and while i may be wrong currently i dont feel thats the case.<br>
<br>
the world expects the US to be the Un's military branch its policeforce and to a certian extent its bank.  if we do all that for the world why cant the world have a better opion of my country?   If its my leadership why cant my people elect better leaders.  if its the leadership of other nations why cant they better educate their population on the services the US renders.<br>
<br>
in the most general terms everyone likes to think thier nation is a good nation and the fault lies elsewhere, i know the US had some skeletons in its closet and has made some poor policy choices, made some short term  choices opposed to long term ones<br>
<br>
im aware that saddam was our boy becuse he was then fighting the evil Iran, we got in bed with the devil to further our policy in the region but he was our devil.<br>
<br>
when saddam invaded kuwait he all but asked if it was ok to do so with no firm answer from the us he took it as a quiet approval.  im sure he was surpised when the us scolded him for his actions.<br>
<br>
I wonder what would have happened if the us stood by and did nothing and let saddam have kuwait  i suppose saddam might have taken over saudi araba by now.<br>

He's playing the UN showing that it truly is a worthless world government incapable of dealing with anything except minor regional conflicts.  I find it simply amazing that a council of governments, elected by no one mind you and in turn not accountable to the electorate, with a myriad of interests that they are beholden to, can usurp the sovereignty of a country by giving a handful of socialist countries absolute veto power.

<br>
I think it's sad the world debates something so bitterly when overwhelming majorities of the people in Iraq are waiting for this to happen.  I for one will be honored to fight for my brothers and sisters in Iraq who want freedom.<br>
<br>
Iraq has the potential to be a great nation.  They have more natural resources then most European countries.  The wealth the people could enjoy is hindered by one thing alone... the tyranny under which they live.<br>
<br>
So you can spin your oil argument (which is dumb because we will spend more money fighting and giving aide then we could ever get out of Iraq), you can spin your UN argument, you can spin your &quot;America thinks it's so awesome blah blah&quot; argument, you can spin your &quot;but what about Korea&quot; argument... but until you come up with a better plan to really help the people in Iraq, you just look like someone who is focused on your own importance in the world, and not the well-being of the people which inhabit it.<br>
<br>
Who cares how the people get liberated, so long as they are free?  I think it would only be a jealous and bitter people.  I think its sad the world demands a self-interest of a nation before it lends a hand to its neighbor.  I think that time has ended though for the US.<br>
<br>
And those who wish to join us in a coalition will be those who care about the people of the world, and hope that everyone can breathe free air and enjoy things like internet forums and free speech.  But there are so many who dont, and that wont change without action from those who are strong enough to do something about it.<br>
<br>
That should be the burden of freedom... to spread it through the world as fast as possible... not to fight over who does the spreading or to make a big bureaucratic mess to figure that out.  If you don't feel that way, then you really don't know what you have...<br>

I dont ever see people waving their stupid banners &quot;Iraq: DISARM AND GIVE A REASON TO PROTEST AMERICA.&quot; Or any signs to that manner. These protestors are are accomplishing nothing but giving Iraq a greater sense of power and more reason to continue their bullshit.  Also, what the fuck is the deal with the people having &quot;naked protests&quot; for war, i mean come on, give me a fucking break.  Or the protestors in Seattle who setup a Triangle thing with a swing in the middle of it (it obviously symbolized NOTHING) in the middle of the floating bridge in the middle of fucking rush hour and did nothing but snarl traffic for hours until their arrests. These fools probably dont even know why they are protesting the war, and just want attention.
