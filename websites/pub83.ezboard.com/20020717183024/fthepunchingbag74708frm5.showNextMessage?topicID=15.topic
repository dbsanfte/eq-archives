I've been through most of the nerfs and the latest unnerf and all I can say is there is still alot of work to do, but alot of good work has also been done.<br><br>With that said let me explain why I have decided to leave my MA.  The main reason actually does not reflect directly on to MAs but to the game in general. <br><br>In case you guys didn't know, after level 80ish getting a level is damn hard.  The only way to do it quickly is either having a really good group or doing missions.<br><br>Frankly, I'm sick of power leveling.  The mobs in this game do not change, or at least for all I have seen.  They all fight the same and a 100k Ace still is as stupid as you 1exp leetas.  Bascially all that changes is how much damage they do and how many hps they have.  Oh yeah, and the exp comes in different skins, from Humanoid to Wormlike creatures, how exciting.<br><br>At the risk of sounding flamish/whiny let me explain how there is nothing else for the MA to do but power level; I do consider missions for exp power level btw.  First of all we have no trade skills or any weapons so no luck there for any downtime fun.  There are nano clusters and implants to play with but with full set of ql120 I doubt I'll be upgrading soon.  PvP you say?  Well MAs have to be one of the worst PvPers in the game.  I don't count docs and other such non-offensive type classes.  I understand that the nature of the MA is not to have ranged combat and to attack with the hands.  But somehow i thought FC would implement a PvP system where it was still viable to PvP with Melee type weapons.  As it stands right now its not.  Usually if I find anyone near my level to fight here is what happens.  I target lv 80 soldier....boom 2k burst/fa or whatever....down to 400hps...heal quick...back at 1k hps or so....run up to him....brawl for a crit for 1k....25% of which i take.....etc...  We do not stand a chance.  And dont even let me talk about fighting NTs or Agents who have root, just forget about it.  And I do have a relatively high nano resist, 200ish.<br><br>So in sumation, I am sick of powerleveling but for the MA there is nothing but powerlevel to do.  Funcom either needs to make the mobs more enjoyable to fight, give players something to do other than fight, fix PvP (or actually just needs to tweeking) or just take some of the classes out of the game.   I've made a new character and when I'm out in the newbie areas I swear the only classes you see are Doctor, Soldier, or Agent.  And i totally understand why as these are the only fun classes to play.  My new character is.....drum roll.....and agent of course.  And i'm now level 16 and having a blast.  <br><br>If something happens to PvP or the like I'll be back to MA as my primary.  But for now I'll be soaking my fists in a nice epson salt bath.  And nobody is as sad as me to give up my favorite character class from all RPGs I have every played.<br><br>++Madrid <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=alianna>Alianna</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>They call me Bruce.</span><br>  Posts: 246<br> <font color=#660000>(9/10/01 10:03:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lv 80 MA signing off</span><hr size=1> &quot;And dont even let me talk about fighting NTs or Agents who have root, just forget about it.

This was an experiment/learning experience to train on PvP. Most of my guildmates would probably not agree with you now that MA's suck for PvP.

(you hear me losonos!)<br><br>I promise you, most of the things that people say about MA's is pure hype and crap, I used to believe it, but my new Rookie title, and the fact that some people in my guild now fear MA's has me feeling OK with the PvP part of the game. On top of that, I had a BLAST learning to fight!

Um low level bwt (lev72) does 172 a tick, unless I outright resist it (never happens) then the other 60-70 dot's a doc can stick on me REALLY sucks. 272 hurts me bad a tick. Then docs can quick heal themselves for like 700...yikes.

Once ye get him like that he might be more plyable but I am too wary of PvP right now to even worry about it.<br><br>Soldiers debuff his burst skill first.... or better yet hit him with a rifle debuff.. often the soldier you are fighting is not even aware he has been rifle debuffed.. so he goes to switch out that rifle and the hot key wont let him. Then you have yerself an unarmed Soldier who can't equip his weapon.. rofl. We call that 'running around like a soldier with his arms cut off' because you will see that soldier run for his/her life after being deequipped <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br><br>Ok then same goes to an Agent's Aimed shot.
