<br>
You know me in game as both Nonosassy, and Glittermist.<br>
<br>
Well I'll start by giving you an account of the relationship between Elizibith and me.<br>
<br>
One day Glittermist was jogging through East Wastes to collect HQ cougar and kodiak pelts, which is quite a tedious task.  On the bridge in EW, she met a few green druids and a warrior, all belonging to a guild called Chaotic Neutrals.  Stopping by to buff them, as Glittermist often did for green people that did not bug her for buffs, she enrolled the help of the trio to hunt kodiaks and cougars.  It seemed like a beneficial agreement to all parties; one group would recieve pretty decent experience whilst the other would recieve the commonly sought skins of the animals.<br>
<br>
As usually happens when a group of people hangs out together, this small group of wanderers got friendly with the ageless druid, Glittermist, and expressed interest in many of the tales she could weave about the happenings and politics of Norrath.  It wasn't a big surprise to the sage-druid that the fledgelings did not know anything of the wars of rebirth, nor the rise of synergy.  Neither had they ever heard of the ageless Peace of Formosa under the many banners they had flown, or even the formation of Ascending Dawn.<br>
<br>
Since the wise druid Glittermist had seen all of these happenings, and had a lot of time to kill while hunting those darned cougars and kodiaks, she felt it justified to recount the tales of old in a grand story which explained all of the above, and why Glittermist avoided the MIMs and the ADs in the zone with great caution.<br>
<br>
The fledgelings were entertained, and recieved a good deal of experience during the tales.<br>
<br>
It was not long before all items were collected and Glittermist had to move along to continue with her adventures.  It had not been without a great impact on these impressionable young-ones, however, that the old druids recounts did make.  One young druid in particular had a new rolemodel; her name was Elizibith.<br>
<br>
Over the next month, a relationship grew between the druids...  that of a mentor and her apprentice.  Elizibith would often ask Glittermist questions which Glittermist would be happy to answer, for the young druid was so naive and cute, it was really a charm she possessed impossible to ignore.  This was not a completely one-sided relationship however, as Glittermist was soul-bound to another person.  A small, but heavy weight warrior named Nonosassy.<br>
<br>
As Nonosassy was a warrior, she was bound to wander Norrath on her two feet, which being soul-bound to a druid, and knowing the freedom of being able to will herself from one place to another, made walking quite tedious.  Nonosassy often called upon the younger druid, Elizibith, to take her from one place to another with the powers the young druid possessed; and she was more then happy to oblige the one who was so closesly tied to her mentor.<br>
<br>
As often happens when an older, more experienced person helps a younger one, Elizibith grew in power and achievement quickly.  It was not long until she was at the point that her lack of jousting gear (for which she would no longer have to worry about losing if she was knocked-out by an opponent), was simply too much to ignore any longer.  Glittermist thought hard and long about how to aid the young druid.  The answer was clear.<br>
<br>
Nonosassy, on the request of the old druid, was more then happy to invite Elizibith along while her guild raided the plane of fear.  It was of course, with very low priority that Elizibith was able to recieve any gear...  but as every person in the world who was new to raids at one point in time can concede, it was more then what this young druid could ever hope to accomplish on her own.<br>
<br>
Many times those in Nonosassy's guild questioned the young druids attendance... always being paranoid about the spies which had plagued them, but always Nonosassy fought and claimed responsibility for her protege.  This went on for many days and many raids.<br>
<br>
One day, the Juggernaught woke.  Ascending Dawn was aware of their enemies doings and determined to disallow them from adventuring further into their raid.  Elizibith was fairly warned by the leader of Ascending Dawn to leave the plane or risk dying to the fist of fate that was preparing to crush her.<br>
<br>
Elizibith was at a loss.  On the somewhat debatable advice of her mentor, she chose to stay.  It was not often this group of people raided Fear, and she had made friends among those that did.<br>
<br>
It is funny how friendships form a bond between players that can be smashed by opposition, strained between two opposing factions, and even twisted upon itself until it is barely recognizable as that of what it once was... yet it always remains in tact.  Elizibith remained in fear that day and died as did most of her friends (Nonosassy, being the clever halfling she was avoided her death as she usually managed to do) and most of her raid.<br>
<br>
Something else died on that day as well; the chance for Elizibith to obtain the equipment vital to her jousting skill had ended.<br>
<br>
Being somewhat more experienced now in the politics driven by rivalry, a tarnished young druid wiped the ashes off her dim and repressed face.  Yet determination shone brightly through, as her eyes glinted with the spark of what every successful member of Rallos Zek one day achieves by dying enough times.<br>
<br>
And so I have accounted the relationship between Elizibith and PB.  Her and I have had encounters outside the game as well, and have become good friends in the world many people are driven to ignore.<br>
<br>
I can attest with complete certainty on my word that this Elizibith has NEVER helped Xbena in any of her endeavours; nor is she in any way related to Xbena in our outside of game.<br>
<br>
Where ever you find the ageless Glittermist, or the proud stout Nonosassy, you will find Elizibith not far away.  And I challenge anyone who can claim that Nonosassy or Glittermist or Elizibith PVPed with Xbena (though in complete honesty, I wish I had half the skill Xbena has at &quot;seek and destroy&quot; and information gathering.  If I HAD been with her, I might have obtained a few items like Lodizal shields =).<br>
<br>
I apologize for this account being so long, and I have really no time to read through it as I must attend to real life matters of work.  I hope that it may clear up some of the misunderstandings and may allow you to understand why Elizibith is dumbfounded at her KOS situation.<br>
<br>
Whatever else I might be called... I am truthful.  I say things how they are and call them how I see them.  And this account is correct.  Elizibith is guilty of none of the charges she has been accused of any more then you are guilty of helping Guznuk get his epic.<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
Nono <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/ucrazykane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>crazykane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 2:56:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?</span><hr size=1>   Apparently it is pointless to disscuss matters with morons like u.

I am fiercely protective of my friends and loved ones, and unforgiving of any who would hurt them. Speed and foresight are my strengths, at the cost of a little clumsiness. I'm most comfortable with a few friends, but sometimes particularly enjoy spending time in larger groups. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A>

However, its painfully obvious to everyone but Elizibith that her arguments on this board didnt help her situation any. In fact, I'll go out on a limb here and say that chances are she is KOS for the following reasons:<br>
<br>
1) Making an complete ass of herself on our board, offering little other than insulting remarks about our guild.<br>
<br>
2) Beeing full of shit, and insulting our intelligence when claiming that Crazykane/Elizibith are 2 seperate individuals.<br>
<br>
