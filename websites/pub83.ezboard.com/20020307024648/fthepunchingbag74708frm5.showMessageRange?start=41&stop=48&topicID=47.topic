Hey Sensei every think about doing freelance writing and hosting a web page where you post your rants.   You have a faily Dennis Miller esque style that I like quite a bit.<br>

Perhaps an rants page?<br>

Sion, don't take this the wrong way, but dude, you're a tool and a shill. You're not a journalist. You're barely a reporter. You're an unpaid PR Associate for Funcom LV. Stop trying to convince people you're not. Accept it and learn to live with it. We'll all be better off for it.<br>

<br>
Sensei:  The one misconception you have about all this is that Sion wants to be a journalist.  He does not, and stated as such in this thread.  (I do, however, remember some Basher folk claiming journalism during an interview with Funcom, don't remember but don't think it was Sion, since he is vehemently claiming that he never said such a thing).  So maybe this wasn't in regard to Sion, but rather whoever from Basher that claimed they were a journalist.  So that would imply, that you, Sion, were probably the wrong one to argue this claim.  That should be the end of it.<br>
<br>
Sion:  You said:<br>
<br>
&quot;We are hosted for free, Funcom hosts us and we do tend to sometimes show them a little more love, if they ask us nicely.&quot;<br>
<br>
Simple enough, I think that was Sensei's point (feel free to correct me if I am wrong).  He respects (and rightly so, as he was/is one) &quot;pure&quot; journalist tendencies.  He sees a conflict of interest situation.  He calls you on it.  What's wrong with that?  From the quote above, it is obvious it exists.  Even if you didn't say what you did above, it would be obvious to the thinking man that it would exist, whether it was purposeful or not.  FUNCOM hosts your website.  Why wouldn't you give them extra lovin' if they asked nicely?  You'd be stupid not to.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think much of this battle came down to ego.  Sensei came from the superior jounalist standpoint, and well, he is (for reference, cite education and experience resume in his posts).  Sion obvously isn't, as stated by himslef, and from some obvious unprofessional textual lashes in response to well thought out comments/concerns.  Many of the arguements you make, Sensei, assumes Sion wants to become a jounalist, or any semblance of one.  He obviously does not.<br>
<br>
Sion's ego comes from the fact that he works on a website that gets quite a few hits from AO fans.  In Sion's mind, everyone wants to have what he has, which is hosting by FUNCOM and a large set of AO players that visit the site he works on.  Sion: Sensei does not want to be hosted by FUNCOM, in fact quite the opposite, considering some of his posts on conflicts of interest.  He also doesn't care about becoming the most popular news site in AO in number of hits.  He has stated that his goal is to create a website that gives information to MA's out there (again, correcty me if I am wrong, but I think that I am not).<br>
<br>
So there you go, the whole argument.  In my view, most of what went down here is Sion looking down his nose at a smaller fan base website because he thinks other people measure self worth as he does, by how many people visit your site.<br>
<br>
What can I say, I call them as I see them.<br>

Don't flame Sion because he has less style than Sensei. Not fair.<br>
<br>
I wonder if it's the first thread of this sort you guys read... But noone will ever win.<br>
<br>
Sion said that they were not independant. They are hosted by FC and Basher is kind (not sure for the tongue). They have a lot of general news and other stuff.<br>
<br>
Sensei has an independant (and smaller) page, with news and rants.<br>
<br>
The rest of the topic is bullshit. They just flame each other... But funny bullshit. Oh. I know that's quite subjective, but...<br>
Round 1 - Sensei wins.<br>
Round 2 - Sensei wins.<br>
Round 3 - Well... Sensei wins.<br>
Round 4 - You're right, stop here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Tenshai - Ninja - Karana</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (Yeah, I know...)<br>
<br>
PS: And... Sensei said: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   I don't need a bigger audience, Sion, because the MA's are already here and there's not a hell of a lot more here <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Just to tell ya that there is much more people reading this website and these forums than MAs, or even than AO players. IMO, anyone who has been here once will come again regularly.<br>
<br>
Don't care if u quit AO. I just hope you wont quit making this kind of site. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uarbuste.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arbuste</A> at: 1/4/02 12:38:38 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=47.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showMessageRange?topicID=47.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=47.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=47.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=48><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.emailToFriend?topicID=47.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.threadControl?topicID=47.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/far_east/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=47.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=47.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="thepunchingbag74708frm4">House Rules<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm1">Main Dojo<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm2">All About Gear<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm6">Raw Data<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm10">Polling Corner<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm7">The Market - Rubi-Ka 1<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm9">The Market - Rubi-Ka 2<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm3">Off-Topic n' Technical<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm8">Past Humor Links<option value="thepunchingbag74708frm5">Bitch-Fest</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#660000>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708>The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm5>Bitch-Fest</a> <font color=#660000> - </font><a href="http://www.thepunchingbag.net">The Punching Bag</a><font color=#660000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
