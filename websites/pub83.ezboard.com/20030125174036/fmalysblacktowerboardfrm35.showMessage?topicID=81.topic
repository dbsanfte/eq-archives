Powerl evel Q. and A.</span><hr size=1> .    Welcome all to the Dayn's Avengers Lounge.  I have been in the power leveling business for about a two and a half years, shortly after Dayn got sow, skin like rock and his first damage shield.  I have done just about everything when it comes to power leveling, from pre Kunark to post Luclin.  I have done the 0 to 30 handfuls of times, and 30 to 50 twice, almost thrice.<br>
.     Why do I do it?  I'm not really sure, I tend to enjoy taking the long process of leveling over my knee and give it a good spanking, breaking all the leveling rules, and making someone else happy.<br>
.     Long ago, when Dayn was the last remaining officer/member of the long forgotten guild of the Three Fold Alliance, I would find myself in a low level zone, between 11pm and 1am, looking to start a guild for a night.  I would invite all the low level characters, noobs preferred, and shoot them from 4 to about 9, then the next night, from 9 to about 20.  For some time, I was considering remaking Threefold, into Dayn's Avengers, but they introduce the Chat channels shortly after, and Dayn joined Black Tower, leaving only one troll Shadow knight on a deleted account to bare the banner.<br>
.   On this post, I would like to share, and have shared, tips and tricks to power leveling (the best spot, strategies, secrets).  I would also like to extend my services to many of the guild members who have twinks, siblings, or friends that need a boost.  <br>
<br>
.    I tend to have a lot of free time at work to check posts, and I would love to have a lot to respond to (Friday/Saturday night, and Sunday), so if you have anything, please do share.<br>
.    My shift is over, but tomarrow I will give my 0 to 50, quick and dirty.<br>

Powerlevel Q. and A.</span><hr size=1> .    Once upon a time, not your time, not my time, but a time, long ago, leveling form level 0 to level 5 was a matter of Crush bone Belts.  Thick leather belts from the orcs of Clan Crush bone, far to the north in the forest of Grater Faydark, these belts yielded humble armor that was worthy of any new arrival to Norrath. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :pipe --><img src=http://www.smilies-world.de/Smilies/Smilies_klein_1/thegrey1.gif ALT=":pipe"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=294">everquest.allakhazam.com/...?quest=294</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
.   Although, in recent day, it seem to be just as well to start the slaughter of orc after orc, leaving the belts to rot, and letting a damage shield do most of the work (Well, all of the work minus the one or two damage dealt by a nimble weapon in the hands of your clumsy new companion, the quicker the better)<br>
.    In my years, I have found that it is often better to let a damage shield do it works when it is not on the skin of your saplings.  Your small friend is just as well to do a dishonorable blow to the back while not receiving one in return, while the pore creature beat on the twice thorned skin (Shield and Coat) of your all mighty druid, all the time he attempts to sit, over and over and over (Works great to keep the agro). <br>
.    Once the orcs are spend, and not one stands that is worth the effort to slay (level 8 or 9), take your fawn to the Gazebo in the Estate of unrest.   Fields and fields of death beetles, Jack O Lanterns, and Ghouls.  The masses of monsters that can be slaughtered in an hour are amazing.  Casting saplings with area of effect damage spells can be very effective here, once the pore beetles are not longer robust to her feeble magical, still with the druid sitting all the time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/unrest.html">www.eqatlas.com/unrest.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
.     Ding, 12, and you’re off, in the footsteps of the late Alice.... To The MOON!<br>
.     PALUDAL CAVERNS, home of those who do not wish to be level 12-24 for more then 3 or 4 hours.   If you could drown in experience, this would be the only place to do it.  The same tactics as before, the druid snares and sits, while the saplings clumsily swings his weapon about in such a manor as to hit each pore Phlarg Fiend once or twice, these can also be substituted with Outcast Shiknar, who tend not to run.   To pass the time, you can kill the Outcast Shiknar near the spawn point of The Reishicyben, AKA, Recyclebin.  He spawns every 2 hour or so, and drops some fun items.<br>
<br>

<br>
Now for the split, those with gate, and those without.<br>
<br>
.     The ability to gate can be substituted with the use of Trans locate.<br>
<br>
.     I will save the tips for those with gate for a later post about tips and tricks of the hero bracer quest. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
.     But for now, I shall share the secrets for the melee (also including Necromancers and Mages).<br>
<br>
.     The Twilight Sea, alfresco for the 24 to 32.  The druid teleport takes you to the only place you want to be.  From here on out, it is kill, kill, kill; Air, fire, water, and earth elementals.  It is much harder for the druid to sit and take the hits form these elementals, so your maturing saplings is about to receive her first intentional blows of battle.  Yes, she will die. No, it  won't matter.  I have tried adventuring to other islands, it does not seem to be worth the effort.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/twilightsea.html">www.eqatlas.com/luclin/twilightsea.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
.    From here, you have many options, the most popular being Sol B, or Echo Caverns.  Long ago, when the Echo Caverns was my little secrete, it was prime leveling material.  Often, it seems to be camped by a soloer, or someone after Undead Snake Organs, for the Katta quest.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1301">everquest.allakhazam.com/...quest=1301</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
.      More often then not, you can have your little nook, kill the silly snake, and all his skelly friends, and get a level every 2 or three hours, about one bout of KEI.  Supposedly there is an enchanter that spawns if you kill all the skellys.  But we have tried several times.  If you like, you can have a friend come, and loot all the picks, sell them in zone, and make about 7pp each pick.  Doing this for several hours is VERY profitable.<br>
<br>
.      I have not been to many of the Kunark or Velious zone, some of them could be very useful for power leveling, if any one know of some, please post.<br>
<br>
.      Well, that’s it for now, and my Pizza just showed up.  Take care every one, sleep well, and safe hunting.  *Wish I remembered to bring the password to work with me, so I can read the other posts..... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Tips and tricks of the hero bracer.</span><hr size=1> .    Before reading on, you must agree to take the content of what you are about to read to your grave.  Day by day the sanctuary of Steamfont Mountains is being over run by those who don'respect the glory that is the hero bracer, and over crowded by those who have no love for its participants.<br>
.     Before I go on, you must read and understood code of conduct for the hero bracer.  Some say this quest is a fluke by Verant, and soon it will be corrected and this goldmine will forever be closed.   Other say that it is Verant's response to the lack of soloing activities, and a justification as to why they call the game Ever quest.  Regardless, no one EVER petition Stolen kills, or wrongfully looted Shackles.  Intentional or not, all disputes are handled there and then, without contacting a GM.<br>
.    In the past, some have been know to gather a large number of minos, and annihilate them with a single Area of Effect spell.  This has been nearly eliminated by me and some of my fellow questers.  Doing this destroys many of the Mino Slavers at once, preventing others from spawning the Mino Hero shortly after he is killed.<br>
.    Most now do the quest in pairs; one spawns the Hero, while the other kills the Hero.  It is common practice to kill 4 heroes in one round, loot two, gate, Turn in, Circle out, run, and loot the other two.  This save much time, but leaves the corpses open for loot.  If you see a Mino Hero corpse with Shackle on it, and more then a minute before it rots, please don’t loot it.<br>
.   Lastly, be nice, share, and hold back your temper.  2% AA experience every shackle is nothing to complain about, and there is plenty for everyone.<br>
.     Now that I have made the Hero Bracer Quest seem like a Dog eat Dog activity, like the old Norrath used to be, with too many people, and not enough things to kill, here is how you can join.<br>
.   Continuing from the Split in my last post, those with gate, or a readily available Wizard who can Trans Locate (once you have expended the Outcast Shiknar, or the Phlarg Fiend), can move to the West Common lands. Here, you seek the two guards at the Tollbooth, their prices are high, they show no mercy, they hit like pansies, and... well, there ugly too. Guard Colin, and Guard Valon are the enemy.  Inside they hold Experience and faction.  You can also kill Kizdean Gix, another pansy just south of the Tollbooth, aswell.<br>
.    The time will come when the experience gained is no longer exciting, and the druid no longer feels useful.  This is when your run to the lake.  Mojax Hikspin is your man, if he is indifferent, then you are set.  You must boy about 560 to 840 milk, and give them to Mojax Hikspin, one stack of 4 works just as well as 4 stacks of 1.  One minute and thirty seconds after turning in the first milk, he will get up and walk a way, drop a note, then despawn.  Hail him, and he stops, and you can continue turning in milk.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/westcommonsmap.html">www.eqatlas.com/westcommonsmap.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
.    After your backpacks are empty, you should have amiable faction with the Steel Warrior guild.  Go to South Qyenos, and find Grahan Rothgar.   If he is amiable, you are set.  No need to kill any silly cat man, just bind your but there, gate and get started.<br>
