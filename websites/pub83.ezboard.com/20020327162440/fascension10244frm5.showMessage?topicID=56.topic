Council have individually discussed all current applicants, so if you have recently applied your situation will be slightly different than if you are newly applying.  If you applied and you are NOT level 60, you must re-apply under the new applicant rules when you reach 60th level.  This post is split into two sections, NEW recruits and CURRENT recruits.  There have been changes to both, so even if you are a current recruit, please re-read the new recruit policies.<br><br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    NEW RECRUITS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>Level Minimums<br>------------------------<br>Level minimum is 60.  No exceptions.  We have always encouraged all members to obtain level 60 due to the advantages in resistances and abilities it gives, even if it means skipping events to do so.  For newer people, however, we'd rather you attend as many events as you can.<br><br><br>Sponsors<br>------------------------<br>You must find at least FIVE people willing to sponsor you from inside the guild.  Ascending Dawn members can only sponsor ONE person at a time.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Note that being sponsored does NOT guarantee guild membership.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You will be evaluated and voted on by the guild as a whole.  Once you've found <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> FIVE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> sponsors, you need to post on the public recruit board and all FIVE of your AD sponsors must post acknowledging themselves as your sponsor.  You must then be approved by council, and at that time you may start attending events with AD.  It is your responsibility to check with sponsors for event times, and also you AND your sponsor's responsibility to make sure you know what is going on during an event (when we're moving, tactics, etc.).  Once a recruit, you can expect the evaluation period to be atleast 4-6 weeks and no longer than 3 months.<br><br><br>Resistance Checklist<br>------------------------<br>Your character's resists play an extremely important role in your ability to function and contribute to events. Someone that continually takes damage from area effect spells because their resists are low is far more of a liability than they are a help. Thus, there are minimum requirements for resist gear before joining the guild. The following stats are the minimums of any given UNBUFFED character. Songs, spells, potions, or items that cast resist spells do NOT count towards your total. There are 3 separate requirements at the moment, all which can be achieved using 3 separate sets of gear if necessary. You may sacrifice your character's main stats (int, wis, etc.) in order to reach these.<br><br>1) 100 Magic, 100 Fire, 100 cold SIMULTANEOUSLY<br>2) 100 Magic, 100 Poison SIMULTANEOUSLY<br>3) 100 Magic, 100 Disease SIMULTANEOUSLY<br><br><br>Item Checklist<br>------------------------<br>There are several items which come in very handy during events. We feel several of these items are a necessity, and have made them a requirement:<br><br>Permanent Enduring Breath item - Songs, spells, or items with a casting time do NOT count. You need an item that is either a permanent effect, or instant-cast enduring breath.<br><br>Journeymans Boots - An independent form transportation is often necessary for our members to reach various locations during events. These also serve as a secondary right-click item for outdoor zones. Traveler's boots ARE acceptable as well, however, SoW potions are NOT.<br><br>Right click instant-buff item - We require that you have at least one item that is a self-only instant cast buff. The item MUST BE INDOOR USABLE. Journeymans boots and items with charges do NOT count. Suggestions are Velium Coldain Ring (preferred), Shrunken Goblin Skull earring. Melee classes should seek to acquire both (however it is not a requirement.)<br><br><br>Key Checklist<br>------------------------<br>Many zones that we visit require a key to access. Everyone should have these keys on hand at any time for events. The keys you are REQUIRED to have are as follows:<br><br>Sebilis Key<br>Charisis Key (howling stones)<br>Tooth of the Cobalt Scar<br>Shrine Key (key to exit skyshrine)<br><br>It would also look favorably upon you if you had some of your veeshan's peak key quest completed. Many of these parts are quite simple and can be done alone. A good guide can be found here:<br>www.geocities.com/mct_02/vpkey.html<br><br>Faction<br>------------------------<br>We are on Giant faction in Velious.  You will be expected to kill dragons and take Claws of Veeshan hits.  If this is a problem, be sure to finish up any quests you are working on that require this faction before applying.<br><br>Any questions may be posted here, or you may give me a tell in-game to discuss anything you have questions about. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/uadellrz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AdellRZ</A> at: 1/12/02 1:02:50 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showPrevMessage?topicID=56.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.showNextMessage?topicID=56.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.threadControl?topicID=56.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/deleteThreadFire.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=56.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=56.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub83.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="ascension10244frm3">Public Forum<option value="ascension10244frm5">Recruitment Forum<option value="ascension10244frm1">AD Private<option value="ascension10244frm6">Trade Forum<option value="ascension10244frm21">Recruits Discussion<option value="ascension10244frm7">Bards<option value="ascension10244frm8">Clerics<option value="ascension10244frm9">Druids<option value="ascension10244frm10">Enchanters<option value="ascension10244frm11">Magicians<option value="ascension10244frm12">Monks<option value="ascension10244frm13">Necromancers<option value="ascension10244frm14">Paladins<option value="ascension10244frm20">Rangers<option value="ascension10244frm15">Rogues<option value="ascension10244frm16">Shadowknights<option value="ascension10244frm17">Shamans<option value="ascension10244frm18">Warriors<option value="ascension10244frm19">Wizards<option value="ascension10244frm4">Officers Forum<option value="ascension10244frm23">AD Private - Quest & Strategy</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bascension10244>Ascending Dawn</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fascension10244frm5>Recruitment Forum</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
