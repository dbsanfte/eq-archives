<br>
Before we veer off into irrelavency, I'll say that your ATK rating is actually split. It's not like a 1he ENF where you cringe at the thought of missmissmissmiss with that HW pulling your ATK rating down. <br>
<br>
Your claw ATK is separate from your fist ATK, despite what it shows on your info HUD. Now, if your claw ATK is slipping, then you'll start seeing more missmissmiss and getting parried more and more. However this has no effect on what your fists are up to, other than depriving you of the seven fist attacks/minute you'd have if you weren't wearing a claw. Eventually, you WILL outgrow your claws (something I'm dreading with my nanomage, but then again, she probably won't get that high of level). <br>
<br>
Now for the fun part. I've been thinking about an org off and on for about six months. More seriously lately...but...god I can't stand guilds anymore. Call it a legacy of bad behavior in guilds in EQ, but I hate them. Ironically, the best guilds I've been in were in DAoC. There, they did seem much friendlier and easier to get along with members' and the org's goals (probably because there wasn't that much to argue about in DAoC--talk about lack of content). <br>
<br>
Everytime I think about contacting someone I starting thinking about loss of freedom. I don't like having to do stuff all the time. I like coming and going ingame when I please and switching toons four or five times a day. PvP in MMRPGs is an incredible waste of time (though mass battles are occasionally amusing). Then we get to camping and the worst of the worst. <br>
<br>
I like the idea of having a ready pool of hunting partners/teams and of being able to call on others for help with certain projects, but we all know what comes with that--especially with FC beginning to slide into creeping featurism--the camping, org conflicts, the idiot-factor...gah. I don't like them, don't trust them, and think the way they're understood these days is bad for these games. We need something new, but unfortunately EQ set the path and that's the way things are still going.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#FFFFCC><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shaokhanfuzzytoes>ShaokhanFuzzytoes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#660000>(10/27/02 7:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2146.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Decided to go with Claws, but</span><hr size=1> I just noticed that with the ql 109 I saw myself using fists and kick sometimes.

Unfortunately, that formula has been used and abused by every MMORPG in existence and will continue to be used and abused until someone can come up with a fresh way to get alot of ppls together in one venue and convice them to plop down their money on something totally new. People are used to the &quot;hack and slash&quot;, level treadmills, &quot;phat&quot; loot, and raid type senarios that UO, EQ (where greed is a way of life), AO, DOAC, and AC made popular.<br>
<br>
I think you'll find much of the same thing in the future MMORPGs that will be coming out next year, only probably abit more refined and streamlined, so as to appear &quot;fresh&quot;. Each new game that comes out somewhat improves on the old system (AO with it's personal mission system, DAOC with it's no exp/loot for green mobs, Shadowbane with it's siege and superior PvP, SWG with it's beefed up tradeskills), so you do tend to see gaming companies learning from the mistakes of past games. Even EQ 2 is supposed to re-work it's game so as not to have as much of the rampant materialism and lack of total respect for younger players that is so prevalent in EQ these days.<br>
<br>
All in all, I think these types of games will improve as they evolve, but the core formula will still be the same as it is today. Also keep in mind that people rarely change, so that griefer that made life hell for everyone in EQ, will probably move on to one of these other games and continue to annoy others with their stupidity. I don't think some things will ever change, however, because as long as the masses WANT to camp hours upon hours for that Breastplate of Supreme Uberness, then that is what the gaming companies will continue to give them.<br>

We now return to our regulary scheduled Claw thread........<br>

That happens when you try to recall specific info from memory...and haven't looked at a toon in months. <br>
<br>
Finally got back to playing my solitus MA, and I was in for a few shocks. One was you forget how hard your oldest toon had it back in the day...pioneers take the arrows and all that. Aside from gameplay, I actually looked at her MA and piercing specs and they're aren't what I remember. 445+ in piercing with 650 MA. She does good claw damage, but it's a damn sight higher than the 330+ I thought it was...sorry about that Shaokhan. Good news is she's 93, so you're a ways off from that. She wails with a ql128 claw and could equip one about 140 easily, I think. My nanomage's piercing is more in line what I remember: 340 or so at 63. She does outstanding damage for her level.<br>
<br>
Back to the hijack: <br>
<br>
I still don't like or trust guilds, but you do see some things occasionally that do give you hope. As I type this, I'm parked in my yalm in ICC HQ and see a little bit of roleplaying that brings a smile to my face. Nanomage Liberation Front folks greeting each other in character. &quot;Hail Xxxxxx. Until all are free!&quot; I like seeing that. It also reminds me why I made my nanomage MA and why she's Omni, though for different reasons than the neutral NLF. Still, neat stuff there. <br>
<br>
I have high hopes (possibly not warranted, this IS Verant...) for EQ2. I still like the world they made, even if it did attact the worst sort of powergamers. Hopefully some fresh ideas will be implemented and I can indulge in dark elf-dom again. Although I don't like the l33t folks, I did get a lot of enjoyment tweaking them whenever possible. It's all about the eeee-vil after all. <br>
<br>
Time will tell...and I still say Shadowbane will never ship! Never!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#99CC66><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub83.ezboard.com/bthepunchingbag74708.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shaokhanfuzzytoes>ShaokhanFuzzytoes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ninja Wanna-Be</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#660000>(10/27/02 7:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub83.ezboard.com/fthepunchingbag74708frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2146.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Decided to go with Claws, but</span><hr size=1> I am lvl 92 now and can equip a ql 129 claw with my own buffs.

<br>
So if you equip a claw and still only see one attack bar moving back and forth, it means your MA skill is not high enough to &quot;dual wield&quot; the claw with fists.  Needless to say, your MA skill should always be maxed and triple implanted, and this usually meets the hidden MA requirement.  If you can self-equip a claw, you typically don't encounter this problem until a very high level Tiger Claw (~Q180+).  However, if you get wrangled or buffed into your claw (and can't/don't keep those buffs running), you may encounter this problem.<br>
