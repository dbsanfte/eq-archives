<p>EQInterface.com is proud to announce that EQSkins.com (formerly found at <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/eqskins/">http://eq.stratics.com/eqskins/</a> ) has merged with <a href="http://www.eqinterface.com">EQInterface.com</a> as of January 3, 2004.</p>

<p>Lueamdar of EQSkins has this to say about his move:<br />

<i>"I am both honored and excited to be joining the <a href="http://www.eqinterface.com">EQInterface.com</a> team. I have watched this site grow since its start, and will do my best to contribute to its content. "</i></p>

<p>Stratics' team will be taking over the files that currently reside on their server. So that all those who go there will not lose their choice of service they will only see a name change in the next week as Stratic absorbs the file structure into its website.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eqinterface.com">EQInterface.com</a> has become the Number One site for User Interfaces. Featuring such well known UI artists as T.King, Sars, Cairenn and Drakah, <a href="http://www.eqinterface.com">EQInterface</a> has more than 2500 files available. With over 160,000 subscribers, it quickly became the place to go if you were having trouble with your UI.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eqinterface.com">EQInterface</a> is Owned and Operated by Kudane Cheetahfeet and Dolby Mithrael. The site started in August of 2002, right after the new User Interface went “Live” on all Everquest servers.</p>
