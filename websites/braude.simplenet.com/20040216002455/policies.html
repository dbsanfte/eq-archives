          <td align="left" valign="top" class="body"><p>SimpleNet acts as a neutral 
              provider of web hosting services to the global Internet. SimpleNet 
              may suspend services provided to you or cancel your account if determined 
              that you have violated SimpleNet policies. SimpleNet is required 
              to enforce the Acceptable Use Policies of our upstream network providers. 
              These include, but are not limited to: UUNet, Sprint, and AT&amp;T.</p>
              <P><strong>LAWFUL PURPOSE </strong></p>
              
            <P>SimpleNet may refuse service to anyone. You may use SimpleNet services 
              only for lawful purposes. You may not transmit any materials that 
              are in violation of any Federal, State or Local laws. You may not 
              transmit any copyrighted materials or material protected by trade 
              secrets. SimpleNet will make the decision as to whether materials 
              violate its policies. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>SPECIFIC ACCEPTABLE USE POLICIES UNAUTHORIZED USE </strong></p>
              
            <P>SimpleNet will strongly react to any use or attempted use of an 
              Internet account or computer without the owner's authorization. 
              This includes &quot;social engineering&quot; (tricking other people 
              into releasing their passwords), password cracking, security hole 
              scanning, etc. Any of these actions by a SimpleNet customer, whether 
              or not the attacked account or computer belongs to SimpleNet, will 
              result in action against the attacker. Possible actions include 
              warnings, account suspension or cancellation, and civil or criminal 
              legal action, according to the seriousness of the attack. </p>
            <p>SimpleNet may deny use of *.simplenet.com third-level domain names 
              which are found to be obscene, offensive, or pornographic. Content 
              which is referenced by a *.simplenet.com third-level domain may 
              not be obscene, offensive, or pornographic. Determining these criteria 
              is within SimpleNet's sole discretion.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>ZERO TOLERANCE </strong></p>
            <P>If you send unsolicited email or cross post to Usenet newsgroups, 
              you may be subject to immediate cancellation. SimpleNet may cancel 
              your account and terminate your services immediately, with no prior 
              notice and no refund of unused service fees. This policy is to promote 
              proper Internet etiquette.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>PAYMENT POLICIES </strong></p>
              
            <P><strong>Initial Fees</strong> <br>
              Payment of the setup fee and first period's monthly charges are 
              required for SimpleNet to activate your service. Setup fees are 
              non-refundable. Fees for domain name setup, renewal, or transfer 
              are non-refundable.</p>
              
            <P>SimpleNet will notify you by email if the initial charge to your 
              card is declined. A second attempt to bill the card will be made 
              in three days. If the card is again declined and you have not provided 
              alternate valid credit card information, SimpleNet will cancel your 
              order. Please note that services will not be activated until payment 
              is received. </p>
            <p>Payment by check will only be allowed for payment periods of 6 
              and 12 months. Service for check paying customers will only be activated 
              after your check clears bank processing.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Monthly Recurring Charges </strong><br>
              You must pay for your service by the first day of each billing cycle. 
              Billing cycles are based on when you initially signed up for service. 
              For instance, if you started service on the 15th of the month, your 
              billing due date will be on the 15th each month thereafter. </p>
            <p>When paying by credit card, we will automatically charge your credit 
              card on the first day of your billing cycle which may be 1, 6 or 
              12 months. Your account will be suspended if three attempts to charge 
              the card are declined. SimpleNet will notify you by email if your 
              account is suspended, so that you may provide us with another credit 
              card.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>CANCELLATION</strong></p>
            <P>SimpleNet reserves the right to cancel your service at any time. 
              Upon cancellation, SimpleNet will refund any unused amounts that 
              you have paid. If your account is cancelled because you have violated 
              SimpleNet usage policies, no refund will be paid. </p>
            <p>You may cancel your service at anytime. You can use the online 
              cancellation form located within your Control Panel. You may also 
              cancel your account using fax or regular mail. Any accounts cancelled 
              by fax or regular mail must include: </p>
            <p>&middot; Account name<br>
              &middot; The primary contact&#8217;s valid signature<br>
              &middot; Reason for cancellation<br>
              &middot; Last four digits of the credit card or Checking account 
              number on file</p>
              
            <p>The customer is responsible for all money owed on the account from 
              the time it is established to the time that cancellation has been 
              confirmed by SimpleNet.</p>
            <p>Transferring your domain away from SimpleNet does not mean your 
              account is automatically cancelled. You must notify SimpleNet to 
              cancel your account, using one of the methods listed above. </p>
            <p>Refunds will only be given for full, pre-paid months of service. 
              If you are due a refund, SimpleNet will send a check or refund your 
              credit card within 30 days of cancellation receipt.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>PRICING POLICY </strong></p>
            <P>SimpleNet will not change your fees during the middle of your billing 
              cycle. If fees change, they will go into effect the first day of 
              your next billing cycle. </p>
            <p>If you signed up for SimpleNet under a special promotion and you 
              change your services, the special promotion pricing will no longer 
              be valid for your new services.</p>
            <p>SimpleNet may change package features and specifications at its 
              discretion.</p>
            <P><br>
