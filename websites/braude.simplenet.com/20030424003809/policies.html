          <td class="maincopy"> <P>SimpleNet acts as a neutral provider of web
              hosting services to the global Internet. SimpleNet may suspend
              services provided to you or cancel your account if determined that
              you have violated SimpleNet policies. SimpleNet is required to
              enforce the Acceptable Use Policies of our upstream network providers.
              These include, but are not limited to: UUNet, Sprint, and AT&amp;T.</p>
            <P><strong>LAWFUL PURPOSE </strong></p>
            <P>SimpleNet may refuse service to anyone. You may use SimpleNet
              services only for lawful purposes. You may not transmit any materials
              that are in violation of any Federal, State or Local laws. You
              may not transmit any copyrighted materials or material protected
              by trade secrets. SimpleNet will make the decision as to whether
              materials violate its policies. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>SPECIFIC ACCEPTABLE USE POLICIES <br>
  UNAUTHORIZED USE </strong></p>
            <P>SimpleNet will strongly react to any use or attempted use of an
              Internet account or computer without the owner's authorization.
              This includes &quot;social engineering&quot; (tricking other people
              into releasing their passwords), password cracking, security hole
              scanning, etc. Any of these actions by a SimpleNet customer, whether
              or not the attacked account or computer belongs to SimpleNet, will
              result in action against the attacker. Possible actions include
              warnings, account suspension or cancellation, and civil or criminal
              legal action, according to the seriousness of the attack. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>ZERO TOLERANCE </strong></p>
            <P>If you send unsolicited email or cross post to Usenet newsgroups,
              you may be subject to immediate cancellation. SimpleNet may cancel
              your account and terminate your services immediately, with no prior
              notice and no refund of unused service fees. This policy is to
              promote proper Internet etiquette. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>PAYMENT POLICIES </strong></p>
            <P><strong>Initial Fees</strong> <br>
  Payment of the setup fee and first period's monthly charges are required for
    SimpleNet to activate your service. Setup fees are non-refundable. Only payment
    by credit card will be accepted.</p>
            <P>SimpleNet will notify you by email if the initial charge to your
              card is declined. A second attempt to bill the card will be made
              in three days. If the card is again declined and you have not provided
              alternate valid credit card information, SimpleNet will cancel
              your order. Please note that services will not be activated until
              payment is received. <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Monthly Recurring Charges </strong><br>
  You must pay for your service by the first day of each billing cycle. Billing
  cycles are based on when you initially signed up for service. For instance,
  if you started service on the 15th of the month, your billing due date will
  be on the 15th each month thereafter. </p>
            <p>When paying by credit card, we will automatically charge your
              credit card on the first day of your billing cycle. Your account
              will be suspended if three attempts to charge the card are declined.
              SimpleNet will notify you by email if your account is suspended,
              so that you may provide us with another credit card.</p>
            <P><br>
                <strong>CANCELLATION</strong></p>
            <P>SimpleNet reserves the right to cancel your service at any time.
              Upon cancellation, SimpleNet will refund any unused amounts that
              you have paid. If your account is cancelled because you have violated
              SimpleNet usage policies, no refund will be paid. </p>
            <p>You may cancel your service at anytime. You can use the online
              cancellation form located within your Web Console. You may also
              cancel your account using fax or regular mail. Any accounts cancelled
              by fax or regular mail must include: </p>
            <p>&middot; Account name<br>
&middot; The primary contact&#8217;s valid signature<br>
&middot; Reason for cancellation<br>
&middot; Last four digits of the credit card on file</p>
            <p>The customer is responsible for all money owed on the account
              from the time it is established to the time that cancellation has
              been confirmed by SimpleNet.</p>
            <p>Transferring your domain from away SimpleNet does not mean your
              account is automatically cancelled. You must notify SimpleNet to
              cancel your account, using one of the methods listed above. </p>
            <p>Refunds will only be given for full, pre-paid months of service.
              If you are due a refund, SimpleNet will send a check or refund
              your credit card within 30 days of cancellation receipt.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>PRICING POLICY </strong></p>
            <P>SimpleNet will not change your fees during the middle of your
              billing cycle. If fees change, they will go into effect the first
              day of your next billing cycle. </p>
            <p>If you signed up for SimpleNet under a special promotion and you
              change your services, the special promotion pricing will no longer
              be valid for your new services.<br>
              <br>
