              <td>When drafting the SimpleNet business plan, the founders envisioned
                themselves enjoying the San Diego surf while the virtual company
                ran itself. Bursting onto the scene in March 1996, as the first
                specialized Internet Presence Provider (IPP) looked much easier
                on paper than it was in reality. Long days and even longer nights
                developed an uncommon corporate culture that became the cornerstone
                of the Internet industry. The relentless endeavors of dedicated
                employees helped sustain SimpleNet&#8217;s explosive growth and
                ability to offer inexpensive, yet reliable services. Choosing
                to avoid the cost of dialup access faced by traditional ISPs,
                the company was one of the first to focus solely on domain name
                registration, email, and the total gamut of web hosting services
                from shared to co-location. SimpleNet suddenly found itself a
                market leader, and one that coined the term &#8220;web hosting.&#8221;
                <p>The plan was to build infrastructure, solve complex engineering
                  problems, and market technology aimed to shape the young web
                  hosting industry. The strategy behind the plan eventually evolved
                  from the company name. The Internet was complicated; SimpleNet
                  created easily understandable services, products, and prices.
                  While continually working to raise industry standards, the
                  organization adhered to a philosophy of simplicity.</p>
                <p>To better control its own destiny, SimpleNet began searching
                  for an ideal location to build a data center. After several
                  months of searching, SimpleNet negotiated space in a downtown
                  high-rise. The build-out required utilizing one-third of the
                  available building power, structural work that temporarily
                  relocated other tenants, and sub-contractors in over 130 trades.
                  Commitment to its customers prompted SimpleNet to undertake
                  this monumental task of building a world-class facility, which
                  became the first of its kind in San Diego. With construction
                  in high gear, the facility was taking shape by January 1998.
                  The notable efforts of many companies made the Access Center
                  a reality. MFS/WorldCom trenched nearly six downtown city blocks
                  in a phenomenal 24 hours to bring in an OC-3 fiber connection.
                  Six months later, SimpleNet celebrated its Grand Opening in
                  June of 1998.</p>
                <p>On the path of continued growth, SimpleNet found itself more
                  often in the public eye. In the spring of 1998, the company&#8217;s
                  first tradeshow appearance at Internet World Los Angeles brought
                  SimpleNet into the limelight. Later that year, SimpleNet was
                  recognized as one of Dun and Bradstreet/Entrepreneur Magazine&#8217;s,
                  Hot 100 Companies of 1998.</p>
                <p>On the evening of November 16, 1998, each employee received
                  a phone call to announce that Broadcast.com had acquired SimpleNet.
                  While it was a new beginning, the acquisition also marked the
                  end of an era and put the company into the large corporate
                  world. Only a few months later, Broadcast.com was in negotiations
                  with Yahoo!, which culminated in the multi-billion dollar purchase
                  of the company in July of 1998.</p>
                <p>In early 2002, SimpleNet hosted nearly 400,000 domain names
                  and more than 75,000 web sites. New accounts were being added
                  at a rate of several hundred per day, many of them through
                  word-of-mouth recommendations by existing SimpleNet customers.
                  Traffic to and from these customers&#8217; sites accounted
                  for approximately 2% of all Internet traffic worldwide.</p>
                <p>After several years of Yahoo! ownership, the founders that
                  were still actively involved with SimpleNet took advantage
                  of an opportunity to rebuild the SimpleNet experience from
                  scratch as a privately owned company. Their premise was to
                  leverage the personal experience that, over the years, had
                  allowed them to create one of the most successful hosting platforms
                  in the industry. But, to take this experience and create the
                  next generation of stability, security, and reliability in
                  a web host. SimpleNet is a company that is monumental in its
                  solidarity. The core experts in software, hardware, networking,
                  customer service, marketing, and business development today
                  are largely the same team members that built the company&#8217;s
                  successes in the mid-nineties.</p>
                <p>There are two aspects that differentiate SimpleNet from its
                  competitors &#8211; reliability and support. Operating a data
                  center and building multiple hosting platforms over the years
                  have provided tremendous experience to the company. SimpleNet&#8217;s
                  infrastructure is unsurpassed in the web hosting world. Redundancy,
                  at SimpleNet, is defined by: multiple web and email servers
                  in a fully load-balanced environment, disk storage with hot
                  spare drives, multiple Internet providers, multiple fiber providers,
                  multiple air conditioning units, UPS, and a dedicated gas-powered
                  generator. Reliability and redundancy to this degree means
                  that customer web sites are faster, more secure, and more accessible.</p>
                <p>SimpleNet also differentiates itself by providing top-of-the-line
                  customer support. Available 24 hours per day, each customer
                  support representative has had at least four years of experience
                  in support of web hosting customers. SimpleNet is dedicated
                  to solving customers&#8217; problems, even if it means handholding
                  through a process that&#8217;s not necessarily nor directly
                  related to its own products. If SimpleNet&#8217;s team is knowledgeable
                  about a topic &#8211; they&#8217;ll attempt to help their customer
                  through it.</p>
                <p>Throughout the course of its growth, SimpleNet has realized
                  that being an industry leader involves assisting in the development
                  of partner products and services. The company is proud to have
                  assisted in the development of the Cobalt RaQ Server Appliance,
                  the Miva Scripting Language, Sun Apache Server Software, and
                  several other application providers&#8217; products.</p>
                <p>Today, running the business from the beach remains a dream,
                  but several other dreams have been realized. The Access Center
                  signifies the culmination of innovation, problem solving, and
                  a pledge to excellence &#8211; all of which remain key components
                  of the operation. Expanded service offerings for every range
                  of customers drive SimpleNet&#8217;s growth. Constantly striving
                  to surpass client and industry expectations, SimpleNet remains
                  a unique, ever-evolving organization dedicated to being the
                Internet&#8217;s foremost Internet Presence Provider.</p></td>
