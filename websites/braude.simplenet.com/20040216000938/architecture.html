		      To evaluate
              the merit of a web hosting provider, whether it be for a new site
              or an existing site, you must often look beyond what they list
              as their feature set. The following information is meant to show
              you how SimpleNet goes beyond industry standards to provide availability,
              security and performance for your web site. SimpleNet has created
              a web site architecture that is unparalleled in the industry.</p>

              <tr>
                <td class="body"><p> <img src="images/photos/architecture_connectivity.gif" width="150" height="150" hspace="10" border="1" align="left">Your web site performance is not just a
                    measure of your web server's speed. The ability of your web
                    host to route traffic through the cleanest Internet connections
                    is also of great importance. It is crucial that your provider
                    have multiple connections to the Internet. Accidental fiber
                    cuts in construction or telecom work and data center equipment
                    failure can cause your site to go offline for an extended
                    amount of time. This can be avoided if your web host has
                    other connections to the Internet that will reroute traffic
                    that would have normally been carried on the failed circuit.
                    Yes, this means your host must also have extra capacity on
                    hand to handle normal traffic levels when one connection
                    is lost; another area where a host can attempt to cut cost.
                    Much like when driving your car, there are several streets
                    that you can take to get to your desired destination. Sometimes
                    you will encounter construction or an accident that will
                    require you to take an alternative street. Well, the Internet
                    works the same way. There are several routes that traffic
                    can take to a destination. Your host should be able to choose
                    the cleanest, or most efficient, route to your web site visitor.
                    In fact, your host should be able to continually tune these
                    routes to find the best path to your visitors. Another way
                    to achieve this is by minimizing the number of different
                    networks traffic will pass through before reaching its destination.
                    It is extremely important for your host to have direct connections
                    to networks that have lots of eyeballs. In other words, your
                    web site will be served better if your web host is using
                    connections with networks that facilitate Internet access
                    to large volumes of subscribers. Finally, avoid hosts who
                    only have &quot;peering&quot; relationships with networks.
                    Peering is a relationship between two or more ISPs whereby
                    they agree to create a link between each other instead of
                    using the standard Internet backbone. Those that have a customer
                    relationship will always get better service than those who
                    are peering.</p>

                    unauthorized access to your web site. A firewall examines
                    each network packet to determine whether to allow it to reach
                    its requested destination or prohibit it and report it for
                    further analysis. A web host should maintain a firewall or
                    packet filtering system to prevent unwanted connections to
                    your web site. Only connections that are necessary toward
                    the functionality of your site should be permitted to access
                    your web server. This is analogous to traffic that may flow
                    into a room. Packet filtering technology basically keeps
                    the windows in your room locked so that visitors can only
                    access your room through the doorway. A web host must also
                    keep its system software up-to-date. Much like it is recommended
                    that you keep your home computer up to speed with security
                    patches, web hosts must stay in tune with security holes
                    and patches as software updates are released to fix them.
                    A good web host will also have regularly scheduled maintenance
                    periods to install these updates with minimal impact to your
                    site availability and performance.</p>

                    that serve requested web pages, files or other information.
                    Servers answer requests from web browsers to provide information
                    from web sites, email and databases. Then, sends that information
                    to the requesting browser. Load balancing divides the amount
                    of work that a server has to do between multiple servers
                    so that more work gets done in the same amount of time and,
                    in general, all web sites requests within the network get
                    served faster. The load balancers stay in constant contact
                    with the servers to determine how busy they are and/or if
                    one of them has failed. It may sound like a no-brainer, but
                    having your site connected to the Internet is the whole reason
                    for having a web site. Failures that cause your site to lose
                    connection can, and will, happen. Therefore, it's crucial
                    to find a provider whose architecture provides the least-risk
                    of failure. Redundancy is key. Single points of failure are
                    very bad, but they are ways in which a web host can cut costs.</p>
