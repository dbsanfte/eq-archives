 The Legacy of a Dwarf <p> <p> 

Once, there was a Dwarf. His name was Flint Fireforge, a Hill dwarf, from the lands of Krynn. Much is known about Flint, however little was known about his brother. Tinder Fireforge. While Flint was a warrior and adventurer, Tinder married young, and lived a happy life at home with his wife.They had a son, and on his day of naming, was given the name, Archivis. <p>

Flint would visit his brother when ever he was able, anf when his nephew was old enough, Flint would tell him stories of adventures that had taken him all over the lands of Krynn. Archivis loved his unlce very much, so when Flint died durring the War of the Lance, Archivis was heart broken. Then, just a short time later, when Archivis was but 15 years old, his parents were killed by the Dragon Armies. <p>

The people of his village sent him to the lands of Norrath, where the Dwarven race was united, and living in peace. The church cared for him. While he lived there, he met to slightly older boys, who were Alter-Dwarves in the church. They were called Gimlis and Gleemen. The three bacame fast friends, however, Gimlis and Gleemen soon became Clerics of Brell Serilis, and left the church to travel the lands to help people and to spread the word of Brell. <p>

When Archivis came of age, he too became an Alter-Dwarf, and started to follow in the foot steps of his two closest friends. I was soon found that this young Dwarf had much power, and was rapidly gaining the faith he needed to harness the power that he had. <p>

Soon the time came for Archivis to leave the city of Kaladim, and go out into the world the same way his friends had. His first adventure was to the city of Free Port, a Human city. While there, he met a Human by the name of Silent Bob. Bob was a monk. and though he never said much, he took to helping the young Cleric. Bob gave him a set of Armor that was as bronze as the dwarf's hair and beard, and a magical mace. Bob also told him that if he wished to gain the favor of the Humans in this city, he should battle the Orcs that were slowly trying to take over the lands. <p>

A short time, and many Orcs later, Archivis was gaining favor with the Humans, and the Human church in the city. <p>

Several years later, Archivis met a Barbarian by the name of Juror. This Shaman told Archivis of a guild named Healers United. After a small amiount of time, Archivis joined this guild and took to wearing it's crest, that looked strangly like a mango... The guild quickly became the family Archivis had been missing since his real family was killed. <p>

The rest..... is history.....
