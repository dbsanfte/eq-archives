<p>Loral was the son of a jewel dealer, a widower, in the fine city of <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/sceenshots/felwithe.JPG">Felwithe</a>.  His father was a good man, but always had an eye out for profit.  One day, a strange travler came in and sold him a magical hammer said to send demons back into hell with one blow.  The hammer was a mighty piece and very valuable, but Loral's father had no intention of selling it.  One night, a figure came to their door.  He was taller than a man, with pale blue skin.  When Loral's father approached him, the figure pulled back his hood and introduced himself as the <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra/pics/maestroofrancor1.jpg">Maestro of Rancor</a>, sent to retrieve the feared weapon for his lord, <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/ultra/pics/innoruuk1.jpg">Innoruuk</a>.  Loral's father attacked with the mighty weapon but when he slammed the magic hammer into the demon, the Maestro laughed, embraced Loral's father and they both disappea
red into the plane of Hate.  Loral never saw his father again.</p>

<p>Now an orphan, Loral was taken in by the local Church of Tunare where he began his life as a priest.  He was happy with his duties, but always dreamed of the riches and adventure life had to offer.  One day he met a Cleric of Quellious from the far away land of Erudin named Ciric Azilebane along with his long time companion, the wizard Azile Ciricbane.  They traded tales of their adventures with the young Loral, telling him of the beauty of the Karanas, the awesome magicks of Erudin and the horrors of Unrest.  Loral was enthralled hearing their stories.  A month passed, Azile had left for the lands of Raithe, but Ciric had decided it was time to hang up his adventuring boots and settle down.  He took Loral under his wing and cultivated his dreams of traveling the lands of Norrath.  Time came for Loral to begin his adventures, and on the day of his departure to the dwarven city of Kaladim, Ciric handed him a pack containing all of his old adventuring equipment.  Loral donned the ar
mor and wielded Ciric's mighty Shining Star of Light as he left the city to spread the word of Tunare and live the life of an adventurer.</p>

<p>The horrors of seeing his father taken away from this world gave Loral a hatred of all unnatural beasts especially the vile undead that infested the lands.  He hunted many moons in the lands of Butcherblock, ridding it of the dwarven skeletons and listening to the tales of the mighty travelers that passed through.  It was during this time that he met the group Healers United, a guild who traveled the lands to bring back life and peace in a world of hatred and fear.  He knew immediatly he had found his place among the members of the guild and did his best to spread the word of Tunare in their name.</p>

<p>Being raised by a jewel dealer gave Loral a keen eye for the marketplace.  He traded often at the bizaars and was always quick and keen in the art of the haggle.  While his true love and purpose is to spread the will of Tunare, he always enjoys browsing the warez of the Oasis bizaar.</p>

<p>Still the memories of his father being snatched by the demons of hate flooded his mind, keeping him isolated from society.  He traveled into the desert of Ro, hoping to chase away these demons that haunted his mind with the ancient techniques taught to him by Ciric and by reading a tome of knowledge known as the Testament of Vanear, a book given to him by Azile, the arch wizard, his traveling protector in the harsh world.  While he learned much and became even more powerful as an instrument of Tunare, he still tasted the ichor of hate that Innoruuk had left in his life.</p>
