		The son of Fetterholf Agravaine and Lysbith McNaff, Juror was expected to
		become a mighty Barbarian warrior when he grew up. Alas the Tribunal had
		another fate in mind for him. While he enjoyed the occasional mammoth hunt
		and defending Halas from the constant onslaught of goblins, gnolls, and
		orcs, he never got any pleasure out of dueling or taunting his enemies.
		With a hammer, mace, morningstar, or staff, Juror could more than hold his
		own in training bouts. But despite hours and hours of practice, he had
		absolutely no skill with a sword. He came to dread matches in the arena.
		More and more Juror took to wandering the tundra alone. At night when few
		barbarians were around, he thought he could hear the spirits of the wolves
		and bears talking to him. He listened to their voices and drew power from
		them.
		<BR><BR>
		Martar Icebear caught Juror daydreaming on the tundra one day and decided
		to teach him a lesson. He attacked him from behind and beat him nearly to
		death. When he told his mother what had happened, she mocked him and told
		him that he had deserved the punishment for not paying more attention to
		his training. Ashamed and distraught over his mother's reaction, Juror
		swore to leave the warrior's guild and never come back. He packed what
		little he had earned as an apprentice smith and tailor and left his
		beloved home.
		<BR><BR>
		His half-sister Almorra saw him leaving and asked a group of his friends
		to go after him. They managed to catch up to him near the tunnel to
		Blackburrow where they were attacked by three vengeful musicians. Still
		weak from his fight with Martar, Juror prayed to the Tribunal to assist
		him in saving the lives of those who had come to help him. His mind
		flooded with mana and he lashed out at the undead with spirits of fire and
		frost reducing one of them to a pile of bones. Bold was killed and Frond
		badly wounded before they managed to take down the other two skeletons.
		Juror laid his hands on his Frond's chest and poured what little mana he
		had left into his body healing the worst of his wounds.
		<BR><BR>
		Feeling responsible for Bold's death, Juror vowed to use the abilities
		that the gods had just given him to protect those in need and preserve the
		lives of those under attack by evil forces. He returned to Halas and
		begged Margyn McCann to accept him into the shaman guild. She took him
		under her wing and after several years of intense study, he was sent out
		into Norrath to keep his oath. While coming to the aid of a young ranger
		in West Karana, Juror met Auburn who invited him to join Healers United so
		that he could not only fulfill the mission that he had given but also
learn from others with similar goals and take comfort in their friendship.
