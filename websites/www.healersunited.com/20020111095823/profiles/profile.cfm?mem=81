<img src="raom.jpg" hspace=15 vspace=15 align=left>My name was Raom Hendricks, and i come from a long line of warriors in Freeport. It was my 15'th birthday when my life changed. I had just recieved my
grandfathers Minotaur battle axe, his Kite shield, and some money. I was going to the warrior guild to enlist as a warrior as my whole family had done before me.
As i passed the PvP area i saw a wounded man ready to die. All of the warriors around the pit looked at him, and laughing. I jumped down to him. I had to do
something to help him. I held his hed up, and gave him some water to drink. Just as i did, a bolt of energy flowed through my hands, and into the wounded man. I
fell to the ground because of the tremendous exhaustion. He stood up, confuzed, and walked away fully healed. I had healed him! A priest of the temple of marr
was walking by and he saw what had happened. He explained to everybody that i had the ability inside me of a paladin. I had the skill Lay Hands. Once i came to,
the whole warrior guild came about me, and the guild master said to me "you are a paladin! not a warrior at all! GET OUT!!!" the whole guild then turned their
back on me, and with them my whole family. With my parents disowning me, i am not allowed to carry the family name. From then on i am called Raom. I sobbed
as i ran away from the guild. Just as i turned the corner i saw the same priest that i saw when i fainted. He told me to follow him to the temple of marr. On the way
he explained to me that i am not a warrior, but a paladin. He took me into the temple of Marr, and cleaned the wounds that i had aquired on my head when falling.
After a day of resting, i had my energy back. The priest then took me to Gygus Renmara to begin my training under the temple of marr as a paladin. I anounced
my allegiance to the temple of marr, and with my axe in one hand, the shield in the other, i went off to fight evil wherever it may lurk.
<BR><BR>

After that day, i was practising my skills with the axe that my family had given me. I was chopping some wood outside of the gates. I heard a scream from a lady.
There was an attack by the DeathFist clan going on nearby. I rushed out to save the villagers that were outside of the gates. I saw a wounded boy almost going to
die, so i used my Lay Hands on him. He quickly thanked me, and ran inside the gates. After that, i was exhausted. I tried to run back into the gates but my legs
were just to tired. Just then, one of the deathfist pawns was ready to attack me. I was sure i was going to die. But with incredible luck, a man jumped in the way,
and killed the DeathFist pawn. He quickly healed me and told me to run. That man had a name above his head. It was in parenthesis. It said Healers United. I
thanked him, and ran into the gates to be saved by the guards. Ever since then, i have wanted to be in the guild healers united. Not just because of the stranger
saving my life, but because it was a totaly unselfish guild who gives the power of healing for free, just as i had done with the boy.
<BR><BR>

Weeks later i had heard of a person that is inviting people into the guild. I had to go! I got the name of her off a person in the market, and rushed of to meet her. It
was said that she was in the east commons. I got to where she was inviting people, and i was shocked at what i saw. A DARK ELF AS A HEALER!! I think her
name was Dahlea... I walked up to her astounded because i had never seen a dark elf before, and i never expected one to be in the guild. I nervously walked up,
and asked to join. She handed me a document that was their doctrine. I read it, and i was astounded by the rules. These were the rules that i live by! I handed
back in the paper, and then i was invited. Once i was invited, a flood of people welcomed me into the guild. That was the first time that i had felt like i was in a
family in a long time. I like it. And thats the story of me so far...
