		One day long ago, a baby boy was born to Drexel and Leezaa Entreri. Drexel Who was a high cleric of Innoruuk's army like
		takeing young Ertemis around with him to watch his father heal the soldiers after exercises. Ertemis was proud of his
		father and wanted to be a great healer like his dad. One day when Ert was 13, Ert's fathers unit went on a raid to Najena,
		Ert's father Drexel was killed by Najena her self as he was trying to heal a fallen warrior!! When Ert found out his dad
		was killed in battle he ran and hid deep in neriak for 5 days. finally after enough crying and mourning is fathers death.
		Ertemis was makeing his way home when he had just passed the cleric guild where him and his father had visited so often.
		Ert enjoyed swimming in the river around the cleric guild so he decided to take a swim to clean up a bit before he would
		see his mother. While Ert was swimming in the river around the cleric guild he was actually feeling pretty good and had
		made his mind up that he was gonna be a great healer like his father, as ert lapped the cleric for the 3rd time he saw one of the guards
		patrolling towards the neriak commons, when a black shadow appeared behind the guard, then there was a flash of shiny
		Steel, blood shot out from the Gurad and the Guard fell limp to the groud!! Instead of being in shock and amazed at what i
		saw, Ert jumped out of the water and ran like a bolt of lightning to the fallen guard because he new he was on borrow
		time!! Ert put his hands over the guards neck to try and stop the bleeding. As Ert turned to Yell towards the cleric guild
		for help a blue bolt of energy shot fourth through Erts hands and into the guards body, Ert watched in awe as the guards
		neck wound began to close and the life was coming back to the guard, as soon as the blue energy stoped flowing out of my
		hands ert fell down unconcious. When Ert awoke he was in the cleric guild and Prexus the cleric guild master and others
		were there with him. Prexus was smileing and he said Young Ertemis your father was right about you!! He said you were gonna be a great healer one day!! So
		right then and there i smiled up at my father and vowed to be as great as he was!! For the next 3 yrs Prexus had me
		studying the healing art,  i was excelling in all the skills and i told Prexus i was ready for the Nek Test. On Erts 16th
		bday Prexus sent Ert to The Nek Forrest to train for 1 yr, well in 1 yrs time in nek ert was so busy healing and fighting,
		bears and beetles, skeletons, zombies that when he went to prexus and ert was skilled so much and so fast that Prexus was
		very proud of him and said to ert i know you father is very proud of you! Ertemis was very pleased with him self. Prexus
		told Ert he was ready to venture  out away from neriak and nek forrest, so one day when Ert was lv 9 he was fighting the
		nasty orcs of EC when he met  a cool druid named Belgaren!! Belgaren said Ertemis i am starting up a guild called Healer
		United for any healer to join in and Become a great healer! Ertemis like the Idea of belonging to a group that all can heal. Ertemis joined this
		guild, on that day and was promoted to Officer right away from Belgaren, ertemis was very plzed. Ert has been a part of
		Healers United for 25 lvs now. Healers united has been the best organization that ert has ever been apart of. Ertemis met
		Dahlea at a guild meeting the Healers had on the docks of Freeport, also at  that guild meeting ERT met Roald, Gruass,
		Coelin, also the guild meeting that Ert met mysstie and invited The great Qazadoo. Ert has went on many exciting raids and
		camps and hunts with Gruass, Coelin, Keyo, Wildar, Meuvil, Dahlea and Rolina. Ertemis is currently questing for his cleric
quest armor, And  that is the story of Ertemis Entreri The Master Healer thus so far!!! :)
