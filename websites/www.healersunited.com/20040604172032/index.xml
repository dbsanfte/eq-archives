      <p>Healers United was featured in the Guild Spotlight in Sony's March 2004 Everquest Newsletter!  Here is what they had to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Spotlight on Guilds! This month we take notice of Healers United on Quellious. Over 200 members strong, these healers adhere to a strict set of guidelines, pledging to help those in need. The guild's members take time out of their busy schedules to set up buffing stations in Greater Faydark on Friday nights. They do so without asking for any compensation, all to help those who are buff challenged.We salute you, Super Buff Makers! www.healersunited.com
</p></blockquote>

<p>There was only one small error.  Our MUSHes are on Monday night, not Friday.  Still, it is wonderful to get recognized among the thousands of guilds that exist.  Your work helping the adventurers of Norrath has been noticed by the gods themselves!</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="eq_newsletter.html">local copy of the March SOE EQ Newsletter</a></p>

      <p>The <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/">Lost Dungeons of Norrath</a> have been discovered.  These dungeons will test the Healers in many trials to last for many moons.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm10.showMessageRange?topicID=244.topic">Loral's Guide to the Lost Dungeons</a> for a discussion of these new dungeons and how we can explore them.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm10.showMessage?topicID=208.topic">Healers United grouping discussion</a> for discussions and tips on building groups for these new adventures.  Finding or building a group will be one of the more difficult aspects of this expansion.  Make sure to take an active roll in seeking a group and do not be discouraged, insulted, or take it personally if it does not work out every time.</p>

<p>Healers United has a <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm10.showMessage?topicID=236.topic">new official meeting spot</a>.  Whenever you're just hanging around, go to the hill just south of the Greater Faydark wizard spires.  It is a great place to meet fellow healers face to face, a great place to buff up young hunters of the Fay, and a great place to find members for a group to go dive into the Lost Dungeons.</p>

<p>There will be a guild meeting within the next month.  <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm10.showMessage?topicID=238.topic">Vote on a day</a> to have it.</p>
