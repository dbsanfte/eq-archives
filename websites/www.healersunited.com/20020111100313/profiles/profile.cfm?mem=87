<img src="meknic.jpg" hspace=15 vspace=15 align=left>
I was born to a meager family on May 27, 3164.  I have a half-brother
two years older than me. He is half-elf and has chosen the path of the
Ranger.  My Parents were Inn-keepers in Freeport. My Father spent all
his time tending the Inn.  It seemed like he was always at the front
desk 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   My mother found joy in her garden
in the small yard behind the Inn.<BR><BR>
       I had an average childhood.  When I was old enough I wandered the
streets of Freeport, playing with my friends.   At about the age of 8 My
brother showed me a secret entrance to tunnels beneath Freeport.   I
wandered around there when I could get away for a while.  One day when I
was 9, I found a sewer rat.  Having watched many rats die at the hands
of others, I decided to kill this vermin myself.  I looked around and
found nothing usable as a weapon. I ran up to the rat and kicked it.  I
tried to stomp on it.  The rat was too fast, and it bit me hard on the
ankle.   Realizing  I was in over my head, I yelled for help.  As if
from nowhere, a Paladin in Bronze armor raced to my rescue and
dispatched the rat with ease.   He then said a prayer, and my wounds
were miraculously healed.  (Boy I could have used that help when I broke
my leg at age 5)  From that day forth, I knew what I wanted to do with
my life.  I knew the path of the Paladin was for me.
      In the years that followed, I endevoured to mimic the traits of
the Paladins, and spent much of my time hanging around the Hall of
Truth.  When I reached 14, the age of Decision, on May 27, 3178, it came
of no surprise to any of my family I chose to become a Paladin.  In fact
for my 14th Birthday my father gave  me a sword, and my mother made me a
tunic.  I signed up That Day at the Hall of Truth, and so began my
professional career...<BR><BR>
      My first duty as a Paladin was to make the West Gate a safer place
to travel.  I learned many new skills there while increasing my rank in
the guild. At  the rank of 6 an overencumbered paladin  named Tristadorn
gave me his old beat-up bronze breastplate. Wow! It was worth more than
all the rest of my stuff put together!  Over time, my brother (Gnuguy),
Chronopolis, Zore and Kerowynn  all helped contribute to my equipment
list.   By the rank of 12,  I had earned my Testimony, and became a
Knight of Truth.  I made it a point to always help those less fortunate
      <BR><BR> By now, I had begun wandering much farther from freeport.  I was
briefly a member of the Immortal Crusaders and made several friends
there.  Unfortunately, I set my backpack down once while fighting a
particularly nasty Kodiak.  When I picked it up again I hadn't noticed
that bugs that had wandered in and eaten my Immortal Crusaders Guild
papers.  Having never seen these bugs before I showed them to
Terrorcheeta.  He had seen them before.  They were known as calm pewter
bugs. The Gods had left them on this world to remind us that we are not
perfect,  we do not live in a perfect world,  and that we must always
strive to improve the world we live in.  He also said it could have been
much worse!   He said they were related to the Great Lag Monster in some
strange magical way. (yeah right, as if these little bugs could cause
the same kind of carnage the Great Lag Monster does.) I counted my lucky
stars the bugs didn't eat anything more in my backpack and moved on.
 <BR><BR>  I returned to the Commonlands and joined the crusade against the
Dervish Cutthroats.  During the crusade, I got word that I was needed in
Befallen, so off I went.  While there I furthered the Paladins' cause
greatly as I dispatched at least 200 skeltons and ghouls. One day while
helping a weaker adventurer retrieve their lost equipment from Befallen,
I too fell victim to an undead ambush.  While the experience was
unpleasant,  and retrieval of my equipment was rather time consuming and
complicated, It did not deter me from my need to help others.   I did
learn to be more careful about HOW I help others, but I know I will
always continue to help others.  Is it me, or is it always the young and
foolish that drag the better informed into, shall we say, unwise
predicaments?
   <BR><BR> While fighting off a bout of depression about the aforementioned
experience, I got word from a friend that Aligators and Orcs had over
run the Oasis and were headed North to Freeport.   I knew they must be
stopped.  So I grabbed my Shiny Brass Halberd (courtesy of the mighty
Chronopolis) packed some rations and headed to the Oasis.  When the
Paladins Guild had seen all that I had accomplished in Oasis, they
promoted me to the 18th rank.
     <BR><BR> From there, I headed to back to Befallen where I found a few young
adventurers in need.  Deja vu.  I helped them as I could.  One happened
to be a member of Healers United.  She noticed my lack of Guild insignia
and we discussed her Guild.  She called Slage from below and he invited
me into the Guild.  I knew I had made the right decision, as this guild
stood for everything I had already been practicing.
    <BR><BR>   From there I started my first Norrath walkabout by heading to
Rivervale, Highpass,the Karanas, and Qeynos, where I continue to bring
the gift of healing to all in need.<BR><BR>
