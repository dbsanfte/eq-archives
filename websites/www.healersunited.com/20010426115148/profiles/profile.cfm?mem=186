		Twas an early morn as I stepped out of the caves and mines of Kaladim and into the most beautiful sunrise I had ever seen but something was different about this day. What was it though I could not see it and I could not touch it but I could hear it in my mind, a beconing, a calling of a troubled woman her voice fading out yet closeby. I ran out of the entrance and saw to my disgust a vile evil creature beating on a woman who lay motionless on the ground it looked up as I screamed a battle cry "Death to all goblins my power will destroy you ! ". I charged the creature and swung my club catching it clean in the jaw and forcing it backwards from the still form of the woman, it returned with a swipe of its heavy slow weapon and grazed off my shoulder infuriating me even more. I stood strong and swung again this time connecting with the side of its head a loud crack errupted as its head split and it slumped to the ground.<BR><BR>
		I turned back to the woman and knelt by her side as she rasped for breath I held her in my arms the poor lassy was but a mere child and there was nought that I could do for her I shouted for help but none came. The wounds were many and her bloodloss too great for her to survive without the aid of the powers of the Mighty Healer and there she passed away in my arms but with her last breath she whispered "Why me ? What did I do wrong ...."<BR><BR>
		Tears filled my eyes, the bloodstained body of a once gentle dwarf erupted in a roar " She will not die in vein ! I swear on my lifes blood that no more shall perish whilst Morim protects ". Reaching for my club in one swift action I sprinted to the place of evil and charged into the camp screaming a war cry that even made the goblins think twice but they still attacked. For a moment I had the advantage of suprise and the nearest foe was struck with such force that it crumpled to the ground motionless but three more of its kin now surrounding me hissing and taunting me. The second struck me with his mace and I felt dizzy and stunned for a moment but in that time the other two had struck at my legs with there blades and blood gushed from my leg. Fury ripped out of me and I swung my mighty club downing the second now the odds were almost even as I stood my ground absorbing all of their blows I slaughtered the next one without even realising until it was just one on one. My strength was waning I was feeling weak I tried to swing but could not lift my weapo, just as I thought that it was surely the end I heard a mumbling chanting from off behind me and blue stars flickered around my body filling my body with energy, a new lease of life, I struck the creature and slay it in one blow with my renewed vigour and repeated my pledge to protect the good from the evils of this twisted world.<BR><BR>
		A twig snapped behind me and I turned club in hand ready to attack as a figure in shiny golden armor stepped forward calming me with her words she comforted me as I collapsed on the floor exhausted from what had taken place. I slept for what seemed like forever and in my dreams I saw the woman who was slain, she smiled and spoke "Morim, go now and seek out the Healers in North Kaladim for you have the heart of a True Healer, take with you this message to the High Priestess and she will assist you further. I will always be watching over you from this day forth as I have watched you up until this day and waited for you"
		The rest is as they say is another story but suffice to say Morim met with Belgaran and joined the travelling healers of Healers United.<BR><BR>
		A long period of lonely travelling for some three months after Morim set out on his travels he had begun to lose perspective of what and where he was to go next until he stumbled upon his old friend Erdurian sitting by the side of the road playing a tune and singing songs of old and stories of mangoes and boiling pots.
		Morim was once again joined with his children who have grown into brothers and sisters this day.
