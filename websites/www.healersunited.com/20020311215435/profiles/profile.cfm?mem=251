		<p>It was a cold dark evening in the glades of Surefall. I remember playing with my friends out in the cove. The moon glistened down softly upon the treetops. The wind gently shook the leaves loose  from the branches that held them so high up. The smell of the grass and water made you thankful that Karana granted such gifts to the insignificant. As the crickets chirped and the bears playfully splashed in the water, my friends and I played gnomes and rangers. Mother had given us some Kiola Nuts to eat to keep our energy up. I often stopped by the water to take in a few handfuls. That was the best times of my life.</p>
                        <p>Mother was a loving gentlewoman. She rarely spoke out against anyone. Her hair was golden as the sun and it flowed like spidersilk in the wind. Her skin was soft and milky such as that of an elf. She was often mistaken as an elf. This always made her giddy. She thought that elves were noble and beautiful creatures, pure with nature. She aspired to be like them. I guess that is why she chose the path of Druids. She often sat with me in the glade and taught me the principles of a druid’s life. What their purpose was. What they were sworn to protect. Who their mortal enemies were. I never really understood the seriousness in her voice. She taught me how to care for sickened animals and how to mend a broken plant. She always told me that a druids work is never done. As long as there were people that would destroy what Karana has given us, a druid was there to repair and care for it. I loved my mother very much….</p>
                        <p>My father was not as gentle as mother but he was very understanding of my adolescence. He was a hardened veteran and oft time kept to himself. Mother and I were the only ones who could bring a smile upon his face. While mother taught me the basics of caring, love, gentleness and kindness, father taught me how to survive the harshness of the real world. He showed me how to fish. Father was a master fisherman, the best in the glade. If only I had picked up on it. He dabbled in the art of smithing. That interested me a lot. I later continued my smithing lessons under the tutelage of Grimbeard Everhot and since then have mastered the art. Father was a bowyer and could fire an arrow with such precision as to take a hair off a gnoll’s head. I learned to fletch from him so well as I had the potential to surpass him in skill and precision. We often went to the forests of Toxxulia to camp and hunt. Two men alone to face the world and nature. I liked this time as it gave me time to practice what mother had taught me.</p>
                        <p>A few days into a camping, we were awakened at an early hour. Father unsheathed his sword just in time to see Geoffrey Greenleaf fall to the ground lifeless. Father frantically tried to heal him…alas the power of Karana could not overcome the power of Innoruk this time. I was distraught and began to cry. After all I was only 6 or 7. That was the first time I had ever witnessed death. Father quickly searched Geoffrey over and after a short time he pulled a sealed message from Geoffrey’s tunic. Geoffrey was the Hierophant’s apprentice. The Hierophant had sent him with this message from the glade. Father read the note and began to cry. This was not something I had ever seen him do. I quickly jumped to ask him what the letter had read. About that time father had regained his composure. As he turned to me I saw a fire hotter than a thousand hells burning within his eyes. What he said next, forever changed my life. He told me that the letter was a message from the Druid Hierophant. While we were absent from the village, a force of gnolls, from the nearby Blackburrow, had attacked the Glade. Only a few survived. My mother fought valiantly and eventually was overtaken. They took her along with the other woman and children. Hierophant was unsure of her safety. I began to cry again. My beloved mother taken by gnolls? My home destroyed? Why has this happened I thought to myself? Father ordered me to quickly pack up camp. Not wanting to catch the fury that was trapped within him, I did as I was told.</p>
                        <p>We then ran for the next 12 hours to reach the boat docks. I had thought that if mother were here we would be home by now, but she wasn’t so I hurried along, tired and sore. When we arrived to the docks, the boat was just about to leave. We did make it on the boat in time. A 3-day journey lay ahead on the boat. Father tried to rest as well as he could but often awakened in a cold sweat screaming out my mother’s name. On the third day, we were in the galley eating some food that father had foraged several days before. When a dark form howled and leapt from the shadows. It was hairy and smelled horrible. It spoke in a tongue I was not familiar with. It barked and growled as it approached my father. Father understood most of what it said, but the only word I could make out was DIE!. I leaped under the table as father unsheathed his Ykeesha and unwound his whip. Just as the tip of his whip hit the floor, then beast was upon him. Father was able to dodge but he still received several deep gashes to his mid section. Father regained his composure and began the chantings of a spell. Upon completing the chant, the beast stopped in its place as roots sprung forth from the floorboards of the ship. They grasped the beast so hard as to cause damage to the its legs. The fur of the beast’s legs were well drenched in blood now. After the beast regained its composure, it took a glowing dagger from its belt.</p> <p>I screamed  "Father!"  but it was too late the dagger had sunk itself into my father’s right breast. The fire once again appeared in his eyes. With shortened breaths father chanted another spell. This time the beasts fur was burned from its body as magical fires burned away his skin. The smell was so horrible, that I expelled my once eaten meal. The beast fell to the ground bloody, burnt and smoldering from the once bright flames. I immediately rushed to my father’s aid. He had fallen to the ground. Unconscious now, I was unable to move him. I knew that he was nearly dead. I thought frantically of something to do. Then it popped into my head. MOTHER!. Could I remember what she had taught me of the healing arts? I could only hope. I first bandaged his wounds to the best of my abilities. Enough to stop the bleeding. I was surprised that mothers lesson had stuck. This did not solve the worse problem of preventing my father’s death. I hit myself several times yelling "Think Idaniel, think!"  I cursed myself for not paying attention. I fell to my knees and began to sulk, when a dwarven man dressed entirely in golden armor appeared from the upper deck.</p>
                        <p> “Boy”, he said. I quickly came to. “Quickly take my cloak and do as I say."   He then kneeled before father and began chanting. I did everything as the dwarf instructed. He continued chanting, then as the chanting stopped, he held up a symbol forged of platinum and inset with emeralds, screamed out my fathers name and my fathers body glowed with a soft white aura. My knees shook as I fell to the floor. I watched as my father’s wounds close themselves up. The pink color returned to his skin. His eyes opened. I asked the dwarf what he had done. I asked him if my father was dead. He told me that father had not died but was so close that normal healing could never have saved him. My father was very weak from the ordeal and He slept for the next 18 hours. I spoke with the dwarf and learned that he was a Vicar from the stronghold of Kaladim. He had been visiting the Erudin temple to speak with the high priest on matters of diplomacy. None of that meant anything to me. I asked him what I could do to repay him, he said that I need not repay him, but rather pray and thank his god for granting him the powers to heal father. I did as he asked. I never saw him again after we left the boat. But I hear that he fell in a battle trying to keep the evil within Karnor’s castle.</p>
                       <p> The boat docked and my father was strong again. He ordered me to go to my cousin’s cottage in North Qeynos. He said he must go to the glades. I did not like this at all. So I used the one thing I did remember from mothers lessons. How to camouflage. I followed father to the glade and what I saw Ill never forget. My home, the peaceful cove all destroyed. The few surviving members were burying bodies in graves they had dug. Father immediately went before the hierophant. He asked if they had located the woman and children. They said that they had a lead. Father asked where they thought the women and children were. The Hierophant stated that they where taken to a stronghold in South Karana called Splitpaw Lair. My father went to our cottage or at least what was left of it and gathered any supplies he could find. He then said goodbye to all the weakened people in the village. He headed to South Karana.</p>
                       <p>When he made it to the bridge I saw father do something I never have seen him do before. He ran and he started to metamorphosis into a wolf! Oh man did he run fast. I couldn’t even keep up with the sow potions I had imbibed. He got far ahead of me and it took me hours to catch up. As I approached a muddy mound of dirt I noticed 2 stone pillars shooting skyward. I saw my father fighting several gnolls and he was doing very well. I also saw Mother tied up with the other women and children. I snuck over to try and help her, but a Tesch Gnoll saw me and chased me down. I was captured. They threw me in the pen with mother and we happy to see each other. I aided my mother in getting free as father hacked and slashed at the weaker gnomes attacking him. Once mother was free, she immediately began helping father. She chanted and after it was complete a black swarm of insect flew down from the heavens and surrounded all the gnolls around father. I had never heard such anguish as I did when those gnolls let out their last screams for mercy.</p>
                       <p>Father embraced mother and just as they were to kiss a portal suddenly opened and the biggest beast I ever saw exited it with his 7 guard ’s men. He ordered his guards after my parents. They fought valiantly. As the last guard was to fall, the big beast chanted a spell at my father. Colorful sparkling lights surrounded my father and his eyes glassed over. What I saw next I could not forget even to this day. My father looked at my mother and started angrily towards her. Before my mother could run, fathers Ykeesha was buried deep within her breast. She said she loved us as she fell to the ground to breathe her last breath. The large beast merely laughed at her as she fell. He barked and yowlped at my father…. I wish I knew what he said. I noticed a tear drip from my father ’s eyes. As the large beast ordered him to pierce his own chest. My father died that day also.</p>
                        <p>I was taken into the Solusek Caverns where I was forced to work. I remained there for 4 years where I became strong. The whole time I was planning my escape. Would it ever come I did not know. I finally got up the courage to sneak out of the mines. I stole a splintered club, a book, a scroll of light healing, and a scroll of snare…. I snuck out while all the gnolls were drunk from a festive evening. I vowed that day to hunt down that king and make him pay for his transgressions. All gnolls will pay I said. I made my way back to Surefall Glade where I learned the ways of Druids.</p>
                         <p>Since that day I have walked the lands and I have grown stronger. I have recruited the aid of The Healers United and countless other people to aid me in my war. Someday I will find that gnoll. If he was a gnoll at all. Many people say that he was a dragon in disguise. Time will reveal to me the truth of his existence. Until that time I will remain silent and continue on the path towards the darkness that has plagued my life. Anything that stands against me in my quest for vengeance is slayed. This includes creatures of nature. The pelts from animals help me to fund my journey. Food I gather from nature. Although I now have the ability to become a wolf, I seldom do it because the beast who slayed my family was a canine himself. I detest taking form of something so similar to my hated enemy.</p>
<p>That is why I am the way I am. It’s not a glorious past nor is it simple, but it is who I am.</p>
