<br><BR>
		So, you want to know about me and my sisters do you? Not a very smart
		question, but I’ll answer it.
<br><BR>
		No Nyene, you cannot hurt him, even if he is human spawn
<br><BR>
		Sorry about that, she doesn’t like humans too much. So you question was
		about me and my sisters right? Well, first you need to know our names. I
		am Myene Sunshadow, the wonder elf. The one you wanted to use you for
		target practice is Nyene Sunshadow, the evil sister. The responsible
		looking one over that is Ryene Sunshadow, the killjoy. And that bard next
		to me is Xyene Sun- hay, wate, where is Xyene?
<br><BR>
		Over in the corner you hear the shout of "THIEF"
<br><BR>
		Heh, its your turn to get her this time Ryene.
<br><BR>
		As I was saying, the one over there who is about to be linched is Xyene
		Sunshadow, the would be bard. She fancies her self as a great bard who is
		unliked by the masses, and there for has to steal for her dinner, in fact
		we are all well taken care of by our guilds.
<br><BR>
		Oh yes we are Xyene; now stop trying to steal, your no good at it!
<br><BR>
		Fine, then you can just sit there.
<br><BR>
		Yes, yes, ok, when it’s your turn you can tell your story, but until then
		no interrupting. No stealing either.
<br><BR>
		Ok, now back to the story. Each of us has a different prospective on how
		we grew up, even if we did grow up together for the most part. I grew up
		in the pines of Surefall glade; my human father left me because I was half
		elf. My mother was human, and so was he. I grew up with the rangers and
		the druids, and when I was five I was sent to a summer camp for
		disadvantaged elves, that’s were I meet them. The presits in all our
		guilds saw that we had a shared bond, and there for deiced to make us
		sisters. We were all to young to remember how the did-
<br><BR>
		No you don’t remember it Ryene, you were younger that I was, now don’t
		interrupt me agen, or I’ll send you to Cazel!
<br><BR>
		As I was saying, none of us were old enough to remember how the did it,
		but they did. It was called the Sunshadow ceremony, hence the names. When
		I was nine I went to camp agen, but this time I went to a Young Ranger
		Campers Association (YRCA) camp. Very fun, I won a Trueshot long bow in a
		archery competition, I beat out a 18 summer old. He and his little friends
		didn’t like that much, so they deiced to teach me a lesson by teeing me up
		and putting me in a Orc camp site for the night. They had thought it was
		abanded, but it wasn’t. The next day I came home with a coil of rope, and
		about 10 Orc belts, witch I turned into the Freeport militia for a prize.
		The other kids left me alone after that one. After that I left the
		protection of my guild and started to travel, when all over Norrath,
		visited Xyene and Ryene, tried to visit Nyene but she tried to kill me.
<br><BR>
		Yes you did!
<br><BR>
		Yes you did, I went to visit you and what happened? *Zapp* *Pow* *WHAP*, I
		would have been an elf cabob if you aim hadn’t been so poor.
<br><BR>
		Ya, of curse you meant it in the most loving way.
<br><BR>
		I am not! Take the back, you little-
<br><BR>
		Ryene, you such a spoilsport, why can’t you just let us fight it out?
<br><BR>
		Ok, fine. I’ll finish my story.
<br><BR>
		After my escape from Nyene I deiced to visit Halas, I wanted to see snow.
		While up there I meet some very tall people, and I also found out the
		Ryene had deiced to tag along.
<br><BR>
		I did not invite you to come with my, you just followed me up there, and
		then complained it was cold all the time.
<br><BR>
		Any way, she followed me up, and she was very young, so I had to hire an
		escort to take her back to a safer place, that’s how I meet Juror and
		Almorra, there the ones over in the coner. Juror is the tall, dark, and
		harry one, Almorra is the other one. We have fought together a few times
		in Kunark too, Juror is very good with his axe, and Almorra is one of the
		best casters I’ve ever seen.
<br><BR>
		That’s about all for my story, I think I’m going to go over the bar and
		get some Ale, Xyene, why don’t you tell- o no, she’s gone agen.
<br><BR>
		THIEF! Come her you dirty bard!
<br><BR>
		*Tables over turn, drinks spill, and you see a young wood elf run by, and
		a very strong barbarian runs after her*
<br><BR>
		Why me? Why did you curse me so Karana? What did I ever do to you…?
<br><BR>
So who wants to get her THIS time?
<br><BR>
