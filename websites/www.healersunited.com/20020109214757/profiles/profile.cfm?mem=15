<P>
The following I was told by a wolven spirit during a mystic ceremony to give unto me my name of Wolfestar; however, until
this ceremony I myself could not recall, perhaps due to the horrific nature of it:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I was born some years ago in a small peaceful woodelf village some distance from the great woodelf city of Kelethin.  I
had a happy home filled with love and all was carefree without a worry.  Alas, this was shattered one dark night.  A pack
of wild beasts had attacked our village.  I heard someone scream "Run for your lives the gnolls have" and then screams of
horror from this poor soul.  My mother gathered me in her arms and with my father we ran towards a forested valley below
which was enshrouded in a misty fog. It was believed that santuary could be found here.  These hounds from hell were too
fast, they tore the villagers into shreds.. screams of terror and moans of those dying and being eaten alive could be
heard everywhere.
<P>
One was catching us and I screamed to my mother and father to run faster.. but my father was too slow and was taken down
and eaten first.  Then my mother threw me forward and told me to run as she was being taken down from behind.  I was
trying to run towards the mist in the woods, feeling claws striking my feet.  I looked up and through my tears saw streak
of light come from the brightest star in the sky.. this light enveloped me and I was filled with energy, and with both a
calmness and a fierce desire to survive and fight at the same time.  The wind blew in my face and the trees sped by me..
the beast could not keep up.  I ran into the mist and then all went silent and dark.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The following is what I can remember:
<P>
I awoke under a tree in the company of a high-elf priestess, with her warm hands running through my hair.  I asked who
she was and where I was.  She said her name was Kelsie Stargazr, a priestess of Tunare, the Mother of All, and that I was
in Misty Forest.  She said that while she was looking at the stars, she saw something and knew that a special event had
occured, that a new druid had been chosen.  She asked what my name was and who my parents were, but I could not remember.
She thought for awhile, looked up, and then looked around, and said that since she found me laying in the Misty Forest,
that my name would be Mysstie and that now, Tunare was my mother, and the Wolf my father.
<P>
Through the next serveral years Kelsie taught me the healing ways and the spirits of the tree, the mist and rain, and my
father, the wolf, taught me the druidish ways.  During this time, Kelsie and I grew to love each other as companions, and
more.  However, we had to leave each other's side as we both knew we had to pursue each one's destiny and calling.  This
was both a sad and an exciting time.  However, we continued to see other in our dreams.
<P>
I practiced my skills near the great Elvin city of Kelethin.  Here I stayed until my 6th season.  While many others chose
to fight the mortal enemies of Kelethin, the Crushbone Orcs, I knew my destiny lie elsewhere.  I happened across another
druid, Teglail, who seemed to have a similar calling as mine.  We hunted together for awhile around Kelethin and grew
fond of each other.  We thought that before we set on our journey, that joining a guild would be beneficial.  The first
one we joined, I knew in my heart was not right for me.  I pursuaded Teglail that we should find another and I noticed
someone from Healers United was around and told them I was interested.  They forwarded me to Roald and he seemed to be a
kind, warm individual.  The rest they say is history, I know in my heart I have found my home.  :)
<P>
Once I entered my 14th season, something profound had changed in my life, I myself could give the gift of speed that was
bestowed upon me by the Wolf Star so long ago in my moment of need, to others, the Spirit of the Wolf.  Being able to
cast this on a needy soul fills me with such joy and love as I know my father, the Wolf, is letting me bestow his gift on
others so that they may outrun their demons.
<P>
I stayed with Teglail in Blackburrow till nearly my 16th season, fighting the snakes and gnolls with almost reckless
abondon and vengence, though at the time I did not know why this strong hatred for gnolls was present.  After slaying the
Commander of these foul, wretched beasts, I felt somewhat more content, but not fully.  I then began to explore other
parts of Norrath and became good friends with many in Healers United, especially with Dahlea, who, even though we are
different in many ways, adopted me as her little sister :).  It was also at this time that mine and Teglail's paths began
to drift apart from one another as is the nature of things and the Wolf at times.
<P>
It was in my 18th season that I came across another outpost of these hell hounds as I call them, the gnolls of Highpass.
I engaged these mangy mutts until I entered my 20th season.  This is when I completed the naming ceremony and became
known as Mysstie Wolfestar.  At first when I learned of my past and my Woodelf parent's death, I was angry at my father,
the Wolf, for sparing my life and not theirs and the other villagers... why me?  It was then that I learned that only
those chosen to be Druids by the Mother Tunare, can be directly affected by my father, the Wolf, and that only these
chosen Druids are able to bestow the Spirit of my father, the Wolf, onto others.
<P>
Thus it with the Love of my Mother Tunare, and the Love of my Father, the Wolf, and the love of life itself that I cast
this on others.
<P>
Be safe, and good (swift) journies to all!
Mysstie Wolfestar
