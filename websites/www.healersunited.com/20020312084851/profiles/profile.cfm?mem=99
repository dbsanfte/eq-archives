<FONT FACE="Lucida Handwriting" SIZE="6">Sarayaven Ghoulslayer</FONT></center>
<BR><P><FONT SIZE="2">I have seen too much killing.... too much death... My tale is one of war and destrution not peace and happiness.  Few truly know me and even less understand.... I am alone in my struggle... alone in my fight..... <BR><P><CENTER> This is my story...</CENTER><BR><BR><P>The tides of war had changed... again.  The Dwarves of Brell Serilis had riden the tide of death and destruction left by the Iskar scarred the land of the Butcher Block Mountains.  The older men had left seasons ago, their ships bound for the root of all evil... the lizard men of Norrath.  They had sent a message to the temple of Marr in Freeport in hopes of gaining the support of the Paladin's there, but the had refused to help fearing that they could not handle the fierce warriors of the south.
<P>Sarayaven had been working at his families forge since his father and all of his fourteen other brothers had left Kaladim.  The city now was proteccted by the old and the young and Goblins of the Clan Runnyeye would continuely attack the city now that the strong men had left.  Finally after five years working at the forge Sarayaven took up as a warrior in the city.  It wasn't long before he was posted outside the cities gates protecting the little ones as the played in the hills.  Every thing changed so fast....
<P> Reports of failure haunted the citizens of Kaladim as burned out skeletons of boats returned bearing the heads of Brell's mighty warriors.  Guards were always alert and slept with their mighty war axe's at their side.  Then one day they arrived....
<P> Thousands of the dreaded lizard men poured out of the burned out ships that they had sent, quickly murdering the dock workers and swarming into the mountains of Butcher Block.
<P> The city's only warning was the fierce cries of the lizard warriors as they charged to the gates of the mighty city to face what remained of the guard.  The men fell pierced by fierce poisoned arrows or run through with jagged and rusty blades.  Soon the city was aflame as the elite of the lizard people rode into the city butchering everything in sight even the women and children.  Sarayaven and the guard had been pushed back all the way to the King's hold.  "To arms! to arms! For the glory of Brell!" the warriors fought on. <P>  All was lost the remaining warriors threw down their weapons surrendering to the lizard men.  But the lizard people weren't satisfied with surrender and started executing the brave warriors one by one... piece by piece... The blood of Sarayaven's best friends tainted his vision as he went for his axe.
<P> Swing after Swing he took down the lizard men who had killed his family.  He only saw red now as the Iskar slowly closed in on him.  Suddenly, his attackers seemed to sprout arrows as they fell to the ground.  Sarayaven looked around to see the hall filled with the human paladins that had finally decided to aid them.  He dropped his axe letting it fall amongst the dead, and he fell to the ground.
<P>Days later he awoke to find himself in the care of the clerics of Marr.  The bodies of those to far gone lay beneath the great gates the smoldered still.  The wounded lay in the sun tended to by the clerics and paladins of the great temple.  One of the temple elders smiled at him as he awoke saying "Wake oh brave warrior for you have been saved."
<P> From that day forth I turned away from the constant battle of a warrior and turned to the tower for their training and guidance in becoming a healer.  My friends will be remembered always and Brell the great duke of the underfoot will always be with me if my warrior spirit needs to arise again...
<P> To those who know the fight and know my struggle they are the ones who really know me...
