<p>Proposals to no longer have High Elders, to adjust duties of Elders, and to change level and time in guild requirements passed at last night's meeting. (Deeme will post official results and revise information on rank structure.)</p>

<p>Based on outcome of vote, I have new assignments to announce.</p>

<p>ELDERS<br />
Brubel, cleric<br />
Deeme, druid<br />
Ketre, cleric<br />
Loral, cleric<br />
Podboy, druid<br />
Soulsender, SK</p>

<p>OFFICERS<br />
Auburn, druid<br />
Eniel, ranger<br />
Faffun, druid<br />
Greyfeather, druid<br />
Qazadoo, cleric<br />
Ughlei, shaman<br />
Warrick, shaman<br />
Zoyer, druid</p>

<p><br />
Belgaran as the founder of HU remains on roster as an honorary elder. I also hope to come up with fancy title for former High Elders and Elders who have retired or who I just removed from positions due to inactivity.</p>

<p>Congratulations and welcome new Elders!</p>
