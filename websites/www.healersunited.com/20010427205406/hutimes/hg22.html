<P><FONT COLOR=black size=+1><B><I>Coelin</B></I>, <B><I>Semagxof</B></I> and <B><I>Sanora</B></I> were hunting <B>Hill</B> Giants out in <B>North Karanas</B> on Saturday.  The first time they went to pull the giants, Coelin and Semagxof decided to try both snare and ensnare so that they would succeed in stopping the <B>Hill Giant</B>.  So they both started to cast and when they were done they had pulled two different giants.  So they had to zone.  They healed up and went back for round two.  They killed the giant after a hard fight.  Then they decided to kill some more Giants.  In total they killed 3 <B>Hill Giants</B>.  They plan to kill more over the course of the next month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR=black size=+1><P>Today if you were passing through <u>East</u> <u>Karanas</u> you would have seen a small group from the guild healers united.  They were hunting for <B>Giants/Cyclops</B>, especially Droon.  He is a Cyclopes that terrorized unsuspecting people who use Druid portals you could possibly run into this big oversized Cyclopes but today that was different <B>Wrenne</B> <B>Semagxof</B> <B>Coelin</B> <B>Rolina</B> and <B>Aarodara</B> were terrorizing <U>Droon</U>. With a total of 2 kills they decided to go to Rathe mountains and hunt Hill Giants.  Unfortunately, there was one causality Aarodara was killed on the way to the zone but after a resurrection by Rolina they were off again but not before they managed to kill Droon again. They met up with an old cleric high elder Morim although he is not himself. Aarodara is very slow so she can't keep up with the group and gets lost a lot.  Finally they make it to lake Rathetear.</Font></P>
