      <p>The <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/">Lost Dungeons of Norrath</a> have been discovered.  These dungeons will test the Healers in many trials to last for many moons.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm10.showMessageRange?topicID=244.topic">Loral's Guide to the Lost Dungeons</a> for a discussion of these new dungeons and how we can explore them.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm10.showMessage?topicID=208.topic">Healers United grouping discussion</a> for discussions and tips on building groups for these new adventures.  Finding or building a group will be one of the more difficult aspects of this expansion.  Make sure to take an active roll in seeking a group and do not be discouraged, insulted, or take it personally if it does not work out every time.</p>

<p>Healers United has a <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm10.showMessage?topicID=236.topic">new official meeting spot</a>.  Whenever you're just hanging around, go to the hill just south of the Greater Faydark wizard spires.  It is a great place to meet fellow healers face to face, a great place to buff up young hunters of the Fay, and a great place to find members for a group to go dive into the Lost Dungeons.</p>

<p>There will be a guild meeting within the next month.  <a href="http://pub10.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm10.showMessage?topicID=238.topic">Vote on a day</a> to have it.</p>
