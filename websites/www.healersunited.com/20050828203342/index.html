	<h2>Dragons of Norrath released</h2>
	
	<p>Last night, SOE released the ninth Everquest expansion, Dragons of Norrath.  For a full review, read <a href="">Loral's Dragons of Norrath Mobhunter Preview</a>.  Here are some tips:</p>

<p>- Press "B" to open up your new bandoleer.</p>

<p>- Press "Control E" to open up the new email system.</p>

<p>- Press "Shift P" to open up the new potion bag.</p>

<p>- Press "M" or "Backspace" for maps.  Take a look at the new atlas.</p>

<p>- Reach new zones through north Lavastorm.</p>

<p>- The Guild Hall is located in the north east of Plane of Knowledge around back of the library.</p>

<p>- The new Barter zone is south east in Knowledge, directly south from the guild hall.</p>

<p>- You can summon corpses in the Guild Lobby for plat.  Make sure to have a resser handy, they only last 20 minutes before going to Shadowrest.</p>

<p>- We added our guild to the "Guild Looking for Player" list.  Send people to this website for more information.</p>

<p>- You can download new <a href="http://loralciriclight.com/maps.zip">Dragons of Norrath maps</a> from Loral's site.</p>

<p>- We added a ton of gear to the new guild bank inside the guild hall.  Go have a look and help yourself.</p>

<p>- If you see one of these guys, run:</p>

	<h2>Healers United and EQ2</h2>
	
	<p>Everquest 2 hits the shelves Tuesday, November 9th.  We have set up a few steps to help HU members stay in touch with their friends across both games:</p>

<p>Type "[join eq2.antonia_bayle.acof" to join the Circle of Friends Everquest 2 channel.  This channel includes Healers United folks from both games, Vindicators from Antonia Bayle, and other friends.  You can chat in this channel with "[1 hail friends".</p>

<p>Join the the "Antonia Bayle" Everquest 2 server.  You can meet and hunt with other members of Healers United who will also play on this server.  This "Roleplay Friendly" server has the same rules as every other EQ2 server and is officially recognized as the "Healers United Friendly" server.</p>

<p>Many members of Healers United joined the <a href="http://vindicators.net/">Vindicators guild</a> on Antonia Bayle in Everquest 2.  This guild has much of the same purpose as Healers United without the class restrictions.  It is a good-aligned roleplaying guild.  For more information contact Loral or read <a href="http://p212.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm10.showMessage?topicID=978.topic">this thread</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a character in EQ2, send a tell to an HU officer to add your character to the <a href="http://p212.ezboard.com/fhealersunited23586frm32.showMessage?topicID=4.topic">EQ2 HU roster</a> so other members can send you a tell.</p>

<p>Post to the HU EQ2 forum with information about your character so we can add it to the roster, meet other HU members in-game, and perhaps schedule EQ2 hunting nights.</p>

<p>Many members, including Juror, myself, and many other officers, will continue to play EQLive primarily.  EQ and Healers United will continue to remain strong and grow.  This announcement only serves to help HU members and friends stay in touch as people try out EQ2.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Loral Ciriclight<br />
Officer, Healers United</p>

	<h2>Healers Spotlight in SOE Newsletter</h2>
	
	<p>Healers United was featured in the Guild Spotlight in Sony's March 2004 Everquest Newsletter!  Here is what they had to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Spotlight on Guilds! This month we take notice of Healers United on Quellious. Over 200 members strong, these healers adhere to a strict set of guidelines, pledging to help those in need. The guild's members take time out of their busy schedules to set up buffing stations in Greater Faydark on Friday nights. They do so without asking for any compensation, all to help those who are buff challenged.We salute you, Super Buff Makers! www.healersunited.com
</p></blockquote>

<p>There was only one small error.  Our MUSHes are on Monday night, not Friday.  Still, it is wonderful to get recognized among the thousands of guilds that exist.  Your work helping the adventurers of Norrath has been noticed by the gods themselves!</p>
