Meet other Healers United members and Quellious players, do a quest, answer trivia questions, harass game designers and GMs in person, and attend awards dinner.  HU suite opens whenever the hotel staff gives me a key.  Not sure what else is going on but I am sure that we can find something fun to do in Baltimore.  Registration is closed but some crash space is still available for those who live in the area and just want to drop by and visit.

<b>Death of the evil Lucan</b><br>
part of Soulfire quest<BR>
Event Leader:Meuvil EvilSmite<br>
Date:Sunday. Feb 04,2001   Time: 05:00,PM,Central<BR>
Location: Freeport<br>

<BR>
(resheduled from Saturday) Meuvil needs some help taking down the corrupt paladin (and his ghost) as well as keeping Brother Jentry and the other guards busy. Those who actually help kill Lucan will take some heavy faction hits and may become KOS in some parts of Freeport. However there are other ways to help Meuvil like buffing party, keeping newbies out of the way so they don't get hurt, dragging guards away from militia house and gate, kiting Brother Jentry, and hailing Lucan without taking faction hit. There are also ways to restore your faction like turning in goblin ears in Highhold Keep. More details in forum.
