		<img src="Laany.jpg" hspace=15 vspace=15 align=left>
		Well Laany used to live quite a desolate life. It was often said of Laany that she had been born with a sad soul, but who could argue that as all her life she has had a black cloud following her around.  Even before her mother discovered that she was to have Laany her own husband was brutally attacked and killed by spects in Oasis.  Her mother and big sister Carany fled to Freeport where Laany was born seven months later. <BR><BR>
		  Laany’s mother met a kind-hearted cleric named Rork, who married her and treated both Laany and her sister as his own daughters.  However when Laany was still a toddler her wonderful life fell apart.  Her mother, during a visit to East Commons, met her untimely death at the claws of a griffin.  Now the sweet sounds of her mother’s voice singing her a lullaby and the gentle touch of her hand on Laany’s cheek are all that she remembers of her mother.<BR><BR>
		  Her stepfather, Rork, had often ventured out on various quest leaving Laany and her sister to the care of their step grandfather, who was once a great cleric, but had become so fragile that he was now reduced to playing caretaker to the two young girls.<BR><BR>
		  Once while Laany was still very young, and her stepfather was away, the two young girls awoke to an empty house.  They wondered out into the city trying to locate their grandfather.  He was nowhere to be found.  The two girls were frightened, hungry, and cold when they wondered into a nearby monk guild.  There they were taken in fed and provided well for.  Word was sent to their stepfather who quickly returned to reclaim his daughters.  Rork, the stepfather, knew he must leave again to search for his father so he chose to place the girls in the cleric guild to be raised there and trained in the cleric ways.<BR><BR>
		  When Laany’s sister Carany heard of this she was irate. She had grown very accustomed to the monk ways and had learned to love their ways.  It was her wish to remain with the monks and to train in their ways.  Although their stepfather, never having been one who could deny his daughters anything, was very hurt he agreed to allow his oldest to remain with the monks.<BR><BR>
		  Laany, seeing the hurt in her stepfather’s eyes, felt something stir inside her.  Not wishing to leave her sister, but greatly wanting to heal the hurt that consumed her stepfather she declared that she would very much like to follow her father’s teachings. So at that Laany was taken to the Temple of Marr and for the first time in her life Laany was left alone in the company of strangers. <BR><BR>
		  She tried very hard to be a good student, but her heart and soul were not in it.  She was very lonely and missed her family and home.  She spoke to others only when spoken to and rarely ventured out.   She lost all desire to practice her skills.  She felt very depressed and her life was very empty.<BR><BR>
		  However far away in the city of Greater Fey a young druid, by the name of Deeme, heard of the sad Laany.  With a brave heart and a determined mind he vowed to grow big enough to travel to the city of Freeport so as to find the sad cleric and to restore her happiness with his kindness and warmth.  It was not an easy task for the young druid, but he never let his sight wonder from his goal and eventually he found his way to Freeport where he began his quest to find Laany.  Finally one day he was able to get word to a friend who spoke to Laany’s sister Carany.  Carany told them where her sister could be found and even though she herself had traveled far away to the Karanas she was able to get a message to Laany who agreed to meet the Deeme at the West Gate in Freeport.<BR><BR>
		  The first time Laany set eyes on Deeme something in her spirit sprung to life, something she had long since thought had died.  She knew this was a very special meeting and that her life would once again have meaning.  Deeme took the fragile Laany under his care and nursed her back to full spirit. He showed her how good helping others could make her feel.  He helped her to build confidence in herself by introducing her to tailoring.  As her skill increased and she was able to make items to sell, she started believing she had value and worth.  In Deeme helping Laany a bond was formed between the two and a great friendship was born.  Deeme then took Laany to his new found “family”, a great guild called Healers United where Laany was welcomed with open arms.  Now with a new life and a purpose to live it, along with a guild to call her family and a soul mate friend, Laany’s life holds the possibility for many great things.  <BR><BR>
