		<BR><BR>
		<BR><BR>Dawn came to Kelethin very slowly in the dense forest of Greater Faydark.  Life was very simple in our great tree castle.  All residents of the City of Kelethin were proud of the city they called home, including the young boy named Garan.
		<BR><BR>Garan was found by a nearby Orc camp, which was more than likely the cause of him being orphaned when he was very young.  He was very bright and kind.  Garan loved the animals that nature provided around him but had a temperament for being vengeful to anyone who would cause harm to his people.  As Garan grew up in the forest of Greater Faydark, he came to familiar with the barbaric attitudes that came from the world of Norath.  Many different races came through his fair city with an audacity to turn their heads at grief, not caring to help anyone when being attacked during the daily raids from the nearby Orc camp.
		<BR><BR>Garan started to realize that the only way for life to change was to take charge and change it himself.  He witnessed the many skills of the area and was fascinated with the Gift of Healing that was available in the world.  Garan thought long and hard on what it was that he wanted out of life, but it was always the Gift of Healing that always crept back into his mind.  The ability to heal was something that struck him as noble in this cruel and sometimes heartless world. He ventured to the nearby Class Guilds to put something tangible to this newfound passion.  He wanted so much to help all the people that he could, but how could he do so with the world of Norath being so large?  Garan eventually decided to join the one class that had the power of healing and the ability to travel Noraths’ vast distances during a brief battle that took place in the lands of Greater Faydark.
		<BR><BR>Garan noticed that he wasn’t the only one with this passion for healing.  One day, he witnessed a group of Norath citizens (consisting of clerics, druids and shamans) helping repel an attack from the nearby Orcs.  Garan watched as many people were saved from the beastly attacks.  During the battle, Garan was so awe struck at the power of healing that he wanted to do what he could to help.  He was so attuned to that ability that he put all his mental strength to praying for their victory, what he didn’t realize was that some of healing that took place on the battleground was from him.
		<BR><BR>After the battle, a man named Aurik came to him and thanked him for the assistance during the fight.  After being informed of his natural ability, Garan asked for guidance in attaining what was his dream.  He would no longer let others die when help was available. He would sacrifice himself for the common good, even if it meant allowing himself to be subjugated to the cruel attacks of its own Norath citizens.  Garan enlisted himself in the mystical Guild of the Druids.
		<BR><BR>Upon training in the Arts, Garan decided it was time to start anew.  He decided to rename himself Belgaran to honor his Beloved wood elf community.
		<BR><BR>Many seasons came and went, and by the time Belgaran became of the 13th season, he was a loved wood elf in the community of Kelethin for all his help in putting down the now abandoned Orc camp.  Finally one day, he decided it was time to venture out into the world of Norath. He saved enough platinum to purchase a Teleport to a far off land.  That land was known as the Western Commonlands.
		<BR><BR>Belgaran learned of many new spells, fought many different species of evil, and befriended many different races and classes.  He realized that life was hard to go solo.  Not just in the fighting, but in the healing too.  Belgaran gathered many of the friends that had helped him in his travels, from Aarodara, Ertemis, Roald, Gruass, Aumdail and Fetterholf, just to name a few.  The guild was to be everything that he thought should be in life, sharing of knowledge, disgorging the evil of Norath, and most importantly the Gift of Healing.  Belgaran became the Guildmaster of the newly founded Healers United Guild.
		<BR><BR>Over time, the Healers United guild would grow, gather more followers, and also loose some by the way sideL.  But that was the way of life on Norath.  Nothing was forever, as Belgaran was to find out.
		<BR><BR><BR>	Belgaran was fighting his old nemesis (the Orc’s on the continent of Faydwer) when he was viscously attacked and left for dead.  Many months had passed of which the Healers United were left wondering what happened to their leader.  Belgaran was all but dead.
		<BR><BR>Fearing the worst, the Healers United Guild marched on with the leadership of Roald and in time, the lovely Dahlea.  The Healers United Guild became a known force in the world of North. Every day members of the Guild kept their promise of fealty to the guilds’ Doctrine and become more and more powerful.  Till one day, the Healers United guild shall become one of the most powerful and respected guilds of the land.
		<BR><BR>But fear not.  All was not lost.  Deep down in the jungles of Faydwer, Belgaran had not died.  He was slowing being brought back to health by the very animals he protected back home, the wolf.  Belgaran was so thankful, that he dedicated his life to the animal and became known thereafter as Belgaran Wolfguardian.
		<BR><BR>Belgaran Wolfguardian burst back on to the scene with a vengeance. He contentedly relinquished his former title of Guildmaster to the current leader, Dahlea, who of which has lead the guild to where it is todayJ.
		<BR><BR>Belgaran Wolfguardian is delighted with the way life is now in the world of Norath.  It still has many uncivilized lands of which to reclaim from barbarism, but is optimistic with its outcome.
		<BR><BR>Belgaran is still feeling the pains from that near death experience, but is ever searching for that peaceful dream of Harmony in his life.  Someday, maybe Belgaran Wolfguardian will even find true love during his adventures.  Maybe a lady in the guild will spark a flame?
		 <BR><BR>
