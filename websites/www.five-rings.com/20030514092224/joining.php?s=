     <p align="left">Thank you for your interest in Five Rings! Our goal is to
     efficiently tackle some of the most challenging encounters in EverQuest. In
     order to meet these goals, we need to ensure that our raid force is
     comprised of highly skilled players who are willing to dedicate the
     necessary time and energy to see that this happens.<br>
     <br>
     Five Rings will remain a relatively small guild. We want every member to
     feel like a valuable member of the team. This means that we will be
     accepting members based on the requirements list below (<b>Exceptions always exist</b>):<p align="left">
     <b>We have reevaluated our requirements, if you thought you did not have 
     the levels or AA requirements for our guild, please seek us out again.&nbsp; 
     The only thing we ask is that you should be pretty damn good at your class.</b><p align="left">
     <b>General Requirements for all Classes</b>:<ul>
       <li><p align="left">Must be flagged for PoV/PoS,  BoT.
     (We will consider getting medallions for you)</li>
       <li><p align="left">Highly desirable to be flagged for CoD, HoHa,
     Tactics. (Again are nice to have, but not required)</li>
       <li><p align="left">It is highly desirable to obtain at least level 60. </li>
       <li><p align="left">Must have the ability and desire to raid multiple 
       times per week during 6pm-12pm EST</li>
     </ul>
     </td>
 
   </tr>
 
   <tr>
 
     <td colspan="4" class="row2">
     <b>That being said, here's how it works</b>: 
     Post your application on our 
     <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/fluclinafterdarkfrm8">Message Board</a>. 
     Tell us about yourself, including class, level, typical playing time, and 
     other information you feel pertinent. Make sure you include your email 
     address so that our recruitment officer can get a hold of you if need be. 
     You are expected to be unguilded at this time. After posting your 
     application, it s your responsibility to contact of the membership 
     officers to establish contact. If there are no immediate issues from the 
     current members, you will be given clearance to raid within usually one to 
     two days. However, in order to ensure that we have sufficient opportunity to 
     get to know each applicant, we may limit the number of applicants given raid 
     clearance at any one time. if this is the case, your name will be placed on a 
     list and given clearance as space opens. once you receive clearance from us, 
     you are expected to start attending guild raids. In order to facilitate 
     communication, you will be guilded during the raids, and expected to deguild 
     at each raid conclusion. <b>Getting to know us is your responsibility</b>.. 
     Therefore, applicants that have shown no efforts in this direction within 
     three days of posting their application will be removed from consideration. 
     If you do not have a sponsor within two weeks of raiding with us, your 
     application will be removed. After 1 month, applicants are welcome to apply 
     again, however, please consider the reasons your application was removed and 
     whether Five Rings is the right guild for you at this time.<br>
     <br>
     <b>Obtain a sponsor</b>. This will be someone in the guild who knows you very well, 
     and knows that you will be an asset to Five Rings. Only active members can 
     sponsor and applicant. Your sponsor will be your mentor in that they will 
     keep you updated on raids and answer any questions you have along with the 
     membership officers.<br><br>
     Sponsorship guilding. Once confirmation from your sponsor is received, you 
     will be guilded and your sponsorship period begins. This period will last a 
     minimum of two weeks to a maximum of six weeks. The exact length of time is 
     up to the discretion of the guild. You will be expected to raid with the 
     guild and actively participate in guild events. All applicants are evaluated 
     in the following areas:<br>
     <br>
     <b>Class Skill</b> - How well do you play your class. This is the most important
     criteria. We are not here to teach people how to play their class, and 
     therefore will ONLY accept applicants who are skilled. Members of the same 
     class are expected to spend some time evaluating applicant skills and 
     offering their opinion.<br>
     <br>
     <b>Raid Skills</b> - How well do you control your aggro, follow directions, pay 
     attention, pick up on the raid strategies, contribute to a fast corpse 
     recovery, etc. Some of these skills are learnable, however, by level 60, 
     most people should have learned basic raid conduct and behavior.<br>
     <br>
     <b>Attendance</b> - Over the course of the two week sponsorship period, we will be 
     able to get a good overall impression of attendance and guild participation.<br>
     <br>
     <b>Motivation, Attitude and Character</b> - Are you making an effort to get to know 
     us? Are you staying on top of guild events? Are you helping out when 
     possible? Are you hanging out during non-raid times? Do you handle deaths 
     gracefully? Can you accept that failures do happen and they are good 
     learning experiences? Do you accept constructive criticism well? Etc. <br>
     <br>
     During this time, you will also be getting to know the other members and 
     learning how we all work together. you will earn DKP during this time which 
     can be traded in for items that drop during raids. However, as an applicant, 
     you will only be awarded loot after active members have passed. You will 
     have access to our raid forum to keep on top of where you need to be on a 
     daily basis. If necessary, we may choose to extend the length of an 
     individual's sponsorship period. Regardless of obtaining a sponsor, your 
     sponsorship will not begin until you meet the requirements listed above.<br>
     <br>
     Final evaluation At the end of your sponsorship period, barring any 
     objections from the officers or members, you will be considered a full 
     member with all the privileges associated with it. <br>
     <br>
     If for some reason, at any time either you or the guild decides that it 
     isn't going to work out, you will be removed from the guild and no longer 
     considered for membership. We reserve the right to remove your application 
     or end your sponsorship period at any time.<br>
     <br>
     We are willing to help with every step of this process, so please feel free 
     to email any questions or send a tell in-game to any of the membership 
     officers.<br>
     <br>
     <b>We look forward to getting to know you.</b></td>
