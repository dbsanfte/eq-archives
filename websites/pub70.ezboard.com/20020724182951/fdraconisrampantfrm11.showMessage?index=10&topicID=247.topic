<br>
Apostles:- I think that in your first post it is apparent taht you have gotten a little ahead of yourself. You really need to settle into a guild before campaigning to be an officer. As for respect, well you could have easily made up everything you said there so respect as far as I am concerned is something that will have to be earnt. At the guild meeting you were childish. The emote 'faarts' is not appropriate for a serious guild meeting. My husband asked you very politely for you to stop spamming the screen with spells you didn't need to cast and you were hostile. Endearing yourself to the guild is not something to be done this way. By all means hunt with us, learn with us, advance your trade skills with us, but don't show off, don't be childish and don't try to take over. <br>
This guild is a very family orientated guild. We all love each other and we all get along at the end of the day. I know full well that if I die in the middle of Beholder, Jylli will pull up an alt and come rez me, just like I know that Guin would drop what she was doing and pick up Senduin for me so we can hunt together. We love each other and we trust each other and if that is not something you are prepared to earn your way into, don't waste your time. <br>

<br>
I was under the impressen that this guild tried to role play I guess not, I was merly role playing and a sense of my overall chatacter... <br>
<br>
As per my second post I stated I was misunderstood...<br>
<br>
Life is always a campaign, your always trying to sell yourself wether it be for a better job, better ( or what you think is better ) girlfriend ot boyfriend, trying to sell to the bank for a better car or house, you get the point, If I cant sell myself to you as a faithful member, then what good am i to you ?<br>
<br>
I should not have to earn respect, Many have you have said we are a family like brother and sister , ( Kin) do you turn to your brother or sister and say I dont repsect you until you earn it !!! No Because your family its just somthing you do...<br>
<br>
I think many of you have conflicting beliefs and may need to step back and think before you banter about what I say, Be cause I repeated for the Second time I was misunderstood on the campaigning thing I was merly role playing but As for the Respect I think who ever reads this can see who has the lack of respect...<br>
<br>
You all have come accross a person that is more interested in having a good time the sitten a guild meeting listen to someone banter for 30 mins and bashin there own guildmates...<br>
<br>
My Emotions &quot;Tressa&quot; where to break the tension , People and myself didnt want to waste our time hearing the bantering, Questionable respect issues !!!<br>
<br>
Some of you that have Taken the time to send me tells and talk to me, know by now that I am a easy going guy that likes to have fun, No reason why you cant laugh a little...<br>
<br>
Guild meetings dont need to be bantering and bitching needs to be a time for show and tell , talking enjoying yourself , how often do you see all your guildmates at once.... ow sure some thing need to be talk about but I think if you have a 30 min opinion that should be in private with the person that needs to hear it .... ( I hope the right Person reads this and backs me up not slam me again like an ealier post ) <br>
<br>
I would have thought I would have earned some kinda respect doing your 100 spider silk quest in about 4 hours, which I know that I got taken for about 250p but thats ok I wanted to earn guild respect...i.e. spider silk sells for about 60p a stack I gave you 5 stacks... <br>
<br>
Im not trying nor have i disrepected anyone undeserving in a any of my post or in guild chat or groups.... <br>
<br>
it is now apparent to me that maybe the Role play idea happens when its easy to do....or when you feel like it... WTF who knows... <br>
<br>
It is funny I can post I was misunderstod and still continue to get bashed gotta love that guild respect.... <p><html>

Those who COMMAND respect shall receive it.  Those who DEMAND respect only prove that they are not worthy of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
I would suggest using a bad experience and trying to turn it around.  Did you ever think to ask yourself &quot;Why was I treated in a way that I didn't like?&quot;.  The answers are oft times found within rather than without.<br>

I really don't like to add posts because I have always been bad at putting thoughts into words, but I found something that might speak for me (I sure hope not).  <br>
<br>
&quot;Behold the pale horse, the man on it is Apostles Cain, and Hell followed with him.&quot;<br>
<br>
I haven't read everything that everybody has had to say, but I saw that you told us a little about yourself in the first post.  Well then, let me tell you about myself (Wachu that is).  I don't know what others in the guild have to say about this, but here I go. My name is Wachu, and I am a member of Draconis Rampant.  Ever since I joined this guild, everyone and I mean everyone has shown me the best of respect.  I have but tried my very hardest to give back to the guild for what I have recieved although I've fallen short in many ways.  <br>
Also, I think I read a bit about how a family shouldn't turn on one another.  Well, it seems that you were tricking us in the first place by later telling the guild that you were role playing when you first made your posts (making many people have bad first impresions with you).  This guild is not to be played with, and if you do not feel like you are getting the respect or attention you deserve then I suggest leaving.  We treat and love everyone in this guild, no matter how much of a newbie or experienced a player is. <br>
I hope I didn't just make a fool of myself, but I just hate when people can't get along.  <br>
<br>
I hope this forum dies quickly because time can only heal so much....<br>

<br>
Apostles,<br>
<br>
  As many of Draconis know, I have been an EQ player almost since release. I lead 2 guilds on Erollisi Marr and had several well versed characters. Never did I demand respect, which after the previous posts which I didn't read maybe this was clarified. The respect you get from others is what is deserved in their eyes. Any respect I have is due to my treating others with the respect they deserve. I am a friend to all I can be and a helping hand even to those I can't stand(I just keep that to myself). Just remember the golden rule(No not &quot;He who has the gold makes the rules&quot; ), &quot;Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you.&quot; Treat someone with respect, share your vast knowledge, and it will be returned to you.<br>

<br>
This is an opinion of my own, but I feel this turning into a flame war, and I would not demand, but suggest that it be removed from the forums.  Lately I have seen too many flamers and been in too many arguments, and I have no patience for any more.  I have recently had a tiff with Kethryveris, and it has been cleared up, only yesterday actually, and I cannot tolerate more flaming within Draconis.<br>
<br>
Apostles, I say this as my last clam, sane word to you.<br>
<br>
Respect IS earned.  Noone walks into a room and is respected by everyone because they are newly met.  Initially, people withhold judgment, they give the person time to show their true colours and once time is given, THEN they judge.  Depending on that judgment, repsect is given or not given.<br>
<br>
This guild is a roleplaying guild.  Officership, as I stated before, is given by the leader.  I cannot recall one officer who actually asked to be an officer.  I myself have personal experience in the steps taken to become an officer, I am waiting to finish my course to accept.  Pipette offered me the position, and I accepted, out of service to my family.  In no way did I expect, or campaign to become an officer, it is given when Pipette feels one right for the job.<br>
<br>
I can also never recall you being treated like an idiot or disrespectfully.  We take pride in being a guild that loves one another.  We are not for everyone, not everyone will feel comfortable in Draconis.  However, I do, and I am personally hurt in this thread by your accusations.  If you must accuse people of treating you disrespectfully, please email that person, or Pipette and discuss the matter.  Taking it public in our forum is uncalled for.  Secondly, you accuse &quot;some of you . . .&quot; very broadly.  We cannot differentiate who you are talking about, nor can we help you if you insist on being so malicious and indirect with your words.<br>
<br>
If this guild isn't for you, then please leave it peacefully and in good heart.  I wish no flamers from ANY member of the guild, and those that wish to leave because they don't feel it is for them, should leave without causing problems.  The key to success is building people up, and posts like yours bring people down.  I will not tolerate it, and should not have to.<br>
<br>
I will stop now before I lose my temper and say something I shouldn't.  Just keep in mind what you say before you say it.  Maybe you should have taken a little more time to learn the ways of the guild before campaigning for officer.<br>
