The final step requires a hefty party to gank three big giants. The giants are spawned as part of the quest. The giants can be spawned repeatedly, provided people have the items ready to turn in (and the final step of the quest is postponed).<br>
<br>
This raid intends for several people who want this item to &quot;chain spawn&quot; the final mobs. These people will have already completed the 1st 1/2 of the quest and have the items they need to spawn the 3 giants. A designated Ganking-Group will be prepared to take out the giants, wave after wave until all the &quot;questers&quot; have their final items. Later, the questers will turn in the items and receive the reward. They will not do it that night, as completing the quest de-spawns the Phenocryst.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
PHENOCRYST PHARMING-<br>
<br>
The Phenocryst Focus is a nice item for most casters w/ some decent INT, Mana and resists. Plus it looks cool (like a glowing black stone). The best part of this item is that it can be quested at really any level, provided you have enough forces to take down the three giants that spawn at the end of the quest.<br>
<br>
Leader: Shafli Tritium, &lt;Unhomed&gt;<br>
Backup Leader: (Volunteers?)<br>
Where: Wakening Lands<br>
Meeting Time: February 6th, 2003; 9:00PM EST<br>
Who: Support Group: One Gank Group 55+, and Any Federation Casters who are interested <br>
Goal: Kill several waves of giants in the Phenocryst Focus quest to farm the final drops for Federation casters<br>
Number of Groups: 1 gank group, +questers<br>
Level Range: 55+ for gank group, any for questers<br>
Channels: /fedpheno<br>
Alternative Goal: If the Phenocryst is not up, we can head into Kael for some mischief and/or faction. However Pheno is almost always up.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>QUESTERS- ONLY SIGN UP ONCE YOU HAVE IN YOUR POSSESSION ALL THE QUEST ITEMS NEEDED TO SPAWN THE GIANTS. FOR FULL DETAILS READ BELOW.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
-I have completed this quest myself and can confirm that this will work as it is scripted. I personally do not need this item, and am organizing this for the benefit of all casters in the Federation. Also, having done this a couple of times I understand what needs to happen during the raid.<br>
<br>

<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<br>
I want to set up this raid for a weeknight, so it doesn't interfere w/ individual guild raids or other major Fed raids. I have put together the following guide based on some stuff I ripped off from other sites and research I've done on my own.<br>
<br>
We will need two groups of 50+ folks (or one group of 60's). Definitely a Cleric and a really good tracking Ranger. Any Federation member OF ANY LEVEL is welcome to try the first part of the quest and if they are able to get that done, they are more than welcome to come to the raid and farm out the remaining pieces.<br>
<br>
For those of you who don't know the quest, it is for the following item:<br>

<br>
This quest is basically broken into two distinct &quot;phases&quot;. The first phase is easiliy soloable for a 45+ character and should be done ahead of time. What we are going to do is to have everyone interesed in getting this item to be prepared ahead of time with the soloable part complete. Then we are going to &quot;chain-spawn&quot; the final battle and kill the tough mobs as a large group for everyone who is doing the quest. Then each person will have what they need to later finish the quest.<br>

Here is the 10,000 foot view (top-down) steps for this quest.<br>

Details<br>
-------<br>
The quest begins w/ Normon Stonetooth who is a dwarf deep in the mines of Thurgadim. You can reach him by going into the mines invis, taking first right, going down a ladder, then hopping over three sections of rail, then entering a large room, taking a left, then a right. He's behind a large chunk of crystals. You should find him first and carry out the following dialog:<br>
<br>
You say, 'hail Normon Stonetooth' <br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
You say, 'who are you talking to?' <br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
You say, 'what do you mine?' <br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
You say, 'what secrets?' <br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
You say, 'What favor?'<br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
<br>
Hakon is in a weapon shop near the bank in Thurgadim. Give Hakon the Pick Axe and &quot;a small piece of velium&quot; (these are the stackable kind from Crystal Caverns, dropped off orc miners).<br>
<br>
You get the pick back plus the following faction adjustments: Coldain (better), DainFrostreaverIV (better), Kromzek (worse), and Kromrif (worse). Go back into the mines and return the pick axe to Normon. <br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
<br>
You receive an item in return called a Velium Focus. You then bring this Velium Focus item to Phenocryst, a named geonid in Wakening Land at -3210, -397 inside a maze of caves. You can hail him and such, the geonids conning indifferent to everybody as far as I can tell. It's very important to note that although geonids con indifferent or amiable, goo does not and if you get any of it on you and a geonid is close by, it'll aggro the geonid. No idea why this is, it doesn't make any sense, but it's the case.<br>
<br>
You say, hail Phenocryst. <br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
<br>
Hand Phenocryst the Velium Focus. <br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
You say, 'how can I help you?'<br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
<br>
Now you have to go to Crystal Caverns. If you invis up and head down into the caverns, you'll pass through an orc area, then a dwarf area, then a tentacle terror and spiders area, and finally there's a long stretch of tunnel leading up to a zone out point. That long stretch of tunnel is filled with geonids and they con the same as the ones in Wakening Land. Give one of them the focus (any one, doesn't matter, you don't have to hail them or anything) and you'll get it back with the following message: <br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
<br>
The description on the focus doesn't change, but it is altered. Take it back to Phenocryst in Wakening Land and give it to him. The following will happen:<br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
You say to Phenocryst, &quot;Find what?&quot; <br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
You say to Phenocryst, &quot;I will gather these stones for you.&quot; <br>
(dialog ommitted)<br>
<br>
Phenocryst gives you an item for telling him you'll gather the stones. It's a magic, lore, no drop Elbaite Focus that has 5 charges of Identify. It looks like a fire emerald. <br>
<br>
The stibnite crystal is found in The Great Divide. If you enter the wurm caves in the center of that zone from the south, go up to the first right, go in and take the next right, you'll be in a room with two spawn points for wurms and there's a patch of blue crystal at the back of the room. The stibnite is behind the crystals and looks like a bag on the floor. It spawns every 1-2 hours or so I think. The description of the item is &quot;Bent Metallic Crystal&quot;. It weights 20.0, is magic, lore, and no drop. When you identify it, it identifies as &quot;Stibnite for the Menhir&quot;. To identify an item using the Elbaite Focus, target yourself, pick up the item and right click it on the Elbaite Focus in your inventory. It won't change the description of the item, it'll just tell you what it is in your chat window. <br>
<br>
The Beryl crystal is in Split Paw. This crystal spawns deep in Paw behind one of the stone pillars near the entrance of the underwater tunnel leading to the Ishva area (+690, -17). The item is called a Reddish Crystal and it's also magic, lore, and no drop. It weighs 10.0. It identifies as &quot;Beryl for the Menhir&quot;. <br>
<br>
The crystal of purest iron is in Burning Woods. It's sitting on the bottom edge of the crashed meteor (-842, -1179). It's item description is &quot;Heavy Metallic Crystal&quot; and is magic, lore, and no drop. It weighs 14.0. <br>
<br>
**********************<br>
* STOP HERE          *<br>
**********************<br>
<br>
THE REMAINDER OF THE QUEST WILL BE DONE DURING THE FEDERATION RAID W/ HELP OF THE GANK GROUP.<br>
At this point you MUST have the following items:<br>
 o Bent Metallic Crystal<br>
 o Reddish Crystal<br>
 o Heavy Metallic Crystal<br>
 o Elbaite Focus<br>
<br>
With these four items the next part of the quest can be spawned. By turning in the four items to the Phenocryst three giants will spawn somewhere in the Wakening Lands zone. This is the part which we will be doing as a group. EVERY CASTER ATTENDING THE RAID WILL HAVE THESE FOUR ITEMS IN THEIR INVENTORY, PRIOR TO THE EVENT. We will each be turning them in and spawning the giants. Then the group will repeatedly take out the three giants until everyone has what they need.<br>
<br>
The three giants that spawn are called:<br>
 accolyte of Zek<br>
 accolyte of Zek<br>
 Bloodpriest Loukond<br>
<br>
These need to be killed and are not an easy task.  They can not be stunned, snared or rooted. They are very highly resistant to magic and have 15k+ HP each. The Bloodpriest is equally as tough, and also CHs himself and gates.<br>
<br>
Each of the giants will drop a &quot;Holy Symbol of Zek&quot;<br>
<br>
We will continue this process until everyone who came prepared (w/ the three crystals and the focus) has in their possession the three needed &quot;Holy Symbol of Zek&quot;. ONLY ONE PERSON WILL FINISH THE QUEST THAT DAY AS TURNING IN THE FINAL ITEMS CAUSES THE PHENOCRYST TO DESPAWN (in a rather dynamic fashion). That person will do it after everyone else has their three symbols.<br>
<br>
Here is what happens when you turn in the three crystals and the focus.:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
You lose the focus and the three crystals and in return gain another focus item with the description &quot;Azurite Focus&quot;. It's a magic, lore, no drop item weighing 0.5. <br>
<br>
Now head outside and start tracking. After a few minutes, two &quot;accolyte of Zek&quot; giants will show up on track. A minute later or so, a Bloodpriest Loukond will show up on tracker as well. You'll have to run out and pull the accolytes to you once you track them. These giants con blue at 52 and are quite magic resistant. Make sure you pull these, they're almost more important than the Bloodpriest. They get attacked by the various mercenaries in the zone sometimes and get killed before you can do the job. If you have to pull mercenaries with the accolytes, do. After killing both accolytes, loot them. Each one has a medalion that has the description, &quot;Holy Symbol of Zek&quot;, which is magic, no drop, and weighs 2.0. After the accolytes are done, go out and get the Bloodpriest. Bloodpriest Loukond should eventually walk up to the cave entrance and stand outside it if nobody pulls it. After a minute of standing outside the cave, he depops, which is why you have to do the accolytes first (they pop first) then the bloodpriest (he'll get to the cave probably if you can't find him, the accolytes might not). The bloodpriest cons blue at 52 and is just as magic resistant. He drops a third and final medalion with the same description. You must get all three medalions in order to for this part to prove fruitful. When you kill the giants, you take the following faction hits: Kromzek (worse), Kromrif (worse), KingTormax (worse), and ClawsofVeeshan (better). The giants never enter the caves to attack the geonids or anything. Everything will happen outside the caves and the giants won't aggro the dragon if it's up either. The Bloodpriest Loukond is also not to be confused with Priest Bjek, another giant who wanders in the area sometimes who is red at 52 and not related to this quest. <br>
<br>
NOTES/WARNINGS:<br>
---------------<br>
There are some dangers in this zone. The corrupted panther is very deadly though rare, and obviously Wuoshi is a problem for non-CoV folks. Ideally we will have a ranger scope out the zone prior to starting and see if they are up, to forewarn of danger.<br>

I truly hope that our Federation casters take advantage of this situation. When I did this quest I had to beg, borrow and bribe some higher level people to take time out of their schedule to trek over to Wakening Lands for the sole purpose of killing a few giants with no real benefit to them. <br>
<br>
The point of this event is that while we've got said people in place, why not do this multiple times? To leverage their generosity in order to complete this pretty nice quest for several people.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We still need a good Ranger for the support group please!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This will be imperative for quickly tracking and pulling the giants. They can and will be aggroed by other stuff in the zone if they're not pulled directly and quickly to camp...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>PRIZES!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I'm a pretty poor wizard, but I wanted to sweeten the pot a little bit for those that volunteer. And to also issue a challenge to the questers!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Reward#1=&quot;Appreciation&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Two or more Blue Diamonds to be rolled on by the support group. I figure everyone can use some resist gear, for themselves or for alts. If I can get my hand on some more I will increase this. Don't laugh if that's a cheap prize, because it's all I can afford so piss off. :D<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Reward#2-&quot;The Challenge&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Some decent caster type item TBD...this prize will go to the youngest caster (lowest level) who completes the Pheno quest on that night.<br>
<br>
--Note: It's nice to see multiple guild support. I hope that all of the Fed guilds encourage their members to attend. I think now is a great time to start hosting regular Federation events where everyone can get involved and benefit in some way...Even if the benefit might just be some good FUN!  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=489696">Shafli Tritium</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=troyden>Troyden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#70DB93>(1/21/03 2:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Phenocryst Focus Pharming, February 6th; 9:00PM EST</span><hr size=1> Grats Bro! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heeroot>Heeroot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#70DB93>(1/21/03 11:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Phenocryst Focus Pharming, February 6th; 9:00PM EST</span><hr size=1> Ranger?

Maybe I was presumptuous in thinking this would be an upgrade for a lot of Fed casters. Maybe everyone has better crap than me! LOL<br>

Know for a fact some DL could use this, not done a pheno fight in over a year and kicked myself when I saw your post. With all the plate cycle farming we've been doing I was looking for a caster farm we could reciprocate with and this is ideal.<br>
<br>
Have posted on our board to stir up a little interest. hopefully if we don't do it thurs we can reschedule very soon.<br>

<br>
I had initially scheduled this a bit into the future to give folks enough time to get the legwork done. I think we should take a different approach. I will leave the scheduled date for this open-ended. That is, once we have FIVE (5) people who are fully prepared to spawn the giants, we will set a time/date to do it. If additional people complete the legwork they are free to sign-up.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Therefore, this event is postponed until a date TBD in the near future. Please reply to this thread when you are fully prepared to participate. Once we have five people good to go, we'll set a time.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
