<br>
Well, I got my hands on the Beasts of Chaos army box (thanks UK Mail Order!), and I thought I’d post a little review. First the book, then the figs. <br>
<br>
The army book: <br>
<br>
First off, the fluff and art and color sections are quality. The color section as a few too many “epic” shots - you know, armies clashing. I would prefer hobby-type stuff instead. But still, very nice. I’d put the presentation up there with the Tomb Kings or the Lizardman book, but it doesn’t quite reach the glories of the Hordes of Chaos book or the 40k Chaos Codex. <br>
<br>
As for the list, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that it looks a lot like the WD preview list. I’ll go through the units in the usual obscure Dakka way, comparing them to other things and trying not to post lots of stats. <br>
<br>
First, the Special Rules. The big four are &quot;Ambush,&quot; &quot;Raiders,&quot; &quot;Unruly,&quot; and 'Beastman Herds&quot; <br>
<br>
Ambush <br>
- Up to half of ambushing units and characters (rounding down) can use Ambush if scenario allows Scouts to use special deployment <br>
- The General must also have “Ambush” special rule (Note that all Beast heroes except the Doombull have “Ambush”). <br>
- The General must be deployed normally; if he gets whacked before the Ambushing units come on the board, you lose all the units and the opponents gets their VPs (!) <br>
- - Ambushing units aren’t deployed at the start of battle. Starting from the 2nd Chaos turn, after the movement phase, the General can “sound the brayhorn.&quot; Mark a point on a table edge for each unit. Roll against Ld for each unit/model. If you pass, the unit/model emerges from the nominated point. If you fail, roll a scatter die in the middle of the table &amp; follow the arrow (even on a HIT) to a table edge. The model/unit emerges from that point. <br>
<br>
Raiders <br>
Like Skirmishers, except can only charge if at least ¼ on unit in range; up to +2 rank bonus; can’t be joined by non-“Raider” characters. <br>
<br>
Unruly <br>
Like Beastman animosity. Roll d6 for each Unruly unit during each of your Compulsory Movement phases. On a 1, the unit charges the nearest enemy if possible, or else moves ASAP to the nearest enemy. <br>
<br>
Beastmen Herds <br>
As in WD. Shooting hits vs. Ungors first; but Gors go to the front in close combat. I didn't see anything about there having to be more Gors than Ungors, or vice versa... <br>
<br>
Now for the army list entries: <br>
================= <br>
LORDS <br>
<br>
All Lords and Heroes except the Doombull get &quot;Ambush&quot; and &quot;Raiders&quot;. <br>
<br>
The Beastlord, Great Bray-Shaman, and Doombull are basically like their WD counterparts. The fightin' guys have -1 WS (**edit** That's -1 WS compared to the WD list **edit**). They can take Marks of Chaos, priced as a Chaos Lord. The shaman can't take MoT or MoK; the Doombull can actually get MoT at a discount(!). <br>
<br>
HEROES <br>
<br>
The Wargor and Bray-Shaman are like the WD; -1WS for the fightin' guy. Can take Marks as a Chaos Hero, but no MoT or Mok for the Shaman. <br>
<br>
BEASTS/CORE <br>
<br>
Beastman Herd <br>
As WD, except Gors are one point more expensive, the Champion is more expensive, and the Ungors have -1WS. Raiders, Ambush, Unruly - such little scamps! And again, I can’t find the rule that says you must have more Ungors than Gors. The basic unit is 5 Gor/5 Ungor, but beyond that, I can't find any restrictions <br>
<br>
Bestigors <br>
As WD, but one point more expensive. You can't have more Bestigor units than Beastman Herds. To get Khorngor/Pestigor/Slaangor/Tzaangor, you give the Bestigor a Mark (like giving one to a Regiment). <br>
No Ambush, Raiders, or Unruly. <br>
<br>
Tuskgor Chariot <br>
As WD, but Tuskgor +1S and the crew is a Bestigor and an Ungor. You can't stick a Mark on a Tuskgor Chariot (no Tzeentch for you!), and they don't get Ambush, Raiders, or Unruly. <br>
<br>
Warhounds <br>
As Chaos book, but they can Ambush. <br>
<br>
SPECIAL <br>
<br>
Minotaurs <br>
As WD, but can get a Standard and a Champion and the add’l hand weapon is cheaper. You can buy a Mark for the Regiment (the MoN is cheaper than usual, I guess b/c Minotaurs already cause Fear). Minotaurs are Core if the General is a Doombull. <br>
<br>
Centigors <br>
Oh, yeah. Basically like amped-up Marauder Horsemen. S4/T4/I2/A2 17pts. Can get Throwing Axes and Shields, and the Musician/Standard/Champion upgrades are a bit pricier than Marauder Horsemen. They act as Cavalry, except they don't get the +1 Cavalry armour bonus. But OTOH they can use two hand weapons, and they DO get the HW+shield armor bonus. They're also drunken: Roll d6 for each unit at beginning of turn. If 1, test for stupidity; if 6, they go frenzied. <br>
<br>
Chaos Trolls and Chaos Ogres are as in the WD. There's a wee bit of fluff about the Chaos Ogres that would mesh with the idea of an Ogre Nation - Ogres &quot;have their own society, their own language and their own customs, and must voluntarily enter the service of Chaos for it to hold any sway over them. Although resistant to mutation, Ogres of the far north are often warped, as are all creatures of the Wastes.&quot; Not much, but hey, nobody ever accused the Ogres of having a society before.  <br>
<br>
RARE <br>
<br>
Dragon Ogres <br>
As WD. The add’l hand weapon a bit cheaper, and they are no longer Large Targets. Dragon Ogres and Shaggoth have the “Storm Rage” rule; if you zap ‘em with Lightning (incl. Warp Lightning), they frenzy. <br>
<br>
Shaggoth! <br>
As WD Drake, except +15 pts, -2WS, -1A and Great Weapon is pricier. He's still a Large Target (and how...), and you can't take a Shaggoth with a Daemonic General. So no more Greater Daemon/Drake combos. <br>
You can upgrade to Shaggoth Champion for free. A Shaggoth Champ takes up a Rare and a Lord slot, gets MoU for free, and can take Marks as a Chaos Hero. <br>
<br>
The Chaos Giant and Dogs of War are as in the WD. <br>
<br>
As I said, it's basically the WD list with some tweaks - some important, other less so. <br>
<br>
====== <br>
<br>
As for Magic Items, Yes, there are Magic Items. I don't really get off on these, so I'm not much use in this department. I will say there aren't that many, and offhand it looks like the usual assortment of killy things, armour and wards. One interesting tidbit - a new Daemonic Gift called &quot;Unliving Idol,&quot; which makes a Daemon count as a Beasts General. So you could have a honking great Daemon Prince and a Shaggoth in the same army... <br>
<br>
====== <br>
<br>
And now the SPECIAL CHARACTERS. These guys are flippin' rockstars. <br>
<br>
First up is good ol’ Khazrak One Eye. He’s billed as “the most intelligent Beastman to have lived,” which seems like being the tallest Dwarf ever, but I digress. For a hair under 300 points and a Lord and a Hero slot you get a stat line that’s between a Chaos Lord and a Chaos Champion, and everyone with “Ambush” can Ambush, including Khazrak himself! Naturally, he must be your General. He can also signal the Ambush from off the table. Plus he's got his magical stuff, basically a magic whip that keeps wounding, and a suit of MR armour that can add to his S. <br>
<br>
Next up comes Gorthor the Beastlord, another old favorite. For a bit more than 4-fitty and a Lord and a Hero slot you get a stat line between a Chaos Lord and a Chaos Champion riding a souped-up Chariot (better save; reroll fleeing and pursuit; and a chariot protecting magic item). He can Ambush (even though he's in a Chariot), and he's a Raider if he's on foot. Gorthor's got the Mark of the Gods, like Archaon; he adds a die to the dispel pool and can basically get a bound Lore of Death spell; and your army can take an extra Rare choice if you take him. He's also got magical gewgaws that add up to killing stick and a Ward. And naturally, he must be your General. He also died a 1000 years ago, so you can all sleep easy. <br>
<br>
And finally Morghur, Master of Skulls. Rumors didn’t capture the half of this guy. He’s an incarnation of the essence of warped mutation – like an evil forest spirit. The fluff about him is pretty wicked. In game terms, when you take him, your army gets all messed up. For a bit under 400 points and a Lord and a Hero slot, you get: <br>
- A stat line something like a Chaos Champion, but moves like Spawn <br>
- Hatred, Terror <br>
- You have no General (select your army as if your General was Undivided) <br>
- No Mortals or Daemons <br>
- Everyone is Unruly, and Bestigors are Raiders. BTW, Morghur has a brayhorn, so other units can Ambush. <br>
- Enemy tests for Fear before entering any woods <br>
- That “turns things into Spawn” power? It’s true, but it also applies to your own units. Anything w/in 8” rolls a Ld check, if failed, d6S4 hits with no Armour saves. If a unit suffers wounds, you create a Spawn with that number of wounds - but you have to have a Spawn figure to represent the creature. So it's a great chance to field all your twisted Chaos conversions. <br>
- He’s also got some magical kadiddlehoppers - some casting and dispel stuff. <br>
<br>
IMO Morghur kicks butt. He’s what a special character should be. It’s not just like bolting on a turbocharger (“more killing power, please”); taking him warps your whole army. Way cool.  <br>
<br>
So basically, I am well pleased with Beasts of Chaos. Looking at the list, the special Beastmen rules (Ambush, Raiders) really only apply to the Beastmen Herds, Hounds and Characters. The tougher units don't get the special rules. With a bit of luck, this will cut back on the horrors of combining Mortal, Beast and Daemonic units. <br>
