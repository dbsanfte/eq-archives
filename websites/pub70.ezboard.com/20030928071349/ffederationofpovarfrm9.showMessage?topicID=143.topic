We started out with 6 groups in raid format, 5 full and one half a group.  This in and of itself was a challenge for me since that number was 3 full groups more than signed up.  Ill address that in a few moments but i want to start with the important stuff.<br>
<br>
The Following people recieved epic drops/turn ins in the hole yesterday.<br>
<br>
Tokaaz did his turn in to High Scale Kirn and we killed that mob for the shammy epic drop.<br>
<br>
Tharkuran recieved the chanter epic drop when we killed the Ghost of Kindle.<br>
<br>
VonAlbrecht did his turn in to Jaeil the Wretched and we killed both the insane and the wretched versions.  The Insane version dropped his piece for the ranger epic.<br>
<br>
Also dropped yesterday:<br>
<br>
Both Tumcei and Aarolron recieved imbued granite spauldrons<br>
<br>
Rezman recieved whithered leather bracer<br>
<br>
and Myork recieved a loam encrusted sash.<br>
<br>
Over all was good lootage and I even managed to get a couple blue aa exp out of things.  I believe we also had someone ding on the landing just before the castle but i cant for the life of me remember who.  Sorry.<br>
<br>
Ok that was the important stuff.<br>
<br>
The raid sign up sheet consisted (even with late commers) of just over 2 groups.  I posted groupage on sat afternoon and there were a couple late sign ups.  Tokaaz was one of these and gave the raid an added goal of the shammy epic mob in the zone.  I figured we should have a good time going all the way to the bottom of the hole and that almost doubled the length of time of the raid.<br>
<br>
What showed up at the Paneel stone was both daunting and heartwarming.  It was daunting because almost DOUBLE the number of people who signed up showed up and suddenly I had a pick up raid on my hands instead of something schedualed.  I have 24 people on my scribbled attempt at groupage and that doesnt include one whole group of latecomers (including and thank you to Tharkuran for being our only chanter on the raid).  Once I managed to get things a bit organized we took off for the Hole and had Barthalemew open the door for us. (there was some debate about if you could buy a key or not in paneel.  According to Allakhazam's you get a key for about 100pp in a shop under the bank in paneel.)<br>
<br>
Once we got into the Hole and got buffed I put Shevia to work as the sr monk present pulling mobs.  We had ALOT of overkill here and many of the casters couldnt even get spells off before the mobs went down.  We had no problem moveing forward and the way to the drop down point was clear even before we had finished buffing.  because of this overkill I told her to pull multiple mobs to keep everyone busy killing stuff.  We had no problem moveing forward except for people going ld.  <br>
<br>
About half way down the Hole is poor Jaeil the Wretched.  I gave specific instructions that he was not to be attacked.  I stated that my turn in would cause Jaeil the Insane to pop and that he was the mob we needed to kill.  So of course someone hit poor Jaeil the Wretched and we fought both of them.  Special thanks go out at this point to Shevia, Murs and Barthalemew for sticking on Jaeil the Insane and makeing sure he got killed.  He obviously had no reservations about running when the chips were down and many people lost him in the mess with Jaeil the Wretched.  From him I looted the soulbound hammer for the ranger epic.<br>
<br>
From here we regrouped and rebuffed and moved down towards the tower/castle area.  Myork and Thark were getting off one or 2 nukes a mob now instead of none.  Shevia had done an excelent job of pulling but had to leave shortly after our fight with Jaeil the Insane so now Murs was in charge of the mobs.  We started fighting now just ghost but snare and root casting revenants.  Murs was not a happy monk when he was playing with these guys.<br>
<br>
This is the point where my personal experience fails.  I had only been into the tower once and that was a while ago.  Between us Tokaaz and Ifigured out where the eq atlas map said kirn was and we managed to get to him after a delay caused by another couple ld.  We get to Kirn and in the next room is our budy the Ghost of Kindle.  We moved into the room and took him out for Thark also.<br>
<br>
After regrouping from these fights we decided to take a look at Master Yael.  Both Murs and I got too close a look at him cause he death touched Murs once and me twice.  Many people  wanted to take him but based on who we had remaining in the raid i decided not to. (this would be a good place to point out that several of us were dual and in one case that i know of tri weilding toons.) I did not feel comfortable makeing the attempt at takeing him.  We recovered one last body, split the loot and ported out.<br>
<br>
AFTER NOTES<br>
I very much hate the idea of leaveing anyone behind and it happened far to often on this raid because of the ld.  I know that at least 4 or 5 deaths can be atributed to either the ld itself or people waiting on the ld to come back.  If at all possible we will wait for the ld to come back and join us.  If not i will make sure they at the very least get their gear back and get a rez.  I dont like doing this but Im not sure what else can be done about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
One of the things I did have some problems with was maps.  I ended up using both the maps of myrist and printed out eq atlas maps to help point us in the right direction.  Nothing beats first hand knowlege of a zone.  There are too many ways that maps can be misinterperated and this can slow down a raid as was seen in this one.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for comeing<br>

The only problem I could see was the great number that showed up that hadn't signed up. <br>
<br>
The problem is, due to the numbers on the sign up, some of us were botting two toons. In my case it was to make sure that we had an evacker in all the groups. Judge was also the SA. TJ did nothing but get rooted moving to the next fight spot. And of course the port out. I could have done more with him, not that it would have made a lot of difference, if I was playing him only.<br>
<br>
 Judge wasn't needed due to the large number of melee present.<br>
<br>
 So why didn't I log Judge and play only TJ?<br>
I have one puter set up for botts and it is a little slower, with HB's set up for my role. To play TJ on that puter would have been different and I would have made mistakes, hitting the wrong buttons, or I would have had to make a whole new set. So I would have had to log Judge and TJ and put TJ on my faster puter. Not really a problem. However by the time I realized Judge wasn't needed we were in the zone and fighting. Which means I would have had to use my gate potion or have a wiz TL me out. Seemed a pain so I just stuck it out.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying this was a big deal. I don't mind doing whatever the raid needs me to do. It's just that I really don't like playing more than one toon on a raid if they both aren't needed.<br>
<br>
And to ask the RL to remember every player that is botting a toon to figure out who doesn't need to is putting a lot more pressure on him/her.<br>
<br>
With that said however, the Fed has been raid poor. So I understand Von not turning anyone away, he never does anyway. And we will always get a few that show up without signing up.<br>
<br>
I just think this raid showed how important signing up is. And even if you take out all the botts we still would have had a huge force.<br>
<br>
btw it's late and I'm very tired so tomorrow this prolly won't matter at all. lol<br>
<br>
Grats to all who got items. And I'd like to mention how Hate, I think that was his name, had looted an item, no one wanted and then won the roll on one of the igs' and gave it up without saying a word in the raid chat. Honor is alive and well in EQ. <p><img border=0 src="http://www.81x.com/Authors/Judgen/Judgensouls.JPG" /></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garnetdragon@federationofpovar>garnetdragon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Federation Admin</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#70DB93>(8/26/03 12:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Hole 24 aug</span><hr size=1> Now that you mention it bud it was an SK named Evil or something like that.  He got the bow from near the entrance and ended up haveing to leave before the raid was over.  Yes I believe that he has the potential to be a find player and would like to include him on any of the raids that I lead just because of his honorable actions.<br>
<br>
If I am doing my math correctly we had 24 toons when we encountered Master Yael but only 20 People.  I was aware of this throughout the raid and it was one of the reasons that I decided not to tackle him.  Hehe Its a credit to those that did play multiple toons that noone in the raid ever mentioned this and to my knowlege noone noticed it either.<br>

yes, it is very difficult to concentrate on two characters<br>
at once on a raid.  i had rezman and kiskin there, which<br>
is tough, but rezman and ishkandar is even more difficult.<br>
needless to say, i'm a bit burnt out from such a long time<br>
playing two characters in a situation where concentration<br>
has to be at the utmost.  turns out, i really could have<br>
left rezman behind, probably, but i know you can never<br>
have too many clerics. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Great show of force from the Fed.  Von, you did a great job leading this one, especially with the impressive turn out we had.  <br>
<br>
Of course, I would like to thank each one of you for helping me get one step closer to my epic, unfortunately I didn't write down everyone's names, so I hope that a blanket 'Thank You' to all will suffice.  It was good be a part of helping others to get closer to their epics too, and I look forward to seeing those epics.  Also, congratulations to those who won upgrades from the drops along the way.<br>
<br>
As for Master Yael, we might have been able to take him, but it would have been tough.  I don't even want to think about the CR which might have resulted.  Better to be safe than sorry at times like that.  After the revamp of The Hole with this recent patch I decided to drop a  newb cleric off the ledge.  The room had changed, there's now a door into Yael's room, a non-agro ghost at the pool (Echo of Nortlav),  I saw no wanders in the room, a lot of 'corpses' of 'a fallen adventurer' (you know, they look like pc's, but are not targetable corpses) strewn about, and no sign of Yael (he may not have been up at the time.) Oh, 'what happened to the cleric?' you might ask. That door I mentioned, it seems to be trapped.<br>
Maybe we'll check it out the next time we do a shopping trip for epic pieces. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tigernach>Tigernach</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://forums.guildwizard.com/uavatar.aspx?ImageID=25" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#70DB93>(8/27/03 11:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Hole 24 aug</span><hr size=1> Trapped you say?
