Tigernach (Lil ol' me) and Nightseer both received their Epic pieces off General V'ghera.  As far as I know only two deaths, Judgen during the first DE Pull (I don't think everyone was quite listening when the INCOMING was called LOL) and Synster who took main tank during second Genral Takedown after Rennal had to leave.  But to quote Syn &quot; I'll take a death to help someone get their epic&quot; .  His inspiring words summed up the whole raid.  At the peak we had 33 people in the zone.  Serantor was an outstanding puller for this raid, knowing exactly when and where to do his thing.  Rennal tanked the way through all the DE's and the first General.  I think I got the first hard hit on him though, as I slammed a 305 Backstab on him...  and he summarily spun about and feared me...  Off I went tearing through the forest (yelling at my cpu screen the whole time).  I made it back before the end of the fight though and was able to help out a little.  Looted my items, and we also handed out an Ashenbone Shield (SK only) to Synster as he was only SK there.  Also handed out was a Katana to Moor of Onaclysm.  We remustered and Nightseer spawned the second General.  We all fought well, Synster acting as main tank now.  Our dedicated Main Clerics Yadina and Kilraa did an awesome job keeping him up as long as they did, but the Gen finally killed poor Syn.  He had lead us to taking the General down to 18% though , so to the rally crys of &quot;Synster Down!&quot;  We all redoubled our efforts and killed the Gen again.  Nightseer got her epic piece.  No one wanted the Katana, and the nifty ashbone shield rotted as the only person who tryed to get an alt to the body, got killed on the way into the zone.  <br>
<br>
  All in all a fun day and I sincerely thank all of you that assisted. <p>Fortes Fortuna Juvat<br>

and yes, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH for staying to help in CoM.  all i have left now is my fear tear and the lord Rak`Ashiir back in CoM.<br>
<br>
it means a great deal to be one step closer and to have been there with friends.  i _might_ step into fear sometime if there's a raid without a shaman, but it's just not the same as being there with you all.<br>

I was trying to follow waiting for the engage and no one was able to get a hit on it. As it ran past me I hit my attack button trying to just stop him from moving. Wouldn't ya know it My weapon proc and alerion started a CH at 50% too late he still had 3 sec left on his spell. I know because he was sitting right beside me on my other puter.<br>
<br>
As soon as the fight was over Alerion started typing that judgen needed a rez. I told him not to waste his time Kilra was there. Before I got the words out of my mouth the rez accept screen opened. Never saw alerion laugh so hard. Always said she was the best battle cleric I ever had the pleasure grouping with.<br>
<br>
Aslo there was a couple War only weapons that dropped. One was a 1hs the other 1hb. I won the roll and took the slashing because I already have a great 1hb. Then later on a greed roll Tiger and I tied and he gave it to me. I felt real funny taking 2 items. The greed roll was a 1hb with +5wiz. I was having so much fun I wasn't thinking. I never should have taken it. I never should have rolled. I already had an item. So I'm gonna give it back tiger the next time I see him. Only fair.<br>
<br>
It was a great time with a great bunch of people. Thanks for having me.<br>

Everything seemed to go like clockwork from my point of view (excepting a minor delay in getting in-game due to technical difficulties) right up until I did my turn-in to spawn the general.<br>
<br>
Of course, my re-hide didn't stick after my turn-in, which left me with the General aggroed on me, our turn-in DE aggroed on me, and JBoots turning out to be of vital use in keeping me alive as I fled back toward the raid group with those two in tow and HT'd for 90 percent of my hps, our ranger pullers left to fend for themselves and chase along behind the fleeing rogue. Astonishly enough, I managed to make it back to the group and turn around to fight the General, only to immediately get feared and run wildly about the zone for a minute or two. I made it back to the group again just in time to see the General fall to the ground.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, this wouldn't have happened without the assistance of everyone who came out for the raid, particularly Tigernach, our pullers, healers and main tank. I think I can also speak for Tigernach in thanking Tinamor, a non-Fed rogue friend of my from the Safehouse, who offered up Kedge robe multi-quests for both of us to finish our epics. Really first-class work on the part of everyone involved.<br>
<br>
