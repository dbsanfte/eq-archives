(yup you did it.  y'all done woke up that windbag writing tutor with the english mentor obsessed with the Oxford English Dictionary).<br>
Uber come from the German Language and simply translated it means super or over.  Superman in German is Ubermensch(sp).<br>
So simply put in terms of relative ability uber means better.<br>
<br>
Now &quot;what is an uber attitude?&quot;.  From what I've seen in the game an &quot;uber attitude&quot; is an attitude that you are better than others.  We have only to look at the majority of Triton members to see this displayed.  I have been playing since spring of 2001 and I can count on one hand and have fingers left over the number of times I have received buffs or assistance from them.  On at least 2 occasions I literally died at their feet, yelling for help and they did nothing.  They do not seem to want to help others in any way.  They do not seem concerned with anyone but themselves for the most part. To many this is arrogant and I have met some very arrogant Triton members.<br>
<br>
The problem with an &quot;uber attitude&quot; is that it is contrary to what I understand the spirit of the Federation is all about (and please correct me if I'm wrong).  We are grouped together to help one another with things that we could not normally do by ourselves. Helping with epic fights, plains raid, grouping together in tough zones for fun and good loot.  A spirit of cooperation and sharing not of arrogance and self interest.  The chat channel is supposed to help facilitate this and (for those who use it) is effective.  This message board is supposed to support communication and coordination outside of the game itself.  <br>
<br>
When we look down on our Federation brothers and sisters for their actions (whether it be their attitudes, their interactions with others or how they go about trying to better themselves) we diminish the Federation as a whole.  We should be about helping each other up to new heights not tearing each other down or apart.  When I was offered the post of Guildleader I saw it not as an opportunity to run a guild and be uber boss man but as an opportunity to help rebuild a structure that provides enjoyment to others.  I have several standing offers from &quot;uber guilds&quot; but I chose service to Souls of Defiance.  With that came service to the Federation.<br>
/e looks down and wonders where the soap box came from<br>

Anyway, I have yet to find a Triton person who is an absolute jerk. <br>
<br>
I think the following qualities exist in just about every uberguild out there<br>
<br>
1) dedication to EQ that borders on the unhealthy (even for eq players)<br>
<br>
2) Intense drive to be the best/first to do something<br>
<br>
3) An intense hate-on for Verant and it's crap<br>
<br>
4) A lack of PC language. <br>
<br>
5) Thick skins, and the willingness to take abuse when they screw the pooch<br>
<br>
6) Hard-core and skilled leadership<br>
<br>
Some of the Ubers are jerks in general, but not on Povar, in my experience.<br>

<br>
Being in an evil only guild is probably the best experience I could have.  You can be cruel to people in game, because it is what an evil character would do.  It's not like being a lightie and having to uphold a reputation with other lighties, and trying to vanquish the evils to make the world a better place.  You don't have to be overly concerned with factions (which is REALLY nice.)  However, some people can misrepresent some things an evil person might do as how they might really act.<br>
<br>
I think some people play the game with total disregard for the roleplaying aspect.  These people are usually the ubers, day traders, and eBayers.  I, personally, have no problem with this.  However, it is because of these people that you can get mixed opinions about a person in EverQuest.  Case in point, I was in Oasis the other day and had my /role tag off.  I was sitting at the docks, and a ranger came up to me and asked politely if I could have some buffs.  In a smart-ass way, I replied &quot;No you may not.&quot;  From there, they proceded to claim that I was a jerk, because I seemed to be one when I hunted with another of their characters in Sebilis.  Now, from a roleplay standpoint, I am this big evil Ogre, and here is this do-gooder ranger asking for me to bless him with some beneficial spells.  Would an evil person realistically do that?  Hell no, never in a million years.  If they did, then they aren't truly evil, and either need to be agnostic, or have chosen something other than an Ogre to make a shaman as.  From the realistic standpoint, here is this person who I have no idea who they are.  They con green, have a 2-word name (and no, I can't remember it off the top of my head,) and are asking for some buffs.  Granted, they were polite about it (&quot;may I have some buffs please?&quot;) but being as the only reason I was there was to talk to some people, I didn't feel like doing anything else.  Just because I play a shaman doesn't make me your buff bitch.  It is my choice to press the appropriate keystrokes to allow you to take some hits, etc.<br>
<br>
I respect this in other people.  When I am playing an alternate character, I either ask someone I know (usually a RL friend) for some buffs, use any buffs I have solo, use a bot to buff myself, or find a group to kill with/get buffs from.  If someone wants to cast SoW on me, I have no problem with that, it is a gesture of good faith.  Sometimes, it is really nice to get some HP buffs, sow, etc.  However, it doesn't mean I owe them anything.  It shows how I can expect them, and if they have a guild, the members of their guild, to act.  So, as playing an evil character, representing an evil guild, I act evil.  If I see a guildmate, 99% of the time, I will toss them a SoW and HoS.  Then when someone starts asking if they can get SoW, etc, I just say no.  If you have a problem with that, than too bad.  If I see a Fed member that I know, I will usually toss them a SoW, etc.<br>
<br>
Anyways, to get back on the topic, there are the people who play the game literally, and judge the PERSON not the TOON (the ubers) and there are the people who play the game for the experience of playing EverQuest and associating with make-believe characters (the roleplayers.) <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=56791" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://www.eq-darklegion.com/images/Oumsig4.gif"><BR><B>Oumlagar, 56 Luminary</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.eq-darklegion.com">Dark Legion</A> on Povar</B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/uvigdissangcarus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vigdis SangCarus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.unhomed.com/images/vigicon1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer of The Federation</span><br>  Posts: 439<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/15/02 6:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=404.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.unhomed.com/images/Sigs/PersonalIcon.gif height=102 width=65></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: y'all done uber did it now</span><hr size=1> <br>
well, hell, Monte ... if that is your honest definition of uber, i am uber and i didn't even know it.  the only thing i lack is an intense hatred of verant. moreover, i look at those characteristics and i'm proud that i fit them (except the unhealthy part - although i've backed off eq significantly within the last couple months - which is due more to the fact that i work 15 hour days and the only social outlet for the hours i work is an international game) for i actually see them as GOOD things. <br>
<br>
as b has noted in the past, i don't view uber as an intrisically bad thing.  in my opinion, there are a few guilds out there that hold bad attitudes.  one guild in particular, but i actually have a couple friends in that guild and i don't want to slander their guild or start some big slander fest.  that guild has members who consistently camp steal and then claim PnP, kill steal and then laugh, act generally childish, and have very little respect for anyone. the fact that these people come from an uber guild does not mean that their attitude is uber.  their attitude is crappy, plain and simple, and should not be confused with the fact that their guild is seriously dedicated to the game (i.e., uber). in other words, uber guilds sometimes breed crappy attitudes; but crappy attitudes are not a requirement for an uber guild. <br>
<br>
like Monte noted, i've often found Triton, RA and RI to be very decent folks. or, hey, maybe its that i'm uber and don't notice.  <p><br><a href="http://www.unhomed.com">

<br>
Thinking that SSRA temple is a more prestigous zone than crushbone. Or that your somehow a better player for adventuring in that zone over crushbone. <br>
<br>
Going into Kedge with 4 folks - say, a wizard, enchanter, warrior and cleric, to kill Phinny for the wizard. Not inviting the small guild mage sitting at zone and letting a mage staff rot on Phinny. <br>
<br>
Kicking out the level 20 warrior in LOIO who is in a mix of banded/rawhide, duel weilding PGT's for the level 19 warrior in full crafted duel weilding whatever is tough this month. <br>
<br>
Killing a long spawn quest mob to keep someone else from getting to it. <br>
<br>
Why should I go into X place for x drop, when I can just spend some time here then buy it in the bazaar?<br>
<br>
Can't go to that party! Got to earn some xp!<br>
<br>
&quot;The point of Everquest is to gain levels, kill things, and get better and better gear, until you can't anymore because better doesn't exist.&quot; <br>
<br>
Thats not worth doing, because you can get x for less effort, that does more.<br>
<br>
Geez, I'm not going to waste time below 50! I've done all that before! (So, you've hunted the Qeynos catacombs? No? Unrest? No? Daugnor's? Gorge of King Xorbb? No? Hmm, didn't you just say you had done all that before?)<br>
<br>
Level up so you'll be useful to the guild.<br>
<br>
I pay my 13 bucks a month, I can hunt whatever I want, and have just as much right to spawn X as an xp group!!!<br>

All of those are examples of an uber taint - and uber  in a negative way. <br>

Yea, the game sucks before 50, and SSRA does pwn crushbone. If the mage asked to join the group, i'd probably let him. I dont really agree with kicking out the warrior with the crappy gear cause I think we all can remember what that was like. If you have the cash, buying items is easier and less time consuming. Mmmmm.....xp.....drooooool. And why would I do a harder quest for an item that isn't as good as an easier quest? Doesnt make sense to meh.

This was the soul purpose for those 48hr straight days where I was so close to lvls. Hell I didnt look for a job for 2 months so I can get my BST high enuff to help the entire guild.<br>
<br>
Everyday I strive to be the best damned Beastlord on Norrath, and have the best gear. weapons skills ect know the most about the class ect... But not so I can tease everyone not as good or equipt as me, or people whom arnt as skilled in hte use of a warder as myself.. I do it so I can help the other people in need. It really makes my day every time I have Bob the lvl 13 beastlord sending me tells asking for information on spells hunting locations ect. When ever I get one of those tells I got a grin from ear to ear. (Why did he ask me? over the other beastlords) Cause I strive every day to be the best.<br>
<br>
I personaly feel an uber attitude is someone who (Quote from my monna=P ) Thinks their ..Pooh... Dont stink. People how have not a damn positive bit of advice for others. The people who stand there and watch a mob pumble you to death at their feed when they could have lifed a finger and dropped the mob.<br>
<br>
Sorry not an attack on you =) I still respect ya till you pass me in lvl =P<br>

There are many deffinitions of an uber attitude, and It really all makes sence to the person interpiting it... so therfor there are going to be MANY diffrent ideas..<br>

<br>
Start with Triton...Hell of a guild.  They have rezzed and buffed me for free more then any other guild except the ones I belonged to.  Once when my group died in Kedge a couple Triton peeps zoned in to see if something was up.  What they wanted was not up but they did see our corpses.  They sent us a tell, rezzed us (no click stick), buffed us.  The cost to us nothing other then a little a lesson on pulling from them. <br>
<br>
On the uber issue...everyone has their ideas and what it is.  <br>
<br>
Lets see...<br>
Queynos Catacombs -- did it..Why  +5 hp rings and 20% exp bonus.<br>
Unrest -- did it...Why?  Unrest Rocks...did the house in my low 20's learned a lot and had a great time + exp rocked.<br>
Daugnors -- did it...Why?  Quests pieces where in there.<br>
Gorge -- did it...Why?  Wanted a mino axe.<br>
<br>
Was never the warrior in tattered and banded.  Spent all my money on smithing so I had all banded by level 16.  When I hit 50 was wearing almost all crafted.  I am lucky that my guild can do keal for the armor drops.  Still need a BP but one day that too shall come.<br>
<br>
Do I buy stuff in the bazaar?  Very rare...prefer to go out and kill the mob and get it.  I like to do it that way, but thats just me.<br>
<br>
I am not sure what SSRA is.  Not a power gamer but have good friends that no what it is.  One day they will take me there.<br>
<br>
Ahhh the PGT...was never so glad the day I got it in HHP.  Was level 20.  Duel wielded a langseax and a PGT for a long time.  I was a happy man.<br>
<br>
Many of the things listed by others on this thread dont make you uber.  They make you an arse.  Other things dont make you uber they define the way you play.<br>
<br>
I remember long ago before Bendi took her raids elsewhere.  I would try to make them.  Why...her raids were in dungeons..the place I prefer to play.  All this being said it comes down to this.<br>
<br>
Bendi your style of play is similiar to mine.  We like the same things ( based on your posts present and past), dungeons, new zones, quests, kill the mob for the treasure.  The funny part is I am in Unhomed.<br>

<br>
Initially, it may have had a more positive connotation, and was used as a compliment or exclamation (I.E. &quot;OMG THAT WEAPON IS UBER!  Wow you must have killed a GOD to get it!&quot;), but as more people took shortcuts to fame and fortune, and less noble individuals attained the power that comes with having a large group of powerful players on your side, the term &quot;UberGuilds&quot; popped up to indicate guilds that might be able to tackle &quot;high-end&quot; encounters, but had little regard for anything (or anyone) else.<br>
<br>
It is a blanket term, used to put people in a box, just like saying that people that play on non-PvP servers are &quot;Care-bears&quot; that hide from the risks inherant in the dangerous environment PvPers enjoy.<br>
<br>
The trully entertaining thing about the phenomena (the proliferation of the term), is that with more and more people using it, it loses it's meaning to a large degree.  &quot;Non-Uber&quot; players start to cast it as an insult, claiming that the &quot;Ubers&quot; couldn't possiblly have an appreciation for the finer, more sublime, or asthetic aspects of the game since they apparently are so blindly focused on goals regarding the advancement of their characters.<br>
<br>
So then, that which was at one point considered &quot;Super&quot; is looked down upon because it is simply attainment of POWER at the expense of others and/or the &quot;fun&quot; aspects of the game.<br>
<br>
The thing is, deep down we all have our own sense of balance.  We are all attracted to differents aspects of the gaming experience and share those experiences with each other in different ways.  Obviously, EverQuest has great replayability, and also a great range of advancement for each class of character.<br>
<br>
Just because someone has a powerful character, and has interest in promoting that character's advancement further purely in terms of levels, experience, and/or equipment DOES NOT mean they have a lack of appreciation for the steps involved, and/or the gaming experience that doesn't provide results that aid their goals, other players that do not share their goals/interests, and the more obscure aspects of the game.<br>
<br>
It is hypocritical for a &quot;Non-Uber&quot; individual to slander the &quot;Ubers&quot; by claiming that their &quot;Non-uber&quot; appreciation of the game is superior and that the &quot;Ubers&quot; are a clueless lot of &quot;Inconsiderate powergamers&quot;.  Anyone that prides themselves on NOT sharing the mentality of players that have made their characters powerful should note that it is not the power of the &quot;Uber&quot; characters that is important.  What IS important is how people obtain and use their power, and this is a rather circumstancial thing.  Making broad stereotypes in this manner only serves to limit one's perspective and imply someone else is shallow, but the person making the stereotype is the one that more than often is trying to alienate themselves from the other and inconsiderately slander that person so that they themselves appear more righteous, or superior.<br>
<br>
One way that some people respond to this social dynamic is with the use of humor.  &quot;De\/\/d$p33C|-|&quot; may have actually been the way some people expressed themselves on a regular basis, but it is often embraced now for comedic purposes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gimmeh dem Phat uber lewtz yo, or stfu joo noob!&quot; is NOT generally considered as offensive statement when used between friends, because it is obvious that it is a joke.  However, where there are large groups of people, there can be found large groups of IDIOTS, and many of those IDIOTS actually embrace the language and mentality sincerely, and at inappropriate times.<br>
<br>
As for myself, I tend to not care how others are or aren't.  I am my own person and will or won't share my passions, interests, insights, experiences, humor, wisdom, and dreams with people as I see fit.  If they don't care to open up to them that is their own choice, and I respect that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=garnetdragon>garnetdragon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/16/02 9:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=404.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: y'all done uber did it now</span><hr size=1> I am pleased and humbled by your responce to the ramblings of an admitedly slightly deranged ranger.<br>
<br>
I also however do not agree with everything that was said and wanted to emphasize a few points that might have been lost.<br>
Monte:  I feel you are describing the blade and not its uses.  I am in no way saying that uber in and of itself is bad.  I use Triton as an example because they personify uber in many peoples minds and i want to empahsize that i was relaying my experience.  However the Uber knife can be used to heal or hurt, to remove diseased flesh or destroy the healthy.  I am saying that it is a long climb to lv 60 and once you hit lv 50 it is easy to stop looking down.  I feel that I received a hand up when I was working my way up the level ladder and I want to return the favor to our younger brothers and sisters.  Thats why im in a guild and not solo.<br>
<br>
Dind:  I agree with you totaly about roleplaying.  I played D&amp;D from age 9 and was a DM by age 12.  Many people in the game just dont get roleplaying and those of us who enjoy it are often misunderstood.  However, in this game there are sections that simply cannot be done solo or even with a full group. That is the point of being in a guild and by extension why our guilds are in the Federation.  I am not saying that you have to buff every character that comes up to you but that everyone in a guild has some duty to help others in first their guild and then in the Federation.  Negative roleplay should not take prescidence over the needs of our brothers and sisters.<br>
     You stated that if you need or want buffs you find a rl friend to ask from or get in a group.  I have a tendency to do the same thing.  I hate incompetent groups where the players dont know how to play their characters. <br>
<br>
Bendi and Fulton:  hehe yeah its gotta be all about the quest.<br>
<br>
Vigdis:  Yes Vig you are Uber and most of the Federation is Uber if you look at it from a lv 20 characters eyes( and that car you were sitting on in the pic is uber too).  Its when we forget to reach down and help others that the negative &quot;uber attitude&quot; starts getting in the way.  When we stop reaching out to help or be helped by our &quot;family&quot; it stops being a &quot;family.&quot;  In our &quot;intense drive to be the best/first to do something&quot; we need to be careful that we dont run over others.  We need to be careful that we dont alow this intence drive to make us so abrasive that we trample others feelings or ambitions and dont even know it.<br>
<br>
Darvan: I think its the simple acts of caring that seperate us from a negative uber attitude.  I also remember being a little ranger running around with nothing but raw hide armor and the weeks i spent in loio killing gobbie battlemasters to get faydark chain.  I have spent alot of time trying to help newbies with buffs or patchwork armor.  &quot;Buffing and Sowing at the Hallas ramp courtesy of the Souls of Defiance and the Green Ranger&quot;  Hehe  I can just imagine the looks on the players faces when suddenly a lv 3 shammy has over 400 hp.<br>
I combine these buffing expiditions with something that I need to do like buying pelts and silks.  The win win is what I look for<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cp again<br>
