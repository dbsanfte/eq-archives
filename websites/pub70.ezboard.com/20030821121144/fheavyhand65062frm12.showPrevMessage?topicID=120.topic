Okay, this is my official Heavy Hand Games Day report.  A lot of this stuff is probably up on the internet already thanks to Games Day LA, but this is what I have seen, read, or heard myself, and you guys know I really exist - because you've seen me...WITH YOUR EYES!!!  Some of this stuff is very, very unique.  You've been warned.<br>
<br>
Anyway...<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #1:</u>  Drinking with Barclay, Merle, Ken, Dean, Ann, and Mark is a shitload more fun than going to the Outrider Info Seminars.  Having earned this knowledge at the cost of going to said seminars, I'm sure there's lots of stuff already online that I <i>don't</i> know.  Oh well, <i>I</i> had fun, and my vacation is about <i>me</i>.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #2:</u>  Outrider Discount Day + On-site Compensation + Rule allowing use of specific Chaos Marine Legions = One complete Lost and the Damned Army.  My brand new debit card is still warm.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #3:</u>  Ruben is a plebe.  But we all knew that.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #4:</u>  Merle and Ken gots LEET infiltration skills.  Outrider Administrator John Conner (our only hope against the future robots) was under the impression that our boys have been Outriders for 2 years now.  Imagine his shock to be corrected in the middle of Games Day.  Imagine Merle's and Ken's shock when told they'd be getting their shirts and info kits mailed out Monday.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #5:</u> The new plastic beastmen are freaking awesome.  They come on a sprue with 3 gor and 2 ungor, 4 sprues per box (it seems).  That's 20 goat-boys.  The ungor heads look really cool, and the gor heads have two layers of hair, so you can mix and match the top layer/horns with the different faces.  Excellant models all around.  A+.  Can't wait to see Barclay's Slanneshi Beastmens.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #6:</u>  The new Codex:Imperial Guard is great.  I didn't have time to memorize it, but I did get to skim it cover to cover twice.  There's new units (Techpreist Enginseers w/ Servitor Retinue, for example) and a really great system to customize your own regiment.  <br>
Basically, you can opt to use the straight up army list and have access to every single unit time.  Or, you can remove about 8 - 10 unit types, and recieve 5 Doctrine Points.  These points can be used to buy special abilities (Iron Discipline and Sharpshooters from the Cadian list are sneak peeks - there's lots more,)  special formations (the Mechanized Company from the Steel Legion army list is an example,) special equipment (the ability to buy squads carapace armor for +20 points, or the ability to swap lasguns for laspistol & ccw are just two of these,) or buy back one of those unit types that you had to give up but really want.  Like Tyranids, you take a hit in what you can bring, but you get to customize those you do.<br>
The art, rules, and other stuff are just great in this Codex.  I can't wait til' September.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  I could do a whole report on this book, (and I just might, if Doc Gabe asks nice enough.)<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #7:</u> The Cadian Heavy Weapons sprue and the new IG Tank Accessory sprue are just two more reasons I'm holding my breath until September.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #8:</u>  In October, Johnny will be ordering a Tau BFG fleet from Fanatic.  I base this prediction on the fact that Johnny is not blind.  If someone gouges out his eyes before then, and he can't see how great the ships look, I can't be held responsible for providing misinformation.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #9:</u>  In September, all of us interested in LAN first person shooters should pick up the PC version of Fire Warrior - especially Johnny and Dave, who are both Tau players and HALO fans (the game plays a <u>lot</u> like HALO.)  It looks really, really good.  So did the lovely lady answering questions at the demo terminals Friday.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #10</u>  Ogre and Zombie Bloodbowl Cheerleaders are good for a laugh, but remain deeply disturbing.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #11:</u>  If you wear a Crux Terminatus belt buckle from Bulldog, and tell people that your belt gives you +1 Attack while pointing to it, people can't help but look at your crotch.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #12:</u>  Vodka can fuck you up, yet not kill you the next morning.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #13:</u>  GW Sculptor Tim Adcock is a great guy to drink and chat with.  Also, according to Barclay, Merle and Ken say he's hot.  (I don't know, they were discussing this when I finished my turn in the shower.  Ask them.)<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #14:</u>  Merle is even more pursuasive when you're both drunk.  Apparently, he and I are going to organize a strategy gaming club at the middle school, with GW support.  Pray for me.<br>
<br>
<u>Lesson #15:</u>  The first 2/3 of the drive back on Sunday will <i>always</i> be very quiet and subdued.  This may or may not be related to the after event party Saturday night.  It's hard to say.<br>
<br>
There's my report for my fellow Handers.  I've got a little bit more detail for a few people in particular, and if you've got any questions, most of you will see me this week.<br>
<br>
Oh...also, if Tim Adcock posts on the board, don't be surprised or mean.  The same holds true if he shows up at Gallop's...I think Merle offered him diplomatic immunity in Bulloch county, but it's hard to remember exactly.<br>
