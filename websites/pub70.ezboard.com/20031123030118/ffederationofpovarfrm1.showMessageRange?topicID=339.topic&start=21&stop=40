<br>
Durring raids it will help the stress of the clerics in situations where you have just enough for CH's rotations or your LoM and the MT is gonna drop.. the druid/shammy can pick up the slack and help save the raid.  i don't think a druid will EVER make it in to a cleric rotation so i see my job in raids as a healer Secured.<br>
<br>
As for Exp'n.  Up untill 58 i never had a problem getting a group, then it was like turning on a light. I would be lfg for hours.  annoying.  The only thing that hurts a cleric in a exp group is another cleric.  I don't forsee any druid/shammy takkin my spot in a group just because of a crack CH. Not often do i use a CH in an EXP group.  <br>
<br>
with the addition of the spell VI has also made or wil make changes to the clerics.  makkin the unswerving hammer of faith USEFUL, i don't think i've ever used that spell other then to get people laughing.  A new Yaulp, Since lvl 1 i melee, even to this day at 60 i get out a bloody my mace.  I get tired now and then just healin and buffin, this is a welcome change.  But again, i do this rarely as is.  but with the new spells and changes i'd love to get out there and solo melee for a tad, root and dot is soo borring <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They are tossing most of the game balance right out the window - mudflation is running rampant, powerlevels are soaring, etc. They say that they are going to continue EQ after EQ2 - but by that point, EQ will likely be so trashed out that you'll want to quit it. <br>
<br>
Hopefully EQ2 will include fixes for most of the problems with EQ, like expanding the recommended levels for items, item decay, etc. They have babified EQ to the point where finally I'm starting to see folks complain about it getting too easy, etc. Mind, these are the same folks who you can't pry out of the Dreadlands for love nor money in their 40's, because of how safe it is (never mind that its crappy xp). <br>
<br>
The Druid/Shaman changes are part and parcel of the diluting of EQ. The cleric changes are a bit more interesting. They might or might not be worthwhile - if all these changes get folks to actually doing more, it will be worthwhile. The Cleric changes will certainly revamp things a tad.<br>
<br>
Just my two cents. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My tells for groups has dropped to almost zero. My ability to get a group at all depends entirely on me either making the group; or the mercy of my closest friends. The soloing is only useful to me as a tradeskill farming thing; and believe me its gotten alot of use since every druid bot or solo druid got dusted off and given the primary healer spot in the group. CT is not the haven that some think it will be -- Groups are already there every day who are not using a cleric at all. I don't care what you throw out about the numbers, and the caps, and percentages, and efficiency; its all statistics. Statistics don't mean jack sh*t compared to what really happens in the world, and that is that all statistics aside, the heal is working well enough that either class can now be primary healer and still offer their full array of abilities. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Whether you agree with the new heal for dru/shm going in or not, the fact of the matter is, the introduction has had a very noticable impact on the group desirability of clerics.<br>
<br>
Like I've been saying in guildchat the past few days, does this mean that I'm eligible to roll on a CoF now? No? Didn't think so. hehe<br>
<br>
If this patch goes live I don't think I'll even bother looking for groups. You'll see me duo with my RL friend's magician the rest of the way up to 60, thanks.<br>

BTW, I'm eager to *finally* start raiding with the Fed. I made 49 after five nights of frantic exping in Echo (was 45 on Sunday). Is 49 high enough for most common raids (dragon, kael, etc.)? <p>[4x Cleric] Lolli Poppins (Gnome)

Most Fed raids are 50+ (being a cleric you should be able to get in just fine since Fed been a little short on clerics lately), several are 45/46+.  At this point there are only a few raids that are 55+.  It all depends how many other clerics sign up for a raid.  Tip:  Sign up early!  If a lot of higher level clerics sign up to a raid you may still not get assigned to a group (chances are good you'll get reserve status and people always no-show) but I've found when I was a lower level cleric that raid leaders will give you a little preference sometimes if you're on the ball. <p><br><br>

Your role on raids isn't going anywhere.<br>
<br>
And as for EXP groups, well you are going to have people that are super picky and will sit forming a group for 2 hours until they get the absolut best combination of people, and you are also going to have the people that just want to get the first people together that will work and go at it for fun.  It's up to you what type of people you want to associate with.<br>
<br>
Personally I have alwaysd been of the belief that some classes are supposed to do things better then other classes, and yeah some classes should NOT be able to solo well, that's not what they are for.  I don't complain that my chanter can't solo worth crap.  Hell it's a multiplayer game hehe.<br>

I don't play any of the 3 classes as a main, and while my husband does have a shaman as his main, I still personally think what they are doing is wrong.  First off, most shamans I have met DON'T LIKE to have to play healer.  Secondly, each class was given certains spells to start with to make them a unique class, and while most of us (especially an enchanter...my main) love having a cleric close by for thier rezzing/healing abilities, I do feel like this will make things harder on them.  I don't particularly like the thought of my cleric meleeing (honestly I think this Hammer of Judgement is the worst idea I have heard).<br>
<br>
My reasons for feeling that this could harm clerics even more comes from the following.  You have 3 groups in Kael.  When I set up groups, I try to make sure I have a cleric and druid/wiz for each group.  Then I have my heals covered and my evacs.  Now if you have druids with CH, I only need one cleric for my main group to do any rezzes that are needed.  I put a druid in my other two groups as my primary healer AND they can evac, this allows me more room for MELEES.  People to put out damage.  I have to agree with most clerics in situations like this, they will get screwed.<br>
<br>
I will NEVER allow myself to take a druid/shaman OVER a cleric.  I just feel as if Verant is taking away the uniqueness of our clerics.  If they are going to do this, they need to add something else that will continue to make our clerics unique and continue to give them the abilities needed to make them a very important part of a group, whether for exp or raids.  I don't feel that handing them a hammer and telling them to whack on a mob is an upgrade by any means.  I don't want my cleric up there swinging away, when they should be medding and healing, they can pull enough aggro with healing, they sure don't need to bring more attention to themselves in this way. <br>
<br>
Maybe they need to add some better buffs (not saying that the ones they have aren't great), maybe give clerics some buffs with more AC/HP or give them the ability to do something that NO other class can do.  Pally's get thier LoH, allow clerics something along this line, but something that would be a group spell, and something that no one else can have.  Make it such a great spell that it is only allowed once a day.  Maybe a spell called The Healing Touch (ThT), allowing a cleric to use this once a day, the spell would:  Completely heal the whole group, and give everyone full mana and stamina all at once.  They would definitely have to make sure it was a dire situation before using it, because they don't want to waste it, but yet this would continue to make a cleric unique and very wanted, knowing that they could possibly save the whole group, even if it is just once a day.<br>
<br>
I know that I was a little miffed when I heard that BL's would be getting clarity, but I knew that they nor bards would ever have my capabilities.  They are both great classes and unique in thier own ways, but they still don't take the place of an enchanter.  Even though druids and bards have other spells/songs that help with crowd control (and I love grouping with a bard that can play this part well), they will never replace an enchanter.  I think that alot of clerics feel this way, that they are being replaced.  Pally's can rez and deal damage, Shamans can now CH, best melee buffs (IMO), they have AC/HP buffs, they can haste, they have a pet, can sow, and put out some damage, especially with the pet, Druids, can now CH, have sow, damn good dots and some great nukes, can port and evac, can put out a bit of melee damage.  A cleric heals/buffs, they do have some great nukes (especially towards undead), but most don't want the cleric nuking because of the aggro, they can't sow, they can't port/evac, they don't have pets (sorry, don't consider a hammer much of a pet), so, the things they had to make them unique they no longer have.  <br>
<br>
I personally think that a shaman is already a very strong class if a person really knows how to play him/her, and that this just about makes them much more desired in a group now than a cleric.<br>
<br>
Normal groups would have been:<br>
Warrior<br>
Any Melee<br>
Cleric<br>
Enchanter<br>
Druid/Wiz<br>
Shaman <br>
<br>
Now you can almost have a group consisting of these classes and not lose a thing<br>
Warrior<br>
Melee<br>
Melee (or druid/wiz if evac needed and druid is not here for heals)<br>
Pally (for rezzes, not great, but still have it covered)<br>
Shaman/Druid (healer and if druid this covers your evacs)<br>
Enchanter<br>
<br>
This allowing a group to have 4 Melees and still have thier heals and rezzes covered.  I just don't like the idea of this, and while most people such as myself love thier clerics and won't allow this little change to affect that, there will be those that don't care, and will just take what they can get quickly as long as they have some types of heals.<br>
<br>
NOW on the FLIPSIDE of it:  I have to agree that getting clerics 50+ has been a real pain at time, and while our guild has some good clerics and a great one (Velisaris), we are always short of clerics and this would help with that problem.  We have had to call many a raid, because of the lack of clerics.  We couldn't go in with 4 groups and only ONE cleric.  This would take care of that problem, and allow us more raids.  So i'm not totally against them giving shamans and druids better heals, I just feel that they need to add something else to the cleric to continue to make them desirable and needed in exp groups and raids.  They are a class that has worked extremely hard to get to where they are, and I understand thier feelings of being jipped.<br>
<br>
Personally I think Verant could have done this a little better by ONLY giving this new upgrade in heal spells to Paladins, allowing them to CH and play healer every now and then.  Reason being that they are already a cleric class, being part cleric I would have been able to understand Verants reasoning behind it.  It would have made the paladins (who have probs with groups also) a bit more desirable to others.<br>
<br>
Alright, I have rambled on long enough, maybe I need to send Rich Waters my idea on the new cleric spell and see what they can come up with.  Not that I would necessarily want them to use that, just would like to see them give clerics something to continue thier uniqueness and continue to make them desirable to all.<br>
<br>
Clerics are my best friends =)<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Bendi that is the reason I didn't let it bother me, there were to many discussions over what they would get, and when they would get it.  When SoL first came out it was stated that BL would get clarity at lvl 39, but that was the only one they would get.  After many discussions, and rumors, it wasn't worth worrying with much, because half of the things they discussed wouldn't ever go live.<br>

See I already see a problem here.  The mentality that you NEED Melee for damage is wrong, and if it is true, it shouldn't be.  There are a lot of other good choices for damage, many of which are and should be better then certain melee classes.<br>
<br>
What it should come down to is the player and how well they are equipped/prepared, not just level and class.<br>

I used myself as leading a raid as an example, so as not to point fingers at anyone, I also stated that &quot;I&quot; wouldn't be one that would use that, but there would be many people that did.  So the mentality of others is what alot of clerics worry about.  I can't say that I blame them one bit.  I wouldn't ever replace a cleric with a dru/sha, but there will be those people that believe that since a druid can CH and evac, he/she would be a better choice.

Yes i know that druid's have a hard time finding a group, but so do clerics, honestly we do.  Shaman have no troubles once they hit high enough to go to DL.  I like that they are trying to help the druids, but I dont like that they make other classes suffer, and not jsut clerics.  Now paladins too will feel like they are losing their edge, cause it seems that verant is trying ot give cleric's a similar job to a paladin.  One problem with this though, I haven't used a weapon since i was like lvl 15.  How well is that hammer really going to work for me, and is it 1hb or 2hb, cause i sure haven't used 2hb.  I agree we will still be needed for raids, but I honestly feel we won't be needed for groups at all, our job will be sitting at the zone shouting for a group, and gettiing 20 some tells for rezzes cause the druid's they thought could handle the heals, didn't quite do it well enough.  At least at the beginning while they are getting accustomed to their heal, but what happens a month or two down the line?  I think you will see alot of people putting their clerics on the shelves, i'm sure glad ive been working on my monk now. Also as far as raiding goes, I don't feel that dru/shm really need the upgrades of heals, chloroblast and torpor work jsut fine in a pinch, that's all their heals are supposed to do anyway.  They use their mana for slows and buffs and regens and whatnot, leave the healing for the cleric.<br>

<br>
What you're leaving out of that argument (and which most people leave out) is that if a druid can't find a group, they have the option to go solo for some decent exp.  The scenario goes like this:<br>
<br>
Druid_01 zones into a high traffic grouping zone and shouts &quot;XX level druid LFG.&quot;  After a couple of minutes, they'll give the shout again.  If there's still no answer, druid_01 says &quot;oh well, I'll just port to suchandsuch zone and quad soandso mobs for a while.&quot; Druid_01 can't find a group that night but STILL ends up with a good bit of exp when they decide to log off.<br>
<br>
And no, the cleric melee changes DO NOT in any form or fashion make up for what Verant is doing to the cleric class. Clerics ARE NOT a solo class, never have been...never will be...we don't want to be.  We are dependent on groups.  When all three priest classes become equal in healing for exp groups, why would anyone take a cleric (who can only heal really well) over a shaman or druid (who can heal pretty damn good AND provide any number of benefits to the group)?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Shaman have no troubles once they hit high enough to go to DL.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The shaman is an interesting class.  It has been my main choice since I started EverQuest in December of 2000.  I didn't really understand the class until I hit level 40 or so.  It was then that I could actually solo.  Prior to that, it was all grouping, which could sometimes be a pain to do.  Anyways, even though DL is crappy exp, I killed there until about level 50.  After that, since I was able to slow, buff, heal, AND dot/nuke all at the same time, I moved on.  Anyways, after moving from there, it is VERY hard to get a group, which pretty much forces you to solo.  I think it is a major misconception that a shaman can get a group easily.  The truth of the matter is that a level 60 shaman can get a group easily.  However, a 56 shaman, even with epic, JBB, horse, and ToV gear, still has an incredibly hard time finding a pickup group.  I think a lot of the problem is there not being enough mobs to kill.  That makes me resort to having to solo unless one of the monks I know are on that I can duo with somewhere like ME, HS, or Chardok.  The only thing I don't like about soloing is that it gets REALLY boring REALLY quick.  Killing the Hole or Chardok zone-ins for over an hour by yourself, especially with people coming through and killing your mobs to get farther down, becomes a large pain in the ass, especially when the mobs have a 15-20 minute respawn time.  Additionally, when I duo with a monk, I usually only have to spot heal them.  A large, 10 second cast heal would be completely pointless, seeing as they only loose ~1-2 bubs per kill, depending on the mob.  That right there is only 1-2 Chloroblasts, which is easy to gain back.  As for Torpor, when I get level 60, it just means we could take on mobs that hit harder, and I can med/cast while the heal is taking effect.<br>

<br>
I personally have never played a druid, so I don't know all that they are capable of.  However, I know that they get a 978 in 5.5 seconds heal, according to EqCaster, in addition to a 30 point heal over time which lasts for 3 minutes.  Also, their best single target DS is for 32 damage.  Comparing that to a cleric, they get Mark of Karn, a 6 point healing DS, and Mark of Retribution, a 15 point DS casted on the mob.  Add to that Divine Light for 880-910 in 4.5 seconds (again, according to EqCaster.)  So, druids end up doing more damage to a mob with their DSes in addition to having similar healing at level 60.<br>
<br>
That is what the whole problem is about with the change in the first place, right?  High end raiding positions?  So level 60 seems ok.  Add to that a 1150 nuke, right-click snare/DoT on their epic, and right-click DoT from Kunark/Velious armor, and that doesn't seem to bad.  Compare that to the best nuke clerics get, 925 damage with 7 second recast, and druids win.  Therefore, it seems like clerics should be the ones that should be getting something better with their heals.  Then again, I guess that's where CH comes in.<br>
<br>
As for shamen, Torpor seems to be plenty for us at level 60.  The only problem I have heard about it is not being able to cast it on someone outside of your group (for healing mages and clerics that are rodding themselves for mana for example.)<br>
<br>
In the end, I feel that this really shouldn't go live.  I think there is something that hasn't been thought of that should be taken into account.  If druids want something to do on high end raids, like Emperor Ssra, then find something that isn't being done and include them in doing that.  For example, why not give THEM aggro reduction spells, seeing as they are all in touch with nature.. I don't know, that seems somewhat of a stupid idea anyways.  Possibly some different buffs that stack with current ones, like some attack buffs.  Would nerf rangers somewhat, but would make them feel useful. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/udindawensangcarus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dindawen SangCarus</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#70DB93>(9/3/02 4:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=339.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: widespread beta testing</span><hr size=1> High end raid (boss mob) from a druid perspective.<br>

Druids 2-10 /agree and go back to soloing, pl-ing, and getting begged by everybody and their sister's cousin's brothers for ports, Sow, PLing, twinking, and foreplay....ermmm, forget that last one.<br>
<br>
Yes, this is a dramatization.  But as far as spells getting resisted...that's my experience.<br>
<br>
Yes, I am a druid.  No, you have never heard me bitch and moan when other classes got upgraded.  Yes, I want this spell.  Now, will everybody please go back to playing their preferred classes and QUIT BITCHING ABOUT DRUIDS!?!?<br>
<br>
That is all.  Wasn't that fun? <p><br><center><a href="http://www.unhomed.com">
