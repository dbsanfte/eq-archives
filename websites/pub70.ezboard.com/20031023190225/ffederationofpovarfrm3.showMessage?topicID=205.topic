I am posting about epics. I know everyone wants them and I know a lot of them are good upgrades. That is why I talked to Von about my current idea which I will be posting here.<br>
<br>
I will be hosting a weekly epic night. This will be for epic battles. All running around will be done on your own time. On the nights that nobody has an epic battle we will camp something for epics that is a rare drop, such as Jade reavers. I am sure there are other pieces like jade reaver it's just the only one that comes to mind for me right now.<br>
<br>
Before I continue I would like to say I am looking for a few others, maybe one from each guild, and preferably each of a different class. I also hope that there will be a variety on the time zone differences as well. I will be representing SoD. I will be bringing Sheff most of the time just because he is high enough to do well on the fights. I ask that each guild has a meeting to choose someone that is willing to be apart of the &quot;Commity&quot; and another to fill in on his/her spot if the person cannot make it to the fight that week.<br>
<br>
What the commity will do is decide on who's epic fight we will be doing that day. If the fights go by fast and successful we will be doing more than one each night. <br>
<br>
If you have a certian part of the epic you are stuck on (such as the jade reaver because you don't want to spend the 13k for it in the bazaar) You will contact one of the commity members and tell us of the part you are stuck on. The commity will get together some time that week, and decide who's epic fighting we will be doing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now about the day and time. I am thinking of Tuesday's starting at 8pm EST and continue to about 10pm PST. That gives each person in different time zones enough time to participate in the battles and such.<br>
<br>
The Epic Commity will have no effect on how the Federation is run and we will have no special say in anything the Federation is discussing. The only goal the commity will be focused on is getting the federation epic equipped.<br>
<br>
Please post your opinions about this. It's only an idea right now and a lot of it will most likely be changed. I would really like to see the epic commity put together so no one person decides it. When the guilds select the two people to represent them in the epic commity, we will decide the rules and such for saying who's turn for the epic help it is. Let me know what you think and if the other guilds decide its a good idea please choose the persons you would like on the commity.<br>

<br>
well, first off, you'd have to change the day of the week periodically or some people could never make it (i know i'm not the only person who works evenings).<br>
<br>
second, as far as whose epic we work on, we need to consider how much time we have available (i.e. do we have enough time to do a raid zone for someone's epic piece or do we only have time for an outdoor zone triggered fight?).<br>
of utmost consideration to me, though, are three things:<br>
 how close is this person to their epic AND<br>
 how long have they been working on it AND<br>
 whether the character in question is a main or an alt<br>
<br>
i'm sorry, but i don't care how close you are to your epic, if someone else has been waiting a very long time to get the next piece of their epic, i think they should get preference, or especially if the first two cases are true - if they're very close _and_ have been waiting a long time to finish it.  also, someone who's trying for their epic for their alt should take a back seat to someone else's main, _especially_ if their main has their epic already.<br>
yes, i'm being selfish here, cos this points in part to me, but i know von has also been waiting a long time (took him a year to get his reaver and then only cos he gave in, saved up money and bought it).<br>

ok, i'll calm down now... <p>heyokah Ishkandar Fireshackle (eesh KAHN dahr)<br>

What we should really do is get a poll going about who is:<br>
<br>
A)  Willing to commit the time needed to basically farm epic mobs<br>
B)  What time people can be on to help with it<br>
C)  Who needs what left for thier epic(s)<br>
D)  How long they have been waiting to do it<br>
<br>
Once we know all 4 of those, we could then begin to form a plan of attack.  A well balanced group or 2 will be key to making it all work smoothly and with success, but it should be doable.<br>

Like I said at this point I really just want to get the commity together to decide how and when everything will work. I do not believe that the person closest to finishing their epic should get priority over the person thats been stuck at a part longer than the person almost done. <br>
<br>
And I see that the days of the week and such will be needed to be changed weekly for all to get their epic. I'll take all suggestions that the fed might happen to have and take it up with the commity.<br>
<br>
When the commity gets together we will discuss the best way to do things, then post what we decided on for the fed to read and post their ideas on how to make it better.<br>
<br>
The current things that need to be discussed is:<br>
A) Changing the day weekly<br>
B) How to help the Europeans (sorry for bad spelling I havn't had to spell that word for quite a while hehe) get their epics<br>
C) Who will get priority over the rest for help on epic for the current week<br>
<br>
All this and more will be discussed on the first meeting of the commity. Again each person in the commity will have the same ammount of say as the next person. No one person will have more influence than another. So every guild chose a person you think will have the best intent for the federation.<br>
<br>
Please continue to post your concerns. They will be brought up and solved either now (if I can answer it by myself) or after the commity is established, if one is <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=barthalemewspellsinger>barthalemew spellsinger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/3/03 12:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An idea to help the federation get epics</span><hr size=1> only problem i have with this is that my epic fights left are random spawns ... i have no problem helping others but gorenair talendor/ragefire and trakanon are the last three fights in have for my epic.... none of which are easy or doable except as a spur of the moment pick up raid. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=313870"><img src="http://www.crewofdestiny.com/images/sigs/barthalemewsig2.jpg"> </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=crafoo>Crafoo</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/mutant-rotar/speed.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/3/03 1:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An idea to help the federation get epics</span><hr size=1> I think the rotation of which day we are holding the &quot;epic farming event&quot; is a good idea, since it will allow us to involve as many people as possible.  Prioritizing the fights might be a good idea as well.<br>
<br>
Barthalemew brought up a good point: not all classes epic quests have the same layout <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Some require extremely long, tedious, multi-group camps.  I think the monk epic falls into this category for instance (?)  Some epic quests are a series of triggered battles that must take place in sequence.  Some epic quests are a random collection of tedious rare drop camps (magi).<br>
<br>
I suggest we get some kind of loose list of what needs to be done, then cycle through the list.  If a mob is not up or a zone is already being raided we move onto the next.  In this way we can hopefully get something accomplished each time we meet.  It would be convienient to have the list published online somewhere.<br>
<br>
It would be good to have as many classes as possible represented by people who know the details of _atleast_ the epic quest for their class. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=560271">Crafoo : 56 Mage - The Stone Cutters</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

And my answer to that is...<br>
<br>
Most of the time I log onto sheff I do a World Track. That means I go to every zone that has a mob that FS enjoys to kill. When we start this I will be adding every random epic mob spawn to the list. When one is on my track I will announce it in the Federation chat. Every member that needs that kill and is ready for it will send a tell to a member of the commity. We then decide however it is who gets the drop that time around. These will be pickup raids and not interfere with the set epic raids. (this stuff might change but most likely not). <br>
<br>
And barth... isn't the trakanon kill spawned? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Crafoo... thos tedious rare drop camps, such as some of the magi epic drops and jade reaver for druid / rangers will be on the set dates where we just get together and camp those pieces until we arn't able to hold it anymore. All extra pieces will be held by someone of the council most likely for others that need it. If the piece is no drop but can be MQ'd one of us will loot it and let the fed know that we have the piece for MQ. Again that might change but it might not.<br>
<br>
Lions we won't just be doing it monday through friday. We will be doing it on weekends every once in a while too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Any other concerns or problems? Most everything is still based on what the commity decides is in best interest for the fed to get EVERYONE! epic'd. That's my goal. I know it will never happen because we see new faces in the fed all the time.

I have not started my epic, nor do I intend to do anything about it until Dyamond completes her last piece for her epic.  Dyamond has had Swiftwind for a year now, but hasn't been able to do the final part of her epic since TCoD was split.  It was mentioned that alts should take the back seat, but Dyamond is a little different.  She was originally my main and also former leader, but have taken a back seat while Sapphyrre leveled.  As Sapphyrre became more active, I decided to transfer leadership to her since it is my belief that the GL should be visible as much as possible.<br>
<br>
I am always willing to help others with any of my alts in any way I can to achieve their epic.  Just letting you know where Sapphyrre stands in her epic.  <p> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=270844"><img src="http://www.crewofdestiny.com/images/sigs/sapphyrresig.jpg"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ishkandar>ishkandar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 160<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/4/03 12:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.execpc.com/~danperry/pics/eq/tishk078b.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An idea to help the federation get epics</span><hr size=1> sapph, your case being as it is, i don't think anyone here would have a problem helping dya get her epic as readily as someone else's main.  the fact of the matter is, none of your characters have their epic, and your effort in that regard has gone to dyamond, even though you play sapphyrre more now.  i can't imagine people here not being understanding about it and willing to help.<br>

I've got them written down. When we get two members from each guild I'm going to try and set up a time for at least one member of each guild (hopefully both) will be able to get on to talk about and decide on the &quot;rules&quot; we are going to have for deciding and such on everything.<br>
<br>
I hope to get everything organized quickly so we can start very soon. I'm sure that the first few times... probably month's... will be trial and error things till we get the best possible way to decide things. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ishkandar>ishkandar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 161<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/8/03 10:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.execpc.com/~danperry/pics/eq/tishk078b.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: An idea to help the federation get epics</span><hr size=1> i'll probably drag murs into this as the song of the raven committee members.  to make this easier we might consider setting up an epic forum on the message board here for people to post where they are at in their epic and update things as necessary.<br>
