They are based on many raids I attended as a member, 5 minutes of raid leadership, and the strong urge to skip my normal work for half of an hour. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
The post focuses on the raid leadership, the &quot;normal&quot; raid members are almost not affected.<br>
<br>
Does this sound interesting? Possible to do? Or is it just too long to read at all? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
I realise that this sounds a lot like a huge overhead of &quot;rules&quot; and administration on a raid. But if you see the large picture, nothing really changes except that the raid leader receives a bit of help by another person.<br>
<br>
I'd be glad to try this out with one of the raid leaders I know best (Filastil, Gotrik) in a 4 group raid...<br>
<br>
Roles in a Raid<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
These are the roles in a raid which can be identified for purposes of discussion.<br>
<br>
- Raid leader<br>
- Group manager<br>
- Loot manager (not so important)<br>
- Group leaders<br>
- Members<br>
<br>
Raid leader, loot manager and group manager are the same person in most cases. This works good for small raids, but less good for larger ones. Let's look at how these can be separated.<br>
<br>
Tasks<br>
-----<br>
<br>
The raid leader has these tasks:<br>
<br>
- Ignore all tells from anybody except the group manager which have to do anything with group setup or anything that should go to the group manager. He may just reply &quot;ask XYZ&quot;.<br>
- Instruct the group manager with a *minimal* amount of constraints on how to set up the groups (as in: we need one puller group with puller/main tank/main cleric, but at the end of the fight we will need a cleric only group) or something like that. The less, the better.<br>
- He of course has to be at the front of the raid and instruct the puller what to do, set the general course of action, etc., normal raid leading business.<br>
- He needs to know the zone.<br>
- He should NOT bother about the exact group setup (except of the main group, which he is a part of, anyway). The group manager should provide him with a general idea on what kind of groups there are.<br>
- To sum it up, the raid leader needs to know most about the raid itself, i.e., the goals, the important mobs and places. He communicates only with the group manager, the puller, maybe the group leaders, and other special persons.<br>
<br>
The group manager has these tasks:<br>
<br>
- Communicate with the raid leader and the group leaders. For &quot;normal&quot; things, the group leaders don't have to tell anything to the raid leader.<br>
- Ignore all tells from everyone who is not a raid leader or group leader. This is important (except of course if a group leader goes LD). <br>
- Create a list of all people attending the raid, including class, level, and guild (in our case).<br>
- Create initial groups.<br>
- Modify groups based on people coming/leaving during the raid, or on special requests from the raid leader. Since this is his main task, he has enough time for it to react quickly even if the fights are heated.<br>
- Do &quot;gtg&quot; calls (and similar stuff): he calls out that he needs a gtg from all groups, and tracks the group leaders answering (maybe with a pencil on a piece of paper :-) ). He should also track LDs. If is responsible for telling the raid leader that it is not yet possible to move on from a place.<br>
- Forward vital information to all groups. E.g., after a wipeout where people a spread about different zones, he should make sure that the group leaders know what is going on.<br>
- Does *not* need to know the zone at all. He does not even have to attend the raid (though he should probably be in the same zone to see /shout and /ooc), but can just sit in a safe and spam-less place.<br>
- To sum it up, the group manager has to be best in communication; he should be a fast typer, be able to track his data on a piece of paper (or with many small pieces of paper, each of with holds the information for one raid member), and quickly set up good group settings. He should maybe not take part in the fighting.<br>
<br>
The loot manager has these tasks:<br>
<br>
- Instruct the group leaders on what to do when loot drops (e.g., only the group leader loots, etc.)<br>
- Gather/distribute loot.<br>
- Call out rolls.<br>
- Track the winners of the rolls, and make sure that they don't roll on the next item (if the raid leader wants this policy).<br>
<br>
The loot manager will normally be the same person as the raid leader or group manager, depending on who has more spare time, and whether the group manager is physically attending the raid.<br>
<br>
The group leaders have these tasks:<br>
<br>
- Communicate a lot with the group manager, concerning their group setup, e.g. information on someone going LD or having to leave, telling oom or gtg, or requesting an evacer in the group, etc.<br>
- Forward questions or comments from his group members to the group manager, loot manager or raid leader.<br>
- Make sure that things said on /shout or /ooc are understood by all group members (e.g., if a member is AFK when an important command is given, then the group leader should relay it later).<br>
- Make sure that his group members follow the general rules, like not using /shout.<br>
<br>
The group member have these tasks:<br>
<br>
- Don't use /shout.<br>
- Listen closely to his group leader and the raid leader. He does not have to know about the group or loot managers at all.<br>
<br>
Benefits<br>
--------<br>
<br>
The group manager obviously has the most &quot;work&quot; to do, and the least &quot;fun&quot; (=fighting), if he decides not to be part of the raid itself. Some persons may find this kind of work fun though. :-) He is the heart of the &quot;operation&quot; of the raid, but has no &quot;high level&quot; decisions to make.<br>
<br>
The raid leader still carries the responsibility for everything. He has much less &quot;typing work&amp;amp;quot; to do then if he would be alone, and can focus on what is right and wrong. He does not have to care about &quot;low level&quot; decisions.<br>
<br>
Person setup<br>
------------<br>
<br>
In small raids (say, at most 2 groups), raid leader, group manager and loot manager can be the same person. Medium or large raids (3-4 groups or more) could benefit from having a separate group manager. Whether to have a separate loot manager would depend mostly on the type of zone (i.e., makes no sense if there is a drop every 30 minutes, but makes sense if there is a drop every 5 minutes).<br>
<br>
Raid leader and group manager should form a good team; they should know each other for a while before trying to start a raid together.<br>
<br>
Importance<br>
----------<br>
<br>
The importance of the roles (in case of LDs):<br>
<br>
1. Group manager<br>
2. Raid leader<br>
3. Group leaders<br>
4. Everyone else<br>
<br>
IMO, if the group manager goes missing in a large raid, it can as well be canceled (or at least the whole preparation phase of the group manager has to be repeated by a new one). Compare this to your car(=raid) - if the motor transforms itself into a large bubbling mass of iron, then you better throw away the car then to replace the motor (provided that you got plenty of $$$ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). Even if you replace the motor, it will take a very long time, probably longer than to simply buy a new car.<br>
<br>
If the raid leader has to be replaced, he can rely on the groups being well-managed and well-balanced. The new leader just should know the zone. Compare this to your car - if YOU, as the driver, go unconscious inside your car, then everyone else can easily drive your car home, provided that he knows the way.<br>
<br>
Group leaders can be replaced with no problem at all. The group manager knows all members of the group, and can quickly instruct one of them to become the new group leader.<br>
<br>

<br>
I could imagine the following setup for the group manager: one piece of paper for each member; one stack of pieces for each group, and LD/AFK people are moved a bit aside from the stack. Simple, but very graspable for everyone, and can't crash or run slowly like your average Java programm. :-) <p><p>
