Another one is in the books.  Firstly I would like to thank everyone that showed up.  There is a huge ammount of effort involved in getting to ToVHot and we were mostly able to start on time.  I believe that we were in ToV by 7:15 and into HoT by 7:45.  Several people had gone to the extent of camping at the zone in the night before and I appretiate their effort.<br>
<br>
Another thing that went right was our replacements.  We had a huge rash of cancels, some at the last minute, but were able to field 5 groups despite this.  The only crippling blow was the loss of both monk pullers.  Thanks go to Markk for steping in at the last minute and pulling for just over an hour.<br>
<br>
Congratz go out to Blodiron for winning the roll on the only drop of the evening.  He recieved boots off of the second kill of the night.<br>
<br>
Things I Learned:<br>
From a practical point of view this raid was a failure.  Sorry guys im not gonna sugar coat it.  All that effort and we get one drop. BAH!<br>
<br>
From a learning point of view this raid made significant headway.  <br>
<br>
I learned that you must be dubious or better faction to go here.  Camo and invis wont help this because many of the ToV mobs see invis.  7 pm cst at the wl zoneline&gt;<br>
<br>
Secondly we NEED a monk puller.  Despite Aabaral's valiant effort we did not get any mobs.  I wont comment beyond that statement.<br>
<br>
Thirdly almost everything that Wulfe said in the warm up confirmed the things that I found at Illia's Everquest Bestiary.<br>
He went beyond this with personal experience that enabled us to go as far as we did.<br>
<br>
Fourthly:  EVERYONE NEEDS TO LISTEN AND BE ON TIME.  There was some confusion before hand both in getting people there and then in buffing people up.  Next time we will not buff untill we are in HoT itself.  I will assign the raid channel for the gathering and then as people join their groups they will leave the raid channel and use the raid function.  This will help simplify communication a facilitate transportation.<br>
<br>
There will be additions to this list when i get home from work and i will try to  expand on what happened.  Hehe i didnt forget anyone yet i just dont have the time.<br>

There is one thing that I'd like to add and that is if you signed up and you're there, you should stay.  If I left every raid that looked like it was going to more work than fun, I wouldn't have showed up to any of them.  That's IMO only and nobody else's.<br>

I had been looking forward to this.<br>
<br>
Ok - talking from thin air here since I have yet to do HoT, but: <br>
<br>
My understanding is that it IS <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>possible</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to get to HoT while being KoS. I believe if you search long enough, you'll find a few maps that tell you what path to use (you need to be all the way to one side, then all the way to the other side, harmony, etc., etc., etc.). Almost all raid leaders that do this raid regularly just toss their hands up in the air and put in the &quot;must not be KOS&quot; rule.<br>
<br>
I've never seen it discussed, but, from all the discussion of the hassles, I'm assuming that this is one of those places where CoTH doesn't work (if it does, then no problem really, eh?).<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to seeing the run down on what happened. I'm also working somewhat on leveling again. I have some raids to do in the next few days, but I've actally added 3 blue this week, which doesn't sound like much (especially to a bard, who should be able to solo that in less than an hour), but that's as much as I had done in the previous month. I'll be a LOT more valuable at 54 than at 53 due to previously mentioned AoE resist considerations.<br>
<br>
Hope you all had fun, even if you didn't get many drops. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=raaddar>Raaddar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#70DB93>(2/28/03 11:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=114.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Just get the faction</span><hr size=1> I dont know why someone would want to go to all the work or technicality of trying to sneak into HoT cuz of faction.  You need to have Ally to do any of the quests anyway so go spend 2 nights in Kael and get dubious or better.  Raids seem to have a hard enough time getting going and staying at a good pace without dealing with the faction issues and having to sneak people around.<br>
<br>
I got dubious in a single 4 hour session in the arena.  It is not difficult and there are some nice drops in the area too...Silvery Belt of Contention, Armor drops, prolly lots of things I havent see yet.<br>

<br>
1. ALL people should have resists over 100 UNBUFFED.  This will help to reduce damage taken by all the AE mobs and therefore save some mana from the healers.  With the BD's that now drop in the PoP zones, this should be a little less costly than before.<br>
<br>
2. Casters should always sit around the corner (not too close to the pit so as to avoid aggro) and step out when casting.  Again, this reduces the chance for damage.  When the mob gets close enough that casters take damage, switch to the other corner.<br>
<br>
3. Minimize AFK's.  I know that this isn't always possible, but we seemed to suffer an inordinate amount of AFK's last night which made it extremely difficult to get any semblance of a rhythm established.<br>
<br>
I know there are more things that I had in mind, but I just can't think of them atm.  Rough raid, Von, but kudos for initiating the whole thing.  They WILL get better and easier. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krainn2001>krainn2001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#70DB93>(2/28/03 2:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=114.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ToVHoT 27 feb</span><hr size=1> Von... sorry for logging on late... but had car trouble at school.

<br>
From a personal point of view I recognized how important the saves are now.  I have the SS bp now with some better saves and i purchased a pair of diamond rings which added to my saves.  This made a HUGE difference in the ammount of damage that I was taking.  I will be going into pop zones and looking for more/better resist gear. (where do all the bd drop Derko?  im calling another raid on that zone next! hehe)<br>
<br>
I agree also with the problem with the afk situation.  Guys I was there an HOUR AND A HALF before we went in and I had one afk and one log off/back on (sorry work paged and I have dial up).  If this was an 8 hour Fear raid I would understand more about afk's but it wasnt.  PLEASE get yourself set up before we zone in.  Dinner...pop...munchies...bathroom break...make out with the wife/husband/girl/boyfriend...feed the fish.... whatever please get it done before hand.<br>
<br>
As for the faction issue i agree with Raaddar.  SoD hosts a Kail faction night every wednesday so im going to throw the &quot;non kos&quot; deal in.  For the last couple weeks we have been able to get the bank but not had the forces to take an arena slot.  There are lots of named giants pulled  at the bank that deliver bigger faction hits.  Fildaar didnt go up to dubious or better with just one raid so you will need to attend several to get to this level or hit a nice 4 hour arena raid.  I got to ally in just over a week of hunting in Kael that included one nice stint in the arena (courtesy of MoS who raided there and allowed me to join them).<br>
<br>
One thing I would like to recognize is Wulfe's actions.  If you didnt know dragging bodies in HoT makes you DEAD.  The dragons take this action as a personal affront and will not hesitate to show their displeasure in a very physical way.  Wulfe did this not once but TWICE to get people to where Kilraa could rez them.  Between that and the guidance that he provided myself and the raid in general I am pleased to award him The Order of Defiant Souls.  This is the highest award that Souls of Defiance can bestow and Wulfe's actions during this raid are a credit to himself, his guild and the Federation.<br>
<br>
And while im on the matter of superb jobs done:  every healer in attendance is to be commended.  Up untill the wipe out i believe that we only had one death.  For HoT this is a very good record.  Every Evacker is also to be commended.  On an accidental aggro getting even half of the raid out was excellent work.  <br>
<br>
With that said guys I will let the matter rest.  I am sure that there are things that I have forgotten and I am just as confident that I will be reminded.  I will schedual another raid for this zone with better results from the things that I have learned from this one.<br>

The only faction problems I have are spousal faction. I'm Warmly to CoV, and I'm working on getting faction to Ally for those turnins. In this case, I was going to have to make special arrangements to be able to attend at what is 5PM my time. I thought I was fine, but then RL got him in the morning, and that made leaving work early impossible.<br>

Hopefully, all will be better next time. I've largely been out of the raid game for a few weeks, so I'm hoping that I'll be able to do a bit more again soon (I really, really want to get to Fear a few more times to try and get that Amy whip). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=derko>derko</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#70DB93>(3/1/03 1:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=114.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tc.umn.edu/~grae0019/skuleyes.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ToVHoT 27 feb</span><hr size=1> Von, we had a couple BD's drop in PoN at the stalker camp within a 2 hour period earlier this week.  (Maybe we were just extremely lucky.) I can't verify PoD, PoI, or PoJ (sure someone out there must know) BD drops as I haven't seen any, but I do know that PoN does drop them.<br>
<br>
Good luck with all the raids this week.  I'm off on vacation for the week.<br>

<br>
From my experience of HoT I would recommend these things.<br>
<br>
No people who are KoS are allowed unless you are going further in than the entrance area. If the door is opened when they are close to it or they cast a spell when close the corridor mobs will zip in and kill them and possibly many others in the raid. Remember you need to be ally to do the quests so why should the people who have worked their faction miss out to people who have not bothered and will take ages to get the faction to complete the quest.<br>
<br>
People should take the time before the raid to lookup their drops in there and decide what is an upgrade for them. Then they can decide ahead of the raid what is an upgrade for them and the rolls will be shorter and the kills faster.<br>
<br>
Resists are king. Remember 100 fire &amp; cold are the minimum required not the top goal. Seen clerics waste far too much mana healing one person in a group whose resists were obviously too low.<br>

<br>
Fildaar as a cleric you need to be getting at least one hit on each giant you kill in Kael, healing does not give you a faction hit. Don't know if you already know this but if not it may be why you're faction isn't improving.( a nuke or something will work fine)<br>
<br>
Getting faction isn't that hard, and can be very rewarding. in addition to the armor drops in kael there are some really nice drops as has already been mentioned, silvery belt of contention, Defiance, rune etched icewurm fang, mask of war, cloak of the maelstrom etc etc.<br>
<br>
I've been ally many times and trashed my faction killing CoV dragons and always manage to get back to ally so i know if you're willing to do it, it's really not that hard. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=331634"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.eq-darklegion.com/images/fensig2.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aarann>Aarann</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#70DB93>(3/1/03 7:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=114.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ToVHoT 27 feb</span><hr size=1> I would like to add one thing to this.  Yes I agree a Monk puller is HUGELY beneficial, but I also think I could have pulled this off for at least a few mobs.  My problem was not being able to get into a rhythm as far as getting back up the steps to the raid.  Had done it a couple times in the past and usually took me a couple of attempts to find the &quot;sweet spot&quot;.  :-)<br>
<br>
Not sure how to take the whole &quot; I won't comment beyond that statement&quot; but if I did something that I can improve on please let me know.<br>
<br>
With that being said if we find ourselves in that position again I would love to give it another shot.  I can do it.  I bet my life on it. Or Aab's anyway.  :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=garnetdragon@federationofpovar>garnetdragon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#70DB93>(3/1/03 11:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=114.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ToVHoT 27 feb</span><hr size=1> It was nothing you did bud.  Steel was having account problems (which have now been solved.....hmmm i wonder if verant is in any way connected with msn?) and the other is now outside of the Federation completely.<br>
If you would and as you have said you have pulled in hot in the past I would like you to pass on your wisdom and experience to whoever we sucker umm i mean ask to pull next time.  Hehe thats what I had planned for our main puller to do for Steel since it was his first time in hot.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for trying bud.<br>
