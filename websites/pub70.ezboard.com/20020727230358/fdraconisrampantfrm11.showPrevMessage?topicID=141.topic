The item will net you a +10Wis, +10 Mana book! For virtually free, it is well worth looking into to get.<br><br>Here is the walk through on attaining the book:<br><br>The quest starts in Qeynos, at Crow's Bar. You look for an Erudite called Moodoro. Give him 2 gold, and he will give you a sarcastic remark, and a container called Testament of Vaneer. Then, give him 4 gold, and he will give you a card. It will either be a king, knight, beggar or jester. Destroy any kings, knights, or beggars, as they are useless. When you finally get the jester card (may take a while), give it back to him. He will say, well, we expected it to take you longer, or something like that, and give you page 34 of the book, or Cinder Hornet Pollen. It doesn't matter, the end result is the same. Put it in the container, then run out of Qeynos, up Qeynos Hills, turn right on the trail marker to Highpass Hold, (which actually goes to West Karana), run across West Karana to North Karana, then across that to East Karana. In East Karana, run straight on the path from the bridge, and take the right fork. Keep running until you get to a mountainous area. At one point, you will notice a ramp pass going up on your right, or a possibility of continuing straight on the ground. Take the pass up, which zones into Highpass Hold. Run south, avoiding the gnoll and orc camps, to the inn in the middle west section of Highpass Hold. This is also known as Tiger's Roar. Walk<br>onto the dock, jump off, and swim straight and to the left. You will notice an underwater tunnel underneath a beam. Swim through, and you will find yourself in a hidden cave, with smugglers. Run up the cave, and go straight/left, not up the side. Keep running. You will arrive at a fairly large, open room. To the front and right should be an awning between an oven and a kiln, with a pottery wheel next to it (they provide things to keep you busy while you wait). Dyllene Starsine should spawn underneath the awning. When he does,<br>take a look around to make sure there are no smugglers there. Wait for them to walk away if there are, or harmony them if you're a druid. Kill him as fast as you can, snaring and rooting him if you can. Dont let him run too far from the awning, or the smugglers will see him and attack you. Back up against the wall while fighting to avoid his backstab. Once you kill him and loot him, do one of two things: Either gate, or run up to the right up the awning, up a ramp and jump off the cliff. You will only take about 50 damage, and if there are smugglers after you, the guards at the bottom will help you. Now, place page 30 of the book in the container (what you looted off Dyllin) and hit combine. Congratulations, you now have a +10 wisdom +10 mana book. <br><br>****Important****<br>Make sure that you only loot the page with the caster who is going to be getting the book, the page is no-drop, as well as the Testament Of Vaneer, meaning you cant do the quest with your highlevel warrior, get the book, and then throw it on your Druid, you have to get the page with your druid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Or Shaman <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Or Cleric<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Or Pally <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Or Ranger <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>But this item is a must have.

I do, however, know that shamans are made tough to take a beating.  They are there to keep everyone alive.  Part of this job is making sure to keep agro off pure casters.  Wizards can deal out the damage, but cannot take it, so the shaman can run in, take the hits and allow the wiz time to step back and root.  Same goes for all melee/caster hybrids.  They are made to be both.  Druids may not be as tough as shamans, but they are in no way pure caster.  Last time I checked, alot of the druid spells are combat spells, and druids solo quite well IMHO.<br><br>Llyr has every right to state that he prefers AC over wis, he is stating his preference, and this allows others to see the benefits of his POV.  I don't believe he should be critisised for stating this.  I too believe that AC is VERY important for a hybrid.  Wisdom comes in very handy when you have a couple of warriors to keep the nasties off, but what if the warriors take a dust nap?  Then who is there to keep the casters alive long enough to nuke the mob?  What if you spend all your time on wisdom building, then in the next fight, the mob agros on you, being something high on it's hate list, and you have no AC to stay alive long enough to cast spells?<br><br>All this arguing may be trying to get points across, but there is always two points to every story, both have reasons.  The other shouldn't be put down for having a different view.<br><br>If you want to buff your wisdom, then make sure you have a reliant tank to keep you alive.  AC DOES keep you alive, as I have learnt from many encounters with Aklor.  A dead druid/shaman is no use to anyone, no matter who much wisdom they have.  This is my POV, please do not critisise me, or anyone else for theirs.<br><br>Aklor<br><br>PS - I know from experience that shamans do take quite a beating. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bdraconisrampant.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=telefae>Telefae</A> at: 2/19/02 5:54:04 pm<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=146.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=146.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.threadControl?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=146.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=146.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub70.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="draconisrampantfrm2">The Dragon's Horde<option value="draconisrampantfrm4">Guild Events<option value="draconisrampantfrm7">The Dragon's Whisper<option value="draconisrampantfrm8">Msgs for Officers or Webmasters<option value="draconisrampantfrm9">Journals from the Battlefield<option value="draconisrampantfrm10">Hobbies of the Dragon<option value="draconisrampantfrm11">General Discussion<option value="draconisrampantfrm12">The Artifacts of Antiquity</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#B30000>- </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bdraconisrampant>Draconis Rampant</a><font color=#B30000> - </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11>General Discussion</a> <font color=#B30000> - </font><a href="http://www.draconisrampant.org/main.asp">Draconis Rampant</a><font color=#B30000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
