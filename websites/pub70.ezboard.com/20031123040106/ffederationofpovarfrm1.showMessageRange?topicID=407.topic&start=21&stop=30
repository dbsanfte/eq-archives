Anyway... as soon as my father see's my grades and i find a job (could really use some help if anyone knows anybody in Diamond Bar), i will be back on EQ and enjoying the raids as much as possible. I also enjoy playing D&amp;D but only seem to have time during the Summer to play with my mormon friends. (they cool... they make fun of themselves for being mormon). well... guess thats my life for now... untill i can get in the navy and build myself some KICK ARSE computers...<br>

I am a 22 yr old male from Indianapolis, Indiana.  My name is Justin Kaufman.  Currently attending Indiana University, Purdue university of Indianapolis.  Majoring in Criminal Justice with a minor in Socialogy.  I like moonlite walks on the beach, sand between my toes and in my buttcrack  ohh wait did I say that out loud?  Seriously Dont really like the beach except to play volleyball and look at all the lovely ladies, ohh and dont forget to get drunk.  <br>
<br>
I was active duty military in the US army.  Did one combat rotation to Kosovo when that went live early 2000.  Which is one of the reasons I have played eq since 99 and my main is only 45. I was in the 82nd airborne and currently have 23 logged jumps and 3 unlogged jumps.  I'll let you think why all my jumps aren't on record.  So, I lived in Fayetteville, NC for three years.  and went to myrtlle beach atelst 5 times a summer.<br>
<br>
I own a 1986 pontiac fiero 2m6.  I am also currently restoring a 1967 or 72 *cant remember* dodge dart swinger.  I just bought it recently and have done just a little engine work and have primed it.  All is original except for a modified intake hood and a fin. Hmm, what else.   lalala and the beat goes on I guess.  Well time for me to leave you with these slight and only a glimpse of the mind of this madman they call, Justin.<br>

Spent most of the last ten years travelling the rural backwaters of Africa so no chance of playing EQ there.<br>
Shared a house with Poonose a long time ago and he got me started on EQ when we I got back this year, told me it rocked.  Like always he was right.  We played too much traveller and AD&amp;D back then and too much EQ now. <br>
Try to always play honorably, I expect others to do the same. No KSing, no training mobs etc. <br>

Anyways, a little bit about me..<br>
<br>
I am a 17 year old student from Sunbury, Ohio.  It is somewhat of a quiet town, but is quickly growing.  I have lived around here since I was born, and am not sure if I would want to leave after I graduate from High School.  I enjoy computers and troubleshooting, as well as design, with the exception of software programming.  I actively troubleshoot computer, software, and network problems for my High School, and am enrolled in the Cisco Information Technology Academy at the Delaware JVS.  I currently am unemployed, and looking for a job, hopefully involving computer repair or consulting.  With 7 years of computer experience, I can only hope someone will accept a 17 year old as a consultant (lol.)  I find myself to be very opinionated, and try to find meaning in most everything.  Blame my logical reasoning I guess.  I also try to keep situations calm, and try to include some humor in most of my conversations.<br>
<br>
I like to play video games, such as EverQuest, Counter Strike, Diablo 2, and random console games.  I have recently started having LAN parties, and have even joined a local clan based on going to LAN parties in the region to compete for prizes, and to have fun.  I also occasionally play some D&amp;D with friends from my school, and have a level 6 human cleric (who blew up this town we went to.  Was quite interesting, lol.)<br>
<br>
PS.  As I have changed since I started playing EverQuest, learning life lessons from my actions, there are many things I regret doing, but please to not judge me based on these prior actions. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=56791" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://www.eq-darklegion.com/images/Oumsig4.gif"><BR><B>Oumlagar, 56 Luminary</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.eq-darklegion.com">Dark Legion</A> on Povar</B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/uredwjamz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>redwjamz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/21/02 9:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=407.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get to know your feddies!</span><hr size=1> I'm still waiting to see the post from the Hot supermodel'esque chick who has a secret thing for introverted anti-social, jobless, living at home with mom, mental condition, no life outside of eq guys.<br>

That would be me, unfortunately most of my time I spent gaming while my life took an aside, first it was atari 2600, then Nintendo, Genesis, SNES, then Street Figher 2(greatest arcade game ever), and on into the years where i shouldnt still be playing games with more Street Fighter, Tribes(best first person action game ever for PC), and now of course EQ.<br>
<br>
I'm 26 with a degree in CS that hasnt meant sh$t so far looking for a job in Hampton Roads area of VA.  Most of my work experience has been computer grunt work but I eventually would like to do something a little more lazy and less time pressure like programming or some kind of administration...I also play pool occasionally but admit I play EQ a TON and need to breakoff some and suffer in the real world more...Shout out to my boy Qinar who I've known the longest in EQworld, back when we were young rangers roaming around SK looking for the infamous Quillmane.<br>

<br>
I'm a 20 y/o junior at St. Mary's College of Maryland, nestled ever so eloquently alongside the St. mary's River, in St. mary's county etc.... I'm a Psychology major with no intention on going clinical post-undergrad school, but study it because it's interesting and helps it most situations involviong people (duh).I'm an avid ultimate frisbee ethusiast, thus a reason i can't make many weekend raids (traveling 4-6 hours away to play all weekend). Also, I'm the Music Director at my school radio station, which gives me the duty of gettting new music and running the station, so I know a little about music of all types. Along this line, I DJ on the side, mostly vinyl (hip-hop generally, but I like to sample). Otherwise, I'm a packrat and i collect virtually everything known to man (predominantly Pez dispensers (300+), Smurfs and peanuts memorabilia, etc). I think that's enough of a glimpse into the hectic, constantly doing something life that I have become attuned to, so see you guys sometime soon, hopefully.<br>

You probably seen my name somewhere, on these message boards if not in EQ. I play an enchanter by the name Aumnayan Deleti (gee, I hope I spelt that right), and have a not-very-active alt by the name Alinu Deleti. <br>
<br>
Outside of EQ, I am a graduate from Oregon Institute of Technology (which is what prompted a 3 month absence from Norath, but got me a BS in Software Engineering). Currently unemployed, or at least I will be this friday since my contract runs out, since I am no longer needed putting kids in carseats on the way to school (makes me glad I spend 40k on school). I am currently looking for work, playing EQ, and ditching both to spend time with my girlfriend. I enjoy outdoor sports, such as backpacking, camping, and snowboarding. I am promply able to do none at this time, of for the past couple years (except backpacking which I refuse to give up). That's about all there is to me. <br>

I like computer games in general as well as pen and paper stuff. I used to do maps and illustrations for Legend of the Five Rings and Deadlands before EQ sucked up all my spare time. Now I play either DnD or Vampire once a week and EQ way too often.<br>

I am a 19 year old sophmore at a Community College in southern Texas atm.  My major is Pre-Veterinary Medicine.  As for who I really am.  I'm a cynic and very opinionated.  I've had a couple run-ins with some of the other opinionated in the guild.  Mostly law students =p  But once you get to know me I'm a nice person.  That aside, what I generally do everyday is school, homework, play EQ and spend time with my boyfriend who is also an EQ player (he's why I play).  Other than that I don't do much else besides help around the house.  I used to be real big into singing but no longer am able to because of my scarred vocal chords and I'm very bitter about that =/  But that's how things go sometimes.  See ya all in game =)<br>
