Here are some quick notes.<br>
<br>
You can't decide on groups beforehand, BUT, you can decide who your group leader(s) are going to be. Decide on their responsibilites beforehand, and jot these down on your notepad (you do have your notepad and pen right by the computer, correct?) Group leaders should always repeat raid instructions to their groups in group chat, for instance, because redundancy is good. <br>
<br>
Decide on your puller beforehand, if you can. Preferably someone from your own guild both for improved communication and because you want to develop as much raid talent in your guild as possible. An experienced puller is a huge part of what makes a raid successful - but remember also that experienced pullers didn't start that way. <br>
<br>
For two or more chanters, divvy up responsibilities between them. Then the chanters should talk a lot about what is going on. Even if one is raid leader, always talk to the other chanters. One chanter should be specifically in charge of clarity on the named roles - healers, and slowers. This chanter might or might not be the same chanter in charge of other clarity, but he or she has these people as his/her first responsibility.<br>
<br>
If you have bard(s), always put one in the group with the main healer. If you have multiple rezzes to manage, the bard should always be one of the first rezzed. Then they can be a mana battery for the cleric.<br>
<br>
Write everything down. You won't remember it in the midst of twenty things happening at once. <br>
<br>
These are some of the things I learned. And the start of my list of stuff after thinking about it. Anything I've obviously missed, etc? What are your tips, advice, etc?<br>
<br>

When i am Raidleader in my group is the Puller, the Main Mezzer and the Main Cleric (till now Puller was always Main Tank if not i put him in my group too). These are the people i have to communicate by far the most thats why they are in my group. Other Group Leaders are people i know well normally for me Kulina and Filumtil for example i can talk with them very fast in German, or people who can lead raids themself they can solve lots of problems themself, like for example Gotrik but he is always in my group as puller or main Tank :-))<br>
<br>
About the third assist in the time you need a third assist in my experience you need a cmped out cleric or a CR Team :-))<br>
<br>
Another Useful thing i found is have split groups for example in PoG the Protectors cant be mezzed for the second that comes have a split group that fights the secong Protector while other groups kill first fast and than help with other Protector. Or in CoM I found it usuful when fighting Black Reavers to have one group killing adds on pull since no Enchanter can mezz 3 mobs for the fight through several Black Reavers and a Lord. <br>

<br>
<br>
Our pets are there to tank and protect our sorry AC arses. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Please don't ask us to kill our pets. That is our main asset.<br>
Nothing in Kedge runs, they fight to the death so no worries about a pet following a mob somewhere. It's CHARMED PETS that are very dangerous. They can get caught on bad pathing and bring the whole dungeon back with them. Charmers have inv ready or sit to med right where you are. Don't move or charmed pet may wander on a bad path.<br>
<br>
<br>
Main assist PLEASE make sure you have the mob targeted you want everyone on or you WILL get a pet running where it doesn't belong.<br>
<br>
<br>
Moving between floors: As mentioned else where in LoLF message board. You don't need to kill pet between floors. Just park your pet with guard (in last SAFE area you were in) and then summon pet to next camp spot. Remember to tell pet to guard you RIGHT AWAY or it will start heading back to old guard spot.<br>
<br>
<br>
We are good for Clerics in one way that I'm not sure how effective it can be. We can make and drop Modulation Rods by the Cleric for emergency mana or at least make sure they have one on them (lore item). There is a higher spell that makes a Mod Rod with three charges. (Can't wait to get that one <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Don't forget to ask us to damage shield the tanks. We have the best damage shield in the game. And at higher levels, we get group DS spell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Malaise line of spells: We have it, but I don't know how useful it really is...<br>
<br>
<br>
Enduring breath: WE HAVE WATERSTONES. They are fast casting EB and great in an emergency. They are also very useful in CR group because they require no component so make sure you have a Mage positioned for CR team. We also have levitation rings that require no component <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
We get CoTH at higher levels. (I don't have yet) I have seen some uses for it. One is to summon everyone right to Phinny ledge one by one to save time. Another is to summon someone in trouble pulling and it wipes agro too!!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
This could also be used to avoid bad pulls if the puller has nerves of steel to send the message to bail and wait for cast time to pull him/her out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
That's it for now. I'll post more info as I hunt more in KK. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Pets are NOT your AC in Groups, they are when soloing but not in Raids, Pets should not gain Agro they will die in seconds.<br>
They are simply DoTs the best in Game but by far the most dangerous, i have seen more than one Enchanter dieing since the Pet was fighting wrong mob. (when i am guildleader i normally allow them till i see that they attack wrong mob too often (too often is a low number of situations) <br>
About the target thing often targets have to be switched most of the time one pets is forgotten which can be deadly for example when pulling Phinny, first come seahorse Tank attacks it, than Phinny arrives target must be switched, Pet still on seahorse <br>
-&gt; cant be messed -&gt; completely heals Phinny 3 times.<br>
Dont get me wrong Pets are extremly useful but dont say you need them to defend yourself not in raids. And sometimes their disadvantage is bigger than their Advantage thats the times you are told to destroy them it will happen often and in some Raids you wont be allowed to summon them at all.<br>
<br>
About Mali line of spells mega useful at highend game not very in the fighting we do. Difference for Example on Trakanon without it Fire spells will be resisted most of time with it (level 60 version) at least level 60 people hit with fire and Ice Spells 90% of time for full.<br>
In Planes they are more than useful too should be cast on every mob. <br>

Our lack of secondary assist was the bigger problem.<br>
<br>
Semite, the lev 59 paladin we had pulling, brought back 3 horses and Phinny. If we coud have all gotten on Phinny, its possible we could have handle the situation - Ikipu was there to mezz the horses. BUT, everyone got tangled up between Phinny and the horses, so even with all the hacking and blasting being done on Phinny - well, the horses just complete healed him. You can't mezz what someone is attacking. And someone was attacking each horse I think. &lt;grins&gt; God knows I run into that just about every raid I go on. When it happens, I slow em and hope for the best, which just would not cut it in this situation.<br>
<br>
Hmm, that raises a good point. I need to be a lot stricter about staying on one target on these raids. Generally it doesn't matter that much - most raids are such overkill that you can use brawn to just overpower the mobs. For some targets in the higher game, that just won't work. And this Phinny wipeout is an example of that. <br>
