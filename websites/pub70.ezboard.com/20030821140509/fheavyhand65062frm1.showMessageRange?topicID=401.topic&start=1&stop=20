Neal from the war store says to rec games mini's warhammer <br>
<br>
Due to a flood of emails requesting verification I have decided to make the following statement: <br>
<br>
I did receive a call yesterday from a Games Workshop V.P. (ie. very official source). Below is the facts of the call as I saw them, at this time you are certainly free to draw your own conclusions. <br>
<br>
The call was a polite courtesy call to let me know in person that a letter was going out to all retailers describing a change in Games Workshop's 'Terms of Trade'. According to them, Games Workshop is disturbed by the infringement of copyrights on their intellectual property so rampant on the <br>
internet. Therefore to protect their IP GW will be closing the internet to all uses of their intellectual property except for a handful of permitted images. Also effective July 15th, no stores besides their own will be permitted to sell GW products on the internet. The caller was adamant that this has nothing to do with the discount levels. He gave me a number to <br>
call with further questions and said I had to decide to comply or that I had 90 days to liquidate my GW inventory. Others who received the call were informed of a GW buyout plan if they wanted to liquidate their inventory back to GW. <br>
<br>
I was rather shocked at the time and did not ask all of the questions I should have, accordingly I will be calling GW again today. Mail Order is 'permitted', tho I am not sure what that means. Does that mean I can take phone orders only? Can I list products for sale in a simple sentence format? Are all shopping carts now unacceptable or just ones with pictures <br>
and GW sales copy? <br>
<br>
I am leaving my own conclusions out of this for a moment but I will say this. It is my opinion that if permitted this will affect every one of the manufacturers in our industry. Wiz Kids has often crusaded against internet discounting, WOTC has railed against it as well. If GW closes down the internet channel, I believe that every manufacturer in this industry will be <br>
pressured to do as GW has done or they will be seen by independent stores as 'unsupportive of the hobby'. <br>
This decision also seems to be entirely without legal precedent, and has far reaching implications FOR EVERY BUSINESS SELLING EVERY PRODUCT ON THE NET. <br>
Can a company shut down a legitimate mode of commerce in the United States? <br>
This decision is far bigger than the Wargaming Hobby, it has serious ramifications. <br>
I will be talking to GW today to get further details on exactly how they want this to work. Rest assured we are very concerned with the situation and will post more details as they come available. <br>
Thank you very much for your kind support. <br>

<br>
I think that this is a great move on the part of GW.  It will save places from Gallops from the undercutters in the biz.  As Farwinkle pointed out to me earlier today, it will also get the army guys, when they return, to buy from the shops and not off of the net.  <br>
<br>
What do you guys think?  Good move or bad for ole' GW?<br>
<br>
I am glad that the internet stores are going the way of the dodo bird. <p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br>

<br>
Good because it helps stores like Gallop's, and cuts down on the internet sales sites that really only exist as a store on paper from selling at just above cost.  There is a reason that WoTC and WizKids are also doing this, its because these actions hurt the business and hobby overall.  GW is in the business to make money, and one way of doing that is by expanding the hobby, which involves game communities and physical stores.<br>
<br>
It's bad because they are doing this just on the heels of price hike in a shaky consumer economy.  Everyone is complaining about the high prices of GW products compared to other companies, this is only going to make GW seem like the RIAA of the miniature company to the eyes of many customers. <br>
<br>
Two message boards I've already looked at today have been split between the good part I described above or a 'down with GW' spirit.  <br>
<br>
They could have planned this better, I don't really question their pricing on models as much as I do on their printed books that are rules / fluff compendiums from WD.<br>

Good luck trying to stop any sort of online reselling, cause its not gonna happen. Look you can't beat just going to the local store and buying something that you can actually take a look at and examine. The real stores have a huge advantage over the online people for that, but gaming is a hobby targeted at folks of a younger generation who are primarily integrated to the internet. There are some bargain bin hunter who try to hunt down all the possible cheap spots on the net like me. Problem is, it takes months to get a good system down when you have no idea. You just can do a google search and get the best deals rite off. After a while you just get sick of it. And you don't know how shady the people are. If anything this is a bad move on their part, why do they care what resellers are selling their stuff all they care if shipments are being placed and being sold. I dont see where their bottom line is being cut at all. If anything it just shows that GW is flailing in finiancial waters just like everyone else, and try to do a last gasp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ehron>Ehron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatard of Death</span><br>  Posts: 755<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(4/16/03 3:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=401.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.heavyhand.org/images/shanesdiploma.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: GW Internet Sales is dead in 3.... 2...</span><hr size=1> Yea, if the people on the net wanna make less profiet...why does GW care?  /shrug...Do they really love their official vendors enough to try to preserve them?  hahaha, I doubt it, unless there is something in it for them.

<br>
GW does indeed care enough about the independant retailers to do this.  It's at the independant retailer where people see the games played or play a demo, decide to play themselves, and start buying.  GW actually has their head screwed on right in this regard - to such a degree that they deliberately don't put a lot of playing area in their own stores and operate those stores at a loss each year.  They want people to learn to play, and to learn about the game, but they don't want to compete with Rogue Trader stores in the area.  If we wanted (and since I just thought of it, we freaking should) I'm sure Gallops could ask the new GW store up in Atlanta to advertise all our leagues for us.<br>
<br>
If taking 5 books down off Gallops' online store is the price to be paid to end competition from online discounters, so be it.  Oh, and never underestimate GW's ferocity in litigating IP infringments...all of the discounters are based in the US, so GW can find them easily and cancel their direct purchases - at the very least.  They've also already told Alliance to expect a shitlist of online vendors that Alliance will have to stop selling GW product to or lose their GW contract altogether.<br>
<br>
My vote?  Good thing.  Brick and Mortar is where it's at for this hobby, and a vendor who offers 40% discounts without providing any gaming or socializing location at all only injures the various hobbies. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#DC143C;font-size:small;">Bungabunga &lt;Heavy Hand&gt;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->53 Troll Beastlord<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->&quot;Have Gator, will travel.&quot;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

Yeh, whatever.<br>
<br>
If you read between the lines, only stores that don't have a physical location are will be affected. Thus, gallops can continue to sell even at a discount if they want since it will all go through a Rogue Trader store.  <br>
<br>
GW can and does determine who sells what of thier product.  We are not talking about resale of painted or already played with material on ebay.  Just the discounters who are killing the independants. <p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br>

Even if there are still a <u>few</u> tiny EQ auctions slipping through, you'd never be able to hide enough GW auctions to keep a discounter in business.  And, it all comes down to the fact that GW is writing a list of people to whom they won't allow their product to get to in the first place.  If GW doesn't let stuff get from the factory to you, then you can't put the stuff on the internet.

<br>
GW can mandate the manner in which you sell.  For what I hear, they mandate how much of a percentage they can reduce sales and how much/often you may discound for special sales.<br>
<br>
Calistra - dont be dumb about the EQ/Ebay thing.  They crushed the selling of characters in one gigantic move.  Yes, I know you can still organize a trade, but nothing like it was.  Verant killed a whole part of the game, and I think that EQ has never looked back since then as far as subscribers go. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This will not affect second hand sale or trading of models online, if you read between the lines.  That doesn't bother GW at all, it is people that they have contracts with that they can determine what/how/where they sell their product.   <p>---------------------------------------------------------------<br>

I own The Gamer's Realm in NJ, and I spoke with someone high up in GW earlier regarding this.<br>
<br>
This is an IP issue for them. What that means to them is that without specific written permission to use their IP's, i.e. marketting, advertisements, etc., we are not allowed to sell GW products on the Internet.<br>
<br>
While this does include E-Bay Auction Stores and the like (half.com. Amazon affiliates, etc.) it does not preclude individuals from selling thir personal products online. However, as many of us know, many stores do sell via auction on E-Bay and other auction sites. If they can prove that these are stores &amp; businesses, rather than individual persons, then they will ask to cease and desist. It is not that hard to prove, either.<br>

Also chatting with the guys at thewarstore, they will still be able to see, but only with phone calls  and faxes (after you set up an account with them), but no internet sales.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.thewarstore.com/acatalog/info_INQ1.html" target="top">This</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is one of thier old links.  An obivious use of the IP to sell thier product.  This is not showing hte cover of a book or a box, but painted models by the 'Eavy Metal team.<br>
<br>
The more i think about it and listen to intellegent people, the more this sounds like an IP debate not a &quot;we will stop selling on the internet&quot; debate.  <br>
<br>
Still it doesn't matter to most of us.  When I was on the island, I stil bought all my stuff from Gallops over EQ chat. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Here on this still crappy (but larger) island, I am getting my stuff from GW just because shipping will kill me.  <br>
<br>
However, I think it is a good conversation topic of us since it will affect the hobby in some way.  Probably to get more of the army dudes to come to gallops or call Ted to set up an order.<br>
<br>
One day Calistra, I will get you to admitt that you are wrong about something.
