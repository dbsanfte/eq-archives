<br>
We can thank FoH for bitching about monks and making a big stink.  There laughing right now on the effect they had.<br>
<br>
The only unbalancing thing about monks were those in Ntov gear and especially Vex Thal gear.  And what percentage of the monk population is that?<br>
<br>
Lets look at flayed barbarian skin leggings - they drop off the AoW<br>
<br>
ac60 +100 hp and plus stats<br>
<br>
AC60 for monk legs? OMG and yes almost EVERY item in vex thal and Ntov is +100 hp.  No damm wonder monks are tanking so good that have that equipment.<br>
<br>
SO we all get screwed for the performance of the top 1% of the monk population.<br>
<br>
So have fun monks pulling high end mobs now your gonna be taking an extra 5-10% damage.  We monks that were not uber died enough doing tough zones.  Now we get screwed and you guys are saying the changes are good?  Why dont you pull HoT then, fuckit ill stay in the rear with the gear.<br>

Verant will NOT be nerfing damage avoidance for monks.  It'll stay the same as it always has been.  They /will/ be nerfing damage mitigation (ie reduction) for monks.<br>
<br>
Guess what effect this'll have on pulling:<br>
<br>
ZERO.<br>
<br>
Here's the explanation (and in case anyone questions my abilities in regards to playing a high-end monk, been there, done that):<br>
<br>
Pulling mobs typically does not involve long, drawn-out combat.  It typically involves taking a few hits on the initial tag (depending on the mob), and dragging back to a camp.  In this instance,damage avoidance is the preferred ability.  You'd rather take less total hits than less damage per hit.<br>
<br>
Tanking a mob, however, generally benefits from damage mitigation/reduction.  Why?  Because over a long, drawn out battle, the numbers play favorites with those taking less damage per hit than avoiding a hit every once in a while.  In this instance, plate/chain classes should be gaining the benefit due to higher mitigation.<br>
<br>
Monks should never have been given a high level ability of damage mitigation.  That wasn't the original intent, and Verant is finally fixing it.  Plate classes are designed to absorb blows, monks are designed to avoid blows.<br>
<br>
What all will this change?  You'll better believe it won't effect all that much.  Sure, you'll remove those strange xp groups that involve a monk main tanking.  *shrug*  Heck, you can still do that, but you might see a bit more healing required.  It's /not/ going to change the raid scenario.<br>
<br>
I'd type more, but this stupid keyboard isn't working well.<br>

<br>
At 57 unbuffed I have 989AAC and 2006 HP's.  They reduce the effectiveness of our AC so we get harder when we get hit and I am gonna become a mana-sponge for any healer in my group.  Even with my avoidance skills maxed I get hit a lot and when I am going to be hit now I am going to be hit for a LOT. <br>
<br>
Maybe the Ubers are laughing at the rest of the 99.9% monks that don't have access to the same gear they do.  Monks are not blowing these changes out or proportion.  This effects everyone and not just monks.  I don't know many monks that can be a main tank on any mob whether it is an xp group or a named raid mob.  I know I have trouble soloing spiders in velks, not sure I could solo without buffs..and I know I couldn't tank frogs in Seb either. <br>
<br>
I know my gear isn't great but I am sure there are a hell of lot more monks out there like me than there are that the change is targetted at. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Over the last day, we've received a great deal of feedback and concern over the proposed Slay Undead change. We've put a lot of thought into the issue, and decided to hold off making any changes to Slay Undead for the foreseeable future. <br>
<br>
Slay Undead will continue to work in exactly the same way, and deal the same damage it does on live servers currently, and remain at that balance through level 65. Damage caused by Slay Undead won't increase post-60, though Paladin melee damage in general will continue to rise as you level up. There will be no defense penalty imposed while using this skill. <br>
<br>
We'd like to apologize for any undue frustration this has caused you, and we appreciate the feedback that was sent in. This change was well-intentioned, but we realized we were focusing too much on the potential of the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> top 5%</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of Paladins, and while the solution was reasonable for that sub-group, it wasn't appropriate to apply across the board. <br>

I am not sure if it is common practice as it may become very costly to do each pull, but I would think it would help to Rune, Bedlam, and Celest the monk before each pull.  Every little bit helps I am sure, and places like ToV are difficult to pull ANYWAYS.  It seems like Verant is on a kick where everything that gives an edge is expensive as hell (Giant's Bane and Dragon's Bane spells costing 2 peridots per cast as an example) so we might consider keeping raid costs in mind and accounting for used resources on the raid so that we can take advantage of these strategies.<br>
<br>
Just an idea, I know there must be more ways to maximize the chances the puller will make it back alive. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/utanadinfc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tanadin FC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/21/02 9:27:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=392.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Caster realm patch announcement</span><hr size=1> The changes to the monks don't change much for the top percentage of them, when you have 1500-1800 AC even a halfling can tank &lt;cough&gt;,  but my brother has a 57 monk, about 1200 AC on him and its not top anything, its his twink and is in gear for his lvl but can get alot better.  before the patch he was pulling for a group with a 60 Warrior and a 60 SK, the clerics had him stop FDing off Agro cause it took less mana to heal him then the other 2.

<br>
The nerf to Mod Rods however, made Mana Burn completely useless in 99% of all encounters.<br>
<br>
Without the ability to quickly regain mana, the only use for Mana Burn is a single mob encounter where the mob has relatively low HPs but needs to go down FAST.  There are not many encounters where the damage done by Mana Burn is justified by the loss of the Wizard's entire mana pool.  The only one I can think of off the top of my head is Venril Sathir.  For all of the other mobs I can think of, the average damage of 8k done by Mana Burn is too insignificant to blow your entire mana pool to achieve.  By using regular Lure spells and doing fewer DPS, the Wizard can do far more total damage with their mana over time.<br>
<br>
However, there is an AA ability called Harvest of Druzil, if this returns a substantial amount of Mana to the Wizard, Mana Burn may be worth using afterall, since the Wizard can regain mana for regular nuking after losing their pool to the Burn by using this skill.  We'll see... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ufalkkordragon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falkkor Dragon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/22/02 8:53:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=392.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Caster realm patch announcement</span><hr size=1> 1cp about unlisted BST Nerf aswell<br>

However, the lvl 60 seems to be up a bit and the pets after the 49 pet are more effective. It appears after talking to to lotsa BST and reading parses that they smoothed it out a bit.<br>

So Beastlords under the 49 pet like the changes, Beaslords with the pet after 49 and up like him lol. The changes suck for me atm. (REALLY hard time solo atm) But they were to improve the later pets so All is good for me =) <p><h>
