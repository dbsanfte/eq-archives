Last Update: 31 Oct 02<br>
<br>
The Tao of Tanking or How I MA on Raids<br>
Choosing an MA (Main Assist)<br>
First off, the main point to having an MA is to make the best use of clerical mana. (I’m going to assume you understand the value in all hands being on one target while its buddies are mezzed. If you don’t, and have grouped with an enchanter level 16 or higher, stop reading, cancel your EQ account, and go play Warcraft. It won’t make your brain hurt as much.) <br>
With Complete Heals being waaaaaay more efficient than any other type of heal, a group or raid will be able to move quicker through a given situation if the cleric is able to continuously Complete Heal a single target. If the cleric has to toss in smaller touch up heals here and there, the mana pool dwindles significantly quicker and the group finds itself sitting on its butt waiting while the cleric meds. So, MA’s are good things. The factors in choosing the MA are <br>
Most HP – Complete heals are more efficient when they can heal more hp’s. Completes level out a 7000 hp, but haven’t gotten to the point where this is an issue. Yet. <br>
Highest AC – Complete heals are less necessary when taking less damage <br>
Ability to hold aggro – If you can’t keep the mob on you, then there’s not much point to MA’ing. I’ll get into this in more detail below. <br>
Note that if you’re at the level where you aren’t playing with Complete Heal clerics, then it doesn’t matter that much if there is a single MA for the purpose of healing. It is a good idea to have one person choosing targets for so that your CC (Crowd control) can deal with any others. <br>
<br>
Run through<br>
For those who may not be aware of it, let’s run through a typical situation on a raid. Assuming you’ve got someone pulling. Puller comes running back with a pile of friends. If the size of the pile is acceptable, the MA tags something and announces that he’s building aggro on the mob targeted. (See below for some comments on target selecting and tagging). Mob chugs over, his buddies are mezzed. MA builds a bit of aggro, and then makes a general attack call to the raid. Everyone /assists the MA (thus the term Main Assist) and hops on. MA furiously whaps on target, taunting his butt off in a desperate attempt to hold the mob on him. Once the first one goes down, announces with the building aggro message, taunts up, breaks mez, the and announces again. Rinse and repeat. That’s the pretty much standard way of doing things. There are different ways of running things, some of which are a downright hoot, but this is the way it generally goes. <br>
Target selection<br>
There are a couple of aspects to this. <br>
<br>
Working with your puller<br>
The puller comes back with a group of mobs and flops (Feigns Death – Monks, Necros and Shadowknights can all Feign Death, making any mob who is chasing it think they’re dead and wander off back to its spawn point) out of aggro range of the main raid body. Do you tag it and bring them to the raid for ‘processing’ or not? How good are the enchanters? How much combat power do we have? Usually a ‘safe’ number is quickly apparent. This is where communication with the puller is important. He’ll usually say to tag when he thinks its safe to do so and if he’s any good, he’s the one who knows best. So be ready. Its really frustrating for pullers to have spent 10 minutes on a really beautiful feign death split only to have the MA ruin it all by having his thumb up his ass when its time to tag. If you’re playing with a puller you know well, then maybe you know that you tag automatically when he flops unless he says something like “AHHHHHH!!! DEATHROT KNIGHT, 4 SPITE GOLEMS AND A DOZEN OTHERS!!! FOR THE LOVE OF MY SLIMY MOTHER, DON’T TAG OR WE’RE ALL GONNA DIE SCREAMING”. Whatever the method, get it straight with the puller what it’s going to be. Too cautious and the raid doesn’t move thru the situation quickly enough and folks get bored. Not cautious enough, and you find yourself sitting at your bind point wishing they’d fix /gems and wondering how hard its going to be to get your gear back.<br>
If your puller isn’t an FD (Feign Death) puller, you don’t have the option of making this choice. You gotta take what he brings. Or the puller has to eat a death somewhere cold and lonely to pay for their ambitious pull. Also known as RD (Real death) pulling. <br>
<br>
The puller, and to a lesser extent, the MA control the pace of the raid. If the two of you really get in tune, you can just handle this yourselves. All the raid leader has to do is say “Clear towards wherever”. <br>
<br>
The puller is often more concerned with the 8 things beating on him than watching raid readiness messages, so a useful role for the MA to play is to make sure the puller is aware of things they need to know. Like the fact there’s no heals available or there’s been a local pop, for example.<br>
<br>
<br>
Working through the mezzed bunch<br>
Ok, so you’ve tagged, your enchanters have locked down the others (God bless ‘em) and you’ve just polished off candidate number one. Now what? Well, you’ve got to move to the next mob, and taunt him to make him hate you and not the enchanter who just made said sit and drool while you killed his cousin Jethro. The standard is 3 taunts will cancel the mez aggro. This does vary depending on the mob and zone, but in a tight situation, go with 3. If it’s the last one and the cleric has a bit of mana left to prop the enchanter up if you’re wrong, then maybe try 2 to see what happens, but 3 is safe. It’s very rare that I’ve seen 3 taunts not work in transferring aggro to the taunter, unless someone debuffs while you’re taunting. (Meaning if you taunt 3 times and it still goes for someone, then its their own damn fault for throwing in some debuff while you were taunting away. If they like what little brains they have in their head and not on the wall, they’ll do this while the thing is mezzed and before you start taunting.) <br>
This is where a good MA can make things move quickly. As soon as the first mob drops, you get on the next target and start taunting. Its surprising how much even a few second delay in getting on target and pressing the taunt button can slow things down. Make it even quicker by holding your taunt when the previous mob gets low so that it has refreshed when you get to the next one. As soon as you have your target selected, hit your “I’m taunting %t &gt;&gt;. Hold on a second” key so that others can move into position and the CC department top up mez’s as required on and generally feel satisfied with his napping buddies. <br>
<br>
Last thing here is to make sure you get on the correct next mob. Basically, you take the toughest first, with the following exceptions: <br>
<br>
Enchanters can suck the brains out of (mana drain) caster mobs. This is sometimes a crucial thing in a busy situation. Having your CC’ers call ‘OOM’ is as sure-fire way to an hasty evac (best case) or early grave (worst case) as I know of. So, go against your natural inclination to smack down the thing that ice cometted you before it got locked down, and clear the melee’s first. (The melees are the ones with things like “Knight” or ‘Warrior” over their heads. Casters have things like ‘Sage’ or ‘Shaman’ or ‘Anti-social Misanthropic Punk in a Funny Hat with the ability to Ruin you with Magic’ over theirs. Melees also arrive sooner at fights because they don’t stop to nuke or otherwise mess up your day) Sometimes your lead enchanter will point out the one they’d like to see attacked next. Sort this out like you did the tag thing with the puller. <br>
Another factor to consider is un-snareable mobs. When mobs get below a certain point, they turn and run. If they can’t be snared or their movement rate somehow reduced, this can be bad as they go barrelling off looking for friends and regenerating health, both at disturbing speed. The ray of daylight is that many mobs won’t run unless they are the last one standing. So if you have the choice between one of these and one of his friends who IS snareable, do the un-snareable one first. <br>
A handy way of getting on target is the judicious use of the Target Nearest hotkey. This defaults to F8. I have it remapped to E. Move next to your chosen target, and tap the key. CHECK that the right one is targeted, as this doesn’t work as one would expect sometimes, and announce your target. This is from a guy who uses his keyboard to move, so selecting with the mouse may be quicker for you mouse-lookers. Either way, make sure you’re on the right target. Be careful with this. If you have it too handy, accidentally tap it during a fight and target another mob, your enchanter is likely going to get dirt napped. I don’t need to say this, because you aren’t a Warcraft player and know about /assisting but I’ll say it anyway: Break a mez at the wrong time and you can wipe out an entire raid. <br>
<br>
Switching targets<br>
Sometimes you have to change targets. Usually, something adds to the combat that the CC crew can’t handle and is just too plain boogly to push off into a tank mez. For this express and relatively rare purpose, you have to have a hot key made screaming in big caps that you’re SWITCHING TARGETS!!!! WILL ANNOUNCE NEW TARGET!!! When people get this they have to stop attacking so that the CC crew get sort out your old mob. You have to get on target ASA-frickkin’P and get contestant number two onto you before he kills all your conveniently un armoured and probably sitting casters. Once he’s on you, call the general target call and all hands pile in. Don’t do this switch lightly as it’s a fairly complicated thing for a raid to actually pull off. You have to trust in your crowd control. Odds are you’re screwed eventually if they suck. <br>
Position, position, position<br>
The combat should revolve around the MA. This means that its up to you to make sure the fight happens where it should. The ideal setup for a fight is to have the MA whappin away with the mob facing him. EVERYBODY else is attacking the rear of the mob. A couple of reasons<br>
<br>
Fights move over time – Bunch of folks whaling on something moves the mob. Better to be able to tell where this is going to be and deal with it. Sometimes this is a bad direction, and you have to alter it by moving. More on that below. <br>
More damage – Everyone will do more damage when attacking from behind. <br>
Special attacks – Most importantly, higher-level mobs will ENRAGE, RAMPAGE and other bad bad things. These effects don’t affect you unless you’re in front of the Mob. For example, ENRAGE is where it ripostes every attack directed from it in front. If you have an epic ranger, hasted to the gills who misses the message, they’ll be dead before the cleric can hit the heal key. Now, you may say, “Charles Darwin was a genius” or “Har dee Har, silly ranger died. Again” or other serves them right kind of thoughts, but those root munchers dish out a PILE of damage. Write this on the back of your hand so you don’t forget it: More Damage Good. Besides, if they’re dead or dying you can’t bum food or arrows off them and it distracts the healer from healing you. <br>
Getting people to do this is sometimes like herding cats. It drives raid leaders postal. Do what you can to help it out. Ok, so you’ve got everyone in proper position. It’s now up to you to steer the mob. He’ll be beaten towards you, so you have to keep moving back a bit at a time. Damned inconvenient when there’s a cliff behind you. Or a pool of lava. Or 92 other mobs just out of aggro range. So what do you do? You steer the fight by either backing yourself in a slow circle over time, and hoping that everyone is on the ball enough to maintain relative position. Or you shout in raid channel “HEADING BACK THEOTHER WAY. SPINNING HIM AROUND”, and swap sides. This is a tricky manoeuvre, as ideally you want to do it without losing sight of your target. (Have seen the situation where missing ONE attack allowed the mob to turn on someone else, usually your medding cleric) For a key clawer like myself I sidestep one way, turn back the other, and move my way around the mob. If you’re a mouse looker, you can do it much quicker by turning with the mouse while you sidestep with the keyboard. I prefer the first way, as it gives people a chance to move with you, but the other is also pretty slick. <br>
In my experience, having a raid force disciplined enough to follow on your moves is something very rare. I imagine it will get more common as the guild gets more and more into Special attack mobs and it becomes more obvious that not doing this will get people killed and raids wiped out. Have had it work well in-group situations where position is tricky. (Climbing up the ramps in City of Mist, for example) <br>
<br>
Another side note to positioning mobs is to keep pets in mind. Pets are stupid when it comes to where they sit. Its also a crying shame to see a mage backstab pet attacking from in front. It means you have to position the mob so that the pet is behind it. Not as important as avoiding falling off a cliff, and quite a challenge to arrange on a 5 group raid, but it is a nice little added touch that makes the mage happy. (They’re all pissed off over the mod rod thing. Be nice to them. Plus remember the More Damage Good rule.) <br>
<br>
It’s all about the Aggro.<br>
All of these things are lovely ideas. And all are totally useless, if you can’t keep mobs beating on you. And that is all about the amount of aggro you can generate. <br>
This IS a team effort. No matter how tough a tank you think you are, a similar levelled rogue will ALWAYS out aggro you when he feels like it. Rangers and monks at higher levels are utter savages. And forget about it if a wizard a few levels higher than you decides to get medieval on the poor mob’s ass. <br>
<br>
So… what’s the point? All these folks can out aggro most MA’s… what have you been rambling on about all this time, Didiaquarr? <br>
<br>
The simple fact of the matter is that unless all these folks are total morons (In which case, they should go play Warcraft) they’re quite happy to leave the aggro on you. So they don’t get al medieval on mobs. They cast jolt spells or flop every now and again when they getting too many hits. They hide and evade in order to avoid hits. That’s their part. Your part is to generate as much ever loving aggro as you can so that they don’t have to. (More Damage Good, remember?). To do this: <br>
<br>
<br>
Get Fast Weapons in BOTH hands <br>
Others have different opinions on this. They tell you that you put as fast as you can in your primary hand, and then as good ratio in your offhand, without considering speed. I don’t know what to say. They’re just plain wrong. (Yeah, that’s arrogant. I’m a warrior. Whataya want?) I’ll argue this with anybody. <br>
My opinion is that many hits are more annoying more than big hits. So, get as fast as you can find, loot, beg, borrow, steal or buy in both hands. Yes, generally speaking, the faster weapon goes in your primary hand (your secondary hand can only possibly attack as fast as your primary, so why limit waste speed without good reason) but put speed in your off hand as well. I’m telling ya… It’s true. You want that delay number as close to or even better under 20 as possible. <br>
<br>
There are two caveats that I know of to this rule: You do need to do a BIT of damage, so don’t totally suck out on ratio. Second, if you lay your hands to a fairly quick 2H weapon (30 – 35 delay or so) with a near 1 to 1 ratio, you’ll give someone dual wielding under 20’s a run for their money. I’ve never laid my hands to one of these puppies, but from what I’ve seen, this (oddly enough) doesn’t suck for aggro. However, take a look at the prices and rarity of such 2 handers, compare them to, say, a Lamentation, and you’ll quickly see why Lammy’s are so popular. <br>
<br>
If you’re a Shadowknight or Paladin who doesn’t dual wield? Get fast in your primary. And then, if you can’t out aggro a warrior or even a ranger with quick stuns, dots, roots, and/or nukes when you put your mind to it… well… I won’t be rude and say it, but you know what I’m thinking. I’ll give you a hint. It involves Warcraft. <br>
<br>
Haste<br>
Get as good an item as you can, and make sure when you’ve got an enchanter, (preferred haste) shaman (they don’t suck at haste and can give you oodles of other great buffs beside from haste) and / or bard in your group, take care to have as good haste as you can get applied to you. Only one item’s haste applies (the higher) only one spell (whichever is up) and one bard song. The three of these categories combine or stack, as the term goes. As far as I understand it, the max combined haste you can have is 100 percent and the minimum weapon delay can be reduced is to 10 (or one second between smacks. Heeehheheeheehhee. 10 delay. Heheehehehehe. /em smacks self. er.. Sorry.) I’ve never sat down and figured this out, as its just TOO dorky, even for me, but it’s what I’ve read. <br>
Whatever the magic formula, its not like I’m going to start telling the enchanter to cast a lesser haste on me. <br>
Taunt<br>
It’s a crutch. Now, sometimes we all ned crutches and that’s ok. But don’t ever believe that this ability will compare with the primary way you piss things off. And that’s by beating them about the face, torso and legs with pointy pieces of metal as fast as you can. <br>
Plus, when you hit 50, anything that isn’t even to or lower than your level will NOT be affected by your taunting. At that point, its old school. Everyone except warriors can wave taunting yellow’s and red’s good-bye at this point. Warlords (60 warriors) can taunt up to 5 levels higher. Note that I don’t have any idea of the effect of the new PoP release on the Warlord 5+ thing. <br>
<br>
<br>
Get up in the Mob’s face<br>
Proximity counts. Get close to the mob as you can. With different mob animations, you can actually find yourself looking out the back of the mob and still attacking. That’s tanking. <br>
Root<br>
If taunt is a crutch, root is a prosthesis. Still, if you simply can’t keep the mob on you, set someone up to root the thing. Rooted mobs attack the nearest player no matter what. Keep in mind that rooted mobs still move due to attack push. Mage earth pets pretty much constantly cast root spells, so these can be useful in tricky aggro situations. (It also drives some melees nuts, because the actually have to pay attention to their location relative to the mob. Instead of kicking off Auto attack and getting back to the Warcraft session on the second PC.) Root can also be handy when breaking mezzes. If you’re in a big hurry, (say, lots of mobs, and a LOM chanter) get someone on the job of throwing in roots on mobs just as before you break mez. You don’t have to bother with pausing for the 3 taunts. <br>
One more aggro related note I’ll throw in here: Early aggro counts more than late aggro. If you take time to whap on a mob BY YOURSELF when you first engage it, you have a much greater chance of keeping it on you than if all hands jump in right away. So, build in a little pause between breaking a mez and calling in all hands on a mob. Curse loudly in the open raid channel or even better, in /shout, in big bold capitals on anyone who hops in before you call. Play with the timing a bit to see how short you can make this pause. The need for it diminishes as you gain levels. (Personally, I’ve noticed a difference between even 54 and 55. Not like I can measure it empirically though. Or would if I could) Again, this is the More Damage Good rule. The sooner you can get your colleagues in destruction attacking the mob, the better. The only person I’ve seen not bothering with separate calls on a raid and it not making a difference was a 60 warrior with post-epic primal weapons. I guess he didn’t feel the need. This early aggro effect seems to vary widely depending on zone and/or mob type. You can beat on elementals in the Hole for 30 seconds and they’ll still go for a sitting cleric. Froggys in Seb stay on the MA quite easily. <br>

<br>
Melee and range attack kick off those attacks, Taunt and Kick are pretty self-explanatory as well. I used to have a socials key made up in place of the Taunt key that would also perform a beg action (extra aggro), but I found it hard to time when the Taunt was refreshed (the social key wouldn’t refresh like a pure taunt key) and in just annoyed me after a while. Defensive disc kicks off my defensive discipline (55 disc that means I take significantly less damage, while also doing less) and announces it to the group. Assist puller is a key to /assist whoever’s pulling. I put the person’s name in on the /assist line in the social. Can be a pain to target them and just use and empty /assist key. <br>
<br>
The rest are announcements that have 2 lines, one for group, one for channel /1. ATTACK TARGET NOW broadcasts for all hands to join in on the attack. SWITCH TARGETS warns people to stop attacking and that I will announce another target once I get on it. The Taunting call announces that I’m annoying the hell out of the target and for everyone to hold on a sec. <br>
<br>
The positions don’t mean anything, just are were my keys ended up as bank evolved. That’s about it for keys really. I have a second bank, but never use it in actual combat. Stuff like sense heading, and /who GUILD all. <br>
<br>
<br>
That’s all folks<br>
There’s probably a pile of stuff I’m omitting, or don’t even know but hopefully reading this will give you some ideas about how to play the role of MA on raids and groups. Feel free to raz me up over this if you think I’m on crack or something. That way I may get some ideas myself. <br>
