<br>
<i>Deep within the bowels of the Imperial Palace on Terra, Inquisitor Mastilius paced before his private communications console. The news he had just received was indeed a mixed blessing. In a moment of doubt, he wondered if his Emperor had been polluted by Tzeentch. A great warrior was discovered on the savage world of Lethe who apparently showed the signs of being a lost primarch. “I couldn’t believe it, sir, but he single-handedly killed a dozen pirates at the loading dock,” calmly stated Comissar Brandigan of the Imperial 36th, stationed on the Southern Rim. “The rest of the pirate force poured from the ship, but he stood there as they crashed against him. Then the most amazing thing happened. He seemed to catch on fire.” Mastilius quickly looked up, his face a mixture of surprise and fear. “He fought with a renewed vigor and slaughtered the rest of the crew.”<br>
<br>
“Did you capture him,” Mastilius asked, his voice and demeanor suddenly calmed.<br>
<br>
“No sir, he ran off along with a small band of soldiers. We have been trying to track him down, but we just do not have the manpower to do it. What do you suggest?”<br>
<br>
Mastilius sat for a moment in thought. “I will alert the active chapters. I will instruct them to send a small expeditionary force to the planet to help in the search. I will allow the chapter that finds him the opportunity to recruit him. Prepare for their arrival.” Mastilius quickly ended the transmission and hurried to his chambers. A memory returned to him of a moment of weakness three hundred years ago. He thought he had purged Lethe of the last of the supernatural Flame Falcons when he ordered the Grey Knights to destroy the chapter’s presence on the homeworld. The chapter was reportedly destroyed, the civilians reeducated to forget the chapter had ever existed.<br>
<br>
“Yes, I will allow them to bring him back to Terra,” Mastilius thought. “Then, I will test him with the power glove until he succumbs, proving him unworthy. And this time, I will make sure that he is destroyed along with all memory of his chapter.”</i><br>
*****<br>
<br>
<i>“The transmission ends their sir,” said Sergeant Thomas, knowing his commander stood silently behind him. “It seems they are willing to bring us back into the fold.”<br>
<br>
“Do not be naïve, Sergeant. Mastilius tried to destroy me along with the foundings of our chapter years ago, and he will surely try again,” said Owen Burgess, primarch of the former chapter of Space Marines known as the Flame Falcons.<br>
<br>
“Well, how should we handle this sir?”<br>
<br>
“We scrambled their surveilance enough to make the image unusable. He will more than likely instruct them to only take me, making it easier for me to ‘disappear’. If he wishes to send all the chapters to track me down, then we must make sure they each find me,” said Burgess, a tight smile crossing his lips. “Prepare the men. Give them each weapons and a suit of power armor. Give them orders to go to one of each of the settlements we have used in the past and wait for the Marines to show. Then they will take us back to Terra and we will confront Mastilius. Then I will make him pay for what he has done to us.”<br>
<br>
In the shadows behind them, a demonic grin shown like a waning moon.</i><br>

<i>Daemon Prince Phlegm Mossbeard awoke to the vision he received from his master, the mighty Chaos god Nurgle. The time was ripe for the realms of Chaos to expand once again. “Sorcerer Slimetoe, did you just receive a vision,” he shouted into his antechamber where the psyker waited. Slimetoe slowly stood and simply nodded to his commander. “Very well, prepare a company for deployment to Lethe. They will act as a diversionary force while we prepare our larger assault. Instruct them to cause as much havoc for the Marines as possible. If possible, tell them to capture this Owen Burgess. Who knows, we may even get the joy of polluting a primarch.”</i><br>

<br>
Reasons for your armies involvement: <br>
<br>
Space Marines (all chapters) – Your chapter has shown an interest in finding this rumored primarch and returning him to Terra, allowing for the creation of a new chapter. When Mastilius contacted your chapter master, he omitted the part about the immolation to try and hide the identity of the marines there. <br>
<br>
Other Imperial forces – You are members of the 36th Company who were deemed nonessential and you are also trying to capture Owen Burgess. <br>
<br>
Chaos Space Marines (all chapters) – Your army is a diversionary force for your main army that is preparing a larger assault elsewhere at a later time. You are to act like you are trying to capture Burgess, but your real objective is to harass the Marines and Imperial forces to a point where they shift focus to your area. <br>
<br>
Dark Eldar and Eldar who side with chaos or remain independent – Owen Burgess has been ruining your plundering and pirating in the area on and around Lethe. Your small force has been sent to track and kill him or better to take him alive. He will serve well as a slave for the rest of his days. However, you did not know the Marines were headed your way. <br>
<br>
Eldar siding with Imperial – The visions of your Farseers have told you that a horrible fate will soon begin to unfold upon the Imperium of Man, and upon many Eldar Craftworlds if the forces of Chaos can capture a lost Primarch. A journey from the Eye of Terror will soon be upon you and if Abaddon’s Black Fleet has the resources obtained from the capture of a lost primarch, then all may be lost for you and your only tenuous ally. <br>
<br>
Necrons and Tau – Lethe while being a savage world still has a large amount of warp energy hidden within the planet. There are also several devices left from the destruction of the Flame Falcons base that may prove vital toward increasing your knowledge of and ability to use the warp. <br>
<br>
Orcs – Lethe is a savage world ripe for you to picking. The removal of the marines left the planet in disarray and is now sparsely populated and guarded by a thinly spread Imperial Guard force. Weak defenses plus guys who shoot worse than you plus fat humans equals a bunch of killin’. Come and get your WAAAGH! on. <br>
<br>
Tyranids – Similar to the Orcs with the added advantage that Lethe is perfectly suited for a hive planet. Your force is there to try to sneakily kill off the populace (you know, make it look like a farming accident) before launching an all-out assault.  <p>&quot;... whereever you rub it, it always feels better, ...&quot; - Brak</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm12.showPrevMessage?topicID=93.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm12.showNextMessage?topicID=93.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm12.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=93.topic><img src=http://heavyhand.org/buttonreply2.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm12.emailToFriend?topicID=93.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm12.threadControl?topicID=93.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/black_default/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm12.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=93.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm12.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=93.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub70.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="heavyhand65062frm1">General/Off Topic<option value="heavyhand65062frm21">Game of the Week<option value="heavyhand65062frm14">Heavy Hand Website<option value="heavyhand65062frm4">Members Only<option value="heavyhand65062frm6">EQ General Board and Guild Events<option value="heavyhand65062frm17">EQ Quest, Trade Skills, Equipment, and More<option value="heavyhand65062frm12">Warhammer 40K<option value="heavyhand65062frm11">Warhammer Fantasy<option value="heavyhand65062frm13">Other Warhammer<option value="heavyhand65062frm18">DAoC General Board and Guild Events<option value="heavyhand65062frm19">DAoC Quests, Equipment, and Trade Skills<option value="heavyhand65062frm15">Roleplaying Games<option value="heavyhand65062frm16">Anime Forum<option value="heavyhand65062frm27">Eye of Terror General Forum<option value="heavyhand65062frm28">Eye of Terror Fiction</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFFFF>- </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062>Heavy Hand</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm12>Warhammer 40K</a> <font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><a href="www.heavyhand.org">Home</a><font color=#FFFFFF> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246e<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
