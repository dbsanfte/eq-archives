And even more shocking is that I don't know what I'm doing and the rule book is crap.  Here is what I can't figure out, buckle up.<br>
<br>
1: I assume a spear is 1 hand weapon and I can wield a balde also.<br>
<br>
2: Can I put a dagger in the same arm a buckler is on (thats the way it works in real life)<br>
<br>
3: Is the first dagger on EVERY model free? So every model will have atleast one?<br>
<br>
4: What does Rare 7 and Rare 9 on skaven weapons mean?  Does it mean I can only use one of each class in my army or does that show how hard it is to find the weapons in a campaine.<br>
<br>
5: Can I give people with 2/hand weapons (incuding halbreds and bows) swords/daggers and just call an audible to which the model will use?  I figure those full scabbards are for something.<br>
<br>
6: My box set came with no human shields, screw you GW, guess I gotta convert a buckler if I even want one.  And no skaven maces, but I converted that easy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is what I came up with just off the top of my head for my reiklanders, looks like a fun army, tell me if I did anything wrong.(Marksmen get +1 to shooting, coulda got 1 more but I wanted a dude with a big fat sword, hello swordsman)  I think I want more pistols.<br>
<br>
 Captain : light armor, buckler, sword<br>
Champion: light armor, helm, pistol, sword.<br>
Champion: light armor, helm, halbred<br>
Swordsman: big fat sword, light armor<br>
Marksman: long bow<br>
marksman: crossbow<br>
Marrksman: pistol/dagger<br>
<br>
Debating on heavy armor for my Captain, I haven't read rules on what happens if your guys fall so dunno how important defense can be yet.<br>
<br>
Thats a good big less than 500c atm, but I can add stuff once I figure out the rules.<br>

<br>
1) yes, but I have no idea what a balde is<br>
3) yes<br>
4) that's for later when you roll to see if you find items in the course of the league.  you have to roll equal to or more on 2d6 to try and buy it.<br>
6) You're complaining about not having shields?  Big Phil's undead warband box had no undead in it (except for the characters and doggies)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>On another note,</b> how would all you guys feel about everyone in the league chipping in $5.00 and 1st place gets a Warhammer Fantasy box set, 2nd gets a Mordheim or other Warhammer blister of their choice (up to $20), and 3rd gets a Mordheim or other Warhammer blister worth less than $10 ($9.99 counts)?  I think it will keep everyone going longer and  <p>&quot;... whereever you rub it, it always feels better, ...&quot; - Brak<br>

Is it just me or is light armor useless and being able to parry huge? Think I may make use of bucklers.<br>
<br>
Also skaven ate the humans for lunch, humans had no chance it seems, skaven get 3 attacks and the majority of the time will be the one doing the charging.  They are faster and stronger than humans.  Black Lotus poison is just nasty when you get 3 attacks....I assume is 3 because you dual them and then the dagger in your tail gives you +1 attack to your main weapon, that seems wrong, but thats what the rules say.<br>
<br>
And another thing, are long bows just useless?  Considering a normal bow can reach far enough.  Only ever getting 1 str-3 hit is kinda lame, might switch to crossbows. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=newmutant>newmutant</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.heavyhand.org/lilx.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elitist Wingnut</span><br>  Posts: 478<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/11/03 12:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=64.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.heavyhand.org/nm.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Mordhein: No clue what I'm doing.</span><hr size=1> 1. You can use a spear and another weapon or shield (I'm assuming balde is Ehron speak for another weapon).<br>
2.You can model someone holding a dagger and a buckler in the same hand but I do not think you can use the buckler, the dagger and other weapon all in one phase. It isn't incredibly clear on the usage of bucklers, if they can be used with two handed weapons or if they take up one of your available hands but I assumed they would, much like a shield. Though recently I have seen several models which are armed with two weapons and a buckler.<br>
3. Everyone gets a dagger, yes.<br>
4. Jeremy is correct, these numbers are used to see if your heroes can find them when out at the trading post.<br>
5. There is nowhere in the book which states a maximum on the number of weapons a single model can have (at least not that I have seen).  <br>
6. If you really need a shield I'm sure I can dig one or two up for ya.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that if your swordsman is armed with a two handed weapon he does not get the "re-roll failed to hits with a sword" even if it is a two-handed sword... it states in the two handed weapon section that two-handed weapons do not take on any abilities associated with thier single handed counterparts (so a double handed sword can not parry either)<br>
<br>
Skaven do not get 3 attacks to start with. The tail fighting skill you were referring to is a skill which must be attained by heroes advancing and then rolling the "New Skill" advance.  The skills listed on that page are all new skills for when you advance and are only available to Skaven heroes.<br>
<br>
Longbows can be useful. If you get the first turn your opponent is generally not within 24", but are almost always within 30".  Crossbows are a great weapon for humans, but have the limitation that they can never move and fire. Just a suggestion, be careful about over equipping henchmen, they have a fairly low survivability rate. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.heavyhand.org/newmutant/heresy.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=farwinkle>FarWinkle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.heavyhand.org/bioniceyeicon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Extreme Farseer</span><br>  Posts: 1038<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(5/11/03 1:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=64.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.heavyhand.org/bmdance.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Mordhein: No clue what I'm doing.</span><hr size=1> This helps too:<br>

Reading it, it implies that somewhere in the rulebook, it states that you can't have more than 2 close combat weapons, 2 missile weapons, and a suit of armor, but adjusts that so the free dagger doesn't count.  I'll try to find where it gives the limitations. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">&quot;Because there is no wrong, there is no right<br>

Oh, and do Youngbloods gain xp?  Or are they just points fillers/skaven bait?<br>

They DO gain XP.  It's odd, but despite starting out with crap stats, the 0 XP thing means they gain those first few advances FAST with you having limited control on how they advance.<br>
<br>
Free daggers are cool, but keep in mind that they have a +1 save modifier.  That means a bare-nekkid halfling bent over a rainbarrel will ignore a dagger strike on a 6, and that can be pretty damned embarrassing - especially if someone sees you with a nekkid halfling bent over a rainbarrel (just ask Dave.)<br>
<br>
And yeah, 8 humans don't cut it.  I mean, you could load them up with gear, I suppose, but that means you'd lose a crap-ton of stuff everytime someone dies.  My advice on purchases is to decide if you want to model plastic characters, or have your characters distinctive from the troops.  <br>
<br>
If you're going with plastic characters, you can get a Mordhiem Merc box (8 humies) for $17, or suck it up and buy a Warhammer Empire Militia box (20 humies, same sprue) for $25 and be set for anything you ever wanna do with Mordhiem Mercenaries.<br>
<br>
If you want to go with the distinctive character option, then search the Mordhiem and Warhammer Empire blisters for cool looking metal models armed the way you want them.  Unfortunately, this is just about the only way to have youngbloods other people can immediately recognize.  A few metal characters and 8 henchmen should be good for a starting band, and later you could get one of the box sets I mentioned above to take care of your additional henchman needs. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">&quot;Because there is no wrong, there is no right<br>
