<br>
Is there a grassy knoll Eldark? YES. Someone came around posting in a friendly manner, and was contributing both to raids and to threads. And the Federation let a damn troll run her off, and even sided with the blasted coward!!!! This is the type of &quot;elite&quot; and &quot;uber&quot; attitude I'm talking about. Even if others see it as a &quot;difference of opinion&quot; - well thats an opinion I don't want to be around. We can agree to disagree on opposite sides of a darn building. <br>
<br>
I'm not even going to touch the whole &quot;I don't see you camping X for X&quot; - answering that would serve no constructive purpose. My guild IS povar, and Kayne Bayle, and Fironia Via. Its also Legion of Little Folk. <br>
<br>
As to being closed to the Federation.... well, mostly. I'm not going to advertise on the calender, or even visit these forums again, nor advertise in fed chat. However, by definition, an open raid is an open raid, and open except to a handful of guilds is still closed. I've still got to get Dofakor his kedge fingerbone (and there is another pally from that raid I have to do that for as well). I'm 100% divorcing my raids from any &quot;official&quot;  Federation status. There is an increasingly nasty atmosphere to the federation I don't like, and which as an individual, I want nothing to do with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ucloudsoul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cloudsoul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#70DB93>(6/24/02 9:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ....</span><hr size=1> Sorry to hear that Bendi, personally I think we're stronger, faster, bigger and better than ever before and if you think thats me converted to the Dark Side ( damn how many sci fi references can I get in) then so be it.<br>
<br>
DL has maybe 100 people active, LOLF more, just averaging out the people I see in the others guilds I'd say 500 members for the Fed at least.<br>
<br>
Thats big potential for arguments, and different points of view.<br>
<br>
I don't know what we've done wrong, someone posted (their right to post), someone else posted (their right to post) person A asked us to take the topic off and the board admin did. You seem to be siding with person A and therefore censoring Person B who may have had a valid point, doesn't that go against this free speech argument you've been ranting on about for 20+ posts?.<br>
<br>
Plus of course you've painted us all with this &quot; uber &quot; brush for what one person has said in response and for what the board admin were asked to do, very poor in my opinion.<br>

In my time being a memeber of the fed, which I will admit has been brief, I have never run across the &quot;uber&quot; or &quot;elitist&quot; attitude mentioned here.  I HAVE crossed paths with many unselfish and goal oriented people, which I both respect and admire.  The fed has opened many doors for our guild and made eq an all around more interesting place to be <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It disappoints me that we wont be seeing your raids/posts anymore Bendi.

<br>
1) Yes, I left the Federation boards. I got the sincere impression I wasn't welcome because I wasn't a Federation member. The feeling I got was 'join a federation guild or get out.' .. And that is the Federation's right to say. I'll still help people out if I get asked (feel free to email me or send me a tell in game) but I won't spam the Federation boards.<br>
<br>
My feeling was also that I was creating more trouble than I could possible be worth. Because of me a very nasty thread generated on the previous to that, very friendly and welcoming Federation board. When I posted a second thread, it became clear to me that the nastiness and distruptiveness would continue if I stayed.. and I really didn't want that. The world has enough crap without bringing it places with you. <br>
<br>
2) I did ask Lach to remove that nasty thread with all the mud slinging. I don't recall asking anyone to remove the second one, but I'm not protesting that it was. It was filled with a whole heck of a lot of nastiness, and people shouldn't have to read that.<br>
<br>
3) I can see how my second thread may have upset people.. the only reason I posted it was because I thought I had been asked a question. So, I had thought I would do my best to answer the question since I had been asked. I spent a long time considering my words and carefully weighing them so I wouldn't be saying bad things about anyone but at worst, myself. That the question asker was being sarcastic, facetious or rhetorical when they posted escaped me at the time. <br>
<br>
That aside, I want to say thank you to Bendi. In a week of my inbox being filled with nastiness, message boards I no longer visit (Not Federation) filled with venom, with people I thought were friends turning their back on me, people reading what they want to read, not what's written and being judged by people I've never even talked to, her words have been a shining beacon in the darkness. Bendi, you are a credit to Legion of Little Folk.. you embody what I think LoLF is all about. (I could be wrong. ^_^ ) .. Friendly, caring, willing to see the person behind the Toon and willing to stand up and voice her opinion. Thank you.<br>

I think sometimes some people tend to forget that. Those things that set us apart from one another are the things that can lead to friendship, or to arguments. <br>
<br>
I may no longer be a member of any of the guilds involved in the Federation.  However..<br>
<br>
- I still have many friends and allies in the Federation<br>
- I will still continue to apply to raids, and if I am turned away I will not take it personally, because I know there is a reason I've been turned away, and it's not necessary that I know what that reason is.<br>
- I will still continue to invite the members of the Federation to any activity that I lead. <br>
- I will still ask for help from the members of the Federation, and I will still respond to any call for aid that comes from any of the members of the Federation. <br>
- I will continue to defend the name and honor of those people and guilds whom I consider friend, ally, or even innocent bystander.<br>
<br>
-YOU will note that the noun &quot;I&quot; appears there quit a few times. The reason is because that these are the ideals I hold. And if YOU don't like them, that's fine, because they're not yours, and you don't have to deal with them. <br>
<br>
Now.. in defense of the german language, please cease to use the term &quot;uber&quot; as something hateful. It is defined in translation as the word &quot;super.&quot; The term you are looking for, if you refer to those who seek to hurt others to advance themselves, is probably &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;malicious.&quot;<br>
<br>
I see nothing wrong with a determination to eliminate a creature, whether the drive is experience, treasure, or pride. I see no problem if whatever reward it is you seek, you seek for yourselves and yourselves alone, or perhaps you wish to share it with others brave enough to volunteer. Whatever the case, if your intent is not specifically to hurt other people with your actions, so be it. My best wishes on whatever endeavors you wish to take on, and on however you choose to take them on.<br>

Remembering the questions though about who you were I took them as a genuine interest and a desire to recruit you, not a get in or get out sorta thing.<br>

I have been playing this game for a short period of time.. less than a year, and in that time I joined LoOF.. discovered LoLF.. then to my amazement I discovered the Federation.. so, that makes us all family then, right?  And families have friends, right?  So... if a friend wants to come over to &quot;our&quot; house.. do we tell them sorry, but you aren't family so no.. you can't come over??  I think the Title of this forum.. Federation Discussion was taken out of context... cause, unless I am mistaken.. doesn't EVERY forum have the word Federation in it?  I can see how this thread can be very volatile, but as someone famous once said... &quot;Can't we all just get along?&quot;  As for someone not in a Federation Guild posting here... why not?  If they are a family friend what is the problem?  I can understand, perhaps, a complete stranger posting here on something totally not game or Federation related.. but come on, this is a GAME.. and I think sometimes that gets forgotten..  If there is the desire to have a closed thread.. for Federation Members only.. then one should be made... until then, if a friend of the family wants to come to our house for a visit we shouldn't turn them away at the door simply because they aren't family.. I haven't met Shadowydreamer, but checked her posts and her site.. she seems like a really cool person.. one who would make a great friend.... EITHER in the Fed.. or not...  well.. that's about all I can think of at this time.... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
All I wanted from my original post was some clarification.  Is the Fed going to be hard-core Fed only?  Or will they &quot;open their arms&quot; to other people they consider friends?  And will this extent on an encompassing basis, or will guilds be able to choose their own policy?  I just want those questions answered, so I know whether or not to bother signing up for Fed raids.<br>
<br>
In regards to loot, I have similar priorities as Vigdis and others.  My guild comes first.  Thus why we have the first 2 drops reserved.  However, the rest are open to any who attend.  Heck, on our Monday night Kael Raid, our only 2 drops (chain gloves + plate bracer) went to 2 non-guildies who were attending.  And I don't have any qualms about it.<br>
<br>
I'd actually prefer to see the Federation reserving items for themselves on raids, instead of just going to a closed door policy.  For one, I really don't attend (or try to attend) your raids with the purpose of getting loot.  I like to attend your raids because they're run well (and thus I learn), and the people that attend them are people I enjoy hanging out with.  In most cases, I would turn down loot in preference to Fed members.<br>
<br>
A little clarification on the Federation's policies is all I ask.  Might help keep that shiny image that people respect even shinier.<br>

Most of what I have to say about this is posted on the LoLF board, because I've not had much to do as far as experience with the Fed. itself, and I don't want to burn any bridges or anything, but I can see bendi's point.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what it is bendi is doing, she's doing it as a matter of principle and beliefs, and that in and of itself garners respect.  It's not easy to follow your principles sometimes, principles tend to get some people into arguments, but sometime you just have to do what YOU feel is the right thing.  I do agree with bendi on his rabidly anti-uber opinion, and I agree with her perspective on censorship.<br>
<br>
I don't particularly agree with the way she's going about it, but then again I'm one who'll talk and debate an issue until its dead, reanimated, expulsed, and utterly destroyed, so I never really agree with a lack of communication<br>

A note on the usage of the word uber: EQ &quot;uber&quot; is a bastardization of the German term...in EQ, it does mean super, supreme, the best, etc. but it means it in a negative connotation...I do wish a new word could be found for guilds like triton...well...a new word that can actually be uttered around children, anyway. <p><img src=http://www.liquid2k.com/morbidspook/mal.jpg><br>Malbraxxus Darknite<br>

Sorry dindawen , I'm gonna have to disagree with you here.  People don't dislike &quot;ubers&quot; because they want to be like them, they dislike them because of thier general lack of respect for people that aren't.  Although I can't speak for all fed guilds, I promise you noone in LF (legion folk) wants to be Uber...even subconsciously. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=87219>Reign "The Feign part needs work" Cloud</a> <BR>

If they wanted to be, I'm sure they would be. The jealousy I speak of stems from the fact that those &quot;uber&quot; people have the gear or kill the mobs or, hell, even go to the zones that those of us who aren't &quot;uber&quot; can never even dream about.<br>
<br>
Hehe, I freely admit that I would LOVE to have a fraction of the items they have. But I never will. Why? Because I choose my friends and loved ones over the faceless masses it takes to do that kind of stuff.<br>
<br>
I admit it, I get jealous of them sometimes. Do I get jealous because they are willing and able to put in the time/effort/sacrifice/single-minded focus? No. I get jealous because those are some DAMNED nice items. But do I codemn them for the choices they make? Once again, nope. Our paths are for us to chose and to hell with anybody who would try to tell us how to live our lives.<br>
<br>
So what AM I condemning? I condemn those who put the negative connotation on the word &quot;uber&quot; just because they aren't _willing_ to put in the sacrifice that it takes to go out and get the stuff that they /drool about.<br>
<br>
You have your goals. I have my goals. Other people have their own goals. You work towards yours, I work towards mine, and they work towards theirs. Don't condemn them or me just because we have different goals/desires than you do.  <p><br><center><a href="http://www.unhomed.com">
