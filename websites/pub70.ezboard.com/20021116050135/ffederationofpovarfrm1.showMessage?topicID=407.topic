After reading some of the recent posts, I thought it might be a nice idea to start a thread where we all can get a little bit of understanding about our fellow feddies. So feel free to chime in below, and tell us all a little bit about yourself=). Perhaps with more understanding, future problems of personalility conflicts might not be so bad, or might not be at all. <br>
<br>
Thus, here's my post=). Maybe you could tell us things like how old you are, where you are from, and why you are here=).<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hi all, this here is your favorite, assanine, arrogant paladin checking in. That's right, Nueinx=P. I'm a 22 year old law student in RL, I hail from New Orleans, Louisiana, and I'm here to be the best damn paladin there ever was (not kidding in the least=P). <br>
Now for a bit of trivia that is true=P. The following phrase describes how I look at things (though somemight doubt it=P):<br>
&quot;I'm a person who is full of love,and in search of peace for the world. Sometimes, there is no alternative.....So, today's lessonis life, and love.&quot; Maybe a lil cryptic, but that's me at times=P. 1kpp to the person that can tell me what anime that is from (EXCEPT YOU ALMORE!).<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ok, now it's your turn! Tell us who you are, and what you do! Families work not because of the blind faith they have in each other, but because they have faith in their members to be the people that they are, SO LET US KNOW WHO YOU ARE!=D<br>

yes, i have two warriors and two shaman. yes, i see a therapist. i am in unhomed. no, you do not know the history of the guild - it is from the thomas covenant the unbeliever novels by stephen r. donaldson ... the stoic giants of seareach, lost for centuries, and searching for their home, family, and friends ...<br>

in real life i am a 27-year-old attorney in west los angeles. i mostly work and stare out the 8th floor west window of my building toward the smog-speckled ocean and wonder how it is that i represent winnie the pooh and consider my social circle to be primarily gamers. i have a delicate statuette of a fairy guarding my desk, to keep the looming demons of banality at bay. Crik-ee sits atop my computer while i sit with my blinds wide open and don't turn on the lights in my office because i can't stand the oppressive feeling of corporate america. for some reason, o'melveny &amp; myers welcomes this and i am affectionately known as &quot;the dark sitter.&quot; i have started a trend, now that people understand that lights are a choice, and have 6 other attorneys who similarly save electricity. i am locked in unreality.<br>

In real life im a 19 year old college student by the name o John &quot;Danger&quot; Adkins and I live in a small town in North Caronlina. I'm majoring in psychology and minoring in philosophy, so when you get tired of your therapist Vig, you know who to turn to /wink. As far as hobbies go, I have many. I read and write poetry and short stories. I paint pewter miniatures (for DnD purposes, which I play every other saturday night), some of which resemble people from EQ. In fact, my weener dog was chewing on my wulfebane figure during a PoH raid, or was it PoA. As far as work, well, I work at the college. I'm a TA for my biology professor, which pays minimum wage and I work about 15 hours a week for her. I'm also a biology/psychology/english tutor which pays a little more than minimum wage and i do that for about 5-6 hours a week. So as you can tell, im not filthy stinking rich, which is probably why i live in the boonies and still rely on a dial-up modem. That just about covers it for me. Anyone have any questions, ask me in game or feel free to ask here.<br>
<br>
PS: Vig, thats a cool forum. I've never heard of it until now.

I have been lurking in the shadows of this board for quite some time, and frankly figure that most of you know me anyway, might as well give a little more background.<br>
     I am known to quite a few as the Mad Mage or simply eminem. I am however not, nor have I ever been, the real slim shady. My title is one I swear I did not make up but which was given to me by mystaful (before she sold her account) and various other individuals waaaaaaaaaaaay back in loio.<br>
     I am quick to make friends, slow to anger, and make it a point to avoid taking anything too seriously. I always do what I think is right, even when I'm wrong, and I can never seem to get to sleep when I should.<br>
     I am the hardest working main tank on povar. <br>
     I do not floss nearly enough, but I do stick up for my friends, which I hope makes up for it in some cosmic way. For the longest time I was convinced that I had lost my mind, but it turns out I just left it in my other pair of pants.<br>
     I am the arch nemesis of the evil squirrel empire, and hourly thwart their plots for world domination.<br>
     Roadkill watches me.<br>
     I routinely give away whatever neat items I happen to collect to guildmates, and will often set out to camp items just to give to others. This has unfortunately left me totally broke, but I get by by begging from level 60 characters who show up in gfey.<br>
     &quot;hey mister, spare a z-heart? velks tome? 10k??&quot;<br>
     In the real world, &quot;no virginia, EQ ain't real...&quot; My name is Stewart &quot;Disco Stu&quot; Dawson, a college student/artist/politician/loan shark/liscensed minister/super hero. I worship both Eris Discordia and Bob Dobbs, but never on Tuesdays.<br>
     I act/sing/dance/skip/jump/talk myself into trouble and out again/ laugh/ cry. I often wear pants and smoke Marlboro red 100's, frequently at the same time.<br>
     I am trapped in the unholy depths of North Dakota, (state motto: &quot;Hey, at least we're not Alabama.&quot;). I am not in the middle of nowhere, but It's only a twenty minute drive away. I frequently go there to eat lunch. <br>
     I study at SLU (shitty local university) and am 20 years old.<br>
     I have not, and never will, dance the polka. Accordians scare me. Both my parents and both my grandparents were teachers, but I hope to avoid their fate and someday fufill my dream of becoming a pimp in Detroit.<br>
     I find myself constantly thrust into positions of leadership, no matter how much I bitch and whine about it.<br>
     No matter how much I try to avoid being in style, inevitably, the worse I dress, the more fashionable I become. Tommy Hillfinger has my phone tapped and an unmarked van parked outside my house at all times. I am at times both delusional and paranoid, but never on tuesdays, and only because they really ARE all out to get me.<br>
     The roadkill is still watching me.<br>

I play Montegue Lonerunner, 54 ranger, and officer in mystic defiance. I am nothing exciting career wise, at the moment. I work as a receptionist for a financial company, and in a months time I will need to seek alternate employment. the two guys that run the biz simply cant afford to pay me full time with the market in the slump that it's in, and I need better bennies. <br>
<br>
That's me mundanely. I work so I can live.<br>
<br>
When I'm living (read: not working), I so a ton of stuff.<br>
<br>
I am a rapier fighter in the SCA, and (if you play there youll know what the following means) a Cadet to Warder Jock McKee here in Northshield (we dont have the White Scarf, but the Bronze Ring - Warders are basicaly our equivalent of a Don). I also write and perform music for the SCA, mostly around campfires at events. I have a CD being recorded currently. Should be done in the next 4 weeks or so. <br>
<br>
In addition to that, I juggle, and once upon a time I toured with the rennisance fair circuit. I did everything there from selling art to doing fire work (juggle/eat/breathe). I don't do that anymore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I also play in a local live action Vampire game, probably the best in the country. It's been running for 8 years now, and is in it's second chronicle.<br>
<br>
I run a mean shadowrun and D&amp; D game, and I also post poetry and stories n' stuff on the same board viggy mentioned. <br>

21yr old from UK, known affectionately by my friends as &quot;old git&quot;. I work in the local council as a low down statistician and spend my life trying to escape incureable boredom.  One of the ways i did this was by going to meet a girl i met on the internet in Malaysia, who is now Triell (55sk), my wife, and the centre of my life.<br>

My real life relfects nothing of my character in EQ, except the wish to be the best at what i do. Whatever that is. Unforunately I only find enthusiasm for this in EQ, and quite often RL takes a back-seat. My wife sometimes gets annoyed by this, but not when she wins an item on a raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~grae0019/GotrikSig1.jpg "></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ubendieq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BendiEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/16/02 5:54:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=407.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Haggatha, Bendi</span><hr size=1> In game I'm Haggatha Moles, Troll Beastlord of 52 Seasons on the FV Server. I'm also Bendi Witherspoon, extremely opinionated level 48 gnome enchantress on Povar. I have 10-12 alts scattered among various servers, all but Haggatha and Bendi in their late teens to 20's. Several I've forgotten what server they are on (I love the raw start, where you have *nothing*). Once I get them somewhat equiped, I tend to lose interest.<br>
<br>
Real life, my name is nobodies business but my own. It ain't a secret though. I'm a computer geek by profession - I am part of a two man IT department at a local company, with around 90 computers in two locations. I'm 33 years old.<br>
<br>
Hobbies include Everquest (obviously) which is my main hobby. I'm an avid reader of virtually anything except romances. I have 37 feet of full bookshelves. I am a semiavid tactical pistol shooter - I own several glock pistols, and work to stay reasonably proficient in using them. I'm also reasonably competant with shotguns and carbines.<br>
<br>
I'll be purchasing or building a house sometime in the next year. I'm not sure which yet, and I'm having a hard time deciding. <br>
<br>
I play pen and paper RPG games (the Everquest D20 adaption is *very* good.). I generally game every 2-3 weeks with the same folks who've been getting together for about 10 years now. I've been playing dungeons and dragons for as long as most folks in this thread have been alive. I have Dragon Magazines almost as old as many people in this thread.<br>
<br>
Thats just me.<br>

I came here to go to Ohio State over 8 years ago and just never left. I plan to once I can afford a house though. Currently I work as a network admin for a local company. What started as a hobby ended up becoming a career. As far as things I enjoy other than EQ well, depends on how much time I have. Mountain Biking and camping is fun when its not frickin freezing outside, plus its a good way to keep in shape. For a while I was really getting into Car racing... not Nascar or anything like that but rather just local competition that sends winners to national races. Not so much into it now but for a while I was dumping some cash into it and having a blast. Current car is a 2001 Mustang GT with some upgrades like flowmaster exhausts and better computer chip (been planning on putting in a supercharger). At the most all I really have time for nowadays is work and EQ. Just got myself out of debt and I'm now working to save up for a house... I'm so tired of renting and I need more space. One thing that I will never forget was getting to do some pen and paper roleplaying recently. I hadn't done it for about 12 years and hadn't realized how much I missed it. As far as meeting me in person goes I'm pretty easy to pick out in a crowd. I'm just about 6'4&quot;, 225lbs, and at parties I guarantee theirs at least a beer in my hand, although I prefer some good liquor on the rocks.<br>
