By my 11th season it was obvious to everyone that they were correct, and might I add that I was/am quite the heartbreaker and drunkard. <br><br>About a year after my birth, my brother Skann was born.  He was destined to be a bard. He had the voice of an angel, and although not quite as sexy as I, with his voice he was quite the heartbreaker as well. <br><br>One day out of the blue, a lot of strange people started arriving in Shar Vahl, and Skann found himself falling for a wood elven lass named Maypop (who can blame em? those Wood Elves and Barbarian females are hard to resist). A couple of weeks later, Skann was no where to be found. I asked his friends, they all said last the seen of him he was headed with Maypop towards Paludal Caverns. I went to investigate at my mother's and father's request. Last sighting of him on the moon was in the nexus at the Fawdar scion. I went and reported to my parents that I thought he had went to the new world, and that I would like to try and find him and explore the new world as well. <br><br>I bid my parents farewell, and headed out. I found my self in some place called Greater Faydark. I was amazed at all that I saw, the rich lush forest, the amazing tree city, and all the wood elven lasses running amuck. I asked around in the city and I was told that Maypop was seen traveling with one of my race headed to Freeport. I ran through Butcherblock Mountains to catch the boat, might I add that I saw some strange creatures there called Dwarves, most of their lasses were pleasing to the eye, except some of them had beards. Yuck! <br><br>I finally made it to the boat and got on. I got sea sick on the way. I hate boats. This was my first boat ride ever and hopefully my last. Did I mention that I hate boats? Anyway, I made it to Freeport and asked around about Skann and Maypop. I turned up many leads, but I have yet to find Skann. <br><br>I kept wandering about joining a few groups of adventurers along the way. I never truly felt at home with any of them so I left. Then one day A dark elf Necromancer that I befriended in my journeys, Kaminite, told me of this wonderful group of people that called themselves Draconis Rampant. I joined up with them, and very soon I knew that they were my family, that this was my home. <br><br>Draconis and I have had many perils and adventures, all in all a great time.

The Lord of Hate himself stepped foot into the mortal realm and ignited a devistating battle that forever changed the land. Many rushed into battle to stop the evil god and his minions, one family that rushed into battle wielding spellbooks filled with arcane knowledge were the Delanooch, a powerful Halfling family respected and honored by all others within the Vale and its surronding lands. The minions of hate knew well of the family's reputation and made sure to strike them down quickly. As the troops from the Vale rushed into the forest, they were ambushed by a group of skilled Dark Elf assassins. They quickly spotted their targets and made their attack only to be denied their victory and sent to the afterlife. The battle raged on until the troops were face to face with the Lord of Hate. As they prepared to use all they had to stop him they were ambushed and destroyed ending the name of Delanooch.... or so they thought. Unknown to even their evil lord, one Delanooch still lived. The youngest of the family, Don Juan, had been left in the hands of the town druids while the family went to fight for their homeland.<br><br> Years later, the druids of Rivervale had raised Don Juan to be a mighty druid. He eagerly awaited the day he would see the world and find his family. The druids had lied to him. He had been told his family served the Vale in a secret quest that would take many years to complete. On the day he had learned all he could learn from the druids, they broke the truth to young Don.<br><br> Learning of his families fate, Don Juan's heart filled with anger and desire for only one thing. To gain all the power Karana had to offer him, so that he may destroy the forces of hate. He set out upon the world of Norrath, taking the name Snootchies Bootchies, so no agents of hate would hear the name of a family they believe long dead.<br><br>  Not long after his travels had began, Snootchies met a valiant warrior by the name of Wachu. He was then brought into Wachu's family, Draconis Rampant. To this day Snootchies strives to become more powerful by the day, but his primary concern is not the vengance of his old family as it once was. He now lives for his new family, the family of Draconis, and seeing that all his family live long happy lives, while being the sexiest Halfling ever to grace Norrath! <br><br>  Ladies of Norrath lookout(especially those high elven chanters, ya know who ya are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> !

I freely admidt I have turned his world upside down and made him question his hatred...or rather the hate if the demon within.  For within Drach lies the mortal soul of the child on the altar, not destroyed as his mentor thought... simply subsumed by the demon.  Now Innoruuk is a jealous god and to have one of HIS vessels taken from him has simply not sat well.  So I have been sent..armed with a most unlikely weapon, to free him.  Each day that we are together I chip at the demon, wear him down...but for a long time I could not find Drachnyen and so feared my task undone and feared also the wrath Innoruuk would show me.

It was a smelly terrible job, and I always swore to myself that I would not endure that kind of life when I was on my own.

We hunted together many a time, I, with my faithful pup at my side, and he with the spirit of The Shamen of Justice pulsing through him.  I was certain that we were destined to be.  Then, around my 19th circle, he was not hunting with me nearly as frequently as he had been...my attention was diverted, and I knew then that we were not meant to be.  I met the true love of my life, my darling Warrl Loreweaver.  I had not yet promised myself to Shayman in terms of marriage, but Warrl and I waited for so long to plan our upcoming marriage out of fairness to the other.  Finally after a very long night of hunting, Warrl and I were spending some relaxing time together before we slept,and out of the shadows stepped Shayman.

After the fierce battles between the halfling families and the Lord of Hate (explained above in Mr Delanooch's story), many citizens of the Vale were wondering if they could hold many more attacks from the enemy much longer.  For this very reason, many of the newer families that entered the Vale were not allowed to study the skills of the druid, yet learn the skills of battle by training with sword and shield.  The Malkieri family was one of the strongest families that went through warrior training, and the mayor even recognized my family as one of the official guardian families of the Vale.  As a member of this family, I was assigned to protect important people within the city.

As they pushed me to the ropes a loud crack of thunder shook the groud and waves of ice poured through their camp.  The bandits ran to their attacker and one by one was slain, sometimes 3-4 would fall.  Minutes later a halfing walked up to me, healed me and released me.  I asked why he didnt' let me die after  explained the death of my parents.  He scolded me and said you live today, grow stronger tomorrow to avenge them.  But then I had no where to go and out of food.  He being the most genorus of all offered me a home in his city of Rivervale.  In Rivervale he arranged that the Guardians of Vale to teach me skills.  He himself taught me to read, to write to live.  He now I call Father. I grown strong with this teachings and I learned the bandit with my mother's braclets was still alive.  I went back to EK and found her.  That pittiful being begged for her life and all I can think of was my parents asking for theirs.  Now all the bandits that held resposbilty is dead and I'm at peace<br><br>As for my current family I will explain. I was the first of many of Stormhunter's &lt;Father&gt; adopted childern.  Second was Feung but has left to be with the monks in Qeynos.  Third was a poor child halfling theive that recived some heavy punishment for pick pocketing the mayor.  Knavin was rescued by father after father convinced the mayor he can change.  Fourth was a child gnome of hate named Shinmei.  He became a knight of darkness to avenge his exile.  Couldn't belive father allowed it..&lt;sigh&gt;  A fifth was just recnetly taken in named Vironci, his first daughter.  While father and me was reinforcing the halflings in nek. forest we came accross a dispectble crying baby.  Being soft hearted and loving of all nature's creations &lt;if Darkelves were of nature's creation&gt; he took her in.  Strangly she smiled.... now she has grown strong....and I dislike her much...but she loves father much...<br>Well that is the story of me and my family<br><br>Raiderarc Stormraider<br>Champion of Stormhunter <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#767676><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/uwulfric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wulfric</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#B30000>(6/19/02 5:59:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: For who we are shall not be shrouded in mystery...</span><hr size=1> Savawulf&gt;<br><br>For who I am will always be shrouded in mystery....<br><br>Sad to say my past is confused by miscellaneous alter-egos, all of which have been a learning experience to make  me the ranger that I am today, and the great ranger that I hope to be.  For if you believe in reincarnation, then I could say that my original incarnation was that of a half-elf rogue under the name of Wulfric Rennison who has a long and sordid history of his own, most of which is told in an epic poem which has yet to be published in any major format.  Wulfric was and is a great rogue who was adopted into the family known formerly as Hecates Wrath, under the guidance of the guild leader, Vveraksizz Bloodscale. However, internal turmoil broke the Hecates family and the members scattered to all directions following their own paths. After this break up, Wulfric went into hiding and the next incarnation was born under the guise of a wood elf druid named Raido Covenfall.  Historically, the records would tell you that Raido was, in truth, a good friend to Wulfric Rennison, each using the other's skills to obtain new armor and equipment occasionally.  Raido enjoyed his own familial bond with the ones known as Amicus Concordiam, And it is through this persona that he made the acquaintance of one human ranger known only as Profian.  It was a rare occasion in Norrath when Profian would make his appearance, and in his 18th cycle, Profian decided to end his life, though before he went, he promised all his worldly possessions to the wise druid.  Yet Raido had not the space nor the strength to carry such heavy equipment and it was then that the ego known as Savawulf was born.  Although, I came into life as the proverbial mule, I have taken on a unique life of my own, finding my place, and creating my own identity in the family known as Draconis Rampant.  It feels good to be welcomed so warmly, and I only hope I can live up to the great expectations of the wonderous family I see around me.  <br><br>Draconis Forever. <br><br>Savawulf Tageric<br>half-elf ranger <p><Insert Signature Here></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.showPrevMessage?topicID=241.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.showNextMessage?topicID=241.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=11><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.emailToFriend?topicID=241.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.threadControl?topicID=241.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=241.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=241.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub70.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="draconisrampantfrm2">The Dragon's Horde<option value="draconisrampantfrm4">Guild Events<option value="draconisrampantfrm7">The Dragon's Whisper<option value="draconisrampantfrm8">Msgs for Officers or Webmasters<option value="draconisrampantfrm9">Journals from the Battlefield<option value="draconisrampantfrm10">Hobbies of the Dragon<option value="draconisrampantfrm11">General Discussion<option value="draconisrampantfrm12">The Artifacts of Antiquity</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#B30000>- </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bdraconisrampant>Draconis Rampant</a><font color=#B30000> - </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm11>General Discussion</a> <font color=#B30000> - </font><a href="http://www.draconisrampant.org/main.asp">Draconis Rampant</a><font color=#B30000> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
