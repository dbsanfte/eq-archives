Nobody shows for these raids, for the most part. I've tried hosting quite a few - and I've never seen a Steel Dragon,  Fates Conspiracy, Dark Legion, Raincaller, or Souls of Defiance at *any* of them. I got 5-6 folks who said they were going to show for Illusion Iskar. I did not get anyone. Only my guild tracker sent me a post saying that he wouldn't be able to make it. Otherwise, no one, no one, let me know that they would not be there.<br>
<br>
Yet, I constantly hear complaints about &quot;there aren't enough lower level raids&quot;. Hmm, the reason there isn't, is that NO ONE SHOWS UP. Only on rare occassions, when the raid is to an already overcamped, mega popular place (I.E - Crystal Caverns - great place) will people turn out in force. <br>
<br>
And, how disrespectful, and downright rude is it to post that you will be there, and then you don't show up? Or, you log in at the time the raid is suppose to start, to begin getting there. <br>
<br>
It really isn't worth it to lead mid level or lower raids.<br>
<br>
Later!<br>

i know how you feel bendi i truely do however we must realize rl takes presidence over eq.  there are a couple times i said i would be there, but could not be do to rl issues.<br>
we too have hosted mid lvl raids and none of the other guilds have shown but our own.<br>
but i am not gonna sit and name them and flame them because i know it would do no good to do that. it will only anger ppl.  i have been told over and over again &quot;this is only a game&quot; in most part this is true, but i have also come to realize that for some of us it is much more and emotions can sometimes run rampant. it is hard to organize anything because all of our lives are soo much different.  we need to think about that. it seems to me the best way to go do something together is to log on and find out who is actually on.  then go from there.<br>
i know my ranting may not sound coherent but it is just mho. nothing more nothing less.  you take from it what you will and leave the rest.<br>
we fates are having a full guild meeting tomm. any of the fed'ers are welcome to be there maybe we can squash out some ideas of how we can better do things i am always open for new suggestions. our full guild meeting is at 9pm eastern time and i think will be held in the tunnel nro side.  if you have any questions please feel free to send me a tell in game i would more than love to hear from some of you.  anyway peace out and may the darkness guide you through all your journeys<br>

Point is.. most people don't read these boards. Having said that.. it's hard to generate the interest which you're talking about.<br>
<br>
One thing I like to point out to people: It's just a game. If you start getting really wrapped up in it or it starts seeming like work, it's probably time to move on. If being guildleader or playing this game ever lost it's entertainment value, I'd be gone. (And it's come close many times.)<br>
<br>
I was in a fun raid with 2 of my characters with the Steeldragons a few weeks ago. Why did I go? Cause the guildleader of the Steeldragons told me about it in game, so I went.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Zones I'd like to see the Federation Raid: (my lvl estimate may vary a bit)<br>
<br>
Any of the planes. (46+)<br>
Karnors (45+)<br>
Kaesora (35+)<br>
Kael Draken (35+)<br>
Skyshrine (35+ at right front rooms 45+ deeper in)<br>
Velks Lab (45+)<br>
<br>
If you need info or help with a lvl 35 or lower zone, let me know. Most of them I've farmed.. er.. I mean &quot;raided&quot;.. yes dif &quot;raided&quot;.<br>
<br>
And personally, I think most of the Fed Raids should be 35 or above type raids. IMHO Those are the lvl Raids that most guilds would need the help with. Although, younger lvl Raids would be fun to play alts and to get to know people.<br>

I thought this raid was well attended.  I think there were 2 full groups a few higher level characters there for back up.  Out of the people there the majority of them were members of Fates.  I saw the following guild tags in the zone for this raid:  Fates, Dark Legion and LoLF.  Me and another Raincaller showed up but were late and groups had formed.  We took advantage of the raid and were able to hunt several things since the raid kept the area under control. <br>
<br>
To people that are organizing raids there are a few things that you need to think about.<br>
<br>
- Time for the raid.  A weekday raid may not be well attended vs a weekend raid.  A day raid may not be as good as a night raid.  Some people are in the east coast some people in the west coast.  I am fairly confident that majority of people in one of the guilds in the Federation are in Hawaii.  I have found that most raids held on a weekend night get better attendance.  If the Federation creates a members list, maybe they can add a time zone and/or best game times to it.<br>
<br>
- Transportation to the raid.  If you are planning a raid try to get a few druids or wizards to port people to the raid.  I see a lot of raids that say find your own way there.  This is not always possible.  It can take along time to get a port or just move from one area to another.  Many people do not have the time to do this and will just hunt in the area they are in then spend the hour or two to move.  <br>
<br>
- PR for the raid.  Try and build up the raid.  Why do you want to raid this zone?  What can others get out of the zone?  Things of this nature.  Some people will not research a zone so have no clue what the zone can give them.<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts.<br>
<br>
Hey Kankersore...I am hanging in Velious and would love to see any raids in those zones.<br>
<br>
Bendi -- Dont give up just yet.  You have done a great job communicating the raids you have put together.  The eagerness and enthusiasm you bring to the Federation are needed, dont let it slip away.  People will come to raids when they can.<br>
<br>
And I will just through this in for fun...Bendi and Warriousalexis, you both give great reasons why there should be some more thought into consolidating the Federation into one guild.  You can not just get in game and do a guildsay and have the entire Federation here what you have to say.  You must remember that the Federation is made up of 8 different guilds with different goals.<br>
<br>
And peace will come to the land after I have laid all my foes to rest.<br>
