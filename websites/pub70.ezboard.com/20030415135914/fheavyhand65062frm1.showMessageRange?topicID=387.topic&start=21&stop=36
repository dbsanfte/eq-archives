war</span><hr size=1> I agree.  The more we meddle with the area, the worse our situation is.  I don't understand why the Middle East is such a hotbed of strife.  But would ignoring it do anything better?  Saddam's not going to fire a nuke at us.  He's not going to mail us anthrax.  But, he's shown support to people using terror to make their political arguements before, and he has a stockpile of weapons we can't afford a 1% chance of reaching people like that.<br>
<br>
Imagine the havoc a single suicide bomber with a tank full of nerve agents could wreak at a national momument.  School kids taking tours.  Old people seeing the sites, what ever.<br>
<br>
I don't give a tinker's damn why the government's waging this war, really.  I do support it, however, because there's a result <u>I</u> want to see.  You want fucking honesty, here it is:  If we have to nuke every man, woman, and child in Asia to keep another 9/11 from happening, then dammit, that's what we gotta do.<br>
<br>
It's survival hidden beneath political discussion.  Like you said, nothing changes.  Americans don't like threats or risks on American soil.  He's a minor danger, and our new policy will not accept what was previously acceptable.  <br>
<br>
Everytime I hear 'No war for oil!' or 'France is the only country getting oil!' I wish they'd put more money into electric cars and nuclear reactors.  If the west and far east could live without war, the Middle East could finally realize their dream of 'freedom from outside influence/agression'.  Unfortunately, with the main source of money gone, they wouldn't be able to by weaponry.  In a few decades, Israel would probably double in size and - as you said - because Hitler killed European Jews by the busload (among other peoples) no ones going to say anything to Israel.  This is another example of the 'Oh woe is me, oh our tragic past - give me concessions' syndrome.<br>
<br>
The end result of all this, and I suppose the core of all my arguments is:  The World Is NOT Fair.  You gotta kill people to get some stuff, and sometimes, killing people today lets you make the survivors' lives better tommorow.  The means are gonna suck, and the ends may suck down the road, but we'll do it today and tommorow because that the only way to get the happy time where the ends kick ass.  North Korea, I imagine, is next. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#DC143C;font-size:small;">Bungabunga &lt;Heavy Hand&gt;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->53 Troll Beastlord<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->&quot;Have Gator, will travel.&quot;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

That doesn't make good sense. <br>
<br>
Its not about the oil, like Gabe said, US has plenty, and for some reason we want to balance our import/export crap.  And besides, the US is making huge leaps now in electric cars and junk.  (They could go faster but introducing cars like that quickly would cause chaos in the industry).  Get with it, &quot;no blood for oil&quot; cry didn't make sense 12 years ago, and it doesn't now.  What did we get for beating Iraq last time? Barrels and barrels of free oil?  naaa, we didn't get squat as far as I know, if anyone knows better then let me know.<br>
<br>
Seems odd to me that we win a war and end up being their biotch over the next 12 years.  Screw that.  He signed the agreement 12 years ago and he didn't follow through with his promises.  We can't go around getting rid of all bad dictators, but we can with the one that owes his life to making a promise to comply with us many years ago. <br>
<br>
And evidently there is more to this than we know.  There is intelligence that we don't know about.  Loose lips sink ships, I gotta stand by my country that I've had relatives die for and injured for life and trust they know more than I do.  But if I find out about any alternative motives, then I will just have to vote differently next time.<br>
<br>
Screw the French, they are hiding something and we'll find it.   <p> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.heavyhand.org/ehronbanner.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calistra>calistra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Techno Monkey</span><br>  Posts: 1037<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/03 2:17:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.gallopsstuff.com/images/webpage/callistra.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: yay! war</span><hr size=1> shane you were only like 8 maybe when the first war happened so your oppinion of what happened then doesn't really matter :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ehron>Ehron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Avatard of Death</span><br>  Posts: 709<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/21/03 12:07:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.heavyhand.org/images/shanesdiploma.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: yay! war</span><hr size=1> lol, yup, thats why I asked if I was wrong then let me know.

No matter what the reasons are for us to be in this position at this time. Alot of it is because we let it slide the last time. I was there the first time.  Anyways.. I support the war 100% and everyone that doesn't needs to go spend a few months in Iraq and try to speak out even once....(bang! you and your family are dead).<br>
<br>
Its not about oil (duh we ain't getting it from Iraq anyway).<br>
<br>
Its not about religion (we arent attacking all Islamic nations)<br>
<br>
Its not about Politics (The Prez is taking a huuuge risk)<br>
<br>
Its about the fact that Saddam is one evil motherfucker and so are his sons. They are evil and all you Nay-sayers are fucking fortunate you are in the USA.  Ive been places that you would be killed in just for looking different.  I've picked up dead children off the ground. I've drug dead friends outta the water.  Most of you "No war for oil" soft bitches dont even have a grip on the twisted fucking evil that goes on in our own country every fucking day!!!!  You live in a fucking fantasy land where its all hugs and kisses. "Hey they arent evil.... they just need counselling and more love""" is your way of thinking.  YOU are soooo fucking wrong I feel the need to kick your fucking head in!!!  But luckily.. I'm out there everyday puttin people away that WILL brutalize you, WILL steal from you, WILL rape you, WILL kill you and WILL do anything they please if they can get away with it!  Saddam is exactly like them, but unfortunatley has the position, power and infrastructure to do it on a large scale.<br>
<br>
There are many others like Saddam in power out there. But we have to pick and choose what we can and can't do. Alot of them are in power because we helped them in the past, but we thought we were choosing the lesser of two evils.<br>
<br>
So, protest all you want and talk about how "peace would have worked" your have a RIGHT in THIS country to do so.  But, remember that all you are doing is undermining our President (that we elected like all the rest) when we need to be showing a united front. All you are doing is giving terrorists something to look at and say "See.. we are right! even his own people are against him."  differences aside.. we are in a war now and this is no time to go Politically bashing our leaders. There will be ample opportunity in the future for that i am sure.  If you think that the soldiers over there want you to be protesting.. you are DEAD FUCKING WRONG! they want your 100% support so that our country can act quickly without distractions at home... and they can get thier job done and get back home.<br>
<br>

After first reading the message posted by Azothep (Ken), I was about to edit the message and replace the gratuitus dropping of the F-bomb to something nicer.  Like Puppy.<br>
<br>
However, after seeing the graphic and horrid images of the American POW's shown on European TV, I changed my mind.<br>
<br>
For a number of reasons, which I dont feel the need to go into at the moment, Ken will retain the rights to use such langue as long as it doesn't get out of hand.  Everyone else better watch it, 'cause Momma Usry comes in to look every now and then.  I just hope she doesn't see my tranny post from a couple of weeks ago.<br>
<br>
Targys: Foxnews is reporting that WMD are found just south of Baghdad.  It doesn't justify nor validate this war however.  It is the defience and the deceit of the Hussain ministration that validates and justifies this war.<br>

In case anyone's interested, I just made two more replies over at Stouthouse.  I'm done, I think.  There comes a point where it's best to let idiots wallow in their own stupidity, like the point where it's not worth fetching the pig, because your shoes are to nice to get mud on them.<br>
<br>
In addition, I have to reccomend to my friends, stop buying the Statesboro paper.  (If you have a way to read it without paying for it, go ahead - its what I do.)  Between Jake and Holli Deal Roach (who has to use the Dixie Chicks as her focus to make a <u>halfway</u> decent point) that sucker's become a liberal, misquoting, hyuck-hyuck, bleeding-heart rag.<br>
<br>
And, I'd bet Ken and Tim Platt will back me up on that.  Maybe Merle, too. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#DC143C;font-size:small;">Bungabunga &lt;Heavy Hand&gt;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->53 Troll Beastlord<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->&quot;Have Gator, will travel.&quot;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

My post isn't the most coherent of things but i hope it gets across some of my opinions.  <br>
<br>
This entire topic is too complicated for any of us to really discuss properly on a forum.  There are way too many intricacies to the whole thing and we are all guilty of oversimplification.  I stand behind my comments 110% (yup thats more than the whole 100% <img border=0 src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif" /> ) However the real situation is far more complicated and none of us will ever know all the factors involved in this war.<br>
<br>
Also... while i will randomly call people soft-bitches that post on the subject and dont' have ANY real world experience to get their opinions from except what they are fed by others etc... and Im posting about a situation I DO know about from first hand experience.. its all OK im not gonna attack you guys in public or anything ... we is still Heavy Hand (even if ya are a soft-bitch <img border=0 src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/eek.gif" /> )<br>
<br>
<br>
anyways.. there is no real reason for us spouting or opinions and rhetoric etc.. cuz its like religion, politics etc.... we have our viewpoints and we won't be changing each others minds.<br>
<br>
<br>
So! Give peace a chance (right after we get done with the war <img border=0 src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif" /> ) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azathotep>Azathotep</A> at: 3/25/03 3:32:21 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calistra>calistra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Techno Monkey</span><br>  Posts: 1040<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/24/03 11:44:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.gallopsstuff.com/images/webpage/callistra.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: yay! war</span><hr size=1> Ok, well now we all have vented etc etc, I tell ya what tho, aint no way im getting in any helicopters!
