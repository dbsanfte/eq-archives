<br>
I would like to explain some of the Philosophies that help guide my raid calling Process.<br>
<br>
1) NEED<br>
If someone has been a long time player, been active in the Federation and contacts me regaurding doing a raid for a specific piece I place them on my raid list.  This list is first come first serve.  There is no specific order or preferentail treatment given other than that.<br>
For example i currently have on my list Ish from SoTR (nother Fear raid for his tear), Klomck from MoS (imagine wearing barbed ringmail at 57 We hitting ToVHoT for armor upgrades) Kilraa of DL(sorry luv my mind draws a blank on what you need) and Chal from Unhomed (gonna drag him into Fear with Ish and if he doesnt get his sk blade then we will go in for him independently)<br>
2)  MANAGABILITY<br>
Once I post a raid the first thing that defines it is the people that sign up.  I will normaly call a raid with a specific goal in mind (example: the Fear raid yesterday was started to get Jasy her piece from the Broken Golem but it wasnt up).  If I dont have enough people for the raid to succeed then I will cancel.  If other people sign up for the raid and ask for a specific piece and it goes uncontested ON THE BOARD that piece will go to them.  This rewards people for being active in the Federation and on this board.<br>
<br>
3) LATE COMERS/ADDITIONS<br>
Everyone in the Federation is welcome to my raids as long as they meet the level requirements and other specified restrictions.  I am flexable enough that I can include last minute additions with the understanding that preference for difficult loot goes to people that have signed up on the board.  Now understand this does not apply to normal loot.  If we are attacking Paludal Caverns everyone gets a roll on bronze loot.  If someone requests an item, ON THE BOARD, that is not the primary goal of the raid and this item goes uncontested, ON THE BOARD, then they have lootrights to the item.<br>
These raids are not pickup raids.  They are designated ahead of time and I put several hours additional work into them before the raid begins.  This rewards the people who help to make my job as raid leader easier.<br>
<br>
4) RL CALLS<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen if we are going to difficult areas and you will have to leave early PLEASE have a way to get out.  Having a druid as your only transportation in Fear has its drawbacks.  I would not recomend that they bind in the plane, port someone out, and then gate back.  The thought is just scary.  There are several port potions for sale if you cannot gate out and i know of one that can be made fairly easily and cheaply (the one for the 4th coldain shawl quest).  I understand that RL calls and your faction with your wife/mother/sister/boss/coworkers is dropping to KOS.  RL shoud and does take priority over the game.<br>
<br>
5) RESPONCIBILITY<br>
Once I have called a raid I will be there.  The Raid makes and I will stay the duration (8 hours in Fear yesterday).  Once people sign up I would like the same from them (with the notable exceptions of #4).  Once you sign up you have the same commitment, not to me, but to every other raid member to help them reach their goals.  This includes a commitment to anyone who has requested an item or turn in during the course of the raid.  If for some reason, not connected with RL, you abandon the raid you have disregaurded your responcibility and commitment to your fellow raid members and in the larger picture to the entire reason that the Federation was created.<br>
<br>
These are some of the guide lines that I use.  I hope that you can understand them and abide by them during the raids that I host.<br>
<br>
Thank You<br>

<br>
RL issues are not always forseeable, but do your best. If you know your girlfriend/boyfriend/spouse/mom/kids/kitty/iguana or whatever is not going to be happy over &quot;x&quot; period of time, then gage it against the length of the raid, or, if in doubt, ask the RL.<br>
<br>
Unless you're being VERY specific and really have a team that knows what they are doing, knows how to work together, and are just plain uber, figure that no planes raid is going to take less than about 4 hours, and will quite often take longer. That is a nasty time commitment I know. Usually, it's about as long as I personally can reliably make (sometimes spousal faction is not an issue, but it often is - by 4 hours I'm stretching it and as we get to the 7 or 8 hours that planes raids can take... well, you can guess. I and most RL's understand that this can be the case, but understand that all raids have certain minimum amounts of time they are going to take, and you probably shouldn't sign up if you aren't going to allow enough time for &quot;what the raid is certain to take&quot; plus some buffer for problems.<br>
<br>
Not all raids are as lengthy as planes raids tend to be. Any specific dragon raid (Vox, Naggy, Rage, Gore, etc) is probably minimum 2 hours (if all know each other, are on time, and do it right), but are usually more like 3 and can run longer if problems occur. I can do a raid on phinny inside of an hour if every shows up proptly and listens well - it just depends. Think about it when you sign up.<br>
<br>
Now, that said, don't let this scare you from signing up. Von and every other raid leader and Fed member out there need you. Just do your best, and most folks will be understanding.<br>
<br>
On leaving. As an RL, I try really hard to make sure I have a Wiz when I'm in tight places for just the &quot;oops, I gotta go!&quot; reasons. You can't always get them though. In this case, we would have expected to have at least Jacy there, but things come up and people can't show when they expected to sometimes. The way around this is to keep a gate potion handy. I needed to leave about 4 hours into the &quot;general&quot; (not break group) part of the raid yesterday. I checked the raid window - no wizzies. I didn't ask for a druid to risk it (bind and gate back), I didn't complain, I just used a thurg potion and was in Thurg and camping in no time. If you farm your own velium/crystalline silks, these are very, very cheap to make. You can also buy gate potions to several other places, but they will run  more money. I recommend that all non-gating classes keep one of these around ALWAYS. You usually won't need it, but &quot;just in case&quot;, you want it there. I had that thurg potion tucked away for a few months now - the day came, I was ready.<br>
<br>
BTW: Thanks for the raid yesterday Von and for allowing me along. Was a great learning experience for sure. Learned a great deal about the mobs there and general tactics. Too bad that no amy's dropped for Opiad or I, but, ahhh well, it was terrific seeing so many epic drops and just plain having fun.<br>

if you have raid rules that will be either inconsistent with prior raids, inconsistent with how the current raid is being handled, or likely to cause some kind of controversy:  it should be posted.  in the case of the particular issue you are alluding to, the rules were not posted and they should have been.  you have now stated the rules and folks can make informed decisions on whether they'll attend the raid.  i probably won't, but i wish you well.  <p><img src="http://www.unhomed.com/images/Sigs/Vigdis.jpeg" border="0">

I think that if someone leads a raid and HAS POSTED the rules...and yes Vigdis they are posted. They have the right to tell ANYONE who attends thier raids about the rules and items that are called. I think that if you attend these raids you should respect the raid leaders decision. I have never gone into a raid expecting anything unless it was called first. As far as I am concerned you, Vigdis, are wrong. You always seem to cry and complain about crap just to get people to bow down to you. Well you can find someone else cause im not doing. You of all people should not speak about UNFAIR raids... You yourself invited Dark Legion to a raid...You called the Ball of Everliving Golem for ONE of your warriors. You stated that it was the only one that was definately going to that warrior. But a second one dropped. And yet again you called it and gave it to another one of your warriors. At least Vonalbrecht had the brains to post his rules before hand. You like to let people get there and then decide, Well I guess im gonna screw you guys over its my raid. Come on are you always a bitch or is it seasonal? I have no respect for you anymore. As far as your guild goes, the rest have done nothing to me. On another note..as much shit as Jandoar got over his post at least now more people know how you really are Vigdis...and YES I AM POINTING THE FINGER AT YOU! If you dont like it oh well you will get over it. As for some of the others in your guild...I understand that you want to defend Vigdis and that is ok....But as one of your guild mates found out last night...they need all the facts before they bitch. You can rip me a new one it doesnt matter to me...HAVE FUN! LOL<br>

<br>
I dropped the subject cause, yes it was Von's decision and the rules weren't clear.  I will think twice about signing up for another raid where the rules are unclear.<br>
<br>
None of you can say you know how Vigdis really is, cause you guys have never taken the time to really get to know her.  What you have seen is her as Raid leader, MT, main mezzer, etc.. all rolled into one, if you tell me.. that can't be stressfull then you are full of it.<br>
<br>
Not sure why you picked now to point the finger at Vigdis, but, /shrug, oh well it's not the first time and we all know it's not the last time cause she will call it as she sees it and speak her mind.  And i guess this was a good opportunity to start another flame thread.<br>
<br>
Not sure why you are bringing up Jandoar again, but he had no business posting the problems that were arising. Well I take that back, guess yeah it's an open forum.  But you all don't see it, why did he have to post for his &quot;friends&quot;, those &quot;friends&quot; have a problem if they can't go to their own guild leader with problems reference the fed.<br>
<br>
Well, I am getting way off topic, so I best end it here.<br>

Lach and Eldark lead raids all the damn time and yet they can still find the time everyday to be nice...All you are trying to do is make Vigdis look like &quot;poor VIgy&quot;' and thats fine. As i said in the first line of my post Lach has been holding me back from saying things that might offend anyone...She deserves everything she gets from me when it comes to anything about unfair raids. I choose to point my finger at Vigdis again because in every problem we have had from your guild it has been her and no one else except that you all try to play her up and take deffence for her. As for Jandoar it was a general statment that HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT HER. Everything he tried to make people see was right. Most just chose to ignore it cause it was Viggy. I think its funny that she can change the rules not follow them bitch anytime she wants post a rant about anything but heaven for bid if anyone else should do it. Like i said if you guys dont like what i have to say well Im not gonna worry about it. But i dont like people who bend things around just to get what they want. The rules were clearly written out... Would you like me to draw you all a picture in crayon? Hmm this is not another flame hun. This is simply speaking my mind and I am pretty sure you dont want to hear what i had up on the boards before i Edited it. I had no problem with Vigdis up until she screwed us over in Fear...and then the toon who wanted to get her epic said her mob was up and she needed help and Vigdis told her that she wouldnt help unless it was an open roll on the item and not called. Hmm again that reflects bending the rules to suit Vig and her needs..and now this issue with another epic piece which i might add he is going to finish soon...Vigdis again throwing her lil hissy about not it not being fair. So I guess Vigdis isnt the only one who can say what she thinks huh. BTW I have that written in crayon incase you need it! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A

There was ONE and ONLY ONE edit to the raid sign up for Fear.  That edit was for groups.  I made that edit and at that time I also clarified the requests made on the board by various members.  How is this not clear?<br>
********<br>
Primary Goal<br>
The Broken Golem for Jasy<br>
<br>
Secondary Goals<br>
The mob for Sadili's epic TURN IN<br>
Golems for the Various shammy in attendance (will be rolled on when we get into zone and see how many are up)<br>
Famingringer's Epic Piece<br>
<br>
Bonus<br>
Armor upgrades for those in attendance<br>
********<br>
<br>
I am sorry but where is the ambiguity in that?  I have been accused of not using plain English in the past by classmates but in this case I believe that this is clear.<br>
<br>
I also do not see how this is<br>
&quot;inconsistent with prior raids, inconsistent with how the current raid is being handled, or likely to cause some kind of controversy&quot; (as Vigdis stated above)<br>
since it was posted along with the groups.  Everyone who went to the thread to see their assigned groups should have seen the new section and still have ample opportunity to decide to attend or not.  No raid is guaranteed untill the groups are posted(and even then Verant can try and cancel it by crashing the zone) so everyone should have checked either Friday night or Saturday morning in order to ensure that the raid was going to happen.  <br>
<br>
I know that Vigdis read the edit that I did to post groups and clarify goals because she posted ON THE THREAD correcting a mistake I had made regaurding the break group.  I posted the groups at 9:16 am by the edit post and Vigdis posted at 7:47 pm that same day.<br>
<br>
All I saw from Vigdis after the sk epic peice droped was attitude when I told Faminbringer to get his piece.  She asked for an open roll for the item since another Sk had joined the raid at the last minute.  This raid was posted 18 days before it happened.  Faminbringer signed up for the raid less than ONE HOUR after it was posted and in a later post requested his epic piece if it dropped. I did not and do not see the controversy of giving a called and posted item to the person that requested it.  This was not a pick up raid.  It was pre planed and posted for almost 3 weeks before it happened.  <br>
<br>
In addition, I talked to the SK that had joined the raid late and explained the situation to him.  I informed him that if a blade did not drop on either of the next 2 golems that I would personaly lead another raid into Fear to help him get his piece.  He is on my list for schedualing SoD sponcered raids and has not been either forgotten or ignored.<br>
<br>
I do not condem Vidis in any way, shape or form.  I do not agree with her actions.  I see her leaving the raid after the first golem as a betrayal of the trust placed in her by her fellow Federation members.  Three other shammen had joined this raid in hopes of getting their epic piece and Sadili still had not done her turn in when Vigdis left the raid.  With only one enchanter (no matter how brilliant) I did not see much hope of maintaining the intensity that Fear demands of a raid team.  That, in addition to the loss of her knowlege of the zone and her tanking ability, would have ended the raid there leaveing 4 of our Bretheren holding nothing but empty promises. <br>

I see her leaveing the raid as a self centered and selfish action. This &quot;if you dont play by my rules i wont play at all&quot; attitude is unworthy of the strong, brilliant Lady that I have only glimpsed in raids and through emails.  I would hope that she would be able to see my reasoning behind my actions as i can see her strong adhearance to her own beliefs and values.  However, I do not believe that her actions acurately portray her ideals.  As such I condem those actions as unworthy of a Federation of Povar member and of Vigdis.<br>

I'm so sick of this uber-melodramatic, motive-examination crap.  This will be the last time I bother posting here, joining chat, or otherwise participating in anything the least bit nonsensical.  Break out the champaigne.  In the meantime:  Vil, if you perhaps spent as much time learning the facts as you do trying to get into mah hubby's pants, you'd sound a little more knowledgeable than the local idiot.  But, hey, since you seem to think dind gives a rats ass about you and your husband's open relationship, I won't even give you that much credit.<br>
<br>
I seriously doubt anyone wanted to know all that information.  On the other hand, I seriously doubt anyone wanted to hear you foaming at the mouth about a joint unhomed/dl raid either.  On the other hand, since you brought it up ... Your guild seemed quite happy with the deal that DL walk away with Shadowknight and Necromancer epic drops and Unhomed walk away with Warrior and Shaman epic drops - until it came to pass that nothing remotely Shadowknighty or Necromancery dropped.  Even then, there was a distinct lack of foaming at the mouth until today and our guilds have managed to pull off a couple joint raids without any peep of disatisfaction.  <br>
<br>
Maybe you didn't get the memo ... Maybe you were busy with those crayons. <br>

  no matter how you slice it, this is exactly what the incident in fear was. it was stated  on the raid post that sk epic piece was going to Faminbringer. the  other SK  was not even signed up  for the raid. Yet when  the piece dropped and was awarded to faminbringer, Vigdis choose to throw a  pissy fit and  leave raid.<br>
 Von, my hats off to you for pulling it together and not letting the actions of 1 rude selfish person spoil the raid.<br>
   Iroqmun, yes vigdis has right to say   and do anything  she pleases, and does so, no matter  who or what it hurts, what raid it disrupts, what guilds it offends. People also have the right to stand up and say  ENOUGH!   and thats what im doing here now.  call this a flame, or what ever you  want.<br>
 since ive started writing this post , 3 posts have been added   by unhomed members  flaming and  badmouthing anyone that dares  have a different opinion.<br>
  There is a cancer growing in   the federation now.  The time is now to decide whether we give up and die,  or take action to  fight it.<br>

<br>
[quote]LOOT RULES: JASY GETS THE EPIC PIECE FROM THE BROKEN GOLEM. I am calling that for him as Raid Leader. All other loot will be random rolled by the usable classes.[/quote]<br>
<br>
That is a direct quote from your raid.  Last I checked the word &quot;ALL&quot; was pretty well defined and didn't have many other meanings, but maybe I am wrong.  As an onlooker, I would assume that when you said &quot;ALL OTHER&quot; you meant that everything but the Wiz epic piece previously mentioned would be open roll.<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
If I found out I was allowed to spend my time at a raid, regarldess of if I signed up or not, and I looked at the raid description and saw that it said all  loot was open roll but the wizard epic drop, I would assume that other drops were fair game.<br>
