The overland trip was a long one from Highpass where I had been honing my skills.  I heard that the gnolls there sometimes carry items of power {items they no doubt stole from their betters, which simply makes it a contest of shadowed skills}.  Alas, in my spying there, I had turned up no hint that the rumors are true, and the only thing I had taken for my trouble to date was a few paltry gold, and the occasional scalp for the Highpass bounty.<br><br>I began my travels through threatening Kithicor, my instincts bid me visit the Shralok orc camp to see if the chieften carried any treasures {he did not}, but even so I knew better than to try such a visit by night.  There was a terrible downpour however, which made it easy to separate the chieften from his guard and slay him.  I began to despair that this trip would show precious little side profit, but onward through Kithicor I travelled.<br><br>After a time, the trees parted, and the gently sloping commonlands stretched out before me.  I paced myself carefully, and made good time, skirting the orc camps, but pausing to spy upon the new Teir'Dal shelters that seem to dot these hills.  This is something I think will need investigation, but for now my objective lay far to the south.  As I crossed the plains, I came upon a druid who had made camp on the plain, and was resting from his wounds.  Such magics as they possess are useful in far travels, and it was worth my time to speak amiably with him, for he imbued me with the spirit of wolf before we parted ways.<br><br>From there, the miles fairly flew.  The rest of the commonlands and northern Ro were a blur.  I paused for nothing to make the most of the enchantment upon me, and it wasn't until I was well south of the Oasis that next I stopped.  I had to, for the scene below me was startling.  Just over the rise, the largest spider I have ever seen, was doing battle with a Teir'Dal magician and his elemental.  I have seen the elementals of our master magisters, they are enormous and this one was called by the most powerful magics for certain.<br><br>There is a subtle beauty to spiders, and I confess I was torn in who I wished to see prevail.  Carelessly, I moved closer to the battle, and the spider {who I am told is a rare breed called the terrorantula}, grazed me while thrashing about, and that one scratch from his razor fangs poisoned me.  I threw myself back out of harms way and immeadiately began tending the wound.  It was difficult.  I felt like my entire arm was on fire.  I've sampled many poisons in my rogue studies, and I think this is what saved me.  Sprawled half dead in the sands, my body was finally able to fight off the poison.  When I finally staggered to my feet, the mage was gone, and only the giant carcass of the terrorantula remained.<br><br>Searching the body, I found several strands of terrorantula silk left behind by the mage, and carefully preserved them in my pack.  Profit at last, but the cost was nearly too high.  I recentered myself by the unyielding and punishing light of the sun, and set off south again, leaving the desert and entering the hills that separate it from the swamps of Innothule.<br><br>to be continued,<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://andais.homestead.com/files/andais.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#767676><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/uandais.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Andais</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#B30000>(7/23/01 2:21:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The search for Gazunga</span><hr size=1> Innothule swamp was every bit as fetid and slimy as the legends implied.  I did everything possible to stay on the outer edge of the mire, but at times the slopes crumbled beneath me, and I found myself knee deep in bog.  Thank Innoruuk that ravenscale doesn't rust.  Eventually, the ground beneath me grew firmer, and I was able to leave that unpleasant place behind.  I hoped the journey would be worth it, and I would find some news of our Gazunga.<br><br>The Feerott is known as the playground of ogre-kind.  I walked carefully in this place, for the Spirit of Wolf was fading, and in Neriak it is understood that the ogres don't always remember their friends when their stomachs are growling.  I have confidence in my combat training from the Hall of the Ebon Mask, but I also know that to the denizens of Oggok, I may appear only as a tender morsel of flesh.  When Oggok came into sight, I was much relieved, for though they eyed a stranger like myself apprehensively, they seemed willing to talk.<br><br>I wandered their city for awhile and spoke first with the merchants.  They are generally willing to add some information to the scale to balance a generous measure of gold.  Though few could claim to be familiar with Gazunga, his reputation as a warrior was fairly common.  Two merchants in particular seemed to know him, an ogre Chef that claimed he used to buy supplies from her regularly, and a bartender {I believe his name was Clurg} that said he'd been in to drink from time to time.  Neither had seen him in recent memory however.<br><br>I then approached some of the city guard, who the ogres call bouncers.  Like many guards, they seemed hesitant to speak with me, other than to occasionally confirm that Gazunga hadn't been about but there had been some whispers of him being seen near the temple of Cazic Thule.  There seemed little choice but to follow the trail the rumors had blazed.<br><br>It was a fair distance from the ogre town to the temple.  {Which speaks well of the lizardmen's guile, I wouldn't make camp too near a city of idle ogres either}  There was a makeshift bridge across the river in the form of a fallen obelisk, but I chose to swim the alligator infested span in the hopes that I could gain access to the temple unseen.  My skills sustained me and soon I stood at the enterance.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://andais.homestead.com/files/gazseek1.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>The lizards were not as large as I had expected them to be, but regardless I approached unseen, and moved into the tunnel that led to the inner courtyard.  It was disturbing to see the litter of bodies that filled that hall.  Adventurers that apparently never got far enough to again see the skies of the feerott.  It was reassuring that none of the bodies were Teir'Dal.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://andais.homestead.com/files/gazseek2.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>I crept down the corridor, stepping over the carcasses of the fallen, and slipped past the sentries into the courtyard of the temple.

They have surprised me several times now.  Their shaman caste draws remarkable healing spells from the Faceless One, and on more than one occasion it was a near thing to decide if my toxins would slay my opponent before he could draw enough breath to petition his god's magic.  My rogue skills served me well in isolating stragglers in the enormous maze just off the courtyard, and in hiding me when I needed time to bind my own wounds.<br><br>Many lizards were questioned at rapier point.  Many were slain for their refusal to speak, but sadly even the ones whose courage failed them could shed no light on the whereabouts of Gazunga.  I even sought so far as to scout out the temple itself.  I hoped to overhear some clue, or boastful tale that might tell me if our ogre were indeed prisioner though I began to despair that such was not the case.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://andais.homestead.com/files/gazseek3.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>My spying came to naught, and I felt that surely if Gazunga was here, there must be talk of it.  I knew my skills could not keep my actions unnoticed long in the temple, where one grunt of pain or outraged hiss could give me away, and so I retreated again to the courtyard to think.  It was then that the Prince of Hate showed me a small sign of favor.  A lizardman of some importance, travelled from the enterance on towards the maze.  The other lizards showed him some deference, and called him &quot;Radiant&quot;.  <br><br>This creature, I thought, might be more informed than a common sentinel.  My interest was his doom.  Luring him to a quiet corner of the courtyard, my blades &amp; toxins did their work, and soon Radiant lay at my feet.  I questioned him before his end, but he swore he knew nothing of Gazunga.  Only one truly ignorant or intensely strong could have withstood the questioning of one of the Ebon Mask, and so I must accept that our ogre is not in the hands of the lizardmen of the Temple of Cazic-Thule.<br><br><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://andais.homestead.com/files/gazseek4.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br><br>After returning to Oggok to resupply, I heard of some of the rumors that put him near Qeynos.

Hail and well met fellow travellers!<br><br>I write to you concerning a member of your guild, an Enchantress who goes by the name of Kishi.  I have previously hunted with her in the Crystal Caverns during a time when the Orc Population seemed to be unusually active.  Kishi herself left the caverns quite abruptly some time ago, but I thought little of it at the time, for this is common among those who adventure in these dark halls.  I remained to assist in weeding out the remnants of the ever present Ry'gorr, eventually succeeding in trimming them down to their prior population.<br><br>Leaving the caverns myself some time later, I went to make my way across the Eastern Wastes to my next destination.   After several days of travel I spotted a patch of blue which seemed to be unusual against the white that surrounded it.  Imagine my surprise when, upon investigating, it turned out to be the body of this enchantress, half buried in the snow.  I broke the ice away from her form and found that she was not dead; it was the corner of her robe, flapping, that had attracted my attention, and its warmth had kept her from the Dark Journey.<br><br>At the time of this writing, she remains in the land of the living; nevertheless I have gotten no story out of her, for she is delirious, in the grip of some strange affliction with which I am unfamiliar.  I have healed many a weakened traveller and it is my opinion that this strange illness has resulted from a magical duel or battle, yet does not seem to be the direct result of a spell.  It is almost as if a piece of her soul is missing or has been taken from her somehow, or she has cast it into some great void.  For all my skill I know little of the ways of the Enchanters, for these are the ways of mind and not body; I can take no other guess than that her affliction is something unique to the class of Enchanters.<br><br>I realize that this is disheartening news but wish to assure you that she is safe and well cared for.  As the closest thing to civilization, from the place she fell, was the Dwarven Stronghold of Frostone, I have taken the liberty of transporting her there.  She grows stronger daily and I feel certain that she shall regain her senses presently.  I have taken the liberty of writing to you, for I knew your name, Kurgn, from prior conversations with her, and in the past I have hunted with Lashoon Thunderbringer.  I shall be glad to speak with any representative you care to send, and shall write again when the Enchantress has recovered.  Better yet, with luck she shall write to you herself.  <br><br>In the meantime I remain,<br>Your Humble Servant,<br>Adiwen Silverlake<br>Intrepid Spirits<br><br><br>(OOC: The author of this letter is REALLY Kishi, who has used Adiwen's name with the gracious permission of his player.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#767676><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bdraconisrampant.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lashoon>Lashoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#B30000>(8/7/01 6:53:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To the Leader of the Draconis Rampant Guild, Kurgn Thex</span><hr size=1> Adiwen,<br><br>Thank you for all your help.

Lashoon was supposed to post it but he is having technical difficulties and has asked me to post it in his stead.  Enjoy!<br><br>Kishi<br>Enchanter of 35 Circles<br>Draconis Rampant))<br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>When Lashoon arrived in Frostone, Kishi was in the tiny room where she had been housed for some time. She looked bad; etherially pale, almost transparent. Her skin was cool and yet there was an expression of terrible suffering on her face. Her lips parted, mumbling. Lashoon could catch phrases; &quot;Lashoon,&quot; &quot;Gazunga,&quot; and quite often, &quot;Cazic has more than one face - Cazic has more than one face-&quot; Her hands were bound to the bedposts, with soft gentle cloth. <br><br>The reason why was clear almost immediately, as she tried to thrash mindlessly for a while, her cries of &quot;Cazic has more than one face&quot; becoming more shrill before devolving into random phrases. &quot;Plane - Cazic - Gazunga - won't leave you - no - NO! - Cazic - Lashoon - planes - musn't go...&quot; Finally she stilled, and once again her words were mere mumblings. <br><br>Lashoon heard the scream, knew it to be Kishi's, and ran towards it. The door that stood between him and the scream was knocked from its hinges with his casting of Thunderstrike. The Coldain guards came running, but backed away when they caught the look in Lashoon's eyes. The wizard entered the room and his jaw dropped. His love, Kishi, was pale as snow. Her eyes fluttered as she screamed and her body jerked against the restraints. Her hair was a tangled mess. Kishi's eyes were dark and sunken. With a sob he knelt and scooped her up in his arms. He pulled the high elf close despite her flailing. Tears streamed down his cheeks. He placed his mouth next to her ear and whispered softly. &quot;Shush now, be calm...Lashoon is here.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Lashoon,&quot; Kishi's voice was incoherent. &quot;Cazic has more than one face... Gazunga... Lashoon... please... Cazic... face... planes...&quot; But slowly her body began to relax, feeling his arms. Her struggles lessened, her head rested quietly on his shoulder, and her cries trailed away to vague mumblings. <br><br><br><br>Lashoon still cradled Kishi in his arms even though she had been asleep for hours. His arms were sore and tired, but he would not loosen the embrace. He placed his ear to her chest to listen to the beating heart within. Still strong, still fighting he thought. <br><br>The wizard did not pray often. He worshiped his god in other ways. He closed his eyes and sought his deity's attention. &quot;Karana, Lord of Storms, hear my plea. I am lost. I need your guidance and protection. I am no cleric or holy man, but I am your follower. I rejoice at your rain that brings life and stand in awe of the power of your tempests. I will follow you all my days. Help me now, mighty Karana. Guide me!&quot; <br><br>As he spoke the last words of his prayer the vision struck like a bolt. He was floating in a nowhere place...naked, alone. Darkness engulfed him. He peered through the inky blackness to make out a form coming towards him. Frail, white...Kishi, naked as well. He could see through her, see her soul, or what was left of it. It was jagged in place, melted in others. It feebly tried to reform itself but lacked the power. She would die without a renewed essence, of that he was sure. <br><br>The wizard reached for her, locked hands with her, and sent his spirit flowing into the enchanter's broken soul. Their eyes met, they connected, joined...became one. Their souls combined. A dark shadow rose to devour them, but the union of two hearts, two minds, two souls kept it at bay. It shrank back, leaving a vow to return to hanging within the limbo. Lashoon snapped awake suddenly. &quot;Thank you, Lord Karana! You have shown me the way. Thank you!!&quot; Lashoon closed his eyes and tried to remember all he knew of HandFasting. <br><br><br><br>It might have been hours later, or only minutes: but there was a stirring in his arms, the soft brush of long dark lashes against his skin, raising slowly, flicking softly in sleepy blinks. And then a voice, one that was soft and confused, weak... and yet familiar, bearing no trace of delirium. &quot;...Lashoon....?&quot; <br><br>Lashoon smiled weakly as his love awoke. He was spent, tired on all levels. Kishi noticed his state, saw the few new gray hairs poking through his dark ones. He was shaky in his movements. Concern, if not strength, rose in her. &quot;Lashoon...?  What have you done? What has happened to you?&quot; <br><br>The wizard calmly took her hands in his and smiled again, now with more vigor. &quot;We HandFasted, you and I. A piece of my soul is in you now and your's in mine.&quot; <br><br>&quot;But...you look so worn...&quot; <br><br>Lashoon nodded gently. &quot;It was taxing without your conscious effort. I had to put more of myself and more of my soul into it. More then normal. It was the only way to heal your spirit. We are forever joined.&quot; <br><br>Kishi smiled. &quot;Mmmm,&quot; she murmered as her head again drifted to Lashoons shoulder. &quot;Like that idea...&quot; Her voice was drained and her eyes were flickering closed in spite of herself. &quot;We can go... Cazic together... have to go.... right away.... soon as I put on my shoes... feels so nice... joined with you... so nice... happy... so...&quot; But the last few words were lost as her eyes closed, and she dropped off to sleep at once, a deep and healing sleep, resting her head on the shoulder of the man she loved. <br><br>Lashoon watched Kishi for a moment, closed his eyes, and was fast asleep. <br><br>The god Karana viewed the the two lovers closely. Karana, the Stormmaker, Keeper of Rains settled back into his throne of lightning. He was a god of neutrality, neither good nor evil. His storms caused growth just as surely as Tunare and destroyed the same as Cazic-Thule. His rains fell on the just and the unjust alike. Why then did he help this lone follower of his? Why did he risk angering the less impartial gods? The Faceless was a terrible enemy to make. Why then risk Cazic's wrath? <br><br>Karana smiled to himself. Why? Because he liked this wizard, this Thunderbringer. This Lashoon was so like himself. A summer shower to those he loves, a monsoon to those who cross him. A wonderful contradiction of passionate emotions, this human man. Karana liked that. Perhaps I might have use for this one he thought. Perhaps indeed. <br><br> <p><IMG SRC="http://www.draconisrampant.org/images/Characters/kishi_sig2.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#a8a8a8><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bdraconisrampant.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=lashoon>Lashoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#B30000>(8/9/01 8:28:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fdraconisrampantfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OOC Handfast</span><hr size=1> OOC:<br><br>Just as a note, HandFasting is the elvish ritual of joining of soul between lifemates.
