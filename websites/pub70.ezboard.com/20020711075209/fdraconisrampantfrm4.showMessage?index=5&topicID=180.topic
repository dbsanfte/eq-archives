We succored ourselves over to the zone out point and into the first battle of the night. The melee sarnaks and guard dogs that patrolled the area hit for in the 130s, and took about 2 and a half minutes each to drop. After getting organized and comfortable with our enemies, whom actually proved to be more difficult than previously expected (tougher than Karnor's Castle Drolvargs), we pushed our we to the ledge, a large cavern than was several feet in the air above the ground, overlooking the front gates of the guard houses. Inside this cave, the difficulty sloped upward some, as we now met an array of caster enemies, including Shadow Knights, nuke-happy and Gravity-Fluxing Wizards, and Necromancers with point blank AoEs, as well as more sarnak and undead sarnak warriors. The toughness of these mobs went up slightly, but the damage they dealt per punch went up to 148. We spent a good deal of time in that spot, as a decent speed of respawn coupled with the increasingly difficult mobs without an enchanter or bard held us at bay for the moment. We left this spot to go outside for reinforcements at about halftime of our hunt, at which Jyll had collected a total of about 70pp and a Star Ruby (70pp as well).<br>
<br>
Outside, we gathered up the forces and regrouped into two teams as Hodur, Lythandar, Xmaxola, Magikdagger, and two friends, Demina and Echoing (46 warrior and 51 cleric, respectively) joined us. We split into two teams, re-entered Chardok, and succored both teams back to the exit point. Unfortunately, while we were gone, a whole bunch of groups moved in, and our 3 ideal hunting spots were either cleared out, or camped totally. Although I was very reluctant to take us down into uncharted territory, with no idea what lies ahead (there are no entirely comprehensive maps of Chardok, showing what spawns where and such), it turned out to be our only choice if we wanted to hunt at all. We moved to the ledge, and after talking with the group camping at it, began our push deeper into the caves. Further inside, we were soon ambushed by a Di'Zok Captain and his group of dragoons and attack dogs. The captain himself was red to me at 52, so I called both groups to focus attacks on him until he was dead as a doornail. After the captain went down, the groups split up and each took one mob at a time. It was an exciting and unexpected battle, and we all survived due to good teamwork. The average mob in that fight hit for around 170 per punch.<br>
<br>
We moved down into the area where those mobs had come from, and I saw an upward sloping exit to our right. Inside it was another Di'zok Dragoon (averaging yellow to me), and one big scary behemoth named the Ancient Guardian. He was a great golem with the form of a super-buff sarnak. He conned a deep red to me and Magikdagger, and although we had come this far, I was too reluctant to charge him without further information (he could hit in the 200s for all we knew.) That being decided, we stayed in our area that we had made it to, and pulled to there. We had two full respawns of the area that the Captain had come from, and on the first one a named Watch Captain appeared. He was yellow to me, and he ended up dropping an Earring of Twisted Leaves (2ac, 1wis 35 hps/mana, and right click Scale of Wolf spell). Congratulations to Hodur who won the earring, although I heard he is not of sufficient level for the effect yet. After those two respawns of the area, and a death outside in Burning Woods as Raiderarc tried to arrive late, we decided to call it a night, but definitely a successful one with no deaths actually inside Chardok. <br>
<br>
All in all, I myself earned two and a half blues of experience, and we collected about 100pp in platinum, as well as a Star Ruby, the Earring of Twisted Leaves, and a Sarnak Skullsplitter that we had forgotten to random off to those that wanted it. (12/26 1hs with 8 SV disease/poison, usable by SKs Warrs Bards Rangers. Basically a Centi SS with Resists instead of stats, worth about 350pp).<br>
<br>
Tonight: I hope to take a shot at the front gate area, the one that the ledge overlooked on. We will have need for an enchanter to handle this spot, as there is a greater possibility for adds here, although they should not be as hard as those at the bottom of the ledge tunnel we fought last night. If we cannot do that spot, we'll either do the succor point, the ledge, or perhaps even go back down by the Watch Captain and Ancient Guardian. If we turn up short on healers, we'll hunt outside, in the outer gates in Burning Woods, where the max that most hit for is about 100 tops. <p>~<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=136883"><b>GAZ</b></a>, Craknek Warrior<BR>
