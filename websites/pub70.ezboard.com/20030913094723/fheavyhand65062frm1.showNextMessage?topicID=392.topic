One, because I am forever debating what games to try, and two, I am bored.<br>
<br>
Let's start out with the classic.<br>
<br>
Ultima Online<br>
<br>
Pros:<br>
1.  Housing (No other game has gone as far to make the player feel he is part of the game.)<br>
2. Mounts (Always a part of UO, cheap, effective, nuff said)<br>
3. PKin' in the beginning(It was a part of life, you packed light, and, always traveled with friends)<br>
4. Soloing (Later in the game, it became a big way to make money)<br>
5. Trade Skills (They were very useful from the get go, blacksmiths were easily rich quickly)<br>
<br>
Cons<br>
1. Grief players (Because of the not so harsh rules in UO, it was easy to ruin other people's day)<br>
2. Lag (It got you dead, more so then any other game I have played)<br>
3. The age of players(It ranged in UO, considering when I played it, it had no competition, but, after school let out, UO's general IQ dropped)<br>
4.Soloing(Yeah, when you can kill any monster in the game by yourself, you get jaded as to the strength of anything.)<br>
5.The facet split(When UO decided that they were done listening to whining, they split the servers so each had two copies of the world, one was PVP and the other wasn't, that gave a lot of people a reason to quit.)<br>
<br>
EverQuest:<br>
 <br>
Pros:<br>
1. 3D(I think it is anyone, going from UO to EQ was like watching a game from above to being captivated by it)<br>
2. Classes/races (When I learned I could choose something more then just my color on a game...I flipped.)<br>
3. Community(Actually getting rewarded for being nice, who'da thunk it?!)<br>
4. Expansions(A game that can constantly progress without pissing off half it's fan base is nice.)<br>
5. Grouping(Classes actually accented eachother, wow)<br>
<br>
Cons:<br>
1. Questing(Let's face it, they aren't that great, for the most part.  How many crushbone belts can one guy need.  Seriously.)<br>
2. Exp grind (Unless you find a way to cheat it -glare-, it can be something you wish you never had to sit thru)<br>
3. People who suck (Although this happens in everygame, it seems to have more of an impact on EQ because of the reputation people have to keep up)<br>
4. Computer Reqs (It keeps getting harder to play due to having to upgrade the computer right along with the game)<br>
5. Nerfing (=P)<br>
<br>
Dark Ages of Camelot<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> Haven't played it as much, so, less to talk about)<br>
<br>
Pros:<br>
<br>
1. It's historical fantasy(That's cool, I like being able to visit Stone Henge<br>
2.Skill based leveling (It's cool when chars can develop differently using the same class)<br>
3. Not such a big basis on equipment(Not much uber loot, or so I hear)<br>
<br>
Cons:<br>
<br>
1. High end content mostly PvP,(no real high end PvM encounters, last I heard)<br>
2. Quests(No one has really gotten them right yet.  Not good enough for my liking, always takes time to run around to all corners, not all that exciting.<br>
3. Graphics (I don't like them, not my kind of look)<br>
<br>
Anarchy Online:<br>
<br>
1. Setting/Story: (Great background story, kept up by an actual cartoon seris.)<br>
2. Genre:  (Sci-Fi &gt; Fantasy in some ways to me, shooting guns is fun, what can I say?)<br>
3. Classes: (They make sense, and what beats a guy with a huge robot?)<br>
4.Missions(Great idea, in my opinion, being able to go thru and do something with your group that won't be interefered with.)<br>
<br>
Cons:<br>
1. Age of players (This game is where a lot of the kewl doods decided they would hang out.  I couldn't go a day without seeing someone being an idiot.)<br>
2. High end content (Again, a major focus on PvP, no real high end content, as of when I left)<br>
3. Bugs(This game outdid a lot of others in the problems area (Sans WWIIO, which was said to be released about a year before it was ready) and, rightly so)<br>
4. Equipment ( A lot of it is easily attainable and therefore lacks the feeling of accomplishment behind obtaining it)<br>
<br>
<br>
Feel free to add more games or more comments.  That killed some time though.<br>

<br>
I never played UO, so I'll skip that.<br>
<br>
First of all, what do you mean by...<br>
3. Community(Actually getting rewarded for being nice, who'da thunk it?!)<br>
<br>
Personal EQ Cons:<br>
1. Camping (this guy is a rare spawn and he has a place holder, so I've been here since early January waiting on him for this Uber Lewt)<br>
2. Expansions (though in some ways expansions are very cool, they give you the opportunity to do new things, but in general they just make the game more expensive and totally shift the balance of in game items.... oh you are wearing Kunark Armor... why bother?<br>
3.  CORPSE RETRIEVAL!!! This is one of the dumbest ideas I've ever seen.  The idea that when you die you leave some lifeless shell of yourself that keeps all your gear on it and then you can go drag it around a zone like a your own little red wagon till you can find a cleric to "rez" you. Tho you aren't even being rezzed... you are alive!  You are just having them cast "Regain XP."<br>
4. Personally I don't think the new graphics are very good. They are better than the old ones but they are incredibly exaggerated and cartoonish, not to mention your point about the ridiculous computer requirements.<br>
5. All you get to do is kill mobs for either XP, or loot. You work to get the highest level so you can get the best spells (which you have to buy or loot) just so you can kill the big mobs so you can get the Uber Gear...<br>
6. Tradeskills are basically only good for doing parts of Quests. The stuff that drops in the game is so vastly superior to the stuff you can make with Tradeskills that there really isn't a point.<br>
7. monster level vs. player level - Something that cons "even" to you will totally kick your ass... unless maybe you have all of the uber lewtz.<br>
<br>
AO- <br>
The "bugs" to which you refer are not such a major part of the game anymore, at least not when last I played it. They've drastically fixed the game. When I first played it, it was almost unplayable, but when last I played it was pretty smooth.  <br>
<br>
You are right about there not really being a lot of point to gathering equipment, you need the stuff, or you are gonna die, but when you do get it, its not very good for your level and you level so fast it almost instantly needs replacing.<br>
<br>
There really is nothing quite as cool as being a "pet caster" but having a giant robot.<br>
<br>
DAOC-<br>
Though High end is mostly PVP, its not just PVP. Its Realm Versus Realm... So you and all your buddies versus them and all theirs... not just me versus you. Plus its not just about killing players.  You get to take keeps.  With the use of siege equipment (catapults, ballistas, battering rams), siege a keep, whack the guards and claim the keep. Having keeps benefits your realm by giving xp bonuses for killing mobs near the keep (even more if your guild or an alliance guild has claimed the keep). Also having more keeps than the other realms gives you access to a dungeon called Darkness Falls, which is both PVE and RVR. But.... there are also a lot of high end encounters, the so called "epic quests" which progress from level 10 to level 50 can get quite difficult at higher levels, requiring more than one group to defeat the end mobs (but the ones from about 10-35 are do-able solo or with just a friend or two). That is just an example though, there are many high end monsters that are just out there for multiple groups to go whack to get some phat lewtz.<br>
<br>
Pros for me:<br>
1. No corspe retrieval, see EQ portion for my hatred of corpse retrieval.<br>
2. Everyone gets a sprint skill, which when activated makes you run faster than most mobs in the game. Only wolves and horses (that I've seen) can run as fast as you while sprinting, so you can escape combats you don't wanna be in, without a spell effect on you.<br>
3. Tradeskills can be used to make equipment as good, or even better than the stuff dropped in game. <br>
4. Equipment doesn't make the character. You don't have to buy spells. So the only thing that decides what spells you have is how you chose to Specialize, not how much cash you had and if someone happened to be selling that awesome rare spell for only 83,000 K!<br>
5. Quests. Once you do the quest, its done. You can't do it again. And once you find the thing you gotta kill and you kill it, it ALWAYS drops the thing you need for your quest. No camping or farming required. I have never had to wait more than an hour or two for a quest monster to show up. Another cool thing is that for some quests, like your "epic quests" you actually trigger the monsters spawn.  My Armsmen had a quest dealing with the lost amulet of a long dead Roman Centurion, when I went to the spot, equipped the amulet, lightning started flashing and striking the columns nearby, and the guy spawned in a full run right at me. Of course Dave crapped his pants.<br>
6. The Classes are different. Though Albion has a lot of the classes that closely resemble the standard idea of Fantasy MMORPG... cleric, fighter, bard, paladin... every realms classes are completely different from one another. Even the fighters from different realms gain access to weaponry and skills not possessed by the other realms.  This, coupled with the awesome scenery, gives every realm a rich and very distinct style.<br>
7. Not as many minor annoyances, Don't need to buy food, no backpacks, don't need to go to a bank to get your money changed, money doesnt weigh anything, and having a few plat means you are a real rich mofo, and thats not even the highest money denomination.<br>
8. I've NEVER been in a group where if something dropped, they wanted to keep it, instead of giving it to the person who could most use it.  Heck, I've had people who were just running by give me things. And I've had groups give me stuff that dropped just because it was useable by my class, even though I said I didn't need it.<br>
9. Eight person groups.<br>
10. One time drops.  This guy has an item that no matter what, the first time you kill him (providing you are the right class and level to use the item) he drops it, and not on the ground, but straight in your inventory.<br>
11. One of my favorite things... Combat styles. Specializing in certain weapons gives you the ability to use different combat styles. It gives the fighters something to do  in combat other than hit taunt and kick.  Some styles require that you block first, others require you attack from the side or rear. So you actually have to do stuff as a tank.<br>
<br>
Ok, I'm getting tired of listing pros and cons, someone elses turn. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Is it worth it? These games arn't designed to pick up and play for mindless entertainment. They are goal oriented with many goals achieved via research in game or out of game.  I mean come on, how many time you have to look at your print out or alt-tab to remember the next part of the quest, or worse, can't do it tonite cause no one is around to take out end reward quest guy. And if its not quests its also gaining levels or skill points, whatever it is, you got a sword go hack that beast. Not even online rpgs, just take a look at ole finaly fantasy, to kill the uber bosses you have to get dem levels, but you don't if you wanna just wanna see the ending. <br>
<br>
I personally hate all forms of pvp online rpg unless everyone just hops on for a nite to goof off. I've played a bunch of pvp rpg games and pretty much they boil down to, are you willing to somehow survive the newb slaughter. It boils down to staying up or waking up at 4-9 am so you can actually get past level 1 or hopeing that you have a high level friend to plevel or just protect from the raving pc's out ot kill you. If you really want this just play an FPS. <br>
<br>
If Loot and money is a problem with these games, how is it really that much of a problem? Money can be made on any game, since an in game economy is gonna happen no matter what online game it is. You just have to not worry about the numbers game. As a view of online games, no matter what it is, its gonna drop in price thru time unless its untainable anymore. Why is this? its because there is an endless supply of equipment drops, but only a set amount of players. So with the rule of supply and demand, prices will drop.  And ok no &quot;uber&quot; loot, but ya your still gonna have to upgrade from wearing nothing, and I don't give a fuck what game you play, a bp is still better than a shirt. I mean seriously, are you gonna get to level 9999, or master skillsman,  with your newbie gear? No your still gonna have to goto x place and kill x mob, or gather items from around the globe or various shops and build up skills to make xbetter item than i had before. <br>
<br>
These games are really about your ability to make friends online, and how to interact with them. If you are not capable of handling people very well, then ya many of these games are really gonna suck. Your gonna be the lfg guy all nite. <br>
I say when picking a game, pick the one with most of your friends play or people you know play. And if you need a break, take one. <br>
Oh ya one more thing, Never buy a game that just came out, wait a year. It always sucks when it first comes out, trust me on this.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calistra>calistra</A> at: 11/27/02 3:10:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sariskjhari>Sarisk Jhari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>> Targys</span><br>  Posts: 101<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/27/02 3:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=314.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Matt's(Sarisk's) Pros and Cons of Online Games</span><hr size=1> By community I mean that being a nice guy gets you places.  Being a good lad will earn you spots in the better parts of EQ (Raids, grouping with cool people, etc.)<br>
<br>
And Questing/camping to me are the same thing.  Buncha pointless crap that doesn't get you involved in the story and ends with an item.<br>
<br>
But, as for CR.<br>
<br>
Um, when you die...you don't magically poof anywhere with all your stuff.  It makes sense that you leave your body, full of items, on the ground where you died.<br>
<br>
It's helpful in a couple ways..  Though yeah, CRs can be bad.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this isn't a post to convince anyone to choose anything, just personal experience.<br>
<br>
I didn't review WWII Online, or Earth and Beyond, or any of the other games coming out....haven't had a chance to play them.  Though, I am sure all of those games have there ups and downs.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, yeah.  It all boils down to the reason I play EQ over other games is the friends I have made on EQ.  No other game have I been so quickly accepted by total strangers.  (Remember, when I started, you guys didn't know me.)  I wouldn't quit until there came a time when I was the only one in the heavy hand.  Which, won't occur I am sure.<br>
<br>
Aww, I am getting all teary eyed.  Anyways, gonna go now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drgabe>DrGabe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://heavyhand.org/portent-avatar.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>King of the Message Board</span><br>  Posts: 702<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/27/02 4:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=314.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://heavyhand.org/demon-hunter.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Matt's(Sarisk's) Pros and Cons of Online Games</span><hr size=1> First things first.. since all the posts are over 4 lines long it looks like we wont get Ehron's opinion on this. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now back on topic.  There is one reason why I dont play any of the online games anymore.  Technology passed me by.  now for DAoC that isn't a big deal, they started at a 16mb graphic card. No biggie.  However, EQ has totally screwed thousands of thier base by upgrading the graphic card (and RAM) requirments midway through the game/expansions.  Now that would be ok if the new graphics were as good as the jump from UO to the original EQ (see Matt's post in the begining).  However, the new graphics suck.  Most people end up with the older version of most of the models (unless they have the spare RAM hanging around) and I kept the old models when I had the RAM (and a desktop, damn all this moving around!).  This is a major pet peve with me and EQ, probably the main reason why I didn't give a flying crap when I stopped my account after several months of trying to keep up with the tech upgrades.  <br>
<br>
However, there is one reason why I kept playing EQ for so long.  It was the community that was around.  Not just the Heavy Hand, though that was a huge part of it, but all the other people that I knew.  DAoC was getting that way before I de-evoloved (went back to laptop land <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  <br>
However, there is one problem with the community of close friends (i.e. Heavy Hand) and this isn't a bash on the HH'ers but a comment on all guilds.  If you start up later than the rest of the gang, then you are constantly running from behind to catch up. Now after awhile you might catch up with everyone.  But this whole tiem you have only one goal... LEVEL.  And when you get there, what do you have.  An experience based on only one thing, geting experience. Not really what I called having alot of fun.  Yeah, you grouped up with people along the way, but got further from the guilds Frame of Reference.  At least that was my experience.<br>
<br>
I wonder what will happen when the next generation of games come out this next year.  Will the HH switch from EQ being the major online game to say Star Wars?  EQ2?  DAoC?  DrGabe's virtual handsfree proctology?  The online slay-a-Squeeky game?   <p>Viva la Revelution!! <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Its like arguing that DAOC sucked because of all the problems they had in its first appearance. EQ now is a very very different game then when I even stopped playing a year ago. <br>
1. Im only using a p3 550 with 256 megs of ram and geforce 2 32 meg video card, that i only payed not even $400 when all this stuff came out, and Im running eq fine, I dont have any of the new graphics on, cause well they suck :P. I turn down the clip plane in the bazaar and thats about it. All this I gotta have an uber computer to run eq is hogwash. Shit with all the spam turned off, you can go into a raid and not go link dead either, with 2 computers networked on a 56k connection. <br>
<br>
2. The best thing about eq, all the races and classes are balanced, no one class race combination is gonna completely overrun the other classes. Rangers dont suck anymore, wizards are incredible, paladins and sk are damn effective tanks, enchanters arent as hard to play as they used to be. <br>
<br>
3. All spell casters can solo effectivily, and I mean ALL spell casters. Hyrids can solo effectively too. Which is a powerful point to EQ, you can't play with your friends all the time, and since your job or what not can let you play peak times, then you can enjoy a solo adventure. But if you wanna group, nearly every spell now stacks with just about anything else (except for hp buffs for obvious reasons). So no more excusses for not playing a certain class because we have to much etc etc. Clerics dont have the stranglehold on healing and rezzing, enchanters dont have a stranglehold on mana regening, and druids and wizards dont have a stranglehold on transportation. And with the nexus being the center of the universe on EQ, you can pick up buffs for mere plats that you will gain back with a quickness.<br>
<br>
4. Oh tradeskills, yeah they are worth it now, you can make armor that is very comprable to the most uber of items. So need to cry about not have your ac 51 bp with blah blah stats, get working on your smithing, you can make one too. And the components, just go out and hunt for em, cause they arent rare drops off the mobs. Oh you dont wanna hunt them, then fine go to the bazaar, some guy already farmed them and selling them , dont like his price, some other guy is probably undercutting him. <br>
<br>
6. Making money a problem, no its not, you can day trade if ya want in the bazaar. You stay on in the bazaar long enuff you can sell anything. <br>
<br>
7. The desingers of the game made a decision that I totally agree with and thats since melee guys have to get uber items, spell casters have to earn their spells, not just got out and buy them from the vendors. Since its your sword or dagger that makes your melee guy what he is, and the only way to get a better one is to kill or quest for a better one, then shit ya a spell caster has to go out and earn their spells. But they didnt make all the most important of your spells drop off of gods, just the actual uber ones. Is malo the end all be all of mac spell list, not really, its that 75% slow, oh wait that doesnt go for x amount of plat. And in reality, the only reason you need these spells is to be uber, what end ups happening, is that other of the 3-4 other guys on the raid of the same class, and your not the one guy everyone is counting on for it to land. <br>
<br>
7. Oh you died, have to run to goto your corpse, Well damn that makes a whole hell of alot more sense then just dying and poping with your items on you in a fantasy sense. Thats just some newb reason cause I fucked up cause I was being careless or stupid. well lets see ive died like 10 times with tiniee, and all it took was 2 loading please waits till i got back to it, why is that, oh ya POP has all these books everywhere. But wait, how do you know your not gonna be just 2 zones away in dungeon. Well thats that whole risk to reward thing. Yeah thats right, the only reason your there, is that your taking a bigger risk for much better reward, like more exp, or better loot, or better money drops. Well the more risks you take IE solo or power leveling, then ya the more rewards, like your the one getting that item or all that exp bonus. To only have to go run back to your corpse, oh no. And if you die, exp rezes start at around level 20 for clerics, and level 30 for paladins. And its not like you need it, you can buy an insta-cast invis potion right by the soul binder in POP. If you died now, its your own damn fault, and if your playing right, you can get back the exp you lost in like five minutes, cause your using the risk to rewards system for exp. Yeah I'm talking about those nasty zones that sucked because of the high level of difficulty. Another thing I've noticed with tiniee, none of the zones are over camped, why? cause there soooo many zones to do exp in.<br>
<br>
8. Epic quests, yeah they suck and are time consuming. But thats why they are and were meant to be. Do you have to have them, not at all. Do they make a difference, shit ya they do.<br>
<br>
So pretty much, most of the complaints now about everquest is pretty much due to lazyness and the jeolousy of not being uber, awww go whine on someone else shoulder.  If your basing your opinion of the silly shit we talk about in the store, take none of that into what the game actually is. We talk about the nonsense because thats what it is, nonsense, but its damn funny. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calistra>calistra</A> at: 11/28/02 2:03:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=farwinkle>FarWinkle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.heavyhand.org/bioniceyeicon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Extreme Farseer</span><br>  Posts: 708<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/28/02 3:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=314.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.heavyhand.org/bmdance.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Matt's(Sarisk's) Pros and Cons of Online Games</span><hr size=1> Humam's made most of my points for me (thought in a highly unformatted block of text) with one exception.  All the qualms any DAoC player has brought up in regards to the EQ community, and DAoC having nicer people, doesn't take into account the higher population of EQ.  Yes, if X% of people are morons, then you're going to run into more morons on EQ.  If X% of people are stingy money-grubbing lewt whores, you're going to see more of them on EQ, too.  You also see more really nice people, you just have to go out and find them.  True, you and the nice people may be grouped with a not-nice person, but you'll have someone to make fun of the bastard with.<br>
<br>
Bungabunga has been in some great groups, where people don't even bother to loot the mobs, because no one needs anything from the spot.  We were just there to get some xp while enjoying some group chat.  And damned fine group chat it was.<br>
<br>
As far as the state of EQ's economy, I agree it's screwed up, but the servers are old.  All DAoC's done is slow down the degredation of the coinage.  Just wait, and one day hundreds of plat per player will have entered the DAoC economy, especially with the use of player-made items in that game.<br>
<br>
Oh, and here's the greatest secret of EQ as regards gear:  You don't have to be uber to be effective.  Hell, you don't even have to be leet.  You only need more stuff to be *better* than your tactics allow you to be.<br>

You either hate the idea of CR's or you put up with it in EQ.  So it is of course left up to opinion.<br>
<br>
Calistra, I haven't heard as many complaints about other in-game encomomies as I have heard about EQ's.  Part of the problem is that it is so popular there are sometimes too many people playing and many playing for such a long time.  The other part of the problem is that verant handles the troubled economy by throwing tons of rare uber loot into the world and creates a massive inflation.  Now all that is fine, I suppose, except that it lead to my main dislike to EQ. <br>
EQ turned into an arms race at higher levels.  All anyone cared about in any of the groups I was in was what equipment you were wearing.  Period.  I played because I liked playing with my friends and I like the game play of EQ, and I loved pyaing my Enchanter in difficult situations.. mezzing and stunning and charming provided me lots of enjoyment.  I didnt want to stare at my monitor for hours on end trying to obtain some silly jacket or fuzzy slippers just because it gave me two extra intellegence.  <br>
Plus my general rule was that the people with the better equipment acted like numbnuts in groups.  <br>
I hope they fix this issue whith EQ2 because I really like the EQ world (and thus would love to play the paper RPG) andt he EQ gameplay (as well as some of the other games I have tired) but I hate makeing the high end game a constant arms race to have the nicest toys.  Playing keeping up with the Jones' is plagues me enough in real life... I dont want to have to do that in make believe life as well. <p>Viva la Revelution!! <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

My recent return brought about a nice savings of at least 50k with this new equipment i got thats a year old, but when I considered even buying it last year it was screaming expensive. Hell I dont even know what a l33t dr00d even uses anymore, but all I know, in a couple of days i went from the same equipment ive been using for a year and a 1/2 to not much less than what ehron is using. Also, stuff you wouldn't even consider even to other players, are now needed for trade skills, and those trade skill junkies are buying them by the droves. WHy, cause mastering trade skills now give out a usable item with nice stats just for getting 250 in that skill. <br>
The amount of &quot;cash loots&quot; that you just sell to the vendor has increased dramitacly, at all levels of the game. But these mobs tend to fall into the more difficult areas, but not always. <br>
<br>
Its not like your buying stock in the damn ingame economy that you can cash for retirement :P. I wouldn't recommend it. And like whatever in life, Keeping up with the jones is always a dissaterous route. And most people who talk about how l33t they are, are really just newbs anyways. I was in a level 20-30 zone the other week, and a group invited me and i was like what the heck. It was made up of a bunch of 30-34 level players, im like what thell are you morons doing here. And if course, they were all talkin about their &quot;alts&quot; and how bad they were. But they were level 34 in 20-30 zone... NEWBZ.<br>
Probably, the biggest problem, which is also the biggest plus too, is that there is soooooo much information on the boards, webpages, the internet that anyone can get some decent info on the game and make decisions on what to do in the game.  But what has happened is that its created like 50,000 mike mcgraws on everquest, not quite as angry as mike, but aparently they have achieved a level of knowledge of the game that mike can get from just reading a couple threads on a message board. <br>
And I havn't even made a negative comment about daoc, cause well I havn't even played the damn game yet, all I've seen is some screenshots and someone else playing it. All I'm doing is setting it straight as to what everquest is right now. <br>
And the only reason Im posting these massive replies is because, all the complaints from wayne and gabe are from when they stopped playing over a year ago. If this was a year ago, I would have been on their bandwagon trashing everquest too, but their complaints are no longer valid, due to the fact that those problems no longer exist. If any of the current players of everquest were to complain, i wouldn't jump their shit at all. <br>

<br>
and as for CR ; i HATE it a great deal, but i also think it is a good punishment for people who do something stupid and get them selves killed, it makes you play careful.<br>
<br>
to be honest i am not a big fan of online gaming in general, i would rather hang out with my friends in real life, me and matt camped a high end dragon in portal juts last week.<br>
and i am not even going to get started on the orcs in hopeyoulikit (sp)<br>
<br>
i would have to say out of everyone who has posted the person who most closely expressed my opninions is ken.<br>
<br>
so go read that <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=newmutant>newmutant</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.heavyhand.org/lilx.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elitist Wingnut</span><br>  Posts: 373<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(11/30/02 6:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=314.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.heavyhand.org/nm.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Matt's(Sarisk's) Pros and Cons of Online Games</span><hr size=1> Cons of DAoC... <br>
<br>
1. You don't really get a full feeling of what your class can really do until after the first ten levels or so. Since you can't actually become fully fledged in your class until you get level 5, grouping at early levels 1-8 or 1-10 or so can be a little annoying but those levels really don't take long anyway.<br>
<br>
2. Some horse rides, and not many, can take a little while to get where you are going. But if you are going somewhere to get a group or just get xp, its not a major concern. It's only when you have to go to one end of things and talk to a guy or kill a thing for a quest and go back to the other end of things.  But its still far far faster than walking.<br>
<br>
3. If you are just starting and coming over from another game it takes some adjusting to get used to it. Its a rather different system.  The character classes of Albion are fairly close to the classic idea of Fantasy Gaming, Wizards, clerics, etc... but Midgard and especially Hibernia classes will throw you a few curveballs (i.e. in Midgard the best healer is also a Crowd Control/Mez class but can't cast any damaging offensive spells). You actually have to take time to aim for archery and there aren't those in combat run speed buffs like EQ or AO has. And it takes some character planning.  Luckily Mythic has given you opportunities to reset your characters chosen specialization paths.<br>
<br>
Other than that I can't think of anything at the moment.   <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Now that is just scary.<br>
However, you have it wrong on a couple of points.  First off, I was playingup until the big Bizare update.  That is when Verant screwed me over witht he graphics crap.  So, up until then I know what I am talking about.  Second, I am not mindlessly bashing EQ (or praising DAoC without end) just giving my thoughts on the cons of the game.  The pros of it (and DAoC for that matter) are a huge long list.  But who wants to praise a game... its much more fun to tear down!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
EQ is a great game... pre-50ish.  After that, they have never been able to acheive the same satisfaction with the game.  Yes I know the improvments they have made, but it was fix all the higherups.  I may be fixed now, I dont know but itwasn't three months ago.<br>
<br>
Wonderboy wanted a con against DAoC... well this biggest for me was the point system.  In theory I liked it, but it was clear to me that it was a pain to have to plan from first level how to spend your spec points.  Now they may have fixed some of that now, but in the begining it was a major bummer to find out you would never ever ever ever be able to get skill x because you spent points in the wrong way when you started. The cool thing about it is that no two characters will be the same.  There are so many ways to spend points on your characters your healer wont just become another healer.<br>
<br>
on the issue of CR.... the AO and DAoC versions of poping back into life with your gear isnt' so bad.  You are still punished because you loose your Exp. However, you dont have to spend all that time just to get your body (and more importantly your gear) back.  Either way, in all most cases, you are running back to a spot, most likely to rejoin your group.  In one system you run back nekkid, and run the risk of dying again.  Pain the ass.  The other system you run back with your gear on you which you can use to protect yourself when you travel... not so pain in the ass.  Either way, you end up about the same... it just on how fashionable you are along the way.<br>
<br>
EQ has zones.  I hate zones.  Back in th eday it was necesary, now they are a major thorn in my side.  Other games, dont have zones, which creates less loading time and a more realist gaming environment.  No more of this whoops you can't chase me because I ran out the door crap. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Might make for some more interesting debate...<br>
<br>
Still feel the same way?<br>
<br>
Have you since quit the game you so loved before?<br>
<br>
<br>
-looks around and whistles-<br>
<br>
<br>
All I can say is that<br>
<br>
RL ended up being &gt; EQ.<br>
<br>
Plus... I don't know... EQ sort of fizzled out for me...<br>
<br>
I mean.. Only so many times can you log on to see everyone else out getting exp and you stuck in Velks with people you see in brell rants one time or another.<br>
<br>
Anyways... You guys still feel the same way?!<br>
