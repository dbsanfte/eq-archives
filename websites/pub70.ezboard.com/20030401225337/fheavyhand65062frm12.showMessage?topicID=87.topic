<br>
(This was posted first by me on Portent, but you guys deserve to have it here!)<br>
<br>
There they are... <br>
<br>
- No Squats <br>
<br>
- Necromunda will be re-released Aug/Sept 2003 <br>
<br>
- Lost and the Damned: Chaos traitor guard similar to those presented in Gaunt’s Ghost’s books. They will have access to demons and spawns. No time table on release. <br>
<br>
- Eye of Terror: WD 282 (UK) May-April <br>
Plastic Cadians will be released in May <br>
4 army lists: Legion of the Damned, Cadians, Ulthwe Strike <br>
Force, and the Wolfen (13th Lost legion) <br>
3 metal box sets, 3 variant box sets, Space Wolf battle force, <br>
Chaos mega-force <br>
<br>
Cool picture of map of the area. There will be 37 different war zones (planet, subsector, etc). Each game will be in whatever zone you wish. When you send the result in, it will be multiplied by a “secret” multiplier which is the size of the zone and its loyalty to the Emperor. The necrons and dark eldar will able to use any warzone they like, and will be involved in multiple sub-plots with the eldar. Tau, tyranids, and orks will wild cards with a limited warzone, and their results will go to expand their empires. If two of the same race fight each other, then it will go down as a loss for both. <br>
<br>
Andy hopes that this summer campaign will have lots of co-ordinated efferts when people will rally to defend zones that are falling to the enemy. <br>
<br>
Special Character: Cadian special character that have been seen are: Ursarkar Creeds and Jarren Kell. Ursarkar will be the leader of Cadia, once the attack begins and all of the current leaders bit the dust. <br>
<br>
The 13th Legion (Wulfen) they were lost 10,000 years ago in the warp and now have returned. Their armor will be a mix between pre-Heresy armor and Chaos armor that they have scavenged in their long trip through the warp. They will have very little armored support, but lots of bikes. <br>
<br>
Eldar Seer Council – metal box set <br>
Cadian Traitors – new minis <br>
Typhus (done by Goodwin) – new metal lord, very well done <br>
<br>
Cadian army list will be a bridge to the new Imperial Guard codex to be re-done (more on that later) <br>
<br>
Ulthwe Strike Force: light weight force, with not falcons, serpants, wraith lords, but lots and lots of bikes . <br>
<br>
The results from EoT will heavily determine the background for the release of fourth edition. <br>
<br>
New Assault Rules: The problems that people are having with the NAR: Independent characters are more vulnerable. Andy says this is the point and he likes it this way. The other problem that people are talking to him about is shooting at troops in transports once the transport is destroyed. I think he said that as the rules read now, you can’t shoot at that unit with the same unit that blew up the tank. Not too sure about this one.<br>
<br>
-New Vehicle Rules: <br>
They will be released in on the net first. <br>
Everyone at GW thinks that they were over zelous to fix the second edition rules that allowed a tank to run around the board shooting at will. Andy admits that third edition went to far and now tanks don’t shoot like they are supposed to. <br>
<br>
Weapons less that Str 5 (anti-personal weapons) can fire no matter how far the tanks move <br>
Weapons over Str 5 (anti-tank weapons) can fire one weapon if they move <br>
Ordinance can fire if it moved, but will scatter further. <br>
<br>
The other major rule, is that the Rhino Rush will be killed. Closed toped tanks will not be allowed to let their occupants disembark and charge on the same turn. Open-top vehicles will be able to though. Andy really dislikes the Rhino Rushing that has been going on, calling it “Space Marines on skate boards.” <br>
<br>
Changes will include adjusted damage tables, moving and shooting, and abolishing the rule that allows to disembark and assault in the same turn. <br>
<br>
Rule clarification: if a unit destroyes an enemy unit in the shooting phase, they may not choose to charge another unit. This is part of the effort to make units specialist in one area or another (i.e. shooting or assault) not both. The “fluff” reason why you cant is that everyone is busy congratulating themselves and not preparing to charge! <br>
<br>
The Land Raider Crusader might be allowed to let disembarking troops charge, since it is apart of its background. Nothing firm on this though. <br>
<br>
- Sisters of Battle: They will come out in the Witchhunters book, due out in winter of 2004. It will be similar to the Demon Hunters book, and you will be able to take all SoB armies if you like. <br>
<br>
There will NOT be any plastics released for the SoB. AC really wanted that to happen but here is why there won’t be plastic SoB’s. Goodwin doesn’t want to redo the line in plastics due to technical issues (i.e. the mold lines) and wont be able to recreate the effect that he has already achieved with the metal ones. So blame Goodwin on this one boys. <br>
<br>
They will add on to the range, so don’t throw away your old models. <br>
New plastic add on kits for the Immolator and Exorcists will appear closer to the release. <br>
Codex: Alien Hunters due out 2005 <br>
The Ordo Codexes will not allow the use of other Ordo’s when the rest of the codexes come out. <br>
<br>
- Re-Do Codexes and Army Updates: <br>
<br>
These will all be done in the long term, they will compatible with the Fourth Edition, when it is released. This is not a cyclic re-do of codexes. Therefore, they will not be re-done in the same order as initial release. <br>
<br>
Codex: Battle zone. The next one will about fighting in space and on space hulks. However, it will take 3-4 years before it is released. City fight took this long says Andy. They wanted to name it Codex: Darkside, but Lucas Arts has that word so copyrighted it isn’t funny! <br>
<br>
Space Marines will be first to get a re-do codex. <br>
New whirlwind out soon, the masters were sent out this past week. <br>
Vidicator: there are plans, but don’t expect anything soon <br>
Plastic Termies: they will be released with the re-do Space Marine codex. No time given on when this will happen. There was a big fight with the “bean counters” Andy said because there are already plastic termies, and the “bean counters” were not hip to redo the plastic figures. Andy is fighting for us on this one, and they will be done. <br>
<br>
Baal Predator: release March 2003 <br>
The re-do codex will make vet squads better and will go explore traits of other chapters more. They will get “skills” like hate (name enemy here) and stuff like that. It will make the other chapters have more character. However, Ultramarines will become the basic Space Marines in the universe. The new codex will flesh out the background more and more. <br>
<br>
Tyranids: more plastics <br>
<br>
Orks: no redo-codex; Andy is happy with the three lists the orks have now, they might get an article in White Dwarf some day about using clan specific armies, but they will be based on the current lists and will not get anything special. <br>
Plastic gretchin: Andy wants them, but having a hard time convincing the “bean counters” <br>
<br>
IG codex: late 2004 <br>
<br>
Crimson Fist: no rules specific to them, but they might get an IA article <br>
<br>
Tau: no new war gear. Some new tanks from Forge World from the Fire Warrior game. The organic battle suit is in the works, but nothing scheduled at the moment. Corrupted Tau?: Not any more. There was some discussion in the past, but that project has been dumped. <br>
<br>
Iron Hands got a lot of talk. There may or may not be some connection to the C’Tan. Andy wasn’t talking much about their future. They might get some metal parts to compliment the plastic space marine box set, in a year or so. <br>
<br>
Eldar: No plastic wraithguard. Harlequins: no current plans, AC is keen to do something with them, but at the moment, there are no plans to add them to the redo Eldar codex. This is contrary to what I reported from Games Day this past year. Seems that the small changes in points costs have “fixed” the need for a redo at the moment. So push back the release date for the new Eldar codex by a long time. <br>
A plastic Wave Serpent is in the works. <br>
Exudites are history. Say goodbye. Andy says that the idea is to expand the number of races in warhammer, not to expand on the races that are out now. Armies like Eldar have enough already, so plans to expand them any more aren’t going to happen. <br>
Someone complained that Eldar skimmers suck. Andy’s response: “Bloody Rot!” He continues to bash Eldar player. <br>
<br>
New races you say? Well mum is the word on them. They are most likely years into the future. Andy told an amusing story that Goodwin wants to do some all clear crystal plastic race (this is the side effect of those Necron rods ). Andy thinks that it would look cool, but wont happen. <br>
<br>
Arbites: nothing new planned for them, don’t expect these guys to appear in 40K again. AC says that their future will be limited to Necromunda. <br>
<br>
Special Characters: Not all special characters will get models. However, in the future, the number of special characters in the codexes will be limited to the number that they can sculpt. I asked Andy if there as a Lucius the Eternal model in the works. He said that they “almost got one done in time for Eye of Terror, but we didn’t.” So, the future of Lucius is in doubt. Andy went on to say that they now have 14 sculptors, but only 4 that are capable of doing a special character like Lucius (can anyone say Cortez?) <br>
<br>
Space Skaven?: No. AC says that in the beginning, 40K was fantasy in space. Now, things are different. However, the Hurd are still avaible to be released, and just might be. <br>
<br>
Index Astartes: get ready for more IA other than founding chapters. IA: monastery, chaplains, and more were mentioned. Add your own IA: underwear jokes here. <br>
<br>
Necrons: The rumored new C’Tan will not appear in the Eye of Terror. Maybe his own campaign in a couple of years. <br>
<br>
Someone asked a question about Negash. I looked for the nearest exit. <br>
<br>
Question to AC, what he thought was the best army: Orks (duh), he added that he thought that Space Marines were the best overall in terms of killing ability. <br>
Another question about the best Space Marine chapter. Andy said that he thought that Blood Angles and Black Templar were easy to manipulate and defeat if you were a good general. Thus, he thinks that Ultramarines are the best Space Marine chapter. <br>
<br>
- Demon Hunters: <br>
He said release of May 2003. That was the only new info that he talked about. Andy did say that we wanted to convey the “toughness and strength” of an Inquisitor should be represented on the battlefield by the size of his retinue. Thus the retinue rules that we see now. <br>
<br>
New Scenery: April 2003 will have the first nicely painted resin terrain. It will be boxed and will be very nice. However, the cost is yet to be reveiled. This is big experiment and will basically be available to the gamer with some money to spare for their scenary. <br>
<br>
June 2003: vac-form two-toned terrain will be released. It will be bagged and at a very reasonable price and will provide a good margin (so the “bean counters” are happy). <br>
<br>
-Army Builder: <br>
June 2003 White Dwarf will re-release the Army Builder. I was called the Interactive Army List, but Andy constantly reffered to it as Army Builder. I wonder what Lone Wolf has to say about this. <br>
There will be 2 CD’s. One for the followers of the Emperor, and one for the enemies of the emperor. These will not replace any codexes, but will be supported correctly this time around.<br>

"Here's a new army with nifty rules: but you gotta use lots of bikes!"  Yeah, well, the rules can't be <b>that</b> nifty.  I do my defendin' of the Webway with a full Ulthwe mobilization of Farwinkle's task force.  (He's currently riding his fleet in hard from the Gothic Sector.) <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#DC143C;font-size:small;">Bungabunga &lt;Heavy Hand&gt;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->52 Troll Beastlord<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->&quot;Have Gator, will travel.&quot;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

Some of these fixes have been a long time comming. Too bad i have already abandoned the game to Warhammer and Gothic. The SMs and Chaos are not fun too play against and are broken.<br>

<br>
However, Marines and Chaos Space Marines are not broken.  Being popular doesn mean they are broken.  They have some great rules, but they are the most expensive models in the game.  All other races will out number them.  Believe me, I'd take my Orks against Marines any day and will stand a fair chance.   <p>Viva la Revelution!! <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>
