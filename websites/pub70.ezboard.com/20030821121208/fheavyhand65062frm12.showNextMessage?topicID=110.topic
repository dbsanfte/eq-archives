<b>Disturbance on Lethe<br>
Finale</b><br>
<br>
	Atop Mount Terra, an imposing peak outside the Imperial city of Turkenton Point on the feral planet of Lethe, an infernal council is convened.  Their purpose is to determine the extent of their victory on this planet.  A few weeks ago, they learned of the re-awakening of the Flame Falcon chapter with the rediscovery of their lost primarch, Owen Burgess.  They each contacted their loyal forces that in turn contacted their respective allies.  Their purpose, to distract the Imperials from the growing threat in the faraway Cadian system and possibly to take this primarch for themselves.  All signs point to a victory for the forces of disorder.  A heated debate now wages, the god Slaneesh seeking to employ a sinister and sadistic plan.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
<i>“I do not like this idea Slaneesh,” the avatar of Tzeentch, the demonic sorcerer Veneficas, said flatly.  “We have won a great victory on this planet.  Our allies and our minions have stalled the Imperials and forces for order and weakened them.  The Despoiler should have no trouble with his campaign into the Cadian system.  What does this last fiasco seek to accomplish?  Surely, this has nothing to do with your failure to control the Inquisitor Mastilius, and his failure to destroy the Flame Falcons.”<br>
	“That is not true, and the facts remain that this plan is quite simple, my brother,” the avatar of Slaneesh, known simply as Doctor Gabe replied smoothly.  “Those you see below you have done their duty, that is for certain.  Why can’t we have a little fun with them as they mop up the remaining Imperial forces?”<br>
	“I must side with the forces of Tzeentch on this matter,” sickeningly gurgled Nurgle’s avatar, Phlegm Mossbeard.  “This is meaningless.  You just want to have a little sick fun with those who have proved themselves worthy.”<br>
	“Shut up, you boil ridden pansy,” shouted Ray Age, the avatar of Khorne.  “This plan is perfect!  The remaining Imperials will slaughter each other like cattle.  True, some of the forces of Chaos will do likewise and all on this planet will surely die.  However, I see no problem in this.”<br>
	“You would think so, you blood crazed fool,” replied Veneficas.  “You have nothing to lose here; none of your followers deemed it necessary to participate in our war on this planet.  I will lose several worthy Thousand Sons Marines to this plan, as well as one of my finest sorcerous prodigies.  Plus, their remarkably efficient and powerful Dark Eldar allies will surely also perish.”<br>
	“I understand what you mean,” Doctor Gabe calmly said, “but you must admit, you could not have realistically thought they would survive this encounter.  The planting of so many warp gates has left us all strapped for power, and we have lost many demons, sacrificed in a vain attempt to hold off the Imperial’s last stand.  Simply cast the spell, and we will see who is truly the greatest force remaining on this planet.  They will die with honor and glory, what more could they ask,” Doctor Gabe asked seductively.<br>
	“Very well, just keep away from me,” Veneficas said warily.  “You give me the creeps when you talk that way.  I will warn you, the casting of a spell of this magnitude and force will most certainly shake apart the very fiber of this planet’s reality.  Even the winner of your little game will probably be lost forever in the warp.”<br>
	“I still don’t see a problem with this plan,” Ray Age exclaimed.</i><br>
**********<br>
<br>
	<i>“Sir, we have beaten back the Black Legion,” hurriedly reported Vet. Sergeant Bill Munny of the Desert Fist.  “The psyker sent from the ship has told us that one of the prisoners knew the reason for this engagement.  It seems that the forces of disorder have meant this as a diversion, to draw our forces away from an upcoming invasion of the Cadian System.  It seems they had no interest in finding Primarch Burgess”<br>
	“This does not bode well for our forces here and on our homeplanet,” Chaplain Rommel replied calmly.  “We were stationed on the planet El’Phanor after Abaddon’s destruction of the inhabitants and spoiling of its terrain to help the Cadian defense.  We must get word back to our homeplanet.  Make preparations to leave immediately.”<br>
	“But, sir, we have lost all communication with the ship.  A terrible warp storm is brewing and is destroying our communications.”<br>
	Rommel stole a glance to the forces of Crazy Phil and a local Imperial force camped nearby.  “Quickly, get word of this evil to all of the other Imperial forces.  They must be alerted.  All forces should immediately escape in whatever craft we can find in the city space docks.  Make sure Owen Burgess is loaded in my rhino and kept safe.”<br>
	“Sir, look at the sky.”<br>
	As the forces of the Desert Fist looked around them, the world itself seemed to die, the sky going black.  As the sun returned, the landscape changed.  Where once stood mighty mountains and stretches of forest, now stood monuments to the Chaos gods and twisted copses of unnatural colors.  Rivers and streams were turned to oily blood and bile.  But worst of all, the camp was surrounded by the hated forces of the Iron Warriors, all advancing towards the heart of the city.<br>
	“Well, gentleman.  It seems we must fight our way off this detestable planet.”</i><br>
**********<br>
<br>
	<i>“The casting is complete my brothers,” Veneficas stated.  “Everyone on the planet now sees the terrain as the worst imaginable.  Additionally, they will see every other force they encounter as their worst enemy.”<br>
	“Let the fun begin,” Doctor Gabe said, licking his lips in excitement.</i> <p>&quot;... whereever you rub it, it always feels better, ...&quot; - Brak<br>
