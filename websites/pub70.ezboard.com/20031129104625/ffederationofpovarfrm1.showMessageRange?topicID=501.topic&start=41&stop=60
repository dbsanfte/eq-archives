<br>
It isn't just hateful feelings. And these boards are real people communicating, not a game. Sure, it relates to said game, but this guy came out of the woodwork and just blatantly attacked Vigdis and her RL. No apology, nothing. <br>
<br>
If I were you I'd de tag his ass and send him back to the Arbiters where he belongs. But I'm not you, so do as thou wilt. <br>

&quot;If I accept what you say at face value, then in real life Wulf is a person who &quot;choses to play his character&quot; to hurt someone's feelings by ridiculing her game character, real life history, real life personality, and real life career.&quot; <br>
<br>
If I in any way hurt your feelings in RL then you have my sincere apologies.I know to all of you this is a serious post but I myself found all of it funny as hell and only posted what i did to see how ignorant your guildies would get(i was successful) But if what I posted actually did hit home so to speak on any level then accept or not I am sorry. In game aye i am a smartass quite a bit, us warriors are proud and strong bla bla bla but never did i intend to belittle you in RL in anyway, I still think you , dindawen and i think that noobs name was montyhoe(who tried to grow a brain) are a bunch of ass munchies who still havent read the manual that came with the ebay account,......in game. But outside all that i'm sure ya'll good peeps. In any event my apologies Vigdis if i got too personal, what i thought was funny at the time cleary was not. ....Wulfebane Out<br>

if you thought you were successful in bringing out the worst in people, you failed miserably.  and if you thought your agenda was clever, that failed too.  that you were trying to provoke people into a fight that would permit Legion to back out was clear from the start.  after all, every single one of your 8 posts was aimed at insulting the two most active people in Unhomed, a guild that everyone has known stands with its own, and the attacks turned very viscious.  i'm sorry, wulf, but you do not get to call me names, insinuate i was not loved as a child, make fun of my profession, and tell me that i make people sick ... and then apologize for the meanness when you realize it actually hurt. i believe you absolutely meant to belittle me and hurt me, you just didn't expect me to admit that it did.   <br>
<br>
every single one of my guildies who has posted in the last two days in response to one of your snide personal remarks did so purely to defend one of their guildmates who was in need.  they proved that they are loyal, dedicated, strong, and kind people. <br>
<br>
dindawen's goal with his posts was clear but in case you missed it ... he posted immediately smart ass remarks in order to take the heat away from me and place it directly on himself.  this was a position that he does not relish but stoicly placed himself in nonetheless.<br>
<br>
montegue had a slightly different tact for he spoke with me after i had spent a day crying.  his goal was purely to paint a picture of the true asshole you were being so that i would understand that the attacks were not to be believed and were merely an agenda pushed by a mean spirited and careless human being.  this, too, i doubt he appreciated doing for monte is a very kind person with a world full of empathy in real life. <br>
<br>

You need more then words to make amends.  Rather then offer up a way to fix things one of your officers attacked someone else and caused this issue to escolate out of control.  EQ is a game, but there are real people playing it, and there feelings are hurt when you or anyone else does something to is disrespectful to them be it in game or not.  Wulf's Actions are clearly an insult to your guild yet you ignore him, Llaph even seems to blame us for encouraging him.  If he were a member of Raven he would be the only Tank, and after these posts he would be guildless.  I would rather beg a warrior who has her epics 'in the wrong hands' to tank then to deal with the embarassment of that fool being assosiated with me.  I think it looks poorly on LoOF that in light of what happened none of you have stepped up to try to distance the guild from his actions.  Throughout this past week I've seen nothing in the way of makeing amends for your actions from either little folk, or other folk.  you have Excuses when there are none, you attack others in a hurtful manor and claim it be jokeing after the damage has been done.  The way it seems to me is that Legion does not wish to be held responsible for there actions and so they backed out with a few appologies for there actions thinking to put a bandaid on what ever wound was caused.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ravensoul52>Ravensoul52</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#70DB93>(1/17/03 8:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *sigh*</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

How about YOUR GUILD stop encouraging him and fucking punish him for this shit! I had no Idea he was an officer!!!<br>
<br>
By trying to gloss over what he has done, you dig your guild's reputation further and further down. <br>
<br>
Do I want a little justice for this asshole? You're damn right I do. Somebody ban his ass from these boards. At least then I wouldn't have to listen to his shite.<br>

And LOOF, this is the first time I've ever witnessed you guys harboring and encouraging a member to be an ass. How the times have changed.<br>

We have way too many people who want the final word on a topic, I can think of 6-7 who'll be itching to post after they read this /resist that fuggin urge.<br>
<br>
On a final personal note I've know Vig for a while, would sorta say we're friendly without being friends don't send her tells all the time or anything but the level of abuse shes been subjected to both on this board and in fedchat is unreal and makes me a little ashamed of other people I know who I also consider friends.<br>

The personal attacks have to stop here and now, it gains us nothing.<br>
<br>
The Fed can still perform a function for us and all the member guilds. I say that as an officer for DL there is still more to gain by staying a part of it than going it alone.<br>
<br>
We need some quiet time to plan and regroup and decide how best to approach it, so rather than spending the next 10 mins thinking of a good insult or a clever put down to make a person cry or some aloof comment that makes us think you're above it all use that high school education to come up with an idea or a plan to put it behind us and take us forward.<br>
<br>
There thats a challenge for ya.<br>

You and your little troup of goofballs can keep this thread going as long as you wish, All i know is I am running out of popcorn and that isnt cool ! While your guildies are still somewhat moronic in there post against me it almost beats comedy central, but ya'l lare running head to head with the cartoon network. You can twist anything i say in any which way you like, in the end all you are doing is wearing down your fingernails and wasting gametime so to speak. This can end on any level you want it too guys/gals I agree with some of the posts as much as the next to just let it die out and move on, i said my BS, you guys said yours, i'm game to let it be.<br>

CoNgRaTuLaTiOnS to Vori for his epic.<br>
<br>
You all seem to have forgotten that he's a good guy that deserved to get his epic.  Sucks that a Fed raid was planned and yes I think it was bad form for LOLF and OF to jump in on the mob.  FFS get over.  Lets kick a dead horse while its down.  Hell kick it 4 times for me if that makes you all feel better.  I'm ashamed to be apart of the Fed with this behavior.  I mean the behavior from ALL sides.  If you want to act like children do it else where.<br>
<br>
That's my opinion.  If you don't like it too bloody bad! <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.mchsi.com/~deviaant/Melianna.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
