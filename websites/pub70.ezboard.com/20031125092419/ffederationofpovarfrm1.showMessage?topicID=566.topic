<br>
<br>
On the topic of New stuff... heard that a really cool thing is being tried out on Test Server and should make it to us all soon in a patch... Two more Bank Slots. Now I know.. big deal you say.. two more slots, 20 more places withs bags in them. Kicker that makes them so cool... the two slots will be shared by all your toons on that server. That means... I get a nifty plus 10 wis, Roar of Winter procing club on a raid with Tiger. I hit a bank, toss the club into a bag in those two slots, and camp out. Awaken Tigger, hit the bank and pull the club out! Woot! No more needing to bother folks for transfers. It will be limited, as No drop items will not be allowed in those slots, as well as if any of your up to 8 toons has a lore item that same lore item won't be able to go in those slots. I haven't heard yet how this is working with coin... If there is a second coin pool all toons can access or if you simply take a small loss in resale value and buy gems to share coin between toons... (ie... for both Tiger and Tigger.. Peridots can be sold to Vendors for 9.5 Plat... and can be bought for 11 easy way to share cash at a slight loss if no one is about to do a coin transfer).<br>
<br>
Hmmmm... Not so happy news off the test server..<br>
<br>
Under 45's no longer being affected by group or Mass buffs of any kind that are over level 50 spells. ie... no more C3, POTG, Ageo, etc.... If you have Mid level toons and use this stuff... (coughs and glances over at Tigger) Better level dang fast to 45 or start learning NOW to do without... Next Patch is scheduled for June 4th... That may be the day...<br>

to play EQ anymore without C3, and their knowledge of<br>

  Aye.. I do agree.. personally, as grumbly as I will be at first about it, I do think it is a good idea.  Currently, Level's 1-20 or so are an absolute joke... (for those availing themselves of the aforementioned buffs).  I can speak of this in firsthand knowledge, as Tiger is my Main.. a melee fighter straight up.  Once I reached 50, I decided I really wanted to start a caster to help me understand the Game better...  How it takes a while for mana regen, how they switch between spells, how casting times vary etc.  Having done this has dramatically help my game with Tiger...  and been a hoot playing Tigger.  That said, I had absolutly no desire to have Tigger follow in Tiger's strict footsteps.  I didn't Twink Tiger at all or accept twinks... he earned all he has on him through many, many deaths LOL.  So when I started Tigger, it was time to create a poster boy for twinkdom...  As he's just recently dinged into 35, he's caught up to his gear in my opinion...  and has been cutting way back on his C3 usage (having heard rumors of this coming about a month ago).<br>
<br>
  This will definatly clear up the Nexus a touch...  and allow the Higher end casters to traverse the land without 15 tells an hour from DruidDood  demanding buffs...  and with folks actually needinbg to learn their class better, there might be more folks doing quests...  YAY!<br>

<br>
ok got that out of my system.<br>
<br>
One of the biggest challenges that I have in game as a tradeskiller is getting materials for the tradeskills.  I can farm with Von or Muratt but I hate the loss of exp to someone who could use it.  I also think its a waste to go around hitting spiderlings for 56 pts of damage and then haveing my fluxblade axe proc for 150 on top of that.<br>
<br>
This will be great for me in that I have characters from lv 16 to lv 55 and I will now be able to go into a win win situation.  I wont be farming anymore.  I can sellect the character that will get exp and then get the materials I need with them.<br>
<br>
Im kinda indifferent about the buff thing.  My 2 main toons are over lv 45 and the ones under are primarily tank/melee type anyway.  Im not saying that aego or c3 doesnt help but the down side is that we are now getting a proliferation of the &quot;greedy caster&quot; types that the game can do without.<br>
<br>
I offer up Cam as an example of the OPPOSITE of this.  I see him casting C3 in pok mostly and have never seen him turn someone away because their &quot;donation&quot; was too small.  I have seen others turn people away and have been turned away for not haveing a big enough donation.  Others set minimum donation levels in order for them to cast a buff.  For spells with material components I can understand (hehe paid 1.2k for dots on the first big raid i lead) but c3, potg, and most shammy buffs dont have material components.<br>
<br>
The primary loss in this &quot;no uber buffs for those under lv 45&quot; is gonna be to people like me who have a low tolerance for idiots.  I would rather solo my lv 24 chanter than get in a group with a player that repeatedly breaks my mezzes and whines about waiting for me to med up. (hehe ask stragus in game what we do to people that repeatedly break mezes.  can you say &quot;death touch&quot;? I knew you could.)  I am gonna have a slower turn around time for mana in my casters and as a result I will level slower.  This might be learning the class but for me its translates into more time to do housework while i med.  There are only so many games of gems that i can play and still keep my sanity.<br>

von... um... your shaman is over 34 now, right? <br>

<br>
Yes Bulow is now 34 (might be 35 now not sure) but im looking for the win win here.  I.e. materials and experience instead of just materials.  Hehe I think its far more fun when there is an element of danger involved.  I can take Von to the Tene mts and can now hold and clear the laborer cave solo but its far more fun to take Muratt there and get the exp/materials combo.  Running around whith a dozen mobs following me isnt funn unless they can take me out.  Otherwise its just work and i came to play<br>

originally i had thought of a postal system where you could send things to people through NPC's... like just adding a post office in all the towns. then i came up with something simpler like the interchangeable bank slot. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>
