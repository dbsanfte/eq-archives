I enjoy the game itself as well as painting many of the excellent miniatures that have been released for the system. The quick answer to your question is:<br>
<br>
No, you do not need to own The Fellowship system rules in order to play the Lord of the rings miniatures game. All you need is the Two Towers. The rulebook in the two towers gives a full, updated set of rules for the entire game. Plus given the full stats and point values for every character which appears in the Two Towers movie, plus Boromir, the ringwraiths, men of gondor, Sauron, and cave trolls. Several characters, who do not appear in the Two Towers, but were in Fellowship, are not in the Two Towers rulebook, such as Gil-Galad, Lurtz, Bilbo, Elendil, and Isildur. (therefore if you wanted to include these in your LoTR army, then you would need the Fellowship book)<br>
<br>
Bottom line, Two Towers gives you all the updated rules and stats on everybody except a small few who were not in the second book, plus the stats have changed for some stuff from the Fellowship to Two Towers, such as men of gondor are now cheaper and Gimli being given throwing axes.<br>
<br>
LoTR is a fantastic game, IMO because it is an easy game to learn, but can get quite complex and strategic in a hurry when you really think about what you are doing. Folks down at the store got to learn how fast the new riders of Rohan are and how tough the uruk hai can get in my basic demo last week. Next week I plan on running the Rescue of Merry and Pippin at the store for all comers(if I can get Eomer finished in time)<br>
<br>
As far as I know at this point, I'm the only one who has any painted miniatures, so when I want to play, I have to assemble and paint both armies. However, interest has picked up around the store and several folks have discussed starting LoTR armies. Some have also purchased some figs and getting ready to start painting (**crosses fingers**).<br>
<br>
Hope that fills you in on the status of the game both as a developing system and its status with our local gamers.<br>
<br>
One side note, I read in White Dwarf that the current LoTR project GW is writing is Shadow and Flame, which introduces Dwarven Armies to LoTR. Those should be dead 'ard.<br>
<br>
One final note: if other Heavy Handers have any questions about the game, post it! I'll be glad to answer any questions, and as this post can attest, I have no qualms about going on and on about what a great miniatures game it is.<br>

With the release of the new minis and the release of the ultra mega cool extended DVD my interest in LotR has hit an all time high.  Not to mention the minis have become friggin awesome!!<br>
<br>
However, I know ask this (becuase the staff at the local GW store are the equals to a certain former worker at Gallops and only tells me to buy this because it is new and cool) does one make an &quot;army&quot; of only one type of troop, i.e. Riders of Rohan or can they be mixed with Wood Elves for example?  <br>
<br>
Also, would it be possible to post some quickie ads/disads of the basic troops for each side?  Something to the likes of a newbie guide to the Two Towers. Just some passing thoughts.<br>

<br>
If you want good advice on how to create a point based army, check out WHite Dwarf 273. It suggests 500 points, and no more than 50% characters and no more than 50% missle weapons. No Balrog or Sauron. Limit 2 cave trolls. I am building several armies right now in 500 point blocks. Taking a look at the releases out now and in the near future, here are some sample ideas for army building:<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai : swordsmen, pikemen, bowmen, bezerkers, Lurtz, standard captains, Saruman, seige teams, crossbowmen<br>
<br>
Rohirrim: Riders, footmen (axes, swords, bows, spears) Eomer, Theoden, plus mounted models of Gandalf, Aragorn, Theoden, and Legolas and Gimli<br>
<br>
Gondor: Isildur, Elendil, men of Gondor (swords, spears, bows) plus generic captains.<br>
<br>
High Elf: 2 handed swords, bows,spears, Elrond, Gil Galad, captains<br>
<br>
Wood elf: bowmen, Haldir, captains<br>
<br>
Mordor Orc: Orcs on foot with spears, swords, bows, 2 handed weapons. cave trolls, Ringwraiths, Warg Riders<br>
<br>
Moria Goblins: spears, swords, bows, generic captains, cave trolls<br>
<br>
Rangers of Gondor: Faramir, Damrod, ranger bowmen, Aragorn<br>
<br>
Moria Goblins, High elves, Uruk Hai, Rohir, Men of Gondor are all particular appealing because they have a good selection of plastic models<br>
<br>
As far as army composition, prety much as long as you don't mix good models with evil models, anything goes. Many times such a mix can be found in the books themselves. ( Last alliance of men and elves; Uruks, orcs, and goblins fighting in Pellinnor fields against Men of Gondor and Riders of Rohan; The witch king's army of Angmar consisting of Uruks, orcs, and goblins.)( The only restriction is good vs. evil)<br>
<br>
As to the attributes of the troops, it depends on what strikes your fancy. Here's a quick rundown:<br>
<br>
Uruks: tough, hard fighters, but expensive points for foot models, well armored (think of them as Chaos space marines of LoTR)<br>
<br>
Riders of rohan: average human stats but the new cavalry rules and throwing weapon rules makes them devastating on the charge (think of them like Empire knights with bows and lighter armor) See Men of Gondor for a description of their foot troops.<br>
<br>
Men of Gondor : average human with moderate points costs and good selection of weapons (think of them like  Space marine scouts: not quite a space marine, but better then an imperial guardsmen.<br>
<br>
Wood Elves: much better shooting than fighting in hand to hand (think of these like Imperial guard: can fight when they have to but would rather sit back and fill you full of holes)<br>
<br>
High elves: probably, stat wise, the best all round troops for good guys, but can be expensive (these are your Imperial space marines)<br>
<br>
Mordor Orcs: as good as humans in fighting, but not as good in shooting or courage (basically like every orc you ever dealt with)<br>
<br>
Moria Goblins: weedy, weak, but cheap cheap cheap (much like every goblin you ever dealt with.)<br>
<br>
One thing good armies have in spades is heroes. Heroes can play a huge role in a battle, just watch aragorn in action sometime! The downside is heroes can eat up points quickly, but have the ability to turn the battle at critical points. Gandalf the White is 200 points all by himself!<br>
<br>
Hope taht gives you a feel for the types of troops available. If you have any follow up questions, don't hesitate!<br>

25 Mens of Gondor w/ sword &amp; shield<br>
8 Mens of Gondor w/ spear &amp; shield<br>
8 Mens of Gondor w/ bows<br>
12 Rangers of Gondor<br>
<br>
and to round out my Gondor heroes later:<br>
Boromir<br>
Foromir<br>
Isildur<br>
Damrod<br>
Aragorn<br>
<br>
This is gonna be a shitload of points, but I'm not really building up to an exact points force, but rather to have a neat set of Gondor models.  I'll probably supplement them with some Rohan once I'm done painting all the Mens, so as to be ready for some Minis Tirith next year... <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:#DC143C;font-size:small;">Bungabunga &lt;Heavy Hand&gt;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->45 Troll Beastlord<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->&quot;Have Gator, will travel.&quot;<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
