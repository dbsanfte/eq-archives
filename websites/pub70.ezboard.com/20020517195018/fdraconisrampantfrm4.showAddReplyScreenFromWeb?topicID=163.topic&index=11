Back to work. Kinda.<br>
<br>
Tonight's Plans: <br>
<br>
There are no scheduled hunts tonight. The reasons for this are:<br>
<br>
A) There is a scheduled Runnyeye raid every night until Friday, followed by a two day hunt in Kurn's Tower.<br>
B) There is an open invitation raid on Lord Nagafen tonight, which is where I myself will be attending. Starts around 6 Central, I believe, and open to anyone of at least 46 levels, I think it is.<br>
<br>
There may be plans for ED hunting tomorrow night, depending on the amount of feedback I get on the matter. Many of our ED players will be preoccupied in Runnyeye still, so I will not intervene.<br>
<br>
Other Matters:<br>
<br>
I've been getting alot of requests on places that soandso would like to hunt, recently. I'll touch on what I can remember, in a second. But the thing I want ye's to keep in mind, when reading these, is this: My primary job, as your Huntmaster, is to give you all a place to hunt. To give you a spot to level, and earn some cash, all with the company of your fellow Draconians. Camping such and such item, whether it be quest related, or some powerful rare drop, don't necessarily fall under my responsibility. So, with that in mind, no calling me a biased jerk, if I say no to your ED hunt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If there's any real bit of info that I might be biased because of, it would be how much you've participated with your fellow ED &amp; Dragons. So far, we haven't had much of a problem on that matter. Anyways...<br>
<br>
Sumalaen: Two requests thus far, one for camping the FBSS in LGuk for him, the other for collecting Ry'Gorr Chain for his Alt Rogue. I'm sorry Sum, but for the Ry'Gorr thing, I'm going to have to say no, to scheduling a hunt <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>just</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> for the purpose of twinking your new Alt out in Ry'Gorr Chain. *shrugs* It's just not my job; your rogue is neither a Dragon, nor Elder Dragon. If he was one of us, then sure, I would give it the go-ahead, although I think at ED level he might be a bit old for the stuff, heh. If we can combine it with, say, the Egg hunt, as someone suggested in that one thread, maybe I'll reconsider. This doesn't mean you, yourself, can't schedule a hunt for it for him, either. Just means that I won't be doing so for you.<br>
<br>
As for the FBSS, that's somewhat of a special case. Frenzy in LGuk is one of those perma-camps, camped nearly 24/7. We wouldn't be able to just waltz in and start camping once everyone arrives online. If you could somehow manage to grab the camp once you know it's open, then you're all good to call in some of us for reinforcements. Otherwise, I'd have to say you'd be better off hanging out in LGuk to camp one yourself, or just buying one.<br>
<br>
Multiple People: Snow Griffon Eggs in Eastern Wastes. Although I don't have too much of an objection to this, I must say that I prefer we no longer do this without bringing a tracker. Also, we've had a recent slew of Luclin hunts being requested. These have all sounded pretty much okay with me, just try to help us out on getting prepped for these; suppliy info on who/what we'll need to bring, what'll we be doing, and so on, so that we can get this set up successfully.<br>
<br>
Okay, all that being covered, is there anyone else still sidelined (unable to get online) for the time being? <p>~<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=136883"><b>GAZ</b></a>, Craknek Warrior<BR>

<br>
Lythandar and myself went to the Nagafen raid. Lythandar arrived first, and participated in clearing the Fire Giants out of the way while everyone else was still on the way. I came in as they finished setting up groups, and managed into group two, meaning I'd be one of the first ones fighting Naggy.<br>
<br>
The fight was a good one, I managed to keep my death-free streak on these raids alive, by surviving the fight with 27/3378 hps remaining. Lythandar wasn't so lucky, as I saw him get summoned over, burnt in the AOE Fire Blast, and chomped. The drops were 2 Red Scales (Warrior and Bard Epics), a Bladestopper, a Heirophant's Crook, and 2 Blights, Hammers of Scourges.<br>
<br>
Tonight's Plans:<br>
<br>
Going to step aside to let those of you still raiding Runnyeye have fun. No plans for ED tonight.<br>
<br>
Also, many more open-invitation dragon raids on the Horizon. For the Lords of Truth raids, there is a Lady Vox raid this Thursday at 6 Central, and another Lord Nagafen slaying this Friday same time. Next week, a newcomer named Tayk has scheduled 2 of these raids as well. It is unknown to me how he plans to handle the loot procedures, as he listed none. I'm going to stay away from the first one, which is next Tuesday, May 14th, at 5 Central. I'll ask Keskan how it goes, as I see him on the roster for the event currently. Tayk is also holding his Vox raid on Thursday, May 16th. Finally, there are two more LoT dragon raids in two weeks, once again on Tuesday, May 21st, and Vox on Thursday, May 23rd.<br>

Ok I may leave something out but this is just of the top of my head.<br>
<br>
Several of us have been gathering stuff for the Luclin armor quests I believe that  Magik's servant Pakratt and Carie's Librarian Fkiny have a long list of Items we need to complete the quests and have some of them in the bank. I would suggest that this be an ongoing type of thing since  the creatures that drop the needed items are VERY random and we will certainly need a tracker ( IE Pip and or Illandriel) to do this right. looking at the list of what we have the ONLY item we have two of the required pieces for is the wizards staff. We might want to go get Lythander that staff first. I would suggest we centralize storage of these Items with the Dagger's servants and as we get close to the items as a group decide who will get the first ones ( we only have a multiplicity of warriors so we warriors can arm wrestle for them or something.hehe) All that being said, The hidden area in twilite might be good exp for all involved and a place with enough pulls for two groups easily.<br>
Ditto for the shadow island in twilite. one group could set up by the wizzy tower and on on the other island by the inn. <br>
<br>
second, there are also twilite armor drops in scarlet desert and Magik and Illandriel both need to get somethig from the sun revenant king.  Most of what is in scarlet is blue to lite blue but there is a lot of it and easy to pull. And the revenants at least were good exp for me. <br>
<br>
Third, there is Dawnshroud and Maidenseye. Dawnshroud has twilite armor drops but the adds are horrendous and the exp isnt all that good. We will need to just look on track as we run through. <br>
Maidenseye seem to be a good place to hunt for us. Challenging, good exp, and has some drops we need for those wis sheilds. <br>
<br>
Forth, Mons Letalis. This place also has drops for the twilite armor and many other things besides, again very good exp when I was there with Magik and Illandriel. I think a full group wouldn't have had the trouble we did.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fifth, Tenebreous. I still want to camp some vamps. There are many twilite drops at those camps as well. as well as that spear quest we can still complete for those who have gotten all their &quot;skin samples&quot; in the Katta graveyard. Not to mention the acrylia needed for cloaks and arrows and all sorts of other things.<br>
<br>
lastly there is the Gray, someplace I would dearly love to go to. There is a quest in Katta for an enduring breath necklace with good stats and ac. We need but three of the organs from undead shissar. It might be nice to get every elder dragon one of these so we can easily go to places that are under water if we choose to do so later, <br>
<br>
Anyway, like I said, just of the top of my head. what does anyone think?<br>
