I have no problem with that. A 40K league might be fun.<br>
As you all saw yesterday, I have painted and am continuing to work on the 21st Kriegs Panzer Division/Steel Legion army that has been neglected for so many months. Basically, I have a hard time getting any interest in playing Fantasy Warhammer which is personally my favorite game.(No, I'm not talking about you Nathan)<br>
Further, the only games of Lord of the Rings have been played with the miniatures completely painted and supplied by me, so I would be safe to say others are not developing any armies for that.<br>
Which leaves 40K. So if ya can't beat 'em, join 'em I always say. So the bottom line is, if it's miniatures, it's the 41st Millenium. Count Kriegs Panzer in.<br>
Also:<br>
Question 1: Would I get to use the Death Korps of Krieg rules from WD 263?<br>
<br>
Question 2: This painting bonus idea: It sounds to me like that would create an incentive to show up for the first game with almost all unpainted models, then slowly paint them one by one over several games. Now that would be great for the new player. But since I refuse to field any unpainted model, I will never get any bonus points. Those of us with currently painted armies get screwed. So therefore, I have to evaluate what the true goal of the league would be: To accumulate points? Or to indoctrinate new players into the painted armies and gaming of GW? Either one is fine with me.<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts.<br>

And I still have a lot to paint. Question is, would it stay at 750 or go up at all? I think all White Dwarf Army Lists should be perfectly leagal. Seeing as how they are chapter approved and all. I also think that since Keith is working at Gallop's now we may be able to get more support than just &quot;Bragging Rights&quot;... I like the idea of it running for about 6 weeks.  Oh, I also think that we should allow Jim to use his army list. Unless some people have a problem with that.  And even though I know several people have several different armies, I think you should be required to play thru the entire league with the same army, that is using the same Codex or rules, not the same models or army list of course.  This also would probably be a good time for me to bring up that I wanna get some pics of armies. League nights would be  a good opportunity to get some pics for the website.  We should also look into ending the league with a tournament. First round seeding dependent upon how well you did in the league. Just like in Bloodbowl play-offs. Just an idea. Maybe no prize support for the league, but some for the tourny. Oh well, regardless, I'm in!  <p><br><img src="http://www.heavyhand.org/timetodie.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.heavyhand.org/loading.jpg"><br><h6>

Anyway we can rig up that webcam and do some long distance gaming?  <br>
Talk to Keith about prizes?  If we can get some more people to join a league and then a tourny, thus spending money on minis and other stuff at the store, then they will easily give some prizes out.  Just thoughts.<br>
<br>
If you start the league with all models painted and never field an unpainted model, then you should get a small handfull of bonus points.  Equal to having accumulated painting points for the whole league.  Just my thoughts. <p>Viva la Revelution!! <br>

Okay, some clarifications:<br>
<br>
1)  The painting thing -<br>
   <br>
         The painting bonus points are not only an incentive for people to get their new armies painted, but also to get those of us with painted armies to expand them a little bit.  Jim has a painted marine army, but he also has a few units either sitting on a shelf, or as yet unpurchased that he'd like to paint and field, but has never had much gusto to do so.  Same with my Eldar - no one has a 'finished' 40K army, they just don't have enough reasons to keep going with it.<br>
<br>
          Also, in response to Barclay's comment about not playing with unpainted stuff:  Note the guideline is 'any unit that you didn't have painted at the time of your last game'.  You don't have to have played with said unpainted unit.  We all know basically what we each have painted up, so all you have to do is walk in, plunk a newly painted sentinel (ex) down, and say &quot;Look what I did last night!&quot;, play with it, and bang! you get a bonus point for it.  The focus of the tournament is to win games AND expand your army.  If you don't wanna paint anything, you still have a chance...you'd better win most of your games, though.<br>
<br>
2)   The 750 points thing -<br>
<br>
            750 points is about right for a league, I think.  Even if you play slowly, you can knock a 6 turn 750 point game out in an hour anna half.  And that's *slowly*.  I've noticed that the jump up to 1000 points seems to be some sort of magical threshold where things can get kinda complicated, and games start running a little long.  People seem more likely to wanna throw down a short sweet game than a longer game.<br>
<br>
3)   A suggestion from Waynona -<br>
<br>
            Wayne came up with a good suggestion:  At the end of the league, we hold a 1,500 point tournament (using the bonus points from the league as incentive to get our tourney forces painted) and base the initial seatings off of how well everyone did in the league.  This sounds like a right damn nifty idea to me.  Thus, on these merits, I decree that this shall be incorporated into The Plan.<br>
<br>
4)    The league night thing -<br>
<br>
            Upon discussion with others, screw doing this one night a week.  We should open up to the entire week, but we need to set either Thrus. or Sat as the day that we all do our damnedest to gather.  You know, that night/day that we go to the store, cause we KNOW that *someone* will be there to play against.<br>
<br>
