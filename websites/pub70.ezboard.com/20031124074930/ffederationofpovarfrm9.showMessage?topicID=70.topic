Well another fear raid another cr, seems like this is becoming a bogey zone for us atm.<br>
<br>
Was asphixias raid and thanks to him for setting it up and getting groups organised etc, I said i'd help on tactics so the 5 hours cr comes on to my shoulders.<br>
<br>
Kk start at the beginning, we had some no shows but in the main everyone turned up - Asp got some good replacements in 60 chanter, 4th cleric, 55 tank but we were waiting a while to group and it was an hour before we were ready to break.<br>
<br>
Not much could be done about this as I only got on at the start time, but as always we need to have a break team an hour earlier to save the hanging around.<br>
<br>
Fdrs went in peaceably and then the strong fight and evac team went in, thats when things went wrong! the fight teams tanks hung at the portal too long, got agro, fought at the portal, got more agro, died and then the mobs came for us.<br>
<br>
With no assist tanks at the west camp, people were confused and dissorientated and we suffered some bad loses.<br>
<br>
This is effectively what stuffed us up, we took down no mobs on that first fight and instead had stirred up a lot of wanderers making regular circuits of the portal.<br>
<br>
2nd break team got ready and zoned just as wanderers mobbed the portal, bad luck really but in hindsight evac should have been called as soon as agro was gained. While its common to stand and die in fear when you get attacked, if your cleric is the one standing and dying your group is going straight to hell anyway.<br>
<br>
With the first and second break groups ganked we were struggling, we'd lost the bulk of our best people without killing any mobs. After that we tried getting inventive, 3 chanters to keep mobs clear for rez stick - failed and more dead. The old fashioned break tactic with the remaining groups charging camp site while cleric got camped - failed and more dead.<br>
<br>
After this we were always going to need outside help to break, we got a couple of people in and tried various break and evac tactics but they failed too, in the end Stoic came and broke it for us, then rode off on their silver horses.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Kaiser and all of Stoic, they were quick, friendly and didn't chuckle once <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
After we rezzed everyone, 5 hours had passed and a lot of people had no exp rez corpses, some left and some stayed.<br>
<br>
For the people who stayed it was actually a fun sort of raid, we knew time was limited and saw shissar was up for chanter epic and went for it.<br>
<br>
We cleared north pretty well and got some armor, then pulled temple very well and got more armor, got the shissar and grats to Sihdarta on a difficult peice of his epic.<br>
<br>
The good points, we got chanter epic peice, we got some upgrades for a few people, we ended up turning a lousy raid around and at least got something out of it. Attitude as always was good, some people were asking more about rezzes than others but after 5 hours I know I would be too, didn't hear many people bitch and complain and thats always a strong point of ours.<br>
<br>
Bad points, people need to listen, looking back the move to west camp was explained clearly at least twice and at least 2 of the people in first break group were seasoned vets of fear, if we have people new to a zone in important positions on a raid we're gonna have to lead em by the nose in the future.<br>
<br>
Only way I see of avoiding a repeat of this is checking with everyone that they know exactly what they have to do, have higher levels on the break in to allow for mistakes and evac at first sign of trouble if your group gets hit before you make the camp.<br>
<br>
Asp is gonna post another one for a few weeks time and we'll take special care and attention next time to avoid anything like this happening again.<br>

Wrap around My Neck</span><hr size=1> Eldark illustrates what took place perfectly.  Only thing I really want to add is alittle advice on future Fear raids.<br>
<br>
The main reason I think we failed is we moved to quickly.  This is the reason pick-up Fear raids or casual attempts on Fear are rarely successful.  We had a very late start, and the no-shows left us alittle weak in some class areas.  I contacted a few guildies and almost as soon as everyone new to the raid arrived we made ready to begin the break.  Eldark did an excellent job of &quot;taking the reigns&quot; (no offence to you, Asphyxia, but Eldark had experience with Fear raid leading and was a natural leading force, I am glad you let him take charge).  He communicated very clearly what the plan was, and what people were to do.<br>
<br>
The disaster that resulted was a combination of bad luck, inexperienced raiders, and more bad luck.  We had alot of unnecessary chatter in the raid channel, and I am certain this led to the miscommunication which made things go wrong.<br>
<br>
Just to point out what I consider to be a successful strategy in breaking Fear, and by no means do I take credit for it's genius - <br>
<br>
- Feign Death capable characters zone in together and head to the left of zone - in, down the hill and to the ledge where camp is usually initially set up.  They zone in, get there, Feign dead, and quit out.  They wait a second for mobs to disburse, log back in, re-FD if necessary, and report camp status to the break group(s)<br>
<br>
- The break groups are fully buffed and ready with at least one Evacuation casting party member, if not two.  It is best IMO to have TWO break groups, as they can be a more potent force, but often a single group is used as it is more manageable.<br>
<br>
- Once the break groups zone in they head straight down to the camp.  They try desperately NOT to aggro mobs along the way, but so long as the mobs brought to camp are manageable by the enchanters so be it.  Players hit by a scarling and sent to whoknowswhere are expected to die where they stand (after being 'gated' by the scarling proc) as opposed to training a horde of mobs back to the group, causing a wipeout.<br>
<br>
- Once at the camp, enchanters mez all mobs they can, and the FD-ers join them in killing as many mobs as possible before the cleric or enchanter run out of mana.  The Evacuation casters should be continually casting and then cancelling their evacuation spells if the situation is difficult.  At first indication that things may turn bad, they should let the spell go off and rescue their group.  FD-ers then FD and quit to clear aggro.   Rinse and repeat until the zone in area is clear, and the remainding members of the raid can zone in and normal groups be established.<br>
<br>
This is a tried and true strategy.  When we have been rescued by other guilds they usually only do it with two well equipped groups.  Their tanks know how to TAUNT mobs off enchanters and healers WITHOUT attacking, their tanks know how to assist when the MT hails the target mob to kill.  They work as a team to clear mobs effectively, and if they need to die to prevent training the group, they die.<br>
<br>
There is a great strategy for breaking (and clearing) Fear with Area-of-Effect spells and I would LOVE to try this out, but I don't think that is even a viable option if we cannot get the old fashioned, reliable strategy down flawlessly.<br>
<br>
Fear is difficult.  Stoic members came right out and told me that there is nothing to be embarassed about a failed breaking of the plane, it can be a real bear sometimes.<br>
<br>
P.S. When the raid leader says someone is giving the word on when to zone in, or delegates responsibility to someone in a group - EVERYONE is to respect this, including 'usual' Federation raidleaders.  If we don't follow the plan as it is laid out things are bound to go awry and get ugly.<br>
<br>
P.P.S. I am very glad we continued on after the almost comically dreadful beginning.  I ended up having a great time and am glad we turned it around and showed our true colors kicking Fear butt.  Congratulations to everyone receiving loot, and THANK YOU AGAIN VERY MUCH Stoic for being our Guardian Angels and saving the day, I hope we can return the favor someday  /snicker  /bonk     <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=70.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=70.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=70.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.emailToFriend?topicID=70.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.threadControl?topicID=70.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=70.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=70.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub70.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="federationofpovarfrm1">Federation Discussion Forum<option value="federationofpovarfrm3">Federation Raid Ideas<option value="federationofpovarfrm4">Federation Raid and Events Calendar<option value="federationofpovarfrm9">Federation AFTER Raid Discussion <option value="federationofpovarfrm17">Epic Community<option value="federationofpovarfrm5">Federation Rules<option value="federationofpovarfrm6">Federation Officers <option value="federationofpovarfrm8">Epic Hall of Fame<option value="federationofpovarfrm11">/auc<option value="federationofpovarfrm14">Applications<option value="federationofpovarfrm15">Archived Events</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#70DB93>- </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar>Federation of Povar</a><font color=#70DB93> - </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9>Federation AFTER Raid Discussion </a> <font color=#70DB93> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.246j<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
