They stood together on the isle of Cazic-Thule, a writhing mass of pale green skin. The heads of those lizards closest to the water swiveled about alertly, seemingly scanning the opposite banks for movement. They brandished their standardized weaponry, a collection of fine steel, some of which was rusty and coated with the grimy mud that covered the riverbanks, or the blood of past encounters. Yet, at this time of approaching war, the masses of the Tae Ew tribe were at ease, comfortable in their late night excursion. In their own tongue did they chatter amongst one another of things only those of their own culture would care about. This social buzz amongst the Lizardmen merged seamlessly with the natural ambiance of the jungle twilight. <br>
<br>
From the distance on the opposite side of the riverbank, a rhythmic thumping began to issue from the enshrouding forest. A patterned repetition, of a quick whooshing through the air, followed with a solid thumping sound, caught the attention of a couple of the lizardmen. Their dark, yellow eyes followed the movements of the source of these sounds, tracing a path across the treetops. The sounds soon bounded over the Greenblood River, and the masses of the Tae Ew turned their yellow eyes to the skyline with anticipation. <br>
<br>
A large figure suddenly dropped from the treetops, and the lizardmen accordingly scattered to give the creature room to land. It landed against the jungle floor with a final thud, in a crouching position to brace it's fall. The figure was easily recognizable as Iksar, it's tail swinging back and forth rapidly, it's skin clad in thin leather hewn from rhino and decorated in dark scales, pulled from the wolves native only to Kunark. The Iksar was barechested, having removed any other gear he might have owned to help speed his travel through the forest, and carried only a Khukri-type dagger on his belt band. The Khukri is a blade with a short handle and bladed hilt, and a long, curved dagger blade that works like a talon when swung, sadistically ripping at the enemy's skin, and tearing burning gashes in the flesh when stabbing with it. <br>
<br>
The Iksar himself was of a dark skin, with grey scales covering most of his face, and protecting the thin, gnarled muscles lie underneath. The oversized lizard stood up, and began to hiss and bark what he had seen across the riverbanks to his fellow reptiles, speaking to them in an archaic tongue. The other Tae Ew were quickly falling into marching formation, preparing to move out from their position on the island. Within a few moments, the army was silent, awaiting further news from their scout from the lost continent. <br>
<br>
The Iksar continued to speak with the Tae Ew tribe leaders, his voice deep and foreboding, his speech a dialect of clicking and hissing. Soon, an uneasy restlessness grew within the assembled masses, impatient to comply with the next order spoken. <br>
<br>
After a few minutes had passed, the largest of the Tae Ew chieftains turned to the masses, and issued forth more words in the lizardman language. The words were followed by a unison of battle cries and dragon-like roaring from the army. They waved their weapons in the air, rallying amongst themselves for the inevitable charge. The ones near the front of the crowd began to wade their way into the river and cross, while others bounded across on an eroded pillar that had capsized into the river long ago. The Iksar himself was now doning his battle armor, covering himself in a light chainmail made of thin, pliable rings, that created a rippling effect much like his scales did as he moved. He picked up a large, antlered face mask, hewn of bone fragments and tough, reinforced leather. The chinstrap on the mask's lower half slid under his jawbone and fitted the mask firmly over his face, like the gruesome facial harness of a black knight's steed. On the forehead of this mask laid the emblem of the Crusaders of Greenmist. <br>
<br>
The Shadowknight gave his own version of the feral battlecry, and began to ascend back up into the treetops, leaping from branch to branch, with each jump closing in on the target destination.<br>
<br>
