<br>
* Warning!! The following is a very graphic telling of one of the worst days of my life! You've been warned. *<br>
<br>
Monday night as I lay in bed with my wife she brushes off my advances with a casual, &quot;my stomach kinda hurts and there's been this stomach flu going around at work.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Fine,&quot; I think to myself. I never get sick anyway. It's always the wife and kids that seem to get sick all the time. Any flu bug that bites me is just wasting its time. So, I roll over and pick up the book I've been reading (Black House - Steven King) and read for an hour before finally going to sleep.<br>
<br>
Tuesday morning dawns bright and hot but the wife is having some trouble getting out of bed. Must be that stomach flu. A few mumbled condolences over her state of health and I'm out the door. Gotta get to work you know.<br>
<br>
All day I'm feeling perfectly at ease with the world. Sure, I'm losing my job in two weeks but for now I've got nothing but time on my hands to job hunt, surf the web, and maybe work the occasional problem ticket that I don't feel the new girl is ready to handle yet. <br>
<br>
As lunch time nears I start to develop a slight headache and the occasional tummy rumble. A macho burrito from Carlos O'Kelly's ought to quiet that rumbling down! A quick drive down the road and I'm at CO'K's stuffing my face with a fat, spicy burrito. Mmm-mm.  <br>
<br>
Back to work I go but lunch doesn't seem to have cured the rumbly in my tumbly like I was hoping it would. In fact, there is a minor hint of urgency in it's manifest rumbling.<br>
<br>
One of the first things I do on a daily basis upon return from lunch is to change the backup tapes in the servers. Nothing like routine to brighten up you day. So I head downstairs to the &quot;Old Data Center&quot; which is, of course, next door to the &quot;New Data Center&quot; and is where the tape vault is housed. <br>
<br>
I grab a couple of new tapes from the tape vault and head on over to the New Data Center and swap out the new tapes for the old. While I'm performing this simple task I feel a wave of nausea wash over me and I break into a hot sweat. &quot;I'd better hurry this up,&quot; I think to myself.<br>
<br>
First though, I must return the old tapes to the tape vault for storage. I make my way back to the Old Data Center and into the tape vault...<br>
<br>
Brace yourselves...<br>
<br>
As I'm placing the old tapes on the shelf, a sudden blast of heat runs through my body and I know that I have to puke RIGHT FUDGEING NOW!! Seeing as how the nearest bathroom is through two secure doors and about 50 yards down the hall, there is no way I'm going to make it.<br>
<br>
I grab a box full of tapes and empty the contents onto the floor of the data vault and hold the now empty box up to my face as I double over in agony and attempt to expel the contents of my stomach into the box. What comes out of my mouth however is not the expected remains of a partially digested burrito but, instead, is a thick, yellowy, mucas like fluid that seems like half bile and half 30 Wt motor oil.<br>
<br>
Surprisingly, there is very little of it coming out of me though because it feels like I am vomiting gallons. It is at this point that I feel maybe this wasn't going to be as bad as I had originally thought.<br>
<br>
How wrong I was.<br>
<br>
Just when I'm starting to relax a bit, my entire body turns against me and decides to flush every thing at once. I am suddenly shooting liquids and semi-solids from practically every hole in my body. I'm vomiting up the remains of my lunch but at the same time I am now pissing down the front of my pants all while suddenly shooting what feels like five gallons of silty CRAP into my pants. <br>
<br>
Trying to salvage myself I quickly strip out of my pants (too late though) and hurridly move my &quot;puke box&quot; around to the rear to catch the stream of CRAP spraying out of my ass. I manage to fill the box 3/4 of the way up with puke and mostly-liquid excrement. All this time I am repeating this mantra over and over and over, &quot;oh FUDGE, oh FUDGE, oh FUDGE, oh FUDGE, oh FUDGE, oh FUDGE, oh FUDGE&quot;<br>
<br>
When I am finally done I look around and see that I've somehow managed to contain all of the puke and most of the CRAP to the box and my clothes. A quick examination of the underwear reveals them to be quite full and into the box they go. The pants are also unsalvageable and I use them to clean up the mess that managed to hit the floor and shelves. The socks also come off as I had managed to step into the puddles sometime during this nightmare ordeal.<br>
<br>
So there I am. Wearing only a puke stained shirt and holding a box with my CRAP filled underwear, pants, and socks. Somehow, I had managed to get my shoes off in my haste to remove my pants and they have survived unscathed. (I also saved the wallet, checkbook, car keys, and $2 in cash) <br>
<br>
That's when it hits me. I'm FUDGEing naked, at work, with no way out of the building, and I'm holding a box full of CRAP. FUDGE. Ok, thankfully there's a phone in the Old Data Center which sees very little traffic on a normal day. (Usually just myself going in and out to change tapes.) There's still the chance that somebody might walk in though. So, I pull my shirt down over my privates and sprint from the tape vault to the phone across the data center. I quickly call the only friend I've got in the building that I can trust not to immediately announce my predicament to the world.<br>
<br>
Only he's on a conference call. FUDGE. Ok, I now call a guy who is the next best choice and as luck would have it he's in. I quickly tell him to bring towels, plastic bags, and some air freshener down to the tape vault in the Old Data Center. He asks, &quot;do I want to know?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No&quot;<br>
<br>
He shows up minutes later with towels and bags (no air freshener) and knocks on the tape vault door. I ask him to leave everything just outside the door and to go get Scott out of his conference call. I quickly clean up what mess I couldn't get with the pants and dump everything into the box which gets wrapped in two plastic bags and is then placed in another box and wrapped twice more in plastic bags. <br>
<br>
Scott then arrives. I hand him the keys to my house and ask him to go and fetch me some new clothes. Interestingly, he doesn't laugh and actually seems genuinely sympathetic to my plight. What a guy.  <br>
<br>
Twenty minutes later he arrives (and has to wake me up since I've somehow managed to fall asleep on the only chair in the vault) and hands me my clothes. I quickly dress and grab the bag containg the box of CRAP/clothes and I'm out the door and on the way home before you can say &quot;boo.&quot;<br>
<br>
Stopping only long enough to toss the bag into the nearest dumpster I race home, shower, shower again, and then crawl into bed.<br>
<br>
And you thought you had a bad day at work.<br>

This game while just a game is a very social one, there are times when we arent in the greatest mood or we have personal problems that bleed into the game... You cant have 10,000 people who play anywhere from 1hr to 16hrs a day get together everyday and not have issues. To ban a person or group of person's supposed to be in our clique is not the solution. I think the solution is in empathy, compassion, forgiveness and the person who's behaviour is in question, an apology. <br>
<br>
None of us are perfect, but we have 2 choices... we can embrace our friends with their flaws, or we can play ms solitare <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Is it a nice thing to do? Sure<br>
<br>
When I pulled fear a while ago I didnt have the right resist gear and died multiple times.  (10+)I was able to get rev, but many times just a regular res.  After losing ep, that takes me farther from my goal; to say nothing of the time during the raid. Why should my efforts go to a non-federation member?  It was cool that we got an epic piece and some peeps got armor.<br>
<br>
If a nice person wants to attend, thats great! But why in the hell should they be allowed to get loot from it?<br>
<br>
To the person that said peeps can come over to your house.  Sure they can come, but they dont also take stuff.<br>
<br>
If someone wants to raid a plane or a zone then they are welcome.  If they want to get loot then they should be a part of the group.  When your grouped up in sebillis do you offer to let others in the zone roll on the loot? No, the people in the group rolls.  I can see if we ask a certain person to help out, but hell there are 12 guilds in the federation.  If we cant flesh out a planned raid with 12 guilds we have issues.<br>
<br>
Why are people bringing up trashing uber?  Most of the times there is an inferiority complex that causes them to go on the attack.  Trying to work towards goals and getting loot does not mean that you have to abandon having fun and being nice.  If you want to do different zones you need to have good equipment in order to do it. Period, you can whine about skill and techniques but you need ac/resist/damage output.<br>
<br>
As far as Unhomed and Vigdis asking us not to attend events.<br>
<br>
Dindawen left out that every member is a admin/moderator on the message board and we only have 1 rule. Period...nothing else. How is that political?  But I can tell you I will not attend these raids as I trust Vigdis 100%, and I know, without asking, that noone else in Unhomed will attend these raids either.  Why? I know the peeps of Unhomed.<br>

I never, EVER, rolled on items on the raids. (Realized = Someone asked 'What Fed guild are you in?' and I said 'None.')<br>
<br>
I've recieved the counter argument that if I'm *invited* along and do as much work as anyone else, then I should get the chance to roll on items.. as they feel I've earned it.<br>
<br>
And I agree with that attitude, but the main reason I refrained was because I knew that chaos and bitchiness would errupt if I dared think of myself, someone invited along, as equal to everyone else.<br>
<br>
I *signed up* for two raids.. One, Fear, when I was still a member of CDF. The second was Dragon Necropolis, which I removed myself from. The rest I was *invited* along to. <br>
<br>
So, instead of having a flying hissy fit saying &quot;Non Fed's shouldn't get stuff!&quot; you should think about the situation a bit more. Those non-Fed members.. Did they get invited on the raid? Did they contribute their efforts, their items/money, and their time? Did they help the raid? Did they support the raid? Did they teleport 15 people to the raid? <br>
<br>
What I'm saying here us thus - if you invite someone along because the raid is lacking something, don't make them a second class citizen. It makes the raid leader and his/her assistants, as well as the Federation, look pretty bad.<br>
<br>
Raid Leaders get the final say on who is or is not welcome. If someone from outside of the Federation is asked to join in, they should have the same rights as anyone else on that raid. (Which includes the right to say 'Nono, nothing for me, just happy to help.')<br>
<br>
If the Raid leader doesn't want any non-Federation members along, under any circumstances, then you don't have to worry about non-Fed's &quot;getting stuff.&quot;<br>
<br>
There. Problem solved. <p><HR><BR>

As far as I can tell this has been a mostly rational discussion on people's views on how raids should be run and who should be allowed along and why. If you don't let people discuss things, nothing ever gets solved.<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm thickheaded, but it's *my* understanding that it's up to the raid leader whether non-Fed people can come along. Has this changed? Has it become an official Fed policy that you *must* be in one of their guilds to attend a raid posted on the Fed board?<br>
<br>
As far as I see it, Vidgis (and Unhomed) are saying &quot;You must be in the Federation to get our help&quot; .. so I read that as &quot;If there's non-Fed people on the raid, we won't be. Choose between us and them. We didn't join the Federation to help people outside of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
While Bendi seems to be saying &quot;Hey, it's just a game, I'll help anyone who's willing to help me. No one gets a free ride on a raid, everyone contributes something, and as long as they're friendly, nice, people, I'll help them while they help me.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not judging one way or the other, and feel free to correct me if I'm getting your message wrong, it just seems that this one issue is getting bandied about and causing a lot of problems and hard feelings. I think one of the Federation admins really needs to step in and say &quot;Guys, it's up to the individual raid leaders to decide. Run your raids the way you want them to be run, and if the raid leader doesn't run it the way you want it to be run, don't sign up.&quot; Or &quot;This is the Federation offical policy on outsider attendance..&quot; or even &quot;Hold the keyboard a sec.. We're debating and discussing the matter, we'll get a decision down to you soon. We promise.&quot; .. Right now it's getting batted around so much because there is no input from the higher ups. (Again, as I see it. I, of course, being an outsider, can't see what's going on behind the closed doors.)<br>

What if someone ninjaloots a nice item on a Federation raid and when you look to see their guildtag there is none?<br>
<br>
Federation guilds are required to abide by the Federation code of conduct and every member can be held accountable for their actions and so can their guild if the offence is serious enough. But if the offender is guildless...........<br>

Every person plays the game there on way - and I'm going to be fair and just in how I run my events. <br>
<br>
Cheeba at least, directly benefited from one of my raids, getting his corrupted seahorse drop out of Kedge on one of my open raids. And, he did object to a non fed druid going - but stayed, and didn't object again after I told him my raid options - accept it, or leave. I *like* Cheeba, and will help him, or any fed member if asked to. Helping others is part and parcel of the game.<br>

Big deal bum4ever, you just know not to allow that person along in the future. Who gives a flip about gear? Getting another random set of pixels isn't fun, nor does it contribute to fun. Its just one of the more tedious parts of the game.<br>

Then instead of having Federation raids why not just have outings in where you all sit in a circle in Misty Thicket and get to know one another? Well, heck - ya dont even need EQ for that, just a big chat room.<br>
<br>
EQ is a game in which everyone wants to prosper the best they can. Some may say that the best thing about EQ are the friendhips, good times and teamwork involved in making it in this game, but everyone wants great gear as well to show off the hard work they have put in.  When you all walked out of K-mart with a copy of EQ in your hand were you honestly thinking about all the great friendships you would make or were you thinking about kicking ass and getting phat loot?  be honest.<br>
<br>
EVERYONE wants to get great gear - nobody aproaches level 50 and says &quot;well, I just want so-so armor so I will just go on small so-so raids&quot;  Everyone playes EQ to reach the top (or try to) but not everyone can. Why is that? Why can some get the best gear EQ has to offer while others dont? You all want it (even if some dont admit it) and ya all are willing to work for it I know. <br>
<br>
Well here is the secret - to get the best gear in this game you need a major force of people who are 57+. oh, you can have a few 50+ tag alongs but your groups must be made up of mostly 57+ peeps if you want to be killing those multiple level 65 through 70 mobs that drop the best crud. And yep - its the &quot;uber&quot; guilds that have the forces to do that.<br>
<br>
there are 2 types of Uber Guilds - The honorable and the dishonorable - theres the ones who have honor and run their guilds as such and there are the dishonorable guilds made up of mostly kids under 15 (which is probabaly more then 60% of the EQ population) - the honorable uber guild is where the honorable peeps go when they get high enough level and want a good social atmosphere of many other mature peeps to chat and hunt with and have enough members to get nice gear as well. the Childrens uber guilds are where the kiddies end up when they reach 57+. These guilds have a kids mentality and just seek to get ahead - but they will hide behind a mask of honor and claim to be honorable at every turn, you just have to watch their actions to see how they truly are.<br>
<br>
The problem with this Federation is the same problem I have seen with all multi-guild alliances. Lets assume that many Federation members are level 50+ and when all those peeps start turning 57+ then the Federation will rock right? It will be filled with craploads of 57+ peeps and you all will be doing ToV and killing level 65+ mobs all day right? Wrong.<br>
<br>
The problem is - EQ is a system of compitition - as members of the federation guilds turn 57+ (give or take a few levels) then they will come to realise that they can either stick with their guild and wait many long months for everyone else to catch up or they can leave for an uber guild and start getting that uber gear now. And when a member leaves a federation guild they leave the federation as well and you have one less higher level person. Not all people do this of course - there are some who are loyal to their guild and stick with it, but enough will leave their Federation guilds that it will have an impact on the whole of the Federation.<br>
<br>
Loyalty is the Key - getting members of your guilds to remain members even after they get higher level is the problem, but loyalty is a taboo subject - accuse someone of being disloyal and you will catch hell from their friends who are more loyal to them then to any guild. (as i have learned)<br>
<br>
Dont believe me? have someone get a list of every 57+ in the federation - and monitor that list monthly- add names of people who turned 57+ and remove those who left their federation guild. (its somethin you should be doin anyhow to get a good understanding of how much power the Federation has, especially after the Ragefire incident)<br>

And, yes, you got my message correct.  Unhomed has had much discussion on this topic in our own forums before I ever posted on this thread.  We are here for The Federation; we are not here to help strangers, especially strangers who belong to another alliance with private raids and private boards.  Bendi can feel free to invite that alliance over to our raids for epic peices:  I sure has _hell_ never saw them (OR Bendi) inviting us to their private, pass-worded protected boards for their epic peices.  Do I blame that alliance?  No.  They have their support network; we have ours.  If those in our support network choose to support others on their raids, hey, Unhomed will refrain from attending.  Doesn't matter if the raid has or doesn't have something in it for us - the idea isn't that we are being pissy because our chances of gathering phat lewtz lowered, the idea is about policy.  We believe in backing our own.  We are in a guild that now does that 100% and we choose to hang with folks who are like-minded.  Something you got wrong, Shey, and I wouldn't blame you for it because re-reading this thread I don't see it posted:  I've been behind raid leader specific invites 100%.  If (a) we need an outsider or (b) the raid leader explicitly invites the outsider on a raid up front, they are in and they roll as an equal.  And, uh, if ever I throw a &quot;flying hissy fit&quot;...you'll know.<br>
<br>
As for uber taint ... Welcome to stay in Mist Moore all your EQ days and be repulsed by me because I don't choose that.  I think Boogs and Dindawen explained away the &quot;uber&quot; idea, and if you actually bothered to read Boogs' post you'd see it was not about equipment either. <br>

If you want to attend raids and such, and your a caring person. Why not join a federation guild? Whats the big deal about joining one of the guilds?<br>
<br>
Your position is rather puzzling to me.  You criticize for making people that dont belong in the federation feeling like second class citizens.<br>
<br>
THEY ARE!<br>
<br>
Dont want to feel like a second class citizen? Then join a fed guild. Whats the big deal?<br>
<br>
Or do you want to belong to a guild thats not federation and get benefis from that and go to fed events?<br>
<br>
So strange that someone would criticize a group of people on policy that they dont even belong to; actually its quite laughable.<br>

<br>
First of all, post 4 in this thread mentions &quot;If non-Fed want in on our action, they can join one of our guilds.&quot;<br>
<br>
Because most of the time they are devoted to the guild, is why they dont join the guild. Which brings another point. NSoG has its own NsoG only raids. if you want some raids to be fed only, make it private in the first place. <br>
<br>
Now IMO, the mentioning of &quot;If a raid is being conducted, and it is open to everyone, Fed and non-Fed, I will not support the raid and I will ask members of Unhomed to do the same. &quot;<br>
so be it. why dont we ALL not support raids that dont affect certain people only? Because it is not what eq is for. people can do what they wish, but doesnt that seem a bit rude? after all, raids are for FUN!!! Not loot, cash, xp, only fun. If someone gets something out of it, so be it. Congratulate them and move on.<br>
<br>
next in line: &quot;leave fed raids to fed members&quot;<br>
<br>
yet again, open raids and fed only raids are a must in that situation. <br>
RP and NSoG allow other non members to be in their raids, why shouldnt fed? I doubt we deny ANYONE from signing up. If it comes down to too many people, cut the people as the raid leader sees fit, in terms of classes needed, levels, and fed/non fed status. <br>
<br>
Example: I am a 44th IKS/SHD. Very common class, but not common race for it. Now, say i sign up for a fed fear raid at 47. God forbid, a non fed member signing up on a fed raid.<br>
do you A.) disallow mefrom coming to the raid regardless, or B.) depending upon the people signed up, remove me from the list if need be, depending upon levs,classes, and alliance status. <br>
If i go, 9 times out of 10 i would be the only iks/shd there. when you pull the nightmares in fear, there is another situation: Greenmist armor drops... iks/shd only. What do you do then? its a decision of the raid leaders depending upon the situation at hand. <br>
<br>
moving on then...<br>
to the &quot;uber/elitist&quot; section.<br>
I dont consider myself Uber or Elitist in any case. the best item i have is the Greenmist, which questing was a living hell for me, but i still earned it, and i dont regret sacrificing the levels and time. Personally i have not ran into any uber or elitist attitudes here. I respect the people here, which is the major difference between the feds and Triton or FoH. The 2 guilds in question everyone is downright RUDE! because with power comes responsibility, like peter parker's uncle said. However, imo, the &quot;uber guilds&quot; have turned that power into arrogance and corruption, in which i have a lack of respect for. The reason im not in an uber guild aside from levs? I like to keep a certain amount of honor. Honor as being a noble race in EQ, honor as staying with RP through good and bad, and honor in dropping everything to help another, I.E. Cancelling my trip to a pickup vox raid to help and collect people for melobolgia with the glowing cliff golem for his greenmist quest. <br>
<br>
I dont mean anyone disrespect in any way here. I have never kept an enemy in EQ, except maybe dheynos, but that was my own character on veeshan server, so he doesnt count. I just needed to explain some things. Let the flaming of me commence when ready, im personally expecting at least 1 thing. but that will not change my opinion. You are my friends and allies, lets keep it that way <p>*cuts the engines and rides the wind... the patented "Dino Bird Swoop"*

It seems you read the thread and put some thought into your response.  This has been quite the ongoing topic, a little heated at first but I think it has come down to a nice open discussion.  In the end I think it comes down to people who are set in their opinion on the topic.  Some of us still aren't 100% decided on all this and it keeps the work day interesting to have something to read <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=269.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=269.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=269.topic&start=61&stop=75>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=269.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=269.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=269.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=269.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.threadControl?topicID=269.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=269.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=269.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub70.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="federationofpovarfrm1">Federation Discussion Forum<option value="federationofpovarfrm3">Federation Raid Ideas<option value="federationofpovarfrm4">Federation Raid and Events Calendar<option value="federationofpovarfrm9">Federation AFTER Raid Discussion <option value="federationofpovarfrm17">Epic Community<option value="federationofpovarfrm5">Federation Rules<option value="federationofpovarfrm6">Federation Officers <option value="federationofpovarfrm8">Epic Hall of Fame<option value="federationofpovarfrm11">/auc<option value="federationofpovarfrm14">Applications<option value="federationofpovarfrm15">Archived Events</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#70DB93>- </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar>Federation of Povar</a><font color=#70DB93> - </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1>Federation Discussion Forum</a> <font color=#70DB93> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.246g<br>Copyright 1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
