take a read at my response lewtwhore<br>
<br>
its quite simple, dont come in here trying to push big guild politics on a federation that doesnt want it<br>
<br>
Im quite sure if you want to force mandatory raids and the like, Stoic has a slot for you.<br>
<br>
I agree with Velisaris Groovenhymer 100%<br>
<br>
I also think this summed it up Stone:<br>
<br>
&quot;Until every member of every guild is 60, decked out in ToV or better, ready to raid 100% of the online time, and online 40 hours a week, and all the other people have left, there's still lot of space for scheduled raids.&quot;<br>

Obviously we have plenty to gain from many schedualed raids still.

Scheduled raids aren't going away anytime soon, it was just suggested we aim for some bigger mobs as well that you can't very well set up a raid for.<br>
If you want to take part in the conversation, by all means take the time and try to come up with an intelligent response.  Personal attacks and flames need not apply.<br>
<br>
If you don't even believe in your ideas enough to put your name next to them you shouldn't expect anyone to care about what you say.  If you just like to hear yourself talk there are plenty of better sites to go flame.<br>

Thank you, that is all.<br>

Being anonymous is what the internet is ABOUT. <br>
<br>
Anyrate, that said, this isn't the only board that gimpzor is making personal attacks on. <br>
<br>
I think Reign's idea has merit. Set aside a few hours one week, and post it as a &quot;hunt time&quot; like a scheduled raid, complete with sign up.  Set a start time, and an end time, and IF folks sign up, then they are comitting to being online during those hours, and perhaps get a weighted roll as result (200-1200, instead of 1 1000 or something). This is in no way &quot;elite&quot; or &quot;uber&quot; so it shouldn't piss anyone off - and if someone happens to just be on during that time, they still have a pretty good shot at loot. <br>
<br>
I don't like points systems either. To me, they are just dumb. I've heard the justification, well x could really use that, and he has been to the last 49 raids. Where Z won the item, and he attends like one raid every 6 months, and plays maybe 2 hours a week, which he usually spends soloing in zone y. So what? How is that unfair? <br>
<br>
BUT, for everyone's consideration, here is how a guild on FV works its point system. I don't endorse this, its just an FYI post. This guild (Ebon Storm) is a lower mid rank guild - its not in the category of Legion of Little Folk,but would be above some of the smaller guilds in the Federation (it is bigger than my FV guild, which is Indigo Void).<br>
<br>
_______________________________________<br>
Loot Rules<br>
<br>
All loot will be obtained via the point system. We feel this is the most fair and equitable way for everyone. The people who put the most into will get the most out of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Point Breakdown-<br>
<br>
1 point being on time ( 10 min window of designated raid start time )<br>
1 point for attending the raid<br>
1 point for staying until raid completion<br>
<br>
2 points for puller. Each raid will have primary puller if he/she should leave during raid secondary puller will also receive points. Pulling is an important job and we want to accommodate our pullers.<br>
The pulling duty may be volunteered for but the Senior Officers/Guild leader will appoint the most qualified candidate.<br>
<br>
Epic Battles – 1 point per group required for the battle.<br>
<br>
8 points for Gods, dragons, 60+ mobs ( this is for all in attendance )<br>
<br>
*This is a rough diagram of how points assigned. The GL will designate point value for each raid.<br>
*points will be tracked by Senior officer/Guild leader and will be on display.<br>
*poor conduct/form on raid will result in loss or no points.<br>
<br>
<br>
Gems-<br>
<br>
Gems obtained on guild raids will be utilized as follows- <br>
Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, Jaciniths will be collected by Senior officer.<br>
A list will be kept of what resistant gears are needed. Resist gear will be made<br>
the person receiving it needs to cover cost of the metal.<br>
Resist Gear Priority- 1- Melees<br>
2- Clerics<br>
3- Chanters<br>
4- Other Casters<br>
Feel free to get your own resist gear as well. This prioritization is to maximize efficiency on raids<br>
<br>
Cash Loot/Non-Resist Gems<br>
Black Sapphires, ruby crowns ect…. Will be collected and given to clerics to cover buff costs and necros if summon corpses are needed.<br>
<br>
Using Points-<br>
<br>
The auction system will only be used in “high end” encounters. i.e. dragon loot, ultra rare loot.<br>
Even though points will continue accumulate they will only be used towards high end gear.<br>
The Guild Leader/Sr Officer will let everyone know before raid if this qualifies as “high end encounter”.<br>
If not loot will be distributed via dice system on NBG “need before greed”.<br>
Everyone gets an item via dice system before you may roll for 2nd item in your class.<br>
<br>
All items will be briefly announced so you know what is up for grabs.<br>
The auctioneer will announce what classes are able to bid on the said item.<br>
Once you bid the item you may not turn it back in if you win. It yours enjoy!<br>
If there comes a time when an item is not desired by anyone or useable by anyone ( ie pally book off Vox) it will become guild property and sold for Gem/coffin fund.<br>
Max Bid Value- whatever the auctioneer deems as the “starting bid”. The item shall not exceed 3x that value.<br>
If the items reaches the bid “cap” and there are several people willing to spend the max value points on it.<br>
The winner shall be decided in the following order criteria:<br>
1- raid attendance&lt; history &gt; if tie,<br>
2- level , if still tie,<br>
3- person with better loot will win and will be expected to pass down old loot to tied player and the old item will cost the person points &lt; GL will decide point value of handed down loot&gt;<br>
<br>
Example- Mage Planar robe drops and opening bid is 10 points. 2 mages are willing to bid max bid which would be 30 points. So the mage who has most historied raid points &lt; current and used&gt; would get it. If that was a tie the higher leveled mage would get it. If it was still a tie the mage with better armor would get it under the pretense they have to pass the old armor down. If they don’t want to the other mage has the option to take it and has to pass down armor if it is an upgrade for the other mage. The pass down loot will be assigned a point value as well and will be charged to the person receiving it.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you were not in the raid you may not bid on any item from that raid.<br>
Non classes can not bid on item. IE caster bidding on haste item for melee.<br>
Points may not be pooled with other people.<br>
<br>
Buy Back Items-<br>
If a item that is worth high value and is deemed to stay in guild. It will be announced that this is a buy back. Once said member out grows this Item ES will buy it back for 50-75% point value depending on the item value at buyback time. This is not optional.<br>
<br>
Epics-<br>
<br>
Epic pieces will not be under normal loot rules. If we are after an epic piece for you and we obtain the item it is yours. This will be stated before raid starts.<br>
If several people need a said epic item from a raid the Guild Leader will consult the message board to see who is the furthest. If you have not filled out message board you will not be considered. If several people are at the same point the Guild leader will deem who gets it based on raid attendance and tenure in the guild. This is not negotiable.<br>
Amendment to this-<br>
How Epic Loot will be handled-<br>
Based on:<br>
<br>
*Who is furthest on their epic ( based on information in Epic Endeavors) if tie then,<br>
*Raid Attendance ( Totaled points used/remaining ) if tie still then,<br>
*Higher Level<br>
<br>
Epic raids will be given priority by their usefulness to guild. i.e. clerics and chanter also<br>
how far along you are will have some bearing as well.<br>
Epic encounters are very time consuming and more often than not the loot is sub standard.<br>
The Senior officers/Guild Leader will monitor epic raids and make sure we do not burn ourselves out<br>
on them. Moderation is a good thing. Everyone gets excited as they get closer to completion but we must maintain a balance.<br>
Also epic raids will be given priority to those who attend raids. If you do not attend raids and expect<br>
Epic raids for your benefit you are sadly mistaken. This is a team effort not an individual effort.<br>
Epic raids will be cleared through via Guild Leader and/or Senior officers. They shall base decisions upon guild participation ex. Attendance at guild raids.<br>
<br>
If you are planning an epic raid you will be expected to know the in and outs.<br>
• Zone layout<br>
• How many people needed to successfully complete it<br>
• Time required<br>
• Cost incurred gems/coffins/port stones<br>
• Mob level, stats, what resistances needed<br>

I don't see any kind of merit system being implemented in the Fed, As far as the reason why this thread started I agree, some great ideas have come up, exp fed groups willing to drop and join raid if needed, as Ral said most high guilds know the spawn times of uber mobs, I know for a fact GL records the time when they take out Vindi, so they can be there for respawn. I think it's a great idea to look for random spawns and assemble when we can. we have the power to take out most of the good mobs in this game and we should use it, a group in KC says VS is up within 15 minutes we should be forming groups all in KC. it can be done. So yes I agree some sort of set night or day can and should be set up for random spawn/ Fed raid. it will only help us all in the future. those are my thoughts anyway.<br>

Many of us need to adjust or coordinate raid times with RL responsibilities.  Raidleaders need to be certain there is sufficient interest and workable groups with a proper balance of classes participating.  Raidleaders need also to know the ins and outs of the raid location and encounters as much as possible, and share all of their knowledge with those attending so that things can move smoothly, and everybody knows what to expect.<br>
<br>
The Federation has always dealt with loot on a NEED BEFORE GREED basis.  This will NEVER change, or I simply won't participate, as I am sure many others won't as well.  This is not even a debateable topic, and people shouldn't have concerns over it.<br>
<br>
What Reign is suggesting is that we have gotten to the point where many of the zones we had to plan WELL in advance for, are now nearly &quot;trivial&quot; to the majority of our players, because we have done them so often and most everyone is familiar with the encounters.<br>
<br>
In order for many of us to advance further, not only in terms of LOOT, (which this conversation was never really about) but in terms of challenge and something new to accomplish.  We have proven in the past that we are very capable of taking down mobs as powerful as Zelnithak, Radiir, Tawtro, Talendor, Ragefire, Treah, Servitor, etc...etc...etc.  However, these mobs aren't there at our leisure, we need to coordinate tracking of them in order to take advantage of the opportunity when they spawn.<br>
<br>
We won't ever stop doing planned raids.  However, it is certainly within our best interests to be ready on a whim to mobilize and do something unique and exciting like take down a boss mob.<br>
<br>
I would like to see us create a list of mobs people would like to track, and see who is willing to park a tracker there to check on the spawns from time to time.  This is all voluntary, of course, but it can only benefit us by improving our ability to coordinate mobilization, improve communication, and provide better entertainment than killing the same mobs over and over until we get the lewtz we want.<br>
<br>
P.S. - Posting annonymous is cowardly and shallow, as was illustrated by Gimpzor who felt no need to use logic to back up his/her points, and turned his/her post into a mindless rant.  I don't care how much you disagree with someone posting on this board, that fact entitles you in no way to start a flame war and use harsh language, and doing so SHOULD get you banned.<br>
<br>
We really NEED to be respectful of each other for this Federation to work.  Projecting fear, blame, shame, frustration and animosity on the board does nobody any good and really takes the fun out of what is meant to be a forum of friends sharing ideas and inspiration. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ucompboy484.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CompBoy484</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#70DB93>(9/8/02 5:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=348.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.eq-darklegion.com/images/Oumphoto2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get a grip.</span><hr size=1> Am already working on a Venril Sathir mule (don't know what level I should get him to be able to track him, though.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ufilumtil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filumtil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 162<br> <font color=#70DB93>(9/9/02 12:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=348.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.camelot.de/~ekraemer/filumtil3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get a grip.</span><hr size=1> Well said, Ravilicus.<br>
