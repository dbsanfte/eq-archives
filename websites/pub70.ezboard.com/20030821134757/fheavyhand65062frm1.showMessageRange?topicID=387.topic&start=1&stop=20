Bennett of Fox News:<br>
<br>
&quot;Lincoln described liberty by a useful analogy: &quot;The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as a liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty.&quot; Lincoln made it clear who the sheep was and who the wolf was. It is equally important to recognize who the liberator is.<br>
<br>
Those who march against the U.S. and the U.K. today, those who condemn Bush and Blair and remain silent when it comes to Saddam, are in league with the wolf’s view that the shepherds are destroying liberty. The people of Iraq will soon know what Afghanis know. The true wolf was devouring Afghanis, the true shepherd saved them.<br>
<br>
It is worth remembering what those in the former Soviet republics know and what the anti-American Western street has forgotten: It was, and is, U.S. and British resolve that truly liberates the oppressed and that defends the lives and liberties of the free against the appetites and ill-will of the world’s dictators.&quot;<br>

<br>
Because they are American, they have the right to protest.  They shouldn't forget, however, that the 'rights' they so value are in truth nothing more than privilages that the founders of this nation shot people for.  Peace is <u>not</u> the natural state of the world, and connot be maintained by inaction.  Every American soldier who dies in this war (keep in mind our death count against Iraq last time was 200-something) could very well be saving the life of 1,000 civilians by preventing even a single terrorist attack  using Iraqi chemical or biological weapons.  It's never a good thing when one must look at the trade-off in lives but, no matter how many feel-good words you say, this does not keep it from being neccessary.<br>
<br>
We live in a new America, and most of the people have not yet realized that we most likely will never again drop below yellow on the 'Terror Scale' because they do not want it to be so.  They must, but sadly do not, realize that playing ostrich with our heads in the sand as regards even the <u>possibility</u> of such strikes is the exact same attitude that allowed Germany to walk into Poland and France in the early 20th century.  Remember that?<br>
<br>
If countless Americans want to rail against military force because it's trendy for Wynona Ryder to tell them to, or because they thought their relatives joined the military for a free scholarship, they have that right.  Every American has the right to be wrong.  No Iraqi has the right to be right, however.  Hopefully, that will change in a week or two.  <br>
<br>
Do not equate Bush with war, however.  The blame for conflict lies on a man who tiptoed around straightforward demands by the UN for him to disarm for 12 years, and the neccessity for Bush to have to stand up and do something about it lies on the leaders of other nations who were willing to let our grandchildren deal with the problem.<br>
<br>
Bush came to a point in history where he could safely play his cards towards re-election, or take a huge risk and end the threat of Saddam.  He does not deserve the outright hatred idiotic liberals throw at him, and it's a shame that their idiocy may cost us the first president we've had with conviction in almost a decade.<br>

<br>
If the French and Germans had united against Saddam is a peacefully disarmament, then this would have all been avoided.  Saddam couldn't have with stood the combined will of the world powers and would have realized that is time for playing games and stalling UN inspectors was up.  In time, he would have destroyed his weapons that he wasn't allowed to have and then been allowed to continue to rule in the way that he has for the last 20  years.  <br>
But that never happened.  France and Germany thought that both Bush and Blair would fold like a cheap deck of cards went he pressure got high enough and they could still continue on with thier  lucrative financial programs with Iraq.  But neither Bush nor Blair stuck thier fingers in the wind to listen what the people with the loudest voices had to say about the matter... they stuck to thier principals.  Like it or not.<br>
<br>
Today people in Afghanistan are free. There is not more family and other privately owned business in the country than ever before.  Women are not being raped in public and men  not being murdered in front of their family because they protested the government.  The Iraqi's will know this freedom soon.  It is unfortunate that the 700,000  that Saddam has murdered in his own country weren't allowed the same freedom.<br>
<br>
We all have the right in the US and the UK to protest.  I happened to get stuck in the first major protest in London last fall.  Here was the make up of the protestors.. the UK Socialist party (i.e. Communism of this era), Muslims extremist in London who openly preach for war to thier people, I am not sure what other name to call this group), peace-nics (those who live in a fantasy world were if we all just love each other everything will be all right), and my favorite... the anti-capitalist professional protestors (the type that would demonstrate against sliced bread if someone told them it was a capitalist plot).  That was about 60% of the people.  The rest were either people like me who made a wrong turn and were stuck for 3 hours, or the London middle class who came out with their wine and cheese just to see what all the noise was about.<br>
<br>
The reason why I mentioned all of those groups, is that they all hate Western government, particularly Bush and Blair.  However, Bush and Blair fighting for relative and prosperity of the western world... and to insure that all of these people will be free to protest again.  <br>
<br>
If at any time you think these terrorist that want to destroy Americans, English, Australians, and everyone else associated with the western world, are not worth dealing with and that we live in a safe and comfortable society.... then down load one of the videos of the 9/11 tragedy... particular the one where the towers fell... and 3,000 were killed.<br>
<br>
I pray for the people of Iraq, and that they will not have to endure and more hardship than they must.<br>
<br>
Sorry to get long winded... but it is good to get some things off of your chest, particularly when you are surrounded by people who talk funny all of the time. <p>Viva la Revelution!! <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

One told me that 99% of the current population want him to leave.  Its odd considering that Hussain held elections late last year in which he earned 100% of the vote.  Wow, that must be some sort of record or something. <p>Viva la Revelution!! <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Our choices have been to act miltarily or to let him tip-toe around diplomacy all along.  Finally, someone has realized that Saddam has learned to drool when someone rings the bell of diplomacy, because it means he gets a treat.<br>
<br>
Castro is nowhere near as dangerous as Saddam.  Yes, its nice that the Iraqis are going to have a much better life very soon.  It's wonderful that we're going to spread democracy, and maybe create a new bastion of our political ideal in the Middle Ease.  But, we must maintain realism, and admit that this is a happy side effect.  We haven't cared enough about these people to help them for over 25 years.  Now, the man stepping on them has WMD, denies having them, refuses to give them up in the face of <u>unanimous</u> demands from the UN, and is just the type to sell them to terrorist groups.<br>
<br>
But Castro can barely shoot his own people, much less us.  There's no real diplomacy there.  We're using the economic equivilent of a frontal assault, and that's even harsher than whats about to happen in Iraq.  We're going to shoot Saddam in the head, when we gave Castro a slow bleeding gut wound decades ago.  He'll eventually die, and we can say, 'Hey, if you guys set up a democracy, we'll let you have stuff again.  Hell, we'll even pay for setting up the new government!"  I imagine after all this time eating dirt, the Cubans will agree.<br>
<br>
Oh, and check out Jake's editorial in the Statesboro Herald today.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the troops and the people of Iraq to come/return to thier homes and families in safty.<br>
<br>
Veitnam was totaly different.  In this mission there is a clear and described mission with objectives.  American and allies have no desire to spend much time there and we can't wait for them to return home. <p>Viva la Revelution!! <!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

His little regime got in cause we supported him, cause originally his party was heavily anti communist and they wanted a war with iran and we hate iran still. So all this *instert rhetoric* is just bullshit fed to people. our government wants oil, and we can get it by just taking it. I mean one of the triggers for the attack the other day is if they torched their oil fields. Come on now, you can straddle the fence only so far.<br>
 Either way hope this goes fast and easy we dont have to bomb bunkers filled with civilians just because they have the possiblity for soldiers. We did it last time.<br>
I'm pissed about the pricing of oil in this country, there is something dirty goin down here, the price is way beyond outrageous, and not because of what they say about venezuala. I think some laws need to go down about commodities of oil and their pricing. I really dont think that price of oil should fluctuate that much, there's isnt that much of a supply scew to warrent a ruffly 40% increase in price. Someone is bling blingin over this. But this is definitly a repeat of the last war either way. Maybe this will drop the price of oil to some 8 year low $.90? I mean with the burning oil fields of kuwait, price of gas was lower than ever? So I except another war in 10 years in the middle east over some other country with huge supplies of oil but not demanding our need for it. So im guessing khadafi is next, cause he is the only vialble target now since well syria has a dictator but they dont have oil, saudis kiss our ass as do all the small countries there. We can't hit iran really cause all the smack we talk about their government,  like the people revolted against the government and placed that government in power. Why did they revolt, cause remainders of a fucked up way the brits decided to split-up the world and leave puppit governments there to kiss their ass by placing certain families into power and giving them monarchies in places that really didnt have a monarchy there. So here we go again with meddling with other peoples affairs using the just power of democracy and &quot;freeing their people&quot;. And we get nice speeches and cool quotes on fox about how awful a man saddam is, and what is up with the damn french, and somehow terrorist are involved, even tho the terrorist wanna kill some saddam too, how stupid people are for not wanting this war cause it somehow ensures our safety or  our friends safety, yay those people who like bulldoze people in their homes and strike with choppers and tanks in the nite into civilian targets and block ambulances from coming in and blatently disregard all geneva convention laws, but who cares really hitler tried to wipe em out so i guess they can do whatever they want. <br>
What I don't care about is the rightious stance everyone is taking and ho ho and ha ha has stupid french man, even tho i dislike the french about as much as the next man,  there is nothing rightous goin on here, its just politics as usual.  What im wondering is how this is gonna play out for the next election and if bush doesnt get re-elected what the next adminstration is gonna do with iraq, which Im afraid is gonna be a mess.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#404040><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bheavyhand65062.showUserPublicProfile?gid=twizteddarsh>twiztedDarsh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Offical Heavy Hand groupie</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#FFFFFF>(3/20/03 12:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/fheavyhand65062frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: yay! war</span><hr size=1> So what, we put Saddam in power, we are taking him out of power now, we also put Bin Laden in power, think we are happy about that?

I agree that the oil companies use every little incident in the gulf to jack the prices of gas up another 20 cents or so. I'm not as pissed about oil and gas prices as I am about the junk that is going on over there. Some article in the 11th hour talked about a liberal anti-war English lady who went to Iraq to see if it was really that bad, it was. Acid baths, drilling through hands and crusifictions are amoung the methods of touture she saw.<br>
I know, nasty shit is going on all over the world, but this nasty shit can use nasty weapons and reach us.

<br>
(a) Take over Saudi Arabia and/or Kuwait?  Nobody would be able to stop the US, nobody would argue (much).  Then we would have all the oil we would ever need, and a dirt cheap prices.<br>
<br>
(b) End our self imposed embargo from oil from... of all places Alaska! Today, the US senate voted not to open up Alaskan reserves and oil grounds.  If it was all about oil then lest take our own oil.<br>
<br>
(c) why does the US not want Iraq to have its own oil fields set on fire?  Because they have said time and time again that the oil if for the Iraqi people and that the US will take no part in occupying THIER oil.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the history lesson on why Saddam is in power.  Only you forgot to mention the mass murder and torture after we left him alone.  You also forgot about the creep that was in power before that was ten time worse than Saddam.  Besides that was over 20 years ago... a lot has changed since then.<br>
<br>
Oil prices are a big problem in America.  You want laws to change this?  Then you welcome the end of free market capitalism.  The Venezuela problem is only adding to the problem, not the core of the problem.  Don’t forget that if OPEC would just increase production, then the price per barrel would go down.  Don’t forget that if Iraq would stop being so aggressive to Kuwait, that they would be able to reopen several large oil fields along the Kuwait/Iraq boarder.  That increases the amount of oil produced which will decrease the price.  Right now, the price of oil futures is falling now that the bulletes are flying.<br>
<br>
Its not about oil.  The only people who were benefiting from the oil for food program were the French.  Hell, Hussein has over one billion dollars in , from our own food aid program, in a bunker in Baghdad.  Not in the hands of the starving Iraqi children.  Its not about oil, but freedom.<br>
<br>
There is a huge population of  people from Middle Eastern origins in this area of London.  Most of them admit that this war is not about oil.  It is about freedom.<br>

And what nasty weapons you speak of have been around since uhh world war 1, and we used them then and we found them to be ineffective because of simple things like lets see weather. Look dude we are the number one users of weapons of mass destruction, we've used them before, so give the rightious hand up.<br>
We give no props to our number one defenders, ya its simple i call them atlantic and pacific ocean, they've only failed us once. <br>
<br>
 Big deal about torture, it always happens and it always will happen thats just how governments use fear and tactics to get what they want and keep people under control. Think we are immune to it, shit we have guantonomo bay over there and who knows what the fuck is goin down there. <br>
<br>
This war was gonna happen regardless of what saddam did, he could have shot himself in the head on CNN or maybe FOX, and had a US doctor to confirm that he was dead and we would have taken control by force either way. <br>
<br>
All im saying the more we meddle the more we fuck it up, we just gotta let them figure out.  If security is such a big factor,  fuck lets just blow up the rest world, I mean your always safe when your the only one you have to deal with?<br>
<br>
Hah, ya I can see it now, an extensive mail anthrax campaign led by saddam using the post office! YES read all about in the next tom clancy book or how it can be done on a bit by bit ever detailed but yet truely impossible on cnn or fox with a slew of experts who have no idea what they are talkin about!
