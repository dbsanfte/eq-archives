There was a huge turn out for this. We started almost a hour and a half later then I wanted too. If i can remember right The frist group went up at 9pm est. <br>

<br>
A really big congrat go to Xbit for Eye of Innoruuk and Tarnas for Hand of the Maestro both get pieces for there epic.<br>

<br>
I did watch the way he ran things, I did watch that alot of people didn't listen. I told out of all we had 10 deaths. <br>

<br>
Now I know that there will be post about how the groups were not set up before the raid and How this was WAY to many people to go to hate. However we must bare in mind the fact that when this raid was posted we were going to fear. When a raid location has to changed so close to raid day It does make it a lot harder, not to mention the time involved, to set things up in advance. Please keep that in mind when posting to this thread.<br>
<br>
I saw a RL trying very hard to keep things under control, without upsetting anyone. I saw at the same time other members trying to help maintain order. Considering all that was going on, not a bad job either, I might add. My reasons for not leading raids was supported by what I saw. I can't be assertive. Either I'm passive or aggressive.<br>
<br>
I believe the problems we had had a lot more to do with people not knowing why they were being asked what they were being asked to do as to not paying attention. Every raid has unique procedures but certain things are always the same. ie always wait for the MT to call engage. Why? Not just so every one is on the same mob but also so the MT has a chance to get on the right mob and this way he/she can retarget if he/she needs to. NEVER ASSUME that the target of the MT before he/she calls engage is the same one after it's called. Shut off auto attack on assist. I believe this caused more mez breaks than people not assisting.<br>
<br>
Another point, TOO MANY channels. When we have people without PoP, they DO NOT see raid chat. So it shouldn't be used.<br>
<br>
Last point in our guilds it is just as important to teach our members, without raid XP, the proper procedures and different rules for raids, as it is to get them involved with Fed raids.<br>
<br>
In closing FUN FUN FUN. This is what raids should be. This one became fun when people finally understood what was expected of them. If they know it before the raid the FUN can start at the beginning as well.<br>
<br>
Damn I talk to much.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to your next raid Lov<br>

Lovebug made a valiant effort at organizing the chaos that all of the last minute changes created.  Wizra helped out with getting things organized and keeping them moving and Destrie made the difference in the raid by creating forward progress when it got bogged down in the entrance hall.<br>
<br>
I do have some areas i would like to address for future reference.  <br>
<br>
One.  PoP vs non PoP.  I believe that we had one non PoP group.  This ment that the PoP raid channel would not be heard by all.  This needs to be addressed in one of several ways.  Inform everyone at sign up that they need pop to participate.  This would ensure that everyone can see the raid channel.  Alternately, to include our brothers and sisters that dont have PoP, let everyone know that we will be using the channel designated on the sign up and not the raid channel.  Either way would solve the communication problem.<br>
<br>
Two.  I have found it useful to go ahead and post groups for raids even if circumstances change.  This at the very least provides a framework for the raid and gives people a feeling of some organization.  It helps to reduce the number of paniced tells and the static in chat channels.  This in turn makes your job easier as raid leader.  <br>
<br>
Three.  You did an excellent job of designating the main cleric/enchanter/shammy for buffs.  Hehe One of the secrets of leadership is to find good people who know how to do their jobs and to let them do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Those are my suggestions/observations for this raid.  Again thank you for sponcering it.<br>
