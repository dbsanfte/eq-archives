These raids can be a blast, but they can also be seriously frustrating.  The chances of winning loot is very, very small at best, and the chances for failure can be pretty high depending on the raid party make-up and experience.<br><br>Regardless, EVERYONE should attend at least one of each Vs Vox and Naggy.  I have been to several dragon raids with Ravilicus, and recently a few with Thunderbumm.  I have never won anything but the experiences have been some of the more interesting if for no other reason than fighting a dragon kicks ass.<br><br>These days with Aegolism, C3, Circle Buffs, Elemental blankets, melee twink weapon upgrades and whatnot these raids are really much easier!  The Fed should definately host a raid sometime soon, especially if we can get some high level support for clearing giants, etc.  A Cleric with a click stick can often turn the tide in a battle with combat resses, too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/uehlynafuzziface.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EhlynaFuzziface</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/2/02 12:25:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=126.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: vox/naggy</span><hr size=1> I attended a public Naggy raid today, and I will tell you I was dissapointed.

I am well aware the Federation is powerful and within its ranks holds many high level peeps.  But, I am sure there are plently that would like to see the epic pieces off these pair.  I mean, I know the unforunate ability of Naggy and Vox to punt High Levels out for their protection, but that doesnt mean you can assist, or guard, or even clear a path for the right lvl groups.<br><br>Say, if we had 3 to 4 groups of 44 to 52 lvl Toons, with 1 to 2 groups of 53 to 60 lvl Escorts, these raids would be simple.  The big boys and girls go in clear the path, keep the crew ready for war, this speeds up down time, because you wont have to waste mana on the &quot; Protectors&quot; of Naggy and Vox, i.e. Ice Giants, Fire Giants, etc.  <br><br>So, you get your crew, zoned in, Buffed up to their ears and just have the Monster Group, which I know we could form some Monster Crews in this Federation, have this Monster Group or Groups, mow down the guards etc.  Then the crew, goes in, killing the dragon and we get Epic pieces for Federation Members.  And I want to make sure all understand, any epic piece that drops, goes to someone that needs it for their epics!  But the remains loot can be rolled on a need before greed style.  Its just sad to see people pawning Red Dragon Scales, White Dragon Scales and other epics, to make some quick cash, its not like these things can be foraged, lol.<br><br>Just an idea, I would love some feedback on this, Thanks all.<br><br>Wyldebear Tundrahunter<br>52nd Shaman of Mystic Defiance <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ukodochasunsoar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kodocha Sunsoar</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#70DB93>(10/8/02 9:39:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=126.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: vox/naggy</span><hr size=1> Actually Wylde that is a very good idea and good use of resources.
