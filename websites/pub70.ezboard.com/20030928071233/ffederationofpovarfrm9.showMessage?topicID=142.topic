You should expect that you wouldnt know where you are.<br>
<br>
Any way a quick run down for those not there.  CoM was camped when we got there.  We spent about 30 mins debateing the merits of various zones and then decided to go to nurga.  Noone but Kiskin had been there since the revamp and we finaly positively identified someone who likes playing &quot;wack-a-gobbie&quot; as much as I do.  We had a few organizational problems at the begining.  Please if you come to a raid and we vote on alternative goals DO NOT LEAVE FOR THEM UNTILL WE GET ORGANIZED.  Once I had put groups together we had a problem GETTING them together becuase some people had gone to dl with the rest of us sitting at the com zoneline still.  Not good and made the cr situation with Lak and Dyam a larger problem than it should have been.<br>
<br>
Anyway we zoned into Nurga and the maps that i have were very screwed up.  Thankfully Kisk was able to lead us through the mines because of all his leveling there and his faction work.  We had a small problem with a group wanting to play leapfrog and take the names as we cleared the fodder.  To solve this we decided to head to Droga.  Murs was an excelent puller in both zones and i was able to correctly orient my maps for once (mutters that myrist was crazy).  We then proceded through what was largely a dark blue zone to muratt at lv 52.  Hehe dark blue untill we got to the workshop anyway where they all turned red.  We were about an hour from the zoneline and were steadily loseing people to time constraints and rl.  When we lost our main cleric and sank under 2 full groups i called the raid and we ported or gated out.<br>
<br>
Over all a good raid but we could work on both the movement of the group in the zone and the pre raid organizational thing.  If the raid leader moves ahead to the puller he is checking things out not wanting the entire raid to move with him.  This is what happened in the large circular room where that poor chanter was camped.  Some people moved with me when i went to check on murs and we ended up with a nice little 5 min fight with most of the room.  If Nurga was a red zone like PoS is to Von at lv 56 that would be called a wipe out.  No questions asked.  In the future please listen to the raidleader's instructions and only move when told to do so.<br>
<br>
It was a poor raid for drops but a good raid for deaths.  I dont think we had more than 2 or 3 total deaths in the 3 hours we were there but we didnt get any good loot either.  Kinda balances out in the end with fun and family time being the winner here.<br>
<br>
My 2cp<br>
Thanks to all who came with us.<br>

With the summoned throwing knives that were given to me, I had a very easy time getting singles, even at the workshop where the mobs were all white - red cons to me at 56.  No major loot that I can remember, but it was a fun time, and thats what really matters.  Hope everyone else had a good time as well, and would like to have another go at it in the future!<br>

my apologies for getting ahead of the group, the druid that<br>
was helping us with ports kinda got ahead of us all, i didn't realise it would be a problem.<br>
and asking me to pull... LOL...  when you have a 56 monk as an alternate choice...<br>
murs knows what he's doing far better than i do.<br>
