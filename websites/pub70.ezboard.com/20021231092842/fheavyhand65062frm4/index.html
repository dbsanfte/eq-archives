<HTML><HEAD><META NAME="Description" CONTENT="   The Heavy Hand is a Gaming Group spanning many genres of interactive entertainment. The group's activities range from Computer Games, to Tabletop Miniature Wargames, to Roleplaying Games, and more. Most of us play massively multiplayer online roleplay games (MMORPGs) such as EverQuest and Dark Age of Camelot. We have formed guilds within both games. The Heavy Hand was first established on the Brell Serillis server in EverQuest. It later made its presence know in Albion on the Kay server in Dark Age of Camelot. The name soon became a nomenclature for all group matters. It didn't take long for us to deem our Games Workshop gaming regulars "The Heavy Hand Gaming Group." 
          We decided that, for ease of contact with those few members who do not live near our main base of operations located in South Georgia, we needed a website. The site is here to keep everyone up to date on what is happening. With daily posts by members on the Message Board, we all keep informed and entertained"><META NAME="Keywords" CONTENT="message boards, forum, free forums, free message boards, visual basic, programming, programmers, community, vb, directx, games, dx, basic, bulletin boards, online communities, discussion forums, everquest, dark age camelot, games workshop, warhammer, anime, role playing games, heavy, hand, computer games, slaanesh, skaven, marines, fantasy, ever, quest,
