<br>
We had 6 no shows, which as always is disapointing.  I did hear from some later explainging why they missed it, but for others we need to work on this, this is a big setback.<br>
<br>
We did have some of the reserves show, which is good.  We filled out the full 4 groups, and started the raid 16 minutes late, not bad considering the people we had to replace, but still 16 minutes later then we should have started.<br>
<br>
I would like to note the requirements I made for this raid.  I was very specific on them, I feel, and I made them for a reason.  The level limit was 53+.  As those who attended can testify, this was in place for good reason.  I was given many tells saying &quot;I'm 51 etc but I have been here before and I didn't die etc etc&quot;  Being in a zone and not deing in a group against trash is different then offering value to a raid against level 60 nameds.  This was also a raid for FED ONLY.  It was posted as such, and I stick with my rules.  So I do apologize that some of you didn't get to go, but I have to do what I have to do.  EVERY person who signed up and met the requirements, and who showed up, was in a group.<br>
<br>
I would like to comment on allocating time for a raid.  If you are going to signup and come to a raid, please allocate the needed time for it.  I have 24 spots, and I still had to turn away a few people.  In this situation, it really angers me when someone leaves after an hour or so for no reason, afer I have already turned people down who may have stayed for the whole raid.  Emergencies happen, but please do not ever leave my raid because you are not happy with the drops etc.  If you sign up, be there, and stay.<br>
<br>
Moving on to the raid itself, we started clearingmobs from the zone in, and did quite well.  I made the call to invis up and move to the cave due to the large amount of roamers etc, feeling we wouldnt be able to keep a path clear.  We invised up an mvoed to the cave, but the lag, which is really bad here, and misfortune cause a couple people to fall behind and others to appear.  We formed a makeshift camp near the cave and fough to hold our grounds, keeping the new mobs mezzed, but finally a few of the stragglers made it to our camp with about 6 mobs in tow.  We called for the evac to zone, and then proceded to drag and rez the dead.<br>
<br>
Attempt 2 was made to clear portions of the way and slowly move to cave instead, which proved to work.  We made our way into the cave, and began to clear in towards two targets, the Netherbian Swarmlord, and Tawro Iceequake, who spawns the Spirit of Tawro.  We were fighting very well, and efficiently, killing the mobs ahead of respawns and moving in at a good pace.  During a break in the action, we were inside one of the clearing rooms, and that is when the &quot;fun&quot; started.  2 Unguilded people showed up, and then we had a rush of about 6 mobs into the room.  We worked our best to lock everything down, and clicked in some of the fallen mid-battle, we ended up coming out OK, EVERYONE performed very well, and did a great job of keeping their cool, doing their job, and stepping it up a level to help us through it.  The 2 unguilded players claim they did not bring the train, however in all honesty that is the best explanation I can come up with.  Anyone else who was there can give your own opinions/observations.  These two were asked to leave, at which point we were cussed at etc, but it eventually cooled down, and we continued to the Swarmlord, our first target.  As luck would have it, he eventually despawned, so we switched targets to Tawro.<br>
<br>
We began clearing the Tawro tunnel, again with efficiency and fairly good kills.  I will note we did have a little bit of trouble with caster agro on this raid, but I think we eventually got it under control.  As we cleared the caves, we made it to the end, but Tawro was not in sight, despite being led by Ranger tracking.  At this point, I will admit I am a bit confused as to what happened, and would definately like to hear some discussion.  We proceded to move back, assuming maybe he was in the other cave, just very close to the wall.  As we mobilized, somehow he did appear, and agroed us.  We quickly composed ourselves, not actually being prepared for the fight, but we got right to it.  Tawro Icequake is a 32k hitpoint mob, who then spawns a 100k hp version after he dies.  During the fight, we started getting adds.  First one, then two, then I lost grasp of what happened, as my mezzes somehow got me summoned into another section of the caves that I hadn't yet seen.  I of course went down at this point, and went to watch from Dofakor's room.  People started getting summoned elft and right over to this mysterious place where they were being executed.  The remaining force DID take out Tawro, but we were all summoned/dead/or evaced at that point before we could make an attempt at the 100k hp version.  Considering how well we did with the 32k hp mob, and with the adds, if we had not run into that summoning bug we would have won that battle as well, I can be pretty sure of that.<br>
<br>
Having the entire raid force basically summoned to their execution, we briefly tried invis corpse drags, but random see invis mobs in the caves made it futile.  We were luckly enough to have Kulina show up with body bags, and she got to work.<br>
<br>
After everyone was summoned etc, I decided to cut our losses and put a bit of thought into what happened, as we were at about the 5 hour point, and I didn't think the whole raid had the stamina for an attempt at the mob again, who could despawn by the time we got there, or to Zelthinak who was now up.  We will get them next time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Loot was scarce, as we did not take out our target.  We had a few Dreamweaver pieces drop, as well as some rotting flesh.  We also got a mage spell, that went to Syrus?  The cash and gem loots went to me toawrds the fund for cleric dots and coffins.  Kulina has been compensated, as have clerics, Kosak please give me a tell in game so I can get you a stack of dots, I tried getting them to you after the raid but you seemed to be afk/not responding.<br>
<br>
Thanks go out to Destrie for a great pulling job, Vigdis and Dawgma for showing up after I logged on requesting a MT and cleric only the night before.  Thanks also to the whole raid force who was patient and in my opinion, good spirited during the corpse runs and the raid in general.  Everyone did a good job, and we had a few quirks, but overall everyone performed very well.<br>
<br>
I am not going to give up on this, I would like to focus on UP a bit more in the future.  I would really like to try the possibility of having a higher level group of 6 out there some night(s) to kill trash mobs for exp and loot, and to look for possible nameds on tracking.  I think a 3 group force of 55+ or so could mobilize and take out the nameds there.  Definately worth trying soon, get those levels guys, we are going to need them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

To be honest no complaints over how the raid was led, groups were balanced, Dis was polite and every decision made was justified.<br>
<br>
Only bad point was when people got seperated. I don't know the zone well and sure a lot of others don't too, would have been better to move more slowly and keep everyone together. People catching up have caused more than a few of my own wipeouts.<br>
<br>
Pull team worked very well and only foul up was when we lost icequake, having found him we should have pulled back to the room we were just in and had cleared, maybe saving some adds.<br>
<br>
Also we reacted slowly to the fact people were being summoned and we all got picked off one by one accordingly.<br>
<br>
All good in that we gain experience and get better, you learn nothing from a perfect raid.<br>
<br>
Well done Dis and looking forward to the next one.<br>

<br>
Just my 2cp from a casters point of view.1st the raid in my oppinion went extremely well. We had some aggro which from what I've studied of this zone is to be expected as the mobs have a high aggro range. That being said tip lets keep the group tighter. Lag is a major problem especially for those with slower computers. Not sure what we can do about it other than everyone going and purchase a new computer so go ask mom, dad, wife, and husband for a grand or two and beef up... hehe. 2nd the swarmcaller pull and the added aggro my first thought it was do to the rapid spawn that occours after the kill but we didnt kill em so had to come from somewhere else we recovered very well and i applaud you all for holding your composure cause we could have taken it on the chin had we not. 3rd and lastly the tawro mob man at this point i thought we had our crap together till i saw both scorppion and dis get summoned away and then all i could say is ah sh.... grab the tp cause i just crapped my pants... so I wiped myself and continued until I saw that guy drop then the swarm of mobs well we know what happened after this... My only solution to this as I see it is maybe just maybe instead of 2 chanters 3 to for all of which being at a minimum lvl of 55? What you guys think if we had at least 1 or 2 more chanters we could have stood a better chance of controling the mobs as the poped in cause they popped fast. <br>
<br>
Overall guys I feel we did a great job at this I'd like to see it happen again I feel that we can handle the spirit of tawro, swarmcaller and any of the other named mobs in this zone with ease. We just need to experience these kinds of things to work out our strategy. You can read about it study it till you're blue in da face but until you live it it means nothing.<br>

<br>
I read up on this quite a bit today, and I think we should have taken the other tunnel from what I read, I am not quite sure how we got him in that tunnel.  Again I could be wrong, I am still slightly confused.  From what I hear, the Radir version of this camp on the other side of the zone is a bit easier as far as only one named so you don't get confused trying to find him.<br>
<br>
We definately need to make some more attempts and learn the caves a bit better. <p><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

And, although I know it was unfortunate, I actually had a frickin' BLAST on that final battle - UNBELIEVABLE that we still ganked this 32k hp mob with about 10-15 adds.<br>
<br>
I believe the final Tawro fall-out was caused by chain aggro.  I believe it happened as follows:  We began moving back down the left tunnel toward the last camp-spot, thinking to begin backtracking quickly in an attempt to bypass pops and move on into the right tunnel (believing that Tawro must actually be located far down in the right tunnel).  I moved down to that camp, saw it was free of pops, and, upon getting the okay in the pull channel, told the raid to move down to me.  During this time, Destrie continued further down the left tunnel, scoping it out.  I believe Destrie found Tawro and was immediately jumped by Tawro and the popped mobs further down the left tunnel.  He moved back up to my camp, planning on FDing near there, but members who were moving back down trying to find the camp aggroed Tawro and SMACK the fighting began.  Finding Tawro at that exact moment, when we were still trying to move and mobilize was unlucky.  I don't believe we got strange aggro.  I believe that mobs jumped people who were backtracking, sometimes backtrackig too far, and I think those mobs chain aggroed their buddies from the original positions.  More unlucky still, the chain aggro mobs summoned a few folks who, in an attempt to re-locate the battle, probably wandered into new camps with additional pops and then, even more unlucky, were then able to actually FIND the battle, bringing their newly aggroed mobs with them.  <br>
<br>
Two recommendations, then.  First, we and I should have kept our cool moving back down the tunnel.  I should not have called any camp moves.  Only the puller and scouter should call moves in the future.   That will prevent any unanticipated battles because the scouter can make the quick decision to FD or die and halt the battle until we are ready.  Second, if someone is summoned away from the party, do not train the party, do not wander around an unknown area, just nab an LOC and gate or die.   <p><br><a href="http://www.unhomed.com">

It wasn't, IMO, due to people wandering.  I was one of the first persons to be summoned, and that didn't happen until I healed Destrie.  Whether that was the cause of me being summoned or just a coincidence is unknown to me.  Also, and I can only speak for myself here, those who DID get summoned, didn't have a chance to wander back to the party with adds.  Last thing I saw was Diso spinning around on his horse trying to figger out WTF just happened and 6 mobs screaming towards me with glee in their &quot;eyes&quot; and laughter on their lips.<br>

Okay, given that information, my theory has changed.  Just before we moved, Destrie AoE'd the final cave in order to bring Tawro out of hiding since rangers confirmed Tawro showed up on track right next to Destrie.  Nothing appeared to aggro, so we planned to backtrack.  Just before we began moving the rangers noted that now Tawro showed up on track behind us, which they thought was strange. <br>
<br>
However ... the map-holders also confirmed that the right and left tunnels run smack side-by-side.  Here is my theory:  Destrie AoE'd the left end tunnel, which aggroed the right end tunnel mobs, including Tawro who was sitting in the right end tunnel.  Tawro and his buddies began moving down the right tunnel and then back up the left tunnel in search of Destrie.  We met them almost half way down the left tunnel.  Not _all_ the mobs ran with Tawro, but they could be chain aggroed.  As soon as someone cast on Destrie, BANG, summoned into the right tunnel by chain-aggro mobs; as soon as someone aggroed one of the right tunnel mobs' friends, BANG, summoned by his friends.  No one recognized the summon location because it was the right tunnel. <br>
<br>
Just a thought.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/uallanonne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>allanonne </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Officer of The Federation</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#70DB93>(7/9/02 9:25:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=66.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Umbral Plains 7/7 Wrap</span><hr size=1> <br>
my aoe never hit  any mob, it is an aoe  strength  tap  , if any mob would have been in range, id have known from the buff i get from  it. that though crossed my mind too though.<br>
  what i think happened was, when i ran into  tawro, i had jumped over the rocks  at the camp spot, into  the next tunnel, i  landed on tawro,   got beat on and  FD, tawro agroed  on someone else in raid then, and took LONG way around to the camp passing agro on the way. that is where all the adds came from, and why  the summoning happened i think.<br>

I didn't know Destrie used AoE to pull Tawro.  If that is the case, it is quite possible it did agro him through the other tunnel, maybe resisted but didnt get resist message because of Line of Sight?<br>
<br>
Reading on Tawro and Swarmlord, I saw someone say &quot;We decided to pull the Swarmlord on our way to Tawro&quot;.  This leads me to believe Tawro is infact located in the other tunnel, behind the Swarmlord area.  Eqatlas has a map, check it out and you can see how close Tawro could have been to the tunnel we were in if he was in the right tunnel last chamber. <p><table width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
