(patches suck)<br>
<br>
In part one I discussed raid roles for the various classes and the necessety of balanceing groups.  In this section I will attempt to cover the remaining items: Main group, healing and pulling.<br>
<br>
MAIN GROUP<br>
<br>
In the main group I try and place the highest level representatives of each catigory.  For example: In the Hole raid last weekend the main group consisted of Shevia (lv 60+ monk puller), Sarpassta (56 sk tank), Coeda (lv 63 cleric healer), Tokaaz (lv60 shammy slower/haster), VonAlbrecht (lv 56 ranger dps and aggro control) and Phunani (lv 53 druid secondary healer and zone necessary).  Shevia was the highest level monk present and was the best choice for puller at the begining of the raid.  When she left the raid I replaced her with Murs who was my second choice for puller because he was the second highest level monk.  Both Sarpassta and VonAlbrecht are the same level (being the highest level melee in the raid) and I chose Sarpassta as Main Aggro because of the difference in the Plate ac vs Chain ac.  Coeda and Tokaaz were also in the main group because they were the highest level characters of their catigory.  Phunani was not the highest level secondary healer but because of the presence of Tokaaz and the nature of The Hole i considered it important that every group have a porter of some type in their group.  Even when I reorganized groups later I kept either a druid or a wizzy in each group so that we could get out or succor if it was necessary.<br>
<br>
The primary benifit and purpose of the main group is communication.  If the raid leader is in the main group he/she has more control of the raid.  He/she can make requests in group that will be more likely to be noticed than tells and the raid channel.  Mana status, multiple pulls, directions (as in where do we want to go), and buffs can all be said in group and do little to disrupt the rest of the raid.  I have worked with the main puller outside the main group.  Useing tells is nowhere near as effective as grouping with him.<br>
<br>
If the raid is large enough or complex enough(ex the plate cycle in kael) to warrant a Secondary Group the same general rules apply.  The only difference would be that members of the Main group are outside of consideration for the secondary group.<br>
<br>
HEALING/BUFFING<br>
<br>
Some situations require more than &quot;inc complete heal on MT&quot;.  There are mobs out there that can take down a tank in less than 30 seconds with him being lv 65 and completely buffed(im thinking Vindi, Tormax, The Dracolich and thats just in velious and fear). I am not going to address this too much because my cleric is only lv 28 and I have no experience in this area.  I have seen multiple clerics &quot;chain heal&quot; a tank when going up against a hard mob and they were highly coordinated.  Not only were the clerics (i believe there were 4) highly coordinated but the line of tanks was clearly delineated and we were down to the 3rd tank when the mob finaly went down.  I will just emphasize healing is  incredibly important and ask one of our senior clerics to fill in this blank.<br>
<br>
PULLING<br>
<br>
Pulling is just as important as any of the other considerations in a raid.  Splitting mobs and single pulls can be the difference between getting a drop and being wiped out.  Again in this instance I do not have a monk/sk/necro/bard who can split mobs and who is asked to pull in raids.  I will bow to the more experienced pullers in the game and will ask some of our senior pullers to add their comments here.<br>
<br>
Ok guys thats a wrap for now.  Please comment and ask questions.  I have made an attempt at outlineing the basics of running a raid but there is always room for improvement and comments.<br>
<br>
Thank You<br>

 after  making up your first and 2nd groups,  just get a good group leader,  a healer, then  just add anyone.  a porter  is sometimes  also nessesary.<br>

   i usualy try and have a dedicated healer  just in charge of  my  main  enchanter,  and  slower   also,  it helps  on  needless deaths <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=rumpepper>rumpepper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#70DB93>(8/27/03 12:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=594.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Raid 101 comments</span><hr size=1> Well Von asked for my comments so here goes.<br>
<br>
Von makes so very good points in his discussions. Growing up as a low level toon you begin to learn your role as a specialized toon and not just caster or mellee. It took me a while and so odd things to happen before I was able to truely grasp how &quot;real raiding&quot; works. Let me explain a bit. For me there is a difference in super grouping and raiding. Raiding usually requires more than one group to kill the mob no matter what level they are. While supergrouping can get a lot accomplished, usually there is little definition in leadership and roles, basicaly because the goals are to kill lots of mobs. What can make supergrouping successful is using raid ideals. Ideals are those like Von mentioned. In many of the raids I have attended there were channels for clerics, nukers, and raid leaders. A key to successful raiding is having the trust of those attending. Hot keys or macros advising engage or other important commands are a must. <br>
<br>
Mellee should know a few things to help the raid as a unit. IMO these apply to all except in the main tanking line. Weapons that do not proc aggro detraction should be used. Bash should also be avoided as it is an aggro attractant. Two handed weapons are typically preferred because you can stand farther back from the mob and still hit it. In fact, you should approach mobs by assisting the MT with a hotkey and walk to the mob until your chat window displayes your contacts. There are a few reasons for this, one is to allow those with shorter weapons the ability to make hits on the mob, but also to avoid AE and flurries. There should be a hot key made to spam when a mob rampages advising folks to back off. During rampage the only engangement of the mob should be by the Rampage tank and the Main Tank. The reason for this is simple, the clerics are all concentrating on healing the MT and don't have the extra time to cast heals on others who had no business getting hit to begin with. One last thing is to back off if you have aggro! Again clerics are concerned with keeping one person alive, if the MT drops mobs go wild and it become difficult for the secondary tank to regain aggro before too many are dropped. <br>
<br>
For clerics - the hardest working class in the game. So, you have sat one your pretty little tushes your whole life and popped up to cast a heal then back down. Guess what, thats all over in raids! The prime requisite is the ability to count to 8!!!!! WHen it comes to raiding clerics must know how to make hot keys, open chat channels and program key casted spells. The mouse can fail or slide if you are in a hurry to click a spell off and the raid needs to know you are on time with your casting of spells. In many cases a minimuim of 4 clerics are needed for the chain heals. It takes 8 seconds for Complete Heal to be cast so make sure you program your hot key for raid say and the cleric channel. You will be in a certain oder so be sure you know what it is. If someone link dies in the chain you need to pick up the slack. Also make sure you are at your maximum casting range, the raid doesn't need you dying to the mobs AE and flurries. In most castes the group is not your concern, just the MT. Some exceptions include the poison AE of Trak where your group heal spells are needed. <br>
<br>
Allanone makes a good point, in making your group leaders someone who has had some raiding exp or someone who you can communicate well with. Party members should direct their communications and questions to the group leader and the group leader can then act upon. Some instances are when a group missed a buff, there is no need for 6 raid spams that my group missed it, a tell from the group leader to the caster fixes it and doesn't interupt raid comments. Raid say is needed for raid comments, a channel to important facts about actions theat have or need to happen, keeping it clear of unneeded chat is important. <br>
<br>
Some key information for all users is to listen/read all comments. If you are asked to do something odd, chances are it is for a good reason. If you have never raided a particular mob, then you may not understand why, but chances are by the end of the battle and noone is lost you will understand. What do I mean? In Fear you may be told before the encounter with Cazic to drop all your buffs!!! The reason is this mob dispells and you need to have certain buffs on at the end in mopes of succeeding. When fighting Ictus Viterus (sorry on spelling) Staying behind his throne in pre stage keeps aggro away and also mellee should fight him with thier backs to the throne as he pushes you way away casuing you to aggro others, if you do just die! When fighting Trak casters and then others who can fit should be under him to avoid the AE. <br>
<br>
There's many more than this and these are just my opinions and observations from my experiences and raids I have attended. But I hope these help future raid leaders and members gain an idea of what will be expected of them and how important their role is. <br>
<br>
well that more like my 3cp worth instead but I hope it helps!<br>
