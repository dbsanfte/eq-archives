i didn't see a raincaller post a single event on the fed forum in months.<br>
<br>
lach and other officers asked for a pulse in april and no sign of lifesigns were forthcoming.  the only pulse i've seen was a thread telling the fed that a raincaller noticed the fed could help him with his epic. <br>
<br>
sheff, someone from your guild should have the fed officer forum password to discuss these and other issues.   <p><br><a href="http://www.unhomed.com">

The officers have been discussing, and putting this off for several months. Kulina was the first to start asking the Raincallers about thier participation, and I took over when I was voted leader. There has been more than ample time for them to respond, and they have not.<br>
<br>
The council decided our course of action, and we carried it out. The Raincallers are more than welcome to appeal. <p><img src="http://www.eq-darklegion.com/images/photos/lachadan.jpg" >

If there were problems with the Raincallers and thier leadership, they should have kept the Federation up to date on thier status, not disappeared for almost 5 months, and then come back expecting the Federation to take them back in with open arms.  We need guilds that are going to be there, and help one another, not only show up when THEY need help.<br>
<br>
If there is a required meeting, please let me know.  I will keep an open mind to this, and listen to reasons as to why The Raincallers hasn't been around, but as of now I have to agree with those that are tired of an inactive guild taking the place of a guild that would be alot more active and appreciative of what the Federation is all about.<br>

We've been here a long time and its been over a year since we saw the raincallers at any events or post on these boards, they have been approached in the past with regards to this fact but with no response.<br>
<br>
I've seen souls of defiance host their own raids and invite the fed, but not seen any raincallers events at all - I've visted their boards and not seen much in the way of posting either.<br>
<br>
Guilds come and guilds go for different reasons, we'd never boot a guild because they were too small for us thats not in our nature, our openness defines us but when a guild vanishes from sight and both gives and takes nothing from us there becomes a point when having them as a part of us devalues our alliance.<br>
<br>
We are upwordly mobile but have no minimum membership no minimum level, we do not ask you to be level 56 with epic to join us as guilds with comparable power to our alliance do, this matter has been discussed at length for months and it is with regret that the leaders and officers have taken this action but it is also completely understandable and completely justifiable. <p><img src="http://www.eq-darklegion.com/images/eldark.gif"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000080><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ubendieq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BendiEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 134<br> <font color=#70DB93>(9/2/02 11:23:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=350.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Officers of the Fed plz read.</span><hr size=1> &lt;shrugs&gt; Just pointing it out. I can name two fed events that the Raincaller's have attended within the past 3-4 months. Sheff attended one of my Kedge raids (when they were still Fed events) and 2-3 raincallers attended my (again, at that time, a Fed event) Upper Guk camp. And, I *think*, but can't remember for sure, that one did attend my Nurga crawl as well.<br>
<br>
Plus, they did indeed host a raid on someplace, Dalnir's, I think, which was open to the Fed, though not posted on Fed boards. (I didn't attend, being outside the level range).<br>
<br>
So, saying they have been totally inactive isn't factual. Just wanting to clear that up, since I was the leader of all fed events (back when I hosted fed events) that they attended.<br>

I will be glad to join you on any raid or grouping if my time allows me. Im going back to school so my time will be limited to at the max, 3 hours a day during the week, and for now all weekend. I will definatly check the LoLF web page. <br>
<br>
Secondly i would like to appologize for the innactivity of the guild for the last few months. We have gone to another guild leader who is still trying to figure things out at the moment. For the Website problem. Our old guild leader and assistant guild leader owned the web site. they had some RL problems that caused them to get rid of it all. that includes stoping them from playing EQ. We are still currently trying to fix this problem along with recruiting more people.<br>
<br>
The reason i myself havn't been really active is because most of the fed stuff is based on higher levels, most people signing up for plane raids (one thing i was really looking forward to when i hit 51) were usually 53- 60. Though if anyone was willing to do some raids based on 25-40 place zones im sure my guild would try to make it. The thing i just really hope for is basically just a trial run kind of thing when the guild is a bit more organized.<br>
<br>
Again, i thank you for your time and i hope you will reconsider the dismissal of The Raincallers from the Federation. I dont ask it right away. I just hope that at some time before the new expansion pack comes out you will have decided that the raincallers are allowed back in the fed. I would really be glad to join you all on some first day raids in some of the new plains. (not sure which one is the correct spelling for this type; so i just spelled it both ways, one in the paragraph above).<br>
