<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://66.93.39.18/images/voxdown.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
This raid went pretty smoothly in terms of her actually dying, but did have several rough spots in prep. Those rough spots were smooth in the end though, as there were actually very, very few deaths in this Vox kill. Overall, Sadili did a great job.<br>
<br>
Issues in general...<br>
Be on time please:<br>
A very large number of people were late. Rude folks. Glad you eventually made it, but it waste everyone else's time waiting on you. If you'll say you'll be there, please make the effort to be there on time. This is not just a Vox thing, this is a &quot;any raid&quot; thing and really a &quot;life&quot; thing.<br>
<br>
Clearing:<br>
My own two bits worth would be not to clear the pits in the future. The pits do not have the same multi-hour repop timer that the lair does, and so clearing the pits only gives you minimal relief and does not balance out against the time that it takes. That's just MHO though.<br>
<br>
Having done this a few times now, I'm increasingly of the opinion that we need to have the support group start out ahead and clear what they can, but then largely mass pull the lair and get it over with. Ideally not everything mind you, but we were handling 5-6 giants (including the Priest of Naggy) fairly well. I think if we decide ahead of time who's going to make pets out of what, we can use a mass pull to our advantage. Just something to try.<br>
<br>
Buffing: <br>
No one is really to blame for this one - just one of those things when not everyone is fully aware of what &quot;real&quot; buffs are coming. We had Circles coming (thanks Cheebs), and several groups elected to use Resist Fire as a junk buff. Normally RF is a great junk buff for Vox, but Circle overwrites it, so all the sudden you've got a circle in you junk buff slots.<br>
<br>
<br>
Done right:<br>
Mana seiving:<br>
We had no chanters. That means no tash and no mana seive from them. The Bards took care of that as best they could. She did get off one CH, but that was it. Considering no chanters - 1 CH t'ain't bad.<br>
<br>
Healing: The healers did a spectacular job. Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Aggro: <br>
I LD'd (think it was related to an internet worm that was active last night - LD'd several times) about the second time she was at 30%, so I didn't get to see all the way through. What I did see was well managed. Good job gang.<br>
<br>
Resists:<br>
Wow. With Circles and everything else, people were resisting like crazy - thus the very few deaths. Another factor, BTW, was that we were VERY high in level this time. 50's resist a lot better than 40's. Still, everyone in my group had 200+ resists (I had a 255 CR) while my songs were playing. Then I went LD, and some folks started missing resists and dying. Sorry gang (I never go LD, but kept LD'ing all night last night after that, so I'm not sure what was up. It was a network thing - as both my EQ connected systems were doing it in synch with each other).<br>
<br>
Looting:<br>
Folks were great and patient. There was only one exception to the rule - a person who wanted to debate the clearly posted loot rules on one item. Sorry - rules posted. Enough already. By and large, everyone was truly great - as they almost always are - and were very happy for the winners. I'm sorry I didn't get a list this week, but maybe Sadili did.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fun times gang.<br>
<br>
Continued thanks to everyone for making this work. This raid continues to prove that people from all across Povar can come together and work together to have success and some serious fun. Folks over this raid series have been increadibly NON-selfish. Points out over and over again many of the things I love about this game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=agurg>Agurg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#70DB93>(1/25/03 1:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Janurary 24th - Victory!

I watched Lysara when she went in.  the buffs that were dispelled were random, not the first 4...  personally, I think &quot;crap&quot; buffs are most likely a waste of time nowadays.

The assumption that buff slots are dispelled in order is one of the most fundemental raid ideas in the game. I will have to watch that closer in the future.<br>
<br>
That said:<br>
<br>
What could be at issue is that some 60+ buffs my not be cancellable buy a standard dispell - which is what I think that Vox uses. The result could be that some buffs get &quot;skipped&quot; because they can't be dispelled.<br>
<br>
Just a guess. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000060><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cheebacoroner>Cheeba Coroner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Soldier of the Federation</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#70DB93>(1/25/03 3:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox Janurary 24th - Victory!

Never figured out exactly who but it wasn't our puller or tagger.  /shrug  Once the camp out was done and she was reset it was all good.  People got a little impatient around this point but everything that could be done was being done.  Heh.  <br>
<br>
Loot:  <br>
100% weight reduction bag- Taldaar<br>
15 int/wis eye patch- Valisbourne<br>
cleric hammer- Karey<br>
crystaline spear- um...just drew a blank here.<br>
<br>
One thing I do need to address was support group people.  Thank you for showing up you were a big help but next time please check with me first.  I would prefer that you sign up rather than just show up.  As things are it was supposed to be only 6 support people rolling and I believe there were 8 there.  I don't like having to be the bad guy so please just sign up and make it easy on me =) <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.ministryofsteel.com/pics/sigs/paladin.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

We got her several times over the course of several weeks.<br>
<br>
I had hoped this would live on long past me, but I've been too busy in RL to push it, and we seemed to have generated enough interest that other folks are actually trying her again now. I know that she's been attempted 5 or 6 times at least since our last kill of her (haven't heard whether any of them were successful or not - I know that several weren't).<br>
<br>
Good peeps doing good teamwork = dead dragon. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I will likely try and get things moving again soon - perhaps when my cleric makes 40, or sooner if RL lightens up on me a bit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=108.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showNextMessage?topicID=108.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=108.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/classic/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.emailToFriend?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.threadControl?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=108.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub70.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="federationofpovarfrm1">Federation Discussion Forum<option value="federationofpovarfrm3">Federation Raid Ideas<option value="federationofpovarfrm4">Federation Raid and Events Calendar<option value="federationofpovarfrm9">Federation AFTER Raid Discussion <option value="federationofpovarfrm5">Federation Rules<option value="federationofpovarfrm6">Federation Officers <option value="federationofpovarfrm8">Epic Hall of Fame<option value="federationofpovarfrm11">/auc<option value="federationofpovarfrm14">Applications<option value="federationofpovarfrm15">Archived Events</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#70DB93>- </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar>Federation of Povar</a><font color=#70DB93> - </font><a href=http://pub70.ezboard.com/ffederationofpovarfrm9>Federation AFTER Raid Discussion </a> <font color=#70DB93> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.245d<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
