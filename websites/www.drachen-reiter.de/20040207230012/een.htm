          guild. If you are looking for an 'uber'-raidingguild, we are probably 
          not going to fit that need for you right now.While we certainly are 
          after large targets, and are willing to try and die finding out tactics, 
          we are not in any kind of race or competition with anyone.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although we are a German-founded guild, 
          our raid chat is English, simply because we have members from various 
          countries like Holland, Denmark, the USA and Austria. Some understanding 
          of German might help to cope with guildchat and jokes, though, but it 
          is by no means required.<br>
          <br>
          Important note:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>We are member of Karana 
          Guild Central (KGC). <br>
          <br>
          Therefore, all rules of the KGC will apply to our members, and we will 
          follow all the KGC-policies regarding scheduling and rotations.<br>
          Do not intentionally killsteal from anyone, intentionally train anyone, 
          or scam anyone in trades. <br>
          Verification of such instances will be grounds for immediate removal 
          from the guild. </b></font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Our loot policy is based on 
          a kind of &quot;Need before Greed&quot; system and not using any point-system.<br>
          During a raid loots will be distributed by the officers, considering:<br>
          <br>
          -Is the item an upgrade for the player, the last time player got an 
          item, proof of willingness to attend raids, and the overall impact on 
          the strength of the guild.-<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, if your main goal in the game is to acquire the best of items 
          for your character in the fastest possible time, we are probably not 
          going to fit that need for you.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We intend to become able to attack and 
          win against the larger targets all over Norrath including PoP (future 
          goals: Tier 1 &amp; 2 Gods - like Bertox,<br>
          Saryn, Mithaniel Marr, Zeks, etc... and LDoN raids.<br>
          <br>
          However, our tactics will not consist of throwing characters at the 
          target until it goes down. Instead we will focus on using skill, strategy 
          and unity, aka working as a team to accomplish our goal(s).<br>
          <br>
          Normal raiding time is between 7pm to 11pm (CET, GMT +1), but we do 
          not want to focus our guild exclusively on high end raiding. There's 
          always room for fun, quests and general sillyness besides our raids. 
          We are running raids three times a week.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Personal items and class components:<br>
          This means our clerics have Peridots, our mages have Pearls, and all 
          other classes have enough food, water, arrows and components to be self-sufficient 
          during raids. While we can provide for the costs of components AFTER 
          the raid (via the message board) we expect you to come fully prepared 
          to a guild event every time. </font></p>

          <br>
          While it is not required, we want to encourage all of our members and 
          applicants to group and hunt with guildmates in order to get to know 
          eachother. This will also familiarize everyone with their guildmates 
          strengths and weaknesses, and allow us to learn to work as a strong, 
          cohesive fighting unit. Listening to, and the following of issued raid 
          orders is mandatory. If you have problems staying at your keyboard or 
          with working as a team you will cause problems for your fellow guildmates, 
          and are perhaps better off in another setup.<br>
          <br>
          We expect you to help all your guildfriends in all matters (quests, 
          tactics, leveling, guidance, porting, ress'ing, etc, etc).<br>
          <br>
          However, don't expect to get a group at login immediately, just because 
          you wear a guild tag. Other guildies might be in a solo camp, or after 
          a specific target, or doing something balanced. Don't whine and log 
          an alt, but try to make/find your own group and do some public relations 
          for our guild, or just let the guild know you are available for whenever 
          a spot opens.<br>
          <br>
          Your alternate characters will also carry the Drachenreiter tag, to 
          stay in contact with the guild. We do not tolerate multiple guilding.<br>
          We understand the need to play alts from time to time, which is why 
          we don't require 100% of your time on your primary character, but having 
          ties and/or responsebilities with other guilds than Drachenreiter with 
          alternate characters is not permitted.<br>
          <br>
          Be proud of your Guildtag and show it, use /roleplaying and not /anonymous.<br>
          <br>
          Being a member of Drachenreiter, we would like you to:<br>
          <br>
          -To think about what you can do for your guild and not what your guild 
          can do for you.</font></p>

          of Drachenreiter.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">-Before you sell stuff in 
          the bazaar try to keep in mind if there are any guild members who might 
          need this item. This especially goes for resist gear and spells.<br>
          <br>
          Note: Some droppable item(s) you will receive during a raid will remain 
          guild property, and handed down to other members as soon as you get 
          a better item, to make us stronger as guild. If this is the case, it 
          will be stated before distribution.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Due to the amount 
          of applicants we are attracting, we had to think about new standards 
          in recruting.<br>
          As we have reached a very powerfull raidforce by now, which makes us 
          capeable of killing new targets, we only want to add new members if 
          they fit to us in matter of social skills as well as in experience and 
          gear. As you all can imagine it is sometimes very hard to keep the balance 
          between having fun and meeting friends as well as improving the guild. 
          <br>
          <br>
          So, in general we made new standards for applicants, where they can 
          add value a to the guild immediately, rather than we have to put effort 
          in them to raise them up to the level of our coremembers. For rl friends/ 
          family exeptions can be made, on a case by case basis.<br>
          <b><br>
          The standard requirements for applicants are now:</b></font></p>
        <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">LvL: 65<br>
          AA: 35<br>

          Flags: Trials, BoT</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The officers will judge all applicants 
          prior to getting tagged, so you must post a <a href="http://www.magelo.com/" target="_blank">Magelo</a> 
          profile with your application.<br>
          <br>
          - To apply for membership the applicant has to contact any officer, 
          and/or leave a message on <a href="http://pub124.ezboard.com/bopendrachenreiter" target="_self">our 
          ezboard</a>. Knowing a full member that can speak up for you sure helps. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">New members will also be on probation for 
          a one month period, during this time they should be grouping with guild 
          members, and attend as many scheduled guild raids as possible. You should 
          play your Main charcter during this time. <br>
          Your alternative character will not be invited during your probation 
          period.. <br>
          Please note that the probationary character will be the Main character 
          in our guild.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All members and applicants should own the

          Map knowledge<br>
          <br>
          A basic knowledge of the zones we are raiding in is required. Since 
          the 'net is full of maps, tips, message boards and information we expect 
          our members to be able to move swiftly to any given location on Norrath 
          and the Planes, should an opportunity arise for a needed kill/mob/quest 
          item, etc. While we can't expect everyone to have a full knowledge about 
          every single zone in Everquest we do want our guildies to be able to 
          reach spots of interest in a reasonable time, or at least the knowledge 
          of where to be for pick-ups and directions. <br>
