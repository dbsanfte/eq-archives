<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaelissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I'm fairly new to Ranger life, but I'm loving it so far. I've played a warrior previously and remember not being able to use the warrior trainers in Shadowhaven... so I'm wondering do we have any trainers in Luclin that we can use right from the start? i.e. I've done no factioning at all.<br />
<br />
Also can we (Human Ranger of Tunare) train in Kelethin or Rivervale? (I remember being able to use the Freeport/Qeynos warrior trainers)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sylviania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">as a tunare ranger , u should probly be able to train in Kelethin.<br />
<br />
never tried luclin ones, so i can't tell.<br />
no problem with FV one, but i got some good faction hit before i went there<br />
<br />
for rivervale , no idea, start trying to enter in the home without a shrink :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
To answer your question, you should be able to use any Ranger trainer, regardless of faction.  As a ranger, you should be able to Sneak behind the trainer and con indifferent.  In addition to this, diety does not play into being able to training at all.  My Cleric worships Brell Serilis, and is able to train at any Cleric guild that I can get too (as long as I'm not KoS).  There are Ranger trainers in ...<br />

Surefall Glade<br />
Rivervale<br />
Kithicor Forest<br />
Kelethin<br />
Fironia Vie<br />
Shadow Haven<br />
Katta Castelum<br />
<br />
Not sure about Thurgadin, Kael Drakkel, or Skyshrine.<br />

<br />
Thanks, as I said, I'm fairly new to the Ranger class and forgot about Sneak. hehe<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Will have to try sneak on the RNG trainer in SH.......last time I went to him I got the &quot;Grrr Human.......go away&quot; - Damn Elves ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My wood elf was not able to train in Shadow Haven without sneak, either, so I'm not sure it's a race thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aandaas Verdemu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shadowhaven faction starts so low that you have to quest to raise it to selling/training level, unless of course you are one of us great rangers (or other class that can sneak, but they don't count), just sneak behind any trainer or vendor, regardless of faction and you can train or buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">MANY THANKS!<br />
<br />
Loaded up last night, was in SH....snuck up on trainer - wahoo :)<br />
<br />
Also I went to Crystal Caverns with a few m8s to check the place out (the sweetest looking and sounding place I've been to in EQ yet I must say!) and used it to sell to the Coldains as well which meant lots of pp from collecting the Veluim weapons :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes as a Human Ranger of Tunare or of Karana you can train in Felwithe, no problems; however your faction will not allow you to start the Trueshot Bow quest; you will have to prove yourself by wacking a few hundred orcs in Crushbone or by turning muffins in in Freeport for faction.<br />
Also just do the faction quest for the necklace in SH for sufficient faction to train and/or buy your spells without sneak. Its an easy enough quest, basically involving just note running. The hardest part is running to Fungus Grove, and it can be done with a SOW with no problems, even at level 1.<br />
Doing the quest once will get you to indifferent (if I remember right) 2 times to high amiable, the third gets you to kindly.<br />
To my knowledge there arent any ranger trainers in Kael, Thurg or Skyshrine...at least none that I have noticed as I didnt relocate to these zones until after my training needs were met</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, as a human ranger of Karana you can train in Kelethin; Felwithe does not have any ranger trainers. <br />
<br />
Rangers can train at any ranger trainer they aren't KoS at, simply because of sneak.  The same is true of any race/class that gets sneak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dunaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are also ranger trainers in Sanctus Seru</div></div><hr />
