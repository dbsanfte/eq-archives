ok need a little help.... ive given up and the wtov arms arent gonna drop for me, so what would you put there - hardened grey flesh?<br />
<br />
i play in a high end raiding guild that pretty much doest do epics so i might never finish my epic, what would you put in primary if youre not using your epic?<br />
<br />
would also like to ditch the goranga idol... i have a few other sort of weak slots too - looking to get my ac/hp up a little more since my guild is just starting ntov and im one of the few malo shamans.<br />
<br />
my budget is probably up to around 30k.<br />
<br />
thanks for your help -<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heikko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since you meantioned a budget I'm assuming you are only interested in NoN NO Drop items.  Primary there isn't a ton of great options so maybe a Disease War Mace from CT would be ok with 6 wisdom and 65 hp's.  For the arms the HGFS is a decent choice 6 sta and 25 hp's and you're only losing 2 ac off the ones you are wearing now.  As far as the ranged item goes I know it's a little pricey but I love my Othmir Prexus Totem, 5 ac, 20 sta and 18 wisdom is definately a keeper till you get a better no drop one from somewhere.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Circled Toe Bones/Shadel Bandit Ring (those don't really upgrade HP though, just saying)<br />
<br />
I don't know what for range, since you ain't on dragon faction for talisman of benevolence.<br />
<br />
Hands - Shissar or Coldain skin (Coldain skin give more HP unless you're near sta cap, which you aren't).<br />
<br />
And get epic.  :D  I use a thunder runed war spear, 5ac 25hp 5mr in addition to being 13/30 or whatever.</div></div><hr />

There is a relatively decent range item that can be quested if you have the PoP expansion. Also, they progress in difficulty/reward similiar to the Thurg shawls.<br />
<br />
It starts out with the following:<br />
<br />
Willamina's Needles, very easy quest, involves you running around PoK talking to various people and giving them various items. Anyone of any level can do this part.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2183<br />
<br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
AC: +1 Cha: +2  <br />
Weight: 1.0 <br />
Classes: All Classes  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
Inventory Slot: Secondary Melee<br />
Can be equipped in the range slot <br />
<br />
This in itself sucks, but don't worry you can upgrade it to this:<br />
<br />

<br />

 <br />
This in turn, can be upgraded to this:<br />

Once again, sorry if this isn't what you're interested in or if this quest has been posted before. I have the Beginner's Magic Manual and can't wait to upgrade it to the Intermediate one.</div></div><hr />
