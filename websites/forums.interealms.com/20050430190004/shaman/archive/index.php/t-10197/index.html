<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">howdy,<br />
<br />
I haven't my wish around anywhere, but if it is, feel free to berate me and point me in that direction (search didn't find this)...<br />
<br />
BUT, the number one thing I want from the LoY expansion isn't more bank space (enough of a packrat as is, and 8 slots forces me to clean up occasionally), and it isn't a ripped off LFG functionality.... it is MORE FREAKIN SPELL SLOTS.<br />
<br />
About the banks space SOE says this:Each day in the world of Norrath, on the moon of Luclin, and in the many Planes, more treasures are discovered. With such an abundance of loot, eight bank slots just doesn't cut it anymore. The same thing can be said about SPELLS!  YOY can't we get more than 8 spells mem'd at the same time after 65+aaxp levels and 4 years???<br />
<br />
Ok, i'm done ranting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree, I would LOVE to have a few more spell slots but I am SERIOUSLY excited about the other features that we are getting in LoY ESPECIALLY the additional bank space.<br />
<br />
The current 8 slots are not nearly enough when you consider folks that are midway in the process of completing several quests (myself - shawl quests, Coldain rings, cudgel quests), plus amassing numerous tradeskill materials and purchasing spells in advance of levels you have achieved.  All this is in addition to having to store a full set of resist gear and actually wanting to be able to store other treasure/loot that you may want to hold on to.<br />
<br />
For some classes they may also need to collect components for spell research.<br />
<br />
8 slots has definitely outlived its time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Apparently, people think having more spell slots is overpowering :rolleyes:   For the life of me, I don't see how, especially in a shaman's case.<br />
<br />
I once proposed something like having seperate spell boxes for certain categories like:<br />
4 slots beneficial only(heals, buffs, cures)<br />
4 slots non-beneficial only(debuffs, roots, snares, etc.)<br />
4 slots detrimental only (DD's, DoTs, AE's)<br />
2 slots general (anything you want, but good for keeping a gate, evac, port up or something)<br />
<br />
That might be alot of extra spell slots, but it's still limits the type of spells that can be memmed and at the same time, have a better variety.  I know druids, clerics and shamans can benefit greatly due to the variety of spells we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/plead... More spells slots please, would make the 2 and 3 box-ing 10x easier ;p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In keeping with the 'time sink = content' theme so prevalent, why doesn't VI just make an extra spell slot an AA ability?<br />
<br />
Code it so there are 10 slots available (max) in the UI,  however, a slot doesn't 'open up' until you get the AA ability (say 1 at 51 and 1 at 55)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">man its so obvious how badly they are ripping us off. They are intentionally holding back features so we have to pay for them. No doubt additional Spell cells will be added in the future, and our EQ lemming mentalities will tell us &quot;I have to get that!!!&quot; and shell out another 30 bucks for an expansion. These are the kind of things that should be added in PATCHES if we're paying 13 bucks a month to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Draw1more</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You know all those spells that all the casters haven't found yet?   (in our case the minitorpor spell Stoicism)  My bet is that they are the new spells in LoY.../drool</div></div><hr />

Make it 10<br />
<br />
10 spell slots woudl be much much better.<br />
<br />
We have to swap too many spells it's not liek we are wizards and every slot is a nuke we got utility spells heals sow Eb haste regen blah blah list goes on 10 slots is not too much to ask after so many spaells have been introduced in this game past 3 years.<br />

Worried about twinks?  Put 60+ level requirement, simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">10 spell slots will make me happy.<br />

Give me more quests so i can actually feel like i am accomplishing something other than just getting exp. Grinding exp to me is like having to work on a weekend. While you could you be out having fun you just seem to be doing the same boring thing you do every day of the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Indoor dungeons with 'instancing' technology<br />
All loot no drop with appropriate level restrictions.<br />
Mobs that port out players of too high a level like vox/nag do.<br />

I love that quote sarania<br />

There has not been a real dungeon in EQ since Kunark. Every dungeon since Velious has been nothing more than a big zone with exp mobs and two or three bosses. On a saturday a lot of people would love to hit a dungeon and try and get some sweet stuff to either gear up or sell for cash to get other things.<br />
<br />
Give us back our one group loot dungeons damn it and stop f-ing up the game with your piss poor &quot;vision&quot;</div></div><hr />

Also, I wish they'd do more about the lag. Most content in POP<br />
is choppy. Just about every night someone in my group goes LD<br />
(either me, or someone else).</div></div><hr />

Almost scary to think it used to be a single-target only cast, not to mention it took more than one cast to fully shrink a large race. 8 ogres melees on a raid all wanted shrink at the same after a wipeout...that was definitely a fun time.../sigh.</div></div><hr />
