<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can partner with a mage too. If you get 2 just OT one of them while the mage nukes the other. Keep a HoT on you and the mage pet and patch as you see fit. Its pretty nice with only 2 people because if the ornate is dropping theres a 50% chance its your money 8).</div></div><hr />

I tried with a monk but would have to slow pretty fast - which meant that when slow was resisted and the shaman got aggro I was in for some trouble. I think with a proper monk partner I'd have been fine but I was 2-boxing and not familiar with the monk.<br />

XP is nice, and the pp from ornate drops can potentially be really good.</div></div><hr />
