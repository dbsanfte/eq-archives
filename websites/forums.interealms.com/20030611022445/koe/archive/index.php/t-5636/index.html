<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Great game in the early going, but WOW what a dominant Canadian team. Congratulations to the USA for getting to the gold medal game and a well deserved silver medal.<br />
<br />
WOOOOOOP!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It was a great game all the way through. There was momentum shifts both ways, and Team USA never gave up.<br />
<br />
As for Supreme Hockey Rulers of the Universe, well,  I don't know that we can say that, but we do have bragging rights until the next World Cup/Olympics :) <br />
<br />
Something our friends South of the 49th may not appreciate, was this game, honestly, defined our Olympics. We did very well at these games, but they would not have been a sucess to us without winning hockey gold. We're proud of all our Olympians but the one passion we have, as a country, is hockey. Its a defining part of our national identity. In the US, you have a split between baseball, football and basketball, with hockey a distant 4th in terms of professional sports. For us there really and truly is only 1. We have maintained for years, that we produce the best hockey players in the world and have proven it over the years in several venues (such as the World Junior championships and other amateur tourneys), but we lacked the credibility that the Olympic Championship brings. The argument was that Canada (and the US) never sent their best, as they were in the NHL. This was not true of most of the European coutnries. Nagano was the first time in a long time where we had an opportunity to send our best, and for both Canada and the US it was a disaster. This Olympics we had a second chance.<br />
<br />
After 50 years, our Olympic drought is over.<br />
<br />
Thank you to arguably the best Canadian Team to ever take to the ice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just have to agree - what a great game...<br />
<br />
The canadians just plain out played us - but a great great game over all..<br />
<br />
hats off to the canadians who won, and hats off the the americans for the silver!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Was a lot of fun watching and following throughout the games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kept track of the game from work. Wish I could have seen it. Well done, Canada. Congratulations.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ryptagudn Gobbleguts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Have to agree.  This was a great hockey tournament and congrats to our wacky, misunderstood neighbors to the north for winning.  :)<br />
<br />
This Olympic Hockey tournament had a LOT of drama to it, not to mention it rated high on the unintentional comedy scale (could someone PLEASE repost that picture of Tommy Salo getting hit in the head with the puck? -- that cracks me up).  <br />
<br />
Anyway, congrats again to the Canadians.  They deserved it.</div></div><hr />
