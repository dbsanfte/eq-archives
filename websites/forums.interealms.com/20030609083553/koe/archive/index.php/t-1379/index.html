<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just posting to confirm our usual Wed night gathering is on for tonight, starting at 7 CST. Usual raid length is 3  to 3 1/2 hours. <br />
<br />
We are still in SolA and the meeting place is the druid ring in Lavastorm. Please be there a bit before hand if you can be, so we might start promptly on time. <br />
<br />
For those of you new, this night has grown out of what used to be &quot;Lizzy night&quot; where Bearan and I played alts with friends and some fellow guildmates. The level ranges we are working with go from 27-30 or so. This event is open to KoE and petitioners. <br />
<br />
Tonight, our mission is a bit different as we plan to make our way into Sol A. We will have a special guest along that should make things &quot;interesting&quot;. The objective tonight is to get to the kings room and pull the surrounding areas, so the action should be fast and furious. <br />
<br />
I might be on as Kly for a short period before hand, but you can also look me up as Calon or contact Griss (Bearan). <br />
<br />
We will form up groups and go kick some gob booty!<br />
<br />
See everyone tonight!</div></div><hr />
