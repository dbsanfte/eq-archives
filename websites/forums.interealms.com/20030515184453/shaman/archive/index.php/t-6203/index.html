<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">really its fairly simple, i got lucky there was a reaver group upstairs and killed enough reavers to spawn Rak.  this is what we did<br />
<br />
raid break down<br />
<br />
3cleric 55+<br />
1shaman 57<br />
2 mages one 55 one 49<br />
2 wizzys one 60 with mb<br />
1 chanter 58<br />
1 bard 53<br />
1 rogue 56<br />
1 ranger 54<br />
1 53 pally GOOOO PETE<br />
1 sham(observer) 45 i think?<br />
and i think thats it<br />
<br />
any hoo, wizzy and ranger got in COM ranger tracked lord rak<br />
<br />
got raid there and cleared to left side of moat. staged there, then cleared bridge to raks room rogue picked lock and 60 wiz pulled all the other mobs in room, usually will be a reaver in room so be ready to deal with that. this one happend to spawn lord grisok so the other sham got his books .<br />
<br />
after rak room clear  of all but rak, raid group went in and stayed in the far left corner from rak( right next to door) mages made lvl 49 fire pets and parked them right by rak(hes non agro) medded to full mana and i turned in tear, took a few AOE's but clerics kept me alive for a few rounds, but mage pets more important to stay alive than me so LOADING PLEASE WAIT,  i bound inside CoM at entrace for CoH purposes got back to room and watched Rak get dead.   no room repops. <br />
<br />
note Rak will run when low on life make sure a snarer snares or root at 20%<br />
<br />
looted tear killed a few reavers gated ran to turn in and Epic<br />
fairly easy , only one death the whole time.... mine lol<br />
<br />
see you in norrath<br />
