<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now I know why they call him the Cursed... I end up cursing at him every time. :p  We seem to be unable to take this guy down.  <br />
<br />
Raid force is about 40-50 people, about half of whom are 60 (rest all 50-somethings), and it always has ended in a wipeout so far.  We junk up (5 junk buffs each) before engaging him, though not everyone has insta-clicky items to hold off the dispells, and I know this is a problem that needs addressing.  The biggest problem is we seem to be unable to hide our clerics and casters from his AE without getting adds.  We've tried fighting him in his room, pulling him into the right-hand corner and fighting him there while the casters sit by the door.   We've tried pulling to the HoT door and pulling him into the right corner while the casters hang a bit closer to the &quot;pit&quot;.  Either way someone ends up aggroing a pit mob that wipes out our back line (as every melee is busy trying to out-damage Doze's regen).  We can't seem to drop him fast enough before the pit respawns, then the add comes and cleans the casters and clerics clocks, then the CR comes. :p  We get him to 50-60%, then all hell breaks loose.<br />
<br />
We get him slowed no problem (even if one of our Malo shamans isn't there, Tash and OOS is enough for me to Turgur him in a few casts), and I'm reasonably sure we could take him out if we could control the adds.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated, since this guy is putting a crimp in our Skyshrine armor farming for the past 2 weeks. ;)</div></div><hr />

1. Why is Doze stopping you from SS armor farming? all other mobs can be pulled without getting Doze aggroed.<br />
<br />
2. Use the damn walls to hide from AE. Same you do with other mobs in HoT.<br />
<br />
3. Clear the pit and the roamer first (and fast). If you can manage this fast you have lots of time to fight Doze in his room or in the pit or even near the HoT door (which I would not advice .. too risky getting Zemm to aggro).<br />
<br />
4. Don't forget to re-slow.<br />
<br />
5. Peeps getting under 40% health they go to healer spot (hiding place) and ask for heals. You don't want low-on-life aggro.<br />
<br />
6. Use god rods to your advantage.<br />
<br />
7. Don't forget to re-slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I didn't say he was stopping us, just slowing us down.  That there is usually another guild right at the HoT door doesn't help. ;)<br />
<br />
Yes, we are using walls to hide the casters from the AOE.  When doing so, we are getting aggro from the respawns in the pit.  This is happening evening though we prep for Doze, clear pit and roamer, and basically immediately take Doze (we are all pretty much FM after an average HoT mob).  I'm not sure what the pop time is pit, but even if we get Doze immediately we are getting respawns.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I use a stopwatch to time when slows are going to wear off. :)  We get adds before the first slow even wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>monotikitia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any advice would be appreciated, since this guy is putting a crimp in our Skyshrine armor farming for the past 2 weeks. You mean you get to see Doze alive?  I'm in HoT one or two days a week and I've never even seen Doze.  His lifespan on Tunare is somewhere under a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kraeger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Something doesent sound right, are you sure you have cleared all the mobs around him? Use trackers  /trackdistance (Or something) to check. I think pit repops every 72min= 1 day<br />
My guild has never had any problems with adds when doing this guy, it sounds weird to me that you cant seem to get rid of those.<br />
And how fast do you kill him BTW ?   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, pit pops are 75/76 minutes... are you getting the two wanderers before you pull Doz too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll have to check that with the puller... I have a feeling maybe the halls through the north and south doors from the pit might not be getting pulled first, and that might be where the adds are coming from.<br />
<br />
Another possibility is, almost every time we're there, there's another guild sitting at the HoT door, maybe their pulls are assisting Doze.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To successfully take doz down, timing of the pit mobs is crucial. The 2 statics and 2 (or 3, cant remember) roamers must die and must die quickly, and then immediately get to Doz once they are dead. If you are getting aggro from the pit, then those mobs arent being cleared fast enough. The is a static drake on the right door (north i think) that we clear for good measure. So a total of 5 mobs we clear before we are ready to take him. Now, thats not to say more mobs arent clear by that point because we usually pull mobs while waiting for everyone to assemble. Maybe we have gotten lucky, but in the 5-6 times i have killed him we have never gotten adds.<br />
<br />
Anyways, i agree with the above posters. Something doesnt sound right. Get those pit mobs and 2 roamers timed and kill them fast. Those 4-5 should be dead within 5-10 mins of each other leaving you about an hour to kill doz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hiho,<br />
<br />
it's ok on your server to have a 2nd guild inside HoT and pulling too while you do Doze??? If so, I am not surprised that you get adds.<br />
Ask them to wait outside for the time you need to kill Doze.<br />
<br />
Clear all static spawns and the 2-3 roamer around Doze. If this takes more than 40 minutes you have a problem. Buff up (5 mins) and pull Doze. Then you have like 30 mins to get him down. The real fight normally takes like 12-15 mins for my guild (24 peeps most of the time).<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<br />
Yeah, I gather now talking to a few officers in my guild that they &quot;apologized for not giving us a crack at Doze without adds&quot;... I'm gonna take this to mean they kept pulling while we were trying to do Doze.  One of the other guild's raid leaders unfortunately has a history of being uncooperative.  There are long threads dedicated to flaming him on our server board. :p  This would explain the first problem we had.<br />
<br />
The second time we pulled to HoT door but I'm not sure the roamers were pulled first.<br />
<br />
Thanks for advice all. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here's what my guild used to do, before moving on:<br />
<br />
-Kill the two static wurms, and *3* wandering drakes/wyverns/racnars.<br />
-Put all non-MT melees up on the stairs, behind the wall.<br />
-Put all casters inside the cubby between the stairs.<br />
-Pull Dozekar into a corner (left corner when facing out of cubby seems to work well), the monk FD's or dies, and the MT gets aggro. CH rotation starts.<br />
-After aggro is secure (10-15 seconds), all other melees come down to engage. A Shaman should Malo the second he is engaged, however, due to low aggro and the need to get him slowed FAST. (Quads for 900 or so.)<br />
-Simply hold him in that corner, and you can heal your MT till the world ends. Don't let him get pushed too far away. Keep him slowed, hold him there, don't let people over-aggro, and you'll take him down easily. And yes, an instant-click in your first slot is immensely helpful. Don't leave home without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Doze is nothin, we killed him on our second attempt.  First attempt we had 18 people and got him to 2% with 2 wyvern adds.  We would have taken him out too, but it seemed that slow wore off even though i didn't get any sort of message and it had only been 3 minutes since i had re-cast, /boggle.  <br />
<br />
And no... we didn't have any MB wizzy's if that's what yer thinking.</div></div><hr />
