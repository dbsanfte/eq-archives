<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Awewa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry everyone, but I don;t know whats up.  I can log in to any server but Veeshan.  For some reason when I select Veeshan, it starts to load, then I get a message that I have lost connection to the patch server and need to rerun patch.  I do so, and nothing changes.<br />
<br />
I am very confused, but unable to play.... Sorry =(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">try logging in an alt char to veeshan, if this works /petition and say  awewa seems to be bugged and won't let you log on that char. <br />
<br />
there was a bug a year ago like that<br />
<br />
*edit* I re read your post and you can't get far enough to try that<br />
<br />
1) petition from another server<br />
<br />
2) in eq chat there is often a GM. you could try there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wassabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That sucks That is ASS /petition takes 4 hrs (=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it is Awewa that is bugged, you can also delete the .opt files for that character from your Everquest folder.  You will have to set up your socials and hotkeys again, but that takes about a fourth the time as waiting on a petition.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, if you are crashing when selecting a server and not a character, I doubt this is the problem.  You will most likely have to call tech support for this issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">or save it to another location.</div></div><hr />
