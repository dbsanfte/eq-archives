<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have no sound<br />
somehow.. i think my son has killed it.<br />
I get white noise through the earphones.<br />
but no sounds will play game.. wav or otherwise.<br />
<br />
i have tried an alternate set of earphones.. but am not sure even if they are working... so i am going to try another set of speakers...<br />
<br />
what i need to know is there another place that i can check sound off / on... ive checked mute and ensured volume is up on settings.<br />
<br />
any suggestions...<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blow out your sound driver and reinstall updated one for whatever card you have.  That might help.  If not, make sure your speakers/headphones plugged into correct jack on card ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd check that the speakers are plugged into the audio out port first.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lost track of how many times I've put em in the wrong one.  They need to label those clearer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have no idea idea or clue as to what happened then as the others said, start from scratch. Check the spark plugs before rebuilding the engine. :)<br />
<br />
Check the speakers. Make sure they are plugged in properly. Is the power cord plugged in to the wall. (My kids have done that one many times). Use headphones too if speakers are suspect.<br />
<br />
Double click your speaker icon in the systray next to the clock. This will open the expanded multimedia options with settings for master volume and individual sounds/inputs. Sometimes kids get into this one and change one of the slider bars or hit mute on wav or midi. Ensure that master volume, wav, and midi are turned all the way up and not muted to test.<br />
<br />
A couple of other things to check are multimedia properties and device manager which would happen if there is a problem with the sound card/chipset. A couple of different ways to get to device manager depending on the operating system you are using.<br />
<br />
If Windows 98 you can go to control panel, double click system, then the device manager tab. You should see a line for sound card (or something like that). If you don't then that is your first indication. It means the drivers are not being loaded. If you do see the line then click the plus sign to expand the entries. Check for a red or yellow sign over any line which means it has problems.<br />
<br />
If all looks good there then go back to control panel and double click multimedia. You will see several tabs. The first one is for wave sounds. You should see a device selected. If it is grayed out then there are further problems, perhaps with the drivers.<br />
<br />
If the problem is not the speakers not working, then it starts to get deep. If you try all of the above then I suggest getting help from someone who has worked with sound issues before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From years of tech support I'd have to recommend to check the obvious first.<br />
<br />
Plug your headphones into Abash's system to test them out.<br />
<br />
Make sure you plug them into the right port on your system (I've had the same problem come to find out the speaker was plugged into the mic jack, DOH).<br />
<br />
Double check the volume settings in windows, make sure that the wav, midi, etc are not checked to be muted.  The only muted device that you might want is microphone.<br />
<br />
Try playing wave files from the control panel under sounds.  Just select some action that has a sound associated and it the play button, it's the easiest way to test it.<br />
<br />
If that works and EQ doesn't then it might be the volume in EQ or a driver problem.  Reinstall DX8 and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If it turns out that its not a problem with your speakers and nothing comes out of headphones there are some easy things to try before going really deep into drivers etc. First is to check multimedia properties for anything greyed out, and to check device manager to see if there are any question marks, or look under the Sound Video and Game Controllers heading for any x's or exclamations ( as Bem said already).  The other easy things to try depend on what OS you are running. Before I type a book, test the speakers, if they are not the culprit let us know what os it is.<br />
If it's 98 try this<br />
http://esupport1.us.dell.com/dellkb_tools/document.asp?Documentid=1011154<br />
If it's ME try these.<br />
1.) Click on START&gt;PROGRAMS&gt;ACCESSORIES&gt;SYSTEM TOOLS&gt;SYSTEM RESTORE. Select &quot;Restore my computer to an earlier time then click next.  It will show you a calender with some dates.  A few of these dates will be in bold print. Pick one where the computer was working fine then hit next twice. This will undo any settings changes or changes to OS files that may have caused this problem, it won't erase any new data files, ie word docs, excell stuff like that.  If that doesn't work you can try...<br />
2.) Click on START&gt;RUN type in scanreg /restore (there's a space between scanreg and /restore) then hit ok. It will give you a list of about 4-5 dates, pick one where you remember the sound working.<br />
Win2K and NT are a little bit different to handle.</div></div><hr />
