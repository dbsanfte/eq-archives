<br />
How do people find the time limit? Will this expansion cater to odd groups or is it more like the trials where you have to have an ideal group? (Yes I know that the exe trial can be done with less than ideal groups, but that is not the norm.) <br />
<br />
Beeing in a small guild where we might not have a high DPS group online at any given time I'm very concerned about this part. <br />
<br />
As a reference we tried an adventure with a group of Shaman, Warrior, Cleric and Enchanter. Lets just say that we didn't even come close. <br />
<br />
Is this normal or will we be able to do it with a group like that once we have had some practice. I did read somewhere that adventures scaled to group composition. I never noticed, but I don't have a big enough sample to say for sure.<br />

The adventures go by levels only, not what classes are in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The time limits given for the adventures are very very very limiting.  Instead of being able to enjoy the dungeon it turns them into kill fests where you don't get a breather.<br />
<br />
So even though the dungeons might be fun you won't get the chance to let people go to the bathroom or go afk much at all.<br />
<br />
You also won't be able to 'enjoy the sights' much.  Have to keep plowing through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was afraid it was level only. My limited parsing didn't show any difference betwen a 4 or a 6 man group either. If this is true I doubt I will get much out of this expansion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd have to agree with Chaw on that.  The 90 min time limit are pretty limiting for many adventures.  Hurry hurry, kill kill ... eye of zomm is almost required to pick out the correct path in order to make it in time, so stock up on those stalking probes.<br />
<br />
You do have 30 mins after the adventure timer is up that you can explore the dungeons though... success or failure.<br />
<br />
There are also like named mobs that drop loots and stuff in addition to the regular mobs in the dungeon, so even if you fail the adventure you can still get something out of it.</div></div><hr />

Last time I completed an adventure I got 51 points for normal (might still be tweaked before launch) on a 65 adventure. Ammount is based on levels and difficulty. Never got into a raid so can't help you there. <br />
<br />
I didn't have too much time to spend and most points I ever got on a single character was 200 which was enough to buy some low level gear and agmentations. Heard 500 starts to get some pretty sweet stuff. <br />
<br />
One thing I have seen so far is all existing items that can be upgraded have a single type 1 expansion slot. So far I've only seen slot 1 drop and non that can be bought making per-LDoN gear harder to upgrade. <br />
<br />
The levels themselves are very nice looking but all have a cookie cuter feel and after a few times through each type you'll feel like you've seen it all. The new models are absolutely terrific and definately top notch work from the art team. Wish they could do some of that magic on the poor looking character models. Skelly's are getting an upgrade including PC pets. Bearform next please m'k. <br />
<br />
As far as the time limits I really was unhappy with them. They do make you optimize your group considerably. You always feel rushed and as time starts running out some people tend to hurry and make stupid mistakes. Pullers are almost pointless since you don't have much time to split, you're better off bringing everything and using CC (feel so sorry for monks, they basically obsolete now). One death can sometimes kill your chances if you're not moving fast enough and unless the cleric bound right outside one wipe and you might as well start over. Good new is CR's are easy due to lack of repops. <br />
<br />
Sometimes you'd get lucky and find the rescue target early and be done in twenty minutes or you could take a wrong turn at the start of the dungeon and end up wasting 3/4 of your time going the wrong way. Same problem with the collect item missions, sometimes you could get your items fast and sometimes even with a high kill rate you'd never find enough. My normal group of 5 (sham, cle, mag, enc, monk all 65 except monk which is 62) had trouble completing a lot of the missions due to lack of DPS unless we got lucky with no wrong turns or item drops. <br />
<br />
The assassination missions work a bit differently. The target isn't up when you enter the dungeon. You have to kill so many mobs before he spawns and then you have to find him. Faster you kill the mobs the faster the name spawns and the more time you have to get to him. Even if you don't have a tracker they recently added occasional messages &quot;you hear a commotion off in such and such direction&quot;<br />
<br />
I am really happy with the bane spell line. It will be very nice in exp groups. I'd place the agro a bit below our poison line as I wasn't always pulling agro off the monk (about 50% maybe) with it where I will 99% of the time with blood. With the mage bracer it can hit for over 500, only drawback is a 25 second wait if it is resisted. It will be going into my normal spell line up. <br />
<br />
Exp for the adventures isn't as good as you get grinding out AA in BoT or Tactics, but was enough and the ability to earn points and other rewards is very nice. I would have liked to have seen it about equal to BoT exp though, no reason not to be able to have fun and get exp at the same time. <br />
<br />
The new alchemy recipies I found are a complete joke. Group SoW, Group EB, and Group Lev potions that according to the book have lessened effects. Didn't actually find the components to make these. <br />
<br />
Overall its not all I expected when I first heard about it, but I still had a lot of fun and did preorder it on all of my accounts. It will be great for something to do other then exp grind, can always grab a few friends and know theres something for you to do other then jump around 3 or 4 zones looking for a spot to exp. I would recommend anyone that plays with a regular group and likes to do things other then grind out another AA in BoT to buy this expansion. <br />
<br />
Feel free to post more questions and I'll answer them if I can. <br />
<br />
I can't comment on any of the raid features as I was never invited to help with one of these. Would like some info if anyone else can provide some. Are these doable by a ssra level guild?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The group of people I play with has:<br />
<br />
Warrior, Warrior, Shaman, Shaman, Enchanter, Cleric<br />
<br />
In old style dungeon crawls this was fine.  Now our dps is going to be critical and its not going to be enough.<br />
<br />
Perhaps SOE would like to publish guidelines on how to tell people you've played with for 3yrs that they are no longer wanted in the group.<br />
<br />
The comment on LDoN being like PoJ trials is reasonable, but not exact.  Not all PoJ trials were dps based.  Why is every dungeon crawl in this expansion a race against time?  Why isn't this an option?<br />
<br />
I don't think the time limit is necessary in order to limit the number of instances.  Instances ought to work something like this.<br />
<br />
1.  If you die your corpse stays in the instance for 15mins, after which it goes to the GY outside.  This means you don't need a res-capable class in the party.  You can re-enter the instance after a res.<br />
<br />
2.  After the instance has had no active character, and no corpses, inside it for (say) 5 minutes it closes down.</div></div><hr />

I don't remember mobs hitting for 900....  was this a raid or group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have mixed feelings about that expansion.<br />
<br />
Time-limit<br />
<br />
The absolutely worst thing they came up with is the time limit. The time is running as soon as the first player of a group entered the dungeon.<br />
<br />
IMHO there is no frecken way that a L 65 group with less than 6 people can be successful in this time. I was in a group with 5 time-equipped players on an assassination mission (find named and kill him) and we had only 5 minutes left (of 90 minutes) when we found and killed him. And we killed fast and nonstop. And this was on normal difficulty level. This was no dungeon crawl, this was a dungeon run.<br />
With that time limit there is not much room for afk-for-bathroom/doorbell/spouse, not much room also for someone dieing/rezzing, and no room for a DPS-suboptimal group.<br />
<br />
In hindsight i would not have preordered Ldon because of that time-limit-feature. It prevents good friends to crawl together through a dungeon and it forces you again into those DPS-optimalized cookie-cutter group-compositions.<br />
<br />
Layout<br />
Also the dungeons i crawled so far had a pretty dull layout. All rooms and alleys had like 90 degree-angles; rarely there were rooms with more than 2 exits and everyone of them were at the north west east or south wall. The people responsible for that should take a look at grand layouts of dungeons like CT, DN, Sebilis, Guk, SolB.<br />
<br />
<br />
Models, Architecture<br />
The monster-models i saw  were top notch; great look and great animations! Also the interiors of the dungeons looked very well.<br />
<br />
Loot<br />
L 65 sight: PP was in the range of 1 gp-3 pp per mob. They also drop random cash items, tradeskill things, very rarely augmentations (one per 40 minutes), and also rarely armour pieces (i found some pants which were slightly better than my Tae Ew Chain legs).<br />
The quality of the augmentations was low; so far i only saw things like plus 6 to Str or Resist disease or resist cold.<br />
<br />
<br />
XP<br />
XP was around  3 percent AXP per 4 mobs killed which was okay imho. If you want better XPs then you should head to BoT. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tradeskills<br />
Alchemy, Smithing, Fletching, Baking and Brewing recipes were introduced. I took a look at Smithing and Alchemy.<br />
<br />
There is a book with 3 new potions: Group sow (Pack Spirit), Group Levitation, Group EB.<br />
Every potion requires one drop of an Ldon dungeon (e.g. Pondweed) and several other components.<br />
I made a group sow potion; the cost for the ingreds was at around 60-70 pp. Whoever is responsible at Verant for this part of shamanistic skill-content handling should be fired asap.<br />
<br />
There are also some new smithy recipes. I made several uninteresting Chain pieces; Chest had AC 27, Resist Dis 6; Legs had AC 9.<br />
No idea who would wear that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
As soon as that unnecessary and artificial time limit is removed i would recommend everyone to buy the expansion. But in its current state the casual players should stay away from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait ! All mob mitigate slow (in hard setting ) ??! If it's really the case ,i will cancel my pre order.  Timer+ general mitigation= no thank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My whole regular group tried this out and in the mirugal scenario on difficult we got nailed by 900+ hitters.  The only way we had a shot at completing this scenario was to dump pulling and gang pull 2-4 mobs at a time.  I'd back off a couple, root and rot em while the tank took on 2 at a time.  This is a problem due to the tight spaces and because after a long park, the mob would finally break root and sometimes bash the cleric.  I was in a group with ranger, rogue, SK, sometimes the necro, me (shaman) and a cleric.  DPS is god in this expansion and the time limit.  Sometimes it's better to pull and root, then slow.  Mobs do not seem to summon, few mitigated slow, some had almost no resists, some were streaky.  At one point in the LFay hole in the ground dungeon we pulled like 8 mobs into camp and we all lived, but it was fun and hairy.<br />
<br />
I'll buy the expansion because the rest of my group will, but the time limit sucks huge.  I don't care too much about the loot, but it was mediochre.  I do like the ability to augment exitsing gear to give new life to that item you got attached too.  Our necro ended up with a 13 INT earring of the solstice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well here's my snitch on LDoN then :) since I can now talk freely about it.<br />
<br />
The best group in my xp would be:<br />
Cleric - Heals &amp; Rez (rez is especially important)<br />
Pally - Tank &amp; Rez (just in case)<br />
Shaman - Slow, buffs (I couldnt forget us could I?)<br />
Enchanter - crowd control &amp; charmed pet (adds more dps)<br />
Ranger - Track, snare &amp; dps<br />
(insert 6th person here)<br />
<br />
The spells:<br />
The new curse line of spells (Curse, Odium, Anathema, Bane) seem to be a good addition, being decent level of agro for what they do.<br />
The new shrew line of spells (aka indoor run speed 3 buff) is good pre-runspeed 3, but once everyone in group has rs3 it's obselete.<br />
The new remove curse spells, I didnt get chance to use them since they are basicly lesser versions of the regular &amp; Greater spells.<br />
<br />
Time Limit:<br />
I think it's just about right. I had a decent group of 5 (the druid decided to gate out for no reason given) and moving slowly we managed to assasinate the target with 1 minute to go. We went the wrong way a few times also.<br />
<br />
Layout of Dungeons:<br />
The dungeons are random combinations of rooms &amp; corridors arent they? like Lego bricks. Sure they'll look wierd but it will guarentee the adventure being fun &amp; different each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I didn't much like the time restriction either, couple of time we came under 5 minutes of failing.  Generally though if your group is used to working with each other and is competent you'll make it, but it makes people rush.<br />
<br />
There are some neat looking items that can drop, with particle effects and all.  Didn't even bother trying the potions, since I never found the parts it takes from the dungeons, but they didn't sound very appealing.  Never saw any mitigating mobs, but we avoided the hard setting ones.  Great looking scenery though.<br />
<br />
After doing this one, I sincerely hope they didn't do past expansion beta this way.  There were so many clueless people playing a 65 character that didnt even know what that class did, I got frustrated just listening to them complain.  Piss poor way to do it, would have been easier to just do a /who all class and gotten better results.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm now regretting having preordered  :mad: <br />
Was really looking forward to this expansion as Dungeons can be so much fun.<br />
I want to go on a dungeon crawl not a dungeon race.<br />
I'm not worried too much about loot I would just like to have fun but to me if you've got to race through in order to finish it then thats no fun.<br />
If i wanted to race id organise a newbie Gnome race or something  :D <br />
Is this yet another expansion aimed at people who just want quick exp and loot ?<br />
Perhaps these people who constantly slag Sony do have a point after all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I suggested shamans boycott LDoN for the wrong reasons, I guess.  As far as I can see, shamans should boycott LDoN because:<br />
<br />
1.  Time limit emphasizes DPS, making shamans less useful.<br />
2.  Bane line sounds great, but with a 4 tick recast time makes it virtually useless in a dps fest, especially with fizzles.<br />
3.  Yet more ridiculous, nearly useless, high cost alchemy recipes.  Get a clue SOE.<br />
4.  Oh, and yes, no fix to rabid bear (sorry had to slip that in).<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would reccomend for a true guide on them you go to sony's main pages, but what I recall of it is this:<br />
<br />
  All gear now has at least 1 Augment slot on it.<br />
<br />
  The Augment slots will have specific Types allowed.  Basically the higher the allowed type, the better the augment you can make.<br />
<br />
  Type 1 augments will augment a SINGLE stat or resist, by 5 or 6 points.<br />
<br />
   Higher type augments may have effects, or multiple stats.<br />
<br />
   You can add augmentation to armor by combining armor + augment gem in a special container.<br />
<br />
  You can remove augment by placing armor into the container alone and combining.   Augmentation that is removed is LOST, not returned.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Once augmented, the armor description will state what item is augmenting it, and you can click on the name to get a seperate window detailing the stats from augmentation.<br />
<br />
<br />
  The special container for augmentation is 2 slot, which leads me to think that you will only ever see single augment slots.  However, the discussion of augments made it sound like some armor could handle multiple augmentation, so maybe you just do them one at a time.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If you can multiple augment an item.. I have no idea how you specify which augmentation you wish to remove when you attempt to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Augmentations will drop (rarely) or be purchased from the LDoN merchants with adventure points.</div></div><hr />

It was a regular group, they changed hard mode last week because all of the top players were complaining it was too easy. <br />
<br />
The people I feel sorry for are the casual 65's. I think for a while even normal difficulty is going to prove very hard for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Reposting this under this thread, put it in the wrong place.<br />
<br />
I have been playing with a copy of my live Shaman on beta, and I'll admit that sadly the betabuff has much better equipment than my copy, like about 1k more hp, 100 more ac, and quite a bit more mana. I played with a betabuff 65 shaman till they copied mine over, and I felt weak with my live copy when it first arrived, but once I got over that fact, I was able to do just fine and the difficulty seemed about right.<br />
<br />
I have won about 15 adventures, and lost 4 for various reasons, mostly when one or two members would leave during the adventure, or go ld and not return. I think this will be the biggest problem with LDon, trying to keep 6 people together while getting an adventure, traveling to the entrance, and making it through the thing without someone leaving. <br />
<br />
I have had fun during the beta, and haven't logged in my live guy since I started playing it, if that tells you anything about the fun factor. The 64 bane spell is awesome too, and will be a welcome addition for places like veksar where poison and disease dots are worthless. Resists are pretty low with them also, as I never bother debuffing before slows in these dungeons, and have had very few resists. I just hope it doesn't cost a thousand adventure points to buy them, since my first goal on live will be to aquire the level 64 bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">So far there is nothing in this thread that convinces me that LDoN is worth buying.<br />
<br />
There are some really good ideas.  I like the concept of instancing, and of augmentation.  And I really like the idea of a curse based, fast acting DoT.<br />
<br />
But.....<br />
<br />
1.  The time limit is unacceptable.  I don't want to spend 91 minutes in a dungeon to find out it has been a complete waste of time.  I wouldn't mind going into a dungeon and getting partial points if I didn't make the 90 minute time limit.  A graduated award system based on the time it takes to complete the dungeon would be much more fun.  Something like:<br />
<br />
0-90 mins = 100% points<br />
91-120 mins = 75% points<br />
120-150 mins = 50% points<br />
150+ mins = 25% points<br />
<br />
A system like that would make me want to go back and repeat the quest to see if my group could beat our best time.<br />
<br />
2.  The 24 second recast time on the Bane series of curses is unacceptable.  One of the things I hate the most about casting spells is waiting for the spell to refresh. I could accept a long (3-4 sec) recasting time, but 24 seconds is out of the question.<br />
<br />
If SoE fixes these two particular items, I would be more persuaded to lay down the cash for the expansion.</div></div><hr />

I hate the fact that you have to have either one group or raid groups too.  There are 6 of us running two each and we like having our Main group and our assist group...<br />
<br />
For me to get this expansion they are going to have to get rid of the time limit at the very least, would love it if they opened up the quest to as many as you wanted to bring along (this isnt going to happen :( ) so that we could take our time and run through with both our groups.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if each quest is completely different or if there is a set group of quests you have to get through to proceed in the story line.  Someone said you get to chose one of the 3 quest types and then normal or hard so there are only ever 6 possible choices?  and actually only 3 choices for 99.9% of the people because even PoTime players cant get through some of the quests on Normal level so there is no way in hell a normal group could get through the harder crawls.<br />
<br />
I have to say I really liked the idea of these seperate zones for my guild to run through but this just sucks :/  Ditching some of your best friends because they cant deal enough DPS to help the group out enough is lame.<br />
<br />
Someone said their group didnt have enough DPS and i dont remember the other classes but there was a Mage and 2 monks?... good lord my groups will never have more dps than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">To me the dungeons aren't all about DPS, they're all about mana regen. I tried a level 50/55 group with 2 Rogues, Necro, Mage, Pally and Cleric. We failed miserably because the Necro was consistently twitching the Cleric. Granted, part of that was due to the gear of the Pally but it was a huge issue when we'd get more then 1 on a pull or when we'd get a necro or enchanter mob. When I tried the same dungeon with a Cleric that had KEI and a Beastlord instead of the Necro we walked right through without trouble.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I am not quite sure what the moaning is all about really. I mean, you still get xp in the dungeons, you still get to group with your friends and go looking for loot/coin which still drop. So there is a time limit, and if you fail you get no reward. Well, so what? If the time limits are removed then every single time you set foot in a dungeon you and your friends can kill a mob, sit and chat, change the laundry, go for a smoke, get back to FM and go kill the next one. At the end of your 5 hours you have completed the quest and got your adventure points. Then, you can log for the night and come back again when time permits and do the same thing in a different dungeon.<br />
<br />
After about 3 adventures you will be on here moaning that the game has been dumbed down and it is so easy it sucks and you want your money back, moan, piss, moan.<br />
<br />
How about they offer an alternative for the &quot;we will cry if we don't get the phat lewts from the boss mob because we were too slow&quot; and offered you the opportunity at the beginning of the adventure to take one of three alternatives:<br />
<br />
Hard<br />
Medium<br />
Piss easy - you get no xp off any mobs, and 10 percent of the coin, but you get to stay there all day and get lewt from the mob.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you want to take the challenge away before you have even played it. If that is what you think, then I really don't think purchasing the expansion is something you should do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">When I posted my summary on the Torv board someone started talking about classes so I summarized my views on classes in LDoN:<br />
<br />
The time limits can be 60 or 90 minutes. Every 65 adventure I ever did was 90 minutes. <br />
<br />
As someone stated bards are pretty godly in these dungoens. Had a time guild bard pulling on hard, lining up 900 hitters for take down, and doing it flawlessly. Even their very limited tracking was a huge help some of the times. <br />
<br />
Far as classes go heres my view:<br />
<br />
Winners:<br />
Bards and rouges - DPS, trap finding, lock picking (lots of locked chests) This one was made for you<br />
<br />
Rangers and druids - snare can be vital (one runner can ruin your day), tracking is a huge bonus, DPS<br />
<br />
Wizards - snare + DPS<br />
<br />
Chanters - Big time CC opportunities, fast mana regen is vital<br />
<br />
Pally's - make best LDoN tank IMO especially in normal setting. Ressing is very important if someone goes down unless they bound right outside. The group heals are great when you get 5 or 6 mobs. Absolutely tear things up in Mistmore setting. <br />
<br />
Mages, BL's - Great DPS. BL slow suffecient for normal mode dungeons. <br />
<br />
<br />
No change<br />
<br />
Necro's, Shamans - While both can have really good situational DPS, they lose a lot of their punch with the time limits. New DoT lines are a help. <br />
<br />
Clerics - Ressing definately important, best group heals which can be a big help sometimes. Can be replaced by druid/pally in normal mode. <br />
<br />
Shadow Knights - They just as good as they are now. Snare a plus if you don't have any other class that can do it. Res/fast heals put pally's a step up for the dungeons IMO.<br />
<br />
Top end Warriors - Almost necessary in hard mode, but only the best equiped warriors really gain anything from this expansion (kinda like warriors in EQ in general). <br />
<br />
Losers<br />
<br />
Monks - No real reason to pull, can get more DPS from numerous other classes. <br />
<br />
Average Warriors - No reason to really take one if they not a friend of yours. Provide poor dps and there is nothing in normal mode that a knight with equal gear can't tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">In regards to the time limit issue:<br />
<br />
Someone on the Sony boards says you do actually get your adventure points if you lose to the time limit but continue on. <br />
Just that you get less pts then if you did it on time. Now since I am not in beta, I can't confirm or deny, but that is what most people are asking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">On the topic of time limits -- what I have read from the 65 crowd is:<br />
<br />
PoT equipment -- easy on Normal -- doable on Difficult<br />
<br />
Elemental equipment -- doable on Normal -- Not very on Difficult<br />
<br />
VoT equipemnt -- 50-50 shot on normal -- no chance on difficult<br />
<br />
No raid equipment -- fail most of the time on normal...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
This makes me wonder if they should have an easy choice -- if they wanted to restrict it, you could only choose it if you had over a 50% fail rate for your group... It would give 1/2 the points, be as if your group were 3 levels lower, and be 120 minutes.</div></div><hr />

How many do you see xping in the exe trial? You get to group, there is loot. If you don't make it in time, so what?<br />

I want the challenge to be there. I just don't like the challenge they put in. I think time limits are a bad idea. I would have prefered it if they could have given us a challenge of a different type.<br />
<br />
Now that the time limit is a fact, I just want to see them balance it against the group going in. This is not the case from what I have seen. I parse the mobs to be identical if I go in with 4 or 6. They are the same if I go in with 4 clerics or an ideal group of 4 DPS, healer and CC.<br />
<br />
So where is the expansion we (at least I) assumed was targeted at the casual family guild type player?<br />
<br />
Note that I have had limited experience in the beta. I might be whining over nothing. I guess I will find out one way or another next week.<br />
<br />
If it is indeed true that we get adventure points after 2 hours even if we failed, this might be good enough for me.<br />

<br />
I guess I was saying that if people are writing it off before they try it then they shouldn't buy it. There is nothing wrong with being concerned and holding off until it is tuned correctly. But, if that is the case, and people are going to buy it anyway, why not get in there sooner and see how you fare?<br />
<br />
A lot of comments are aimed at Sony screwing the players over and yet there are many out there who like a challenge. If everyone can win straight away it just becomes another grind. I personally like to beat difficult situations. But when I fail I don't say I hate Sony. I evaluate, figure out what could be done better and try again.<br />
<br />
I see your point that the mobs are the same if there are 4 or 6 players. But, if there are 4 players in a BoT grind group while you look for more you still grind, you just act more carefully. In this expansion you cant add latecomers so maybe folks will not play the new dungeons as often as they would like for lack of people around at the time. That needs some work IMO.<br />
<br />
Your point that the challenge is not fair is well taken. I assume that the countless feedbacks from this widespread beta are being reviewed and the expansion is still being tweaked. I expect there will be several follow on patches as time progresses. The main thing I see is that these dungeons are doable, but can be tight. If no one could complete any of them it would suck, but the challenge of having to put your skills to the test under pressure is a fun thing.<br />
<br />
Again, my post was not truly meant to offend, it was merely to highlight that no one is forced to buy it, and to pose the question that if it had no time limit how many people would be complaining that it sucked for being too easy.<br />

The good thing is that for the first week or so my favorite zones will be empty, except for all those that refuse to buy it of couse. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tolgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">After reading all the threads in here I think everyone is missing the reason a time limit was put into place, at least in my opinion.<br />
<br />
 Last I read SOE servers were only able to handle 44,000 of these 'instance dungeons' at one time. The time limit insures that everyone will eventually get a chance to do one in a timely fashion. If there we no limits then the 44,000 groups could just hold up the SOE servers for who knows how long.<br />
<br />
 If after a time players seem to not be using the LDoN dungeons so heavily or SOE comes up with a way to handle more 'instances' at one time then maybe the time limit will be lifted. Until either of those happen I don't see it going away.</div></div><hr />

Some of my friends that are in the 60-65 range with no raid experenice or loot I see getting completely owned at least at first in these dungeons.

I agree about the challenge. I just personally don't like the challenge to be a time limit. It is also possible that I'm whining about a none issue. I have not played enough in beta to be sure that I will have problems when this goes live although it sure feels like it. I definately agree that this should not be a walk in the park.<br />

<br />
I for one was not offended. I just think that your response was unfair to those that MIGHT (we still don't know for sure) have a problem with completing the adventures. There are dungeons out there that will give the classic dungeon crawl feel. There is no valid reason to go to the LDoN dungeons unless you are in it for the reward (xp or loot). You can do a few of them to see what they are like, but if you know that the challenge will be too much, there is no reason to go back to them. I don't think xp grinding in them is a really good idea. Droga for example would be a much better place if that is what you want to do.<br />
<br />
As I said, all of this might be premature. I just really really hope that the balancing will be such that any group of friends can go in and have a chance at a good, challanging and possibly rewarding crawl. Right now I don't think that is true, but I hope I'm wrong.<br />

Umm......whats to stop you just xping in the new dungeons until you get your 6 member group, and then aborting the mission and starting a new one? Just suggesting the obvious, hope you dont mind ;)<br />

A more general comment, when I tried the beta I was struck by just how easy it was. In my opinion it was far too easy, and needed to be tweaked up. That may have happened in the last week or so, I haven't played on beta since then<br />
<br />
I think the real issue is how competent your group is. The only times we had problems was when we had people in the group playing critical roles (like MT or puller) who clearly didn't have a clue what they were doing (they were probably low level toons on the live servers).</div></div><hr />

The thing that would stop me from ending an adventure and grab two more when I find them is that I do not play in pick up groups. For me it is playing with friends in guild or when they are not around I have other things to do (tradeskills and such). I know that I am limiting myself by doing this, but I do not see why the game should impose the limit.<br />

<br />
Points in favor:<br />
1) Graphics. You have to have your graphics at high resolution to really get it, but these places are stunning. The layout is a bit lackluster (One of the Mistmoore's Crypt zones looks like Paludal meets Torgiran) but the textures, the flow of colors, and the mob models are wonderful<br />
<br />
2) Difficulty. I like the time limit. Really, I do. My groups had plenty of time, and the only time we failed was because the dungeon didn't have all the drops we needed for a &quot;collection&quot; quest, and we kept dying. Mobs have moderate HP, and at the 65ish levels, hit like Teir 2 mobs after a tagar's. Caster mobs seemed to limit themselves to buffing their compatriots.<br />
<br />
3) Exp. I was getting 1% per kill at 65, and the kills were going fast. For a full level 65 group, every mob is level 60, with occasional flukes and nameds going up to 63<br />
<br />
4) Loot. It's definately not Sebilis or Dulak, but 5+ PP splits, occasional gems and vendor food that averaged 11pp each.<br />
<br />
Against:<br />
1) Lag. Mainly this is caused by the piles of corpses outside the entrance of the zones<br />
<br />
2) Newbie problems. NOBODY tested below level 65 with any frequency. I managed to get a group with a 30 cleric (By the way, the lower your level is, the more time you have), and the exp was dismal. Less than 1% per kill, there was no loot that wouldn't be found in Blackburrow, and the mobs are pretty hard for the average mid-level. <br />
<br />
3) Adventure Points: Another awful discrepancy for level here. A level 65 adventure nets you 52 adventure points. A level 20-25 one gives you one. As stated, the low-end versions of these dungeons are comparitively tougher than the high-end. To put it into shaman persepective.. .With Malos, Q, SuperDog, and AA's, you'll have no problems. With Ebreath, Canni 1, and no dog, your butt is going to get spanked<br />
<br />
4) Getting started. You get a &quot;message&quot; from an NPC in your starting town, who tells you to talk to someone in the town. These NPC's are like damned easter eggs, and thankfully most are in taverns - Though in towns full of drunkards such as Kelethen, that can be a real problem. That NPC then sends you to talk to someone at one of the five wayfarer camps, who quizzes you on what the first NPC told you. IMO, this is the drop-dead dumbest part about the expansion.<br />
<br />
I have no idea about loot. I saw a lot of stuff from the &quot;raids (Gotta love al lthe broadcasts for &quot;time-equipped characters to join a raid&quot; that went over the chat window), but normal grinding seemed to reveal nothing of use. The Augmentations we found sucked (at level 65, do you really want to slap +6 Charisma onto your Time's Antithesis?), and the tradeskill components were rare as all hell. Reportedly, the dungeons weren't itemized for beta, though. I can imagine that they would have crap gear loot drop there, though, to allay the fears of what a &quot;rare drop&quot; might mean in an expansion with an infinite number of zones<br />
<br />
And folks, it's NOT like the trials. The trials weren't a pain because of a timer, they were a pain because they had a half-hour restart time to let the executioner's corpse poof. LDoN doesn't have that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe to a guild that was already on top when PoP came out or after you really got the trials down. <br />
<br />
A lot of guilds had a real problem with the trials for a long time. Even 4 months after PoP had come out I was spending at least one night a week doing nothing but buffing trials groups. These are going to be the same people that have a lot of problems with the LDoN timers like a lot of friends I have in a casual guild. <br />

From what I can tell get a chanter or druid in your groub for a charm and you should win the adventure np.   (Necros too, but I can't group with necros)    That's 3 different classes for amazing DPS and doesn't limit group composition too much.</div></div><hr />

Another pain was that you -needed- to complete the trials to move on to teir 2. it was mandatory. There was a lot of competition to nab the trials right after the 30 minutes was up. What I meant to get across was that the LDoN timers aren't a bottleneck. If your goal is to go in, get exp, whatever, you can do that and not worry about the timer. <br />
<br />
Think of it this way. Opening a dungeon for your group starts a quest (&quot;Bring me twenty-five of these&quot;, &quot;Kill this guy&quot;, &quot;rescue an idiot elf&quot;). The quest isn't mandatory. The reward for the quest isn't flags, isn't more exp, isn't kick-ass gear. it's points and a rating. You can spend points for some decent stuff once you get enough, but that's it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">First off, Gandwer that was a masterful summary. I agree with most points.<br />
<br />
I understand the reason for the time limit so I agree with it to that extent. I don't want my ability to access content 'blocked' by a group of sloths (figuratively speaking). While it does kind of set up an immediate assumption that DPS RULEZ, that doesn't have to be the case. Perceptions change and the playerbase has consistently proven that they are far more innovative than the developers so folks will find ways to maximize &quot;non-dps&quot; classes.<br />
<br />
My main concern is the lower level encounters. I've /bug'd and /feedbacked and spoken to devs so much that I don't know what else I can do. The lower level adventures are WAY too hard. Now, that might be because the lower level betabuff toons are horribly equipped (with a few exceptions) or other external factors. But when 6 people who are playing classes they've played to 65 and TWINKED via betabuff (i.e. on our second try, my 55 betabuffed rogue was wielding a Salindrite dagger I swiped off the 65 ranger), cannot pass an adventure after multiple tries, there is something wrong. Refine our tactics? Sure! But what happens when your cleric and enchanter are constantly OOM halfway through your adventure? This problem (as previously mentioned) came up at EVERY level from 20 to 55 (i.e. 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55). And it's very true that every day you log in and find everyone is level 65 so unless a dev specifically asked them to (PERSONALLY), very few people rolled lower level toons.<br />
<br />
The level 65 raids though, are gonna SODOMIZE people outside E-planes, from what I saw. At least at first they will. My advice? If you aren't in an elemental planar guild, DO NOT DO A RAID WITH LESS THAN THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PEOPLE ALLOWED (36). I cannot possibly stress that enough. Just save yourself the CR and do something else. And this is coming from someone who JUST did a raid (Rujarkian Hills Halls of War) three hours or so ago (right before the server came down).<br />
<br />
Augments are gonna be pricey, at least for the good ones. FT1 augment was 510 pts last I saw. Odium (the spell) was 60 points. Some existing items won't be augmentable (fungi tunic, for example).<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, I'm probably not gonna buy LDoN. At least not in the short term. This expansion doesn't have the &quot;hook&quot; that previous ones did. Like, I bought Luclin primarily for the spires, Nexus, and (the promise of) the Bazaar. It allowed me to stop caring about my Velious faction since I'd always have a bind point within 1 zone of Velious. PoP I bought because of the port stones. LoY I bought for the map and LFG tools and dyes. LDoN just doesn't have that kinda allure for me. I'll get it eventually but right now, there's nothing that really makes me feel like I HAVE to have it (unlike Luclin and PoP). Heck, I still need to get LoY for Amorae's account (basically only for Stoicism/Blood of Nadox and to get her a Drogmor since her horse's head is annoying me now :p). I'll get LDoN eventually for the dots and curse spells and such though (not to mention Remove Greater Curse!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Newbie problems. NOBODY tested below level 65 with any frequency. I managed to get a group with a 30 cleric (By the way, the lower your level is, the more time you have), and the exp was dismal. Less than 1% per kill, there was no loot that wouldn't be found in Blackburrow, and the mobs are pretty hard for the average mid-level.<br />
I pretty much exclusively tested lower end stuff and what I found was mobs, excluding casters, were entirely too easy. They had no hit points whatsoever, they were dead extremely fast and didn't hit all that hard. The biggest challenge for my groups were always the Enchanter type mobs because our resists, buffed, were always lacking. <br />
<br />
The hardest part for the lower end groups will be mana regen. When I played with a group that didn't twink down from /beta'd 65s (no BoC on the Bard :p) we often had me or whoever else was playing the Cleric, in mana trouble. But once I got used to how things worked and had some competent people the missions were all winable with time to spare.<br />
<br />
My boyfriend has had the same experience as I did with the lower end stuff so it's interesting that a few thought they were the exact opposite. I'm curious to know what you found, specifically, to be the cause of the difficulty. We did fail missions at lower levels but I still didn't consider them too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Oh, I finally bought the book with the new alchemy recipes in them. The new potions are &quot;mists&quot;, the description says they affect those around the person drinking, small radius. It doesn't specify group only or not, would guess so. One of the potions is SoW. It does say that the &quot;mists&quot; aren't as potent as the normal potions and as my Alchemy skill with the character I was using is like 34, they aren't something I can try. I may use a beta'd one later to test some of them, if the game stops crashing on me ;)</div></div><hr />

That doesn't sound bad to me, roughly 10 adventures? 900minutes of play and I can stick FT1 on my epic...sounds like a bargain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Yes, but the catch is... how long are you planning to keep your epic?<br />
<br />
<br />
  You can't just pluck the arugmentation out of the slot later, you have to be careful which slot you place each augment you get into.   I mean, personally if I managed to find an FT10 augmentation the first day I'd be pretty damn pissed cause I would be afraid to put it on any gear (well, not really cause that'd be enough reason to keep an item and I won't replace my Seru earring for a LONG time... but trying to get across my general feelings)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">How does the adventures get adjusted to groupcomposition?<br />
<br />
Would 2 level 65s be able to start an adventure with 4 level 1s so that the dungeon would be filled with mobs suitable for low level 20s?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I believe the wayfarer won't give you an adventure if your group members are not within 7 levels of each other.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, there is no adjustments made.  Doesn't matter if you have 4 people or 6 people.  Classes don't make a different either, you can have 6 priests or 6 meleers, you get the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">If there we no limits then the 44,000 groups could just hold up the SOE servers for who knows how long.<br />
<br />
44000x4 = 176000 players required to &quot;hold up&quot; the servers in the manner you describe.<br />
<br />
Going with 6 person groups raises that to 264,000, or more than half the total playerbase.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">was lucky to get in on the beta..  realy enjoyed my time there. every thing i didnt like bout the pick up group was gone  was just me and  the 3 ta 5 peeps at my side..  i didnt have ta worrie some guy was gonna come along with  half the zone on  him  trying  despratly to save a measly 4% exp  no matter how many  he  kills long the way   no camp fights,  every mob is this dungeon is mine, no arguments over camps..  if things go wrong and the group is killed ya can just walk back in as the mobs dont respawn and pick up where ya left off..<br />
<br />
that aside alll the time limit goes for is the adventure points. if you dont meet your objective in time  you lose nothing but the points ya would have gotten on a sucess..  there is loot cash  and the such to be had just killing..  if the time limit dosnt work for your group just  go in an and kill at your leasure..  win or lose. some of my best  group memorys  are when  we were up aginst something we were  prty sure to lose and insted win<br />
<br />
bane  i loved the spell  it took over bos spell slot.. resisted rarely and always got full dmg out of it before  the mob died <br />
<br />
never once did i have trouble completeing  an adventure  with a decent crew..  when we hooked the betabuff toon that has never played the class before we were crushed. but that wont be a problem live(save the rare ebay=P) <br />
<br />
that along with there will  never again be a night when you or your guild cant find something to kill..  something to kill is always there waiting for the trigger phrase at your local raid/group recuiter...<br />
<br />
any how  i would say ldon is defenatly worth  trying..   ignor the posts here make your own call</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Just a not to those talking about the trials...there are more than one.  The bottleneck was becuase most people were unwilling to even try anything other than execution.<br />
<br />
And I am still eagerly awaiting my first LDoN adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I like the novel ideas of Ldon, I think normal is generally easy, main reason you can fail on normal is taking a wrong turning. The occupation of a certain time period is cool, and its less mindless than grinding. So the main concern you concentrate on in these adventures is passing the event and not exp. In that sense it is a great upgrade to the game.<br />
<br />
The rewards at the low number of adventure points are lame, but that is expected. I have heard of decent rewards higher up which I like. Whether saving the appropiate number of adventure points is tuned nicely for the reward is yet to be seen.<br />
<br />
I also like that EVERY class is useful in ldon, pallies will love it, necros will love it. (necros can contribute with nice damage to undead and can assist very nicely with crowd control.) A cleric is not too necessary in ldon however its a benefit to have one. <br />
<br />
I don't think Ldon is too costly, so I will buy for sure. My concerns are that it will follow the line of loy, and will/could get boring pretty quick. However atm I have not really had to make these criticisms, but I am still in the novelty period. My other concern is that it will not necessarily appeal to the raiding guilds, however I did not try any on hard or a raid(Euro time so on Beta raid events were mainly American time)<br />
<br />
My advice is if you don't find it too expensive, which I don't think it is, to buy it and experience it for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">About the trials being a pain...<br />
<br />
When my crew finally did pass the trials we had a huge since of accomplishment that we had worked out a strategy to get us through.  We never had a problem killing mob_x, just killign it fast enought, but we got it and were happy.  We are wanting to complete all the trials soon to say we did it :)<br />
<br />
Remember when trials first came out?   Strategy was all AE slowing (go shamaninity!) and then tanks.  Then it went to enchanter stuns and tanks, then pet groups did it, then AE groups.  THere is no one set way to win in LDoN either, except to have fun doing it.  If you dwell on the frigging timer you are missing a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />
