<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhentil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if there were enough people to get a well rounded group together to get some items from Droga...i was looking at some sites that listed all the drops...there are tons there some are nice some look kinda lowbie...but i figure we could always give the stuff to the lower members or to peoples secondaries...let me know if you want to go, its a lvl 25-35 dungeon but alot of stuff HTs which can add up fast =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boogahz Dokupuppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would actually recommend a slightly higher starting level.  I was there as my necro at 38 and it was rough even with two people in my group that was higher level than me.  It is definitely a nice dungeon, but make sure you have an evac or know the way out before you set up shop.  Unless you do some skillful levitating to go in through the exit tunnel, you will have a hard time finding your way once you fall into the main &quot;trail&quot; of Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm going to have to agree with Boog.  I went to Droga a few times in my early 40s, it can be a rough place.  Think a Lower Guk type force when going there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Droga can be tough, but once you learn it's secrets you're set.  Moving through Droga can be difficult.  Everything there will agro you and there are lots of roaming patrols.  The good news is nothing there sees through invis.  What we did was invis until someone dropped, killed the 5 (or 10) gobs that they picked up, rinse, repeat until we got to where we wanted to be.  My advice would be to get a map, and know what you're after and head straight there.  It's a very cool dungeon, but it can be deadly.<br />

There are a lot of nice drops there, but in my experience they can be stingy depending on what you're after.</div></div><hr />
