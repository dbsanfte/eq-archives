<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For a slightly less uber (more attainable) magelo, click my signature.  :D</div></div><hr />

Check mine out for easily attainable hp gear. Not the greatest in the world but it is fairly easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For a slightly less uber (more attainable) magelo, click my signature<br />
<br />
I thought Jinheim had some good suggestions.  Some of his stuff is a good option for most shaman, and its attainable too.<br />
<br />
BTW, don't click mine, its really not going to help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Face:  Crystal Spider Eyes is a good one.<br />
Neck:  Ribbon Choker from the Thelin event in PoN is good.<br />
Head: Slime Covered Rubicite Coif is pretty nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you want good sugguestions check the equipement forum this a common type of question. If you want more specific sugguestions post your profile so people can see what you've got.<br />
<br />
Jaradis mentioned some good options for those slots. <br />
<br />
The viel of the execution is a good mask and if your server is like mine dirt cheap with lots of people doing or trying to do the trial to get flagged.<br />
<br />
For helm i've always liked the circlet of farlkin (sp) even tho i never got one or wore one myself. Nice stats if a little light on the ac and a useful focus effect.<br />
<br />
Just in general if you don't already have an earring of the solstice get one. You can't come close to that nice of a peice for that cost on pretty much anything else.<br />
<br />
and like jaradis said my profile probably isn't gonna give you much in the way of suggestions for easily obtainable gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">where does the stuff drop though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Go to allakhazam.com and do a search.  You can also search by zone if you've heard something good drops there but can't remember the name.<br />
<br />
Earring of essence has some hitpoints on it as well as MR, crystal spider eyes for face is good, I think we can wear collar of undead protection for neck, goranga idol in range slot has HP but is otherwise not very good, shimmering terrorhide cloak(I think that's the name) has 50 hp; spider fur belt has 40 hp, barbed dragonscale boots have 30 hp and 9 sta(27 hp for priests if STA not maxed and you're locked at 255 due to level) for total of 57 HP.  If you have more money, girdle of mithaniel has nice HP on it but is expensive.<br />
<br />
A lot of the stuff to improve yourself once you're of the level to get canni 5, though is really going to be something that drops, not that you buy.  No drop stuff, I mean.  Good luck on it; that's what we're all working toward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've found the the Artificers gear to have better HP then my kael gear. It's some of that smithed diety armor for Barbarians.</div></div><hr />

<br />
slightly uber gear, nothing super outstanding tho. the di'zok rings can be soloed (altho soloing goblin faction is slow yet painful; get an ae group together). the iksar cultural is same stats as barbarian cultural. shawl of perception is NToV, and hammer of the ironfrost is from xerkizh the creator. ruby pendant was from storms, look it up on allakhazam cos explaining the event would derail the thread :p</div></div><hr />

With Focus (of Souls)/Aego/Boar I pass 4000 hp. I can safely Cann V self-buffed if I'm at or close to full life - I just have to be a little more cautious.  <br />
<br />
Notes - Mostly my rambling - ignore if you like. :) :<br />
* There are some good suggestions already given in this thread.<br />
* If you have deep pockets (at least on my server), a Wicked Bone Atlatl (for range) would be nice.  I use a Talisman of Benevolence, which is pretty easy to get if you are on dragon faction, but it's no-drop.<br />
* Tracking Wolf collars aren't bad if you aren't doing the Qeynos Badge(10 AC, 40 hp, 5 wis), and they drop in the 8th shawl quest (which is also worth doing if you've done the others, though I am reluctant to do it from scratch). I'm not sure what a good price is for one, though.<br />
* For a helm, the Slime Covered Rubicite Coif's HP are awesome (65 hp!), but it's a little soft on AC IMHO, and it's ugly as sin to boot (red chain graphic on a barbarian - ugh!). Oh well, as someone on this forum once said, with that many hp, it could be a pink paper bag with &quot;LOSER&quot; written on it, but I wear it anyway. :) (My apologies to whomever said this first; I've forgotten! :) ) The Tae Ew Spiritcaller's coif isn't too shabby either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Taarne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I cry everytime I see a level 60 shaman with less than 2k unbuffed hps. It's not overly hard to achieve, you don't need to be in an uber guild or anything. Of course, if you want max wis, then you may not have broken 2k, or if you are extremely poor with no guild. :(<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=538738<br />
<br />
There is my profile.. I just hit 2300 hps unbuffed as I hit lvl 61.. The only nodrop piece is my BP from PoG, the rest is all buyable (and 75% of it is bought, too) <br />
<br />
I think 2300 is quite good, considering it's unbuffed, and it wasn't too hard to get, either. The downside is that I have a pretty small mana pool with just 175, but that's life. Hp &gt; wis in my opinion, those hps keep you alive and canning ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I keep seeing coldain skin gloves on shaman magelos - shissar scaled gaunts were updated to be shaman-equippable.  Superior gloves in every way, if I remember right...  extra 10 or 15 hps at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Feel free to click my sig, only one NToV (or higher) item.<br />
I also use some Barbed Rubicite Leggings; they add some more HPs, shattered my mana pool, but thurga legs just looked so ugly :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">cause the coldain skin have 9 sta.. and even if they is 2hp per STA point, that 18 more hp's, with when added to the hps' already on it, equal more then the shissar.<br />
<br />
I just bought the coldain, and switched back and forth while I still had both, and the coldain are more hp's (least for me)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I get 3hp per sta at lvl 60 as shaman.  I remember tanks saying they got 5 or 6 hp per sta at lvl 60.  If you are on real tight bugdet leaf scale gloves sell on xegony for 50 pp hehe, lots of bang for the buck there.  Almost as good as coldain or shissar.  Also for the bargain minded the spider fur belt at 10 ac and 40hp for anywhere from 200 to 400 pp is hard to beat.</div></div><hr />
