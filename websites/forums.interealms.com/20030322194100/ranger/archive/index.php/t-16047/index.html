<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ginzu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where did you see the absolute best AAXP pre PoP (100% AAXP on).  I am interested in AAXP at any lvl 51-59.<br />
<br />
Also best AAXP in groups as well (In case those happen to come up)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best for me was Velks, where I'd get a point in 4-5 hours soloing spiders.  Grouping in CT was almost equal to that, around 5 hours for a point there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanthie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Velks, Seb, and CT were good AA exp<br />
<br />
The old Sleepers tomb was good exp in a level 60 group (two group hunt though)  Sadly with the new revamp, ST is a 18 person minimu with my guildmates<br />
<br />
UP offers good AA exp, if you have the DPS <br />
<br />
Soloing spiders was my choice.  With good velious level equipment, KEI running, I could pull down 1 AA per 4 hours or so.  More if I was duoing with a chanter (consistant haste and mezzing of adds increased my ability to kill faster)</div></div><hr />
