<p>Assuming this is right... you came to the Ranger Glade and posted spoiler info on class armors for every class EXCEPT Rangers?<br />

<p>Yea, well, they seem pretty self explanitory.  You have some gem+a few other items that you turn in to get the armor.  The question becomes, how hard are the items to get?  Does each item have its own long sub-quest, or is it like sky, where you go around and kill stuff in zones and hope you get the drops you want?  Oh, well, guess we gonna find out within a week or two once SoL gets explored a bit.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Is the horse summoning instacast?  Or does it have a cast time?  How long is the cast time?  Curious how this is going to effect PvP.  It sounded like the horses are coded as a buff, and thus you could dispell someone and remove their horse, but if you can resummon the horse instantly, then the Speed of Cheetah horse makes them a PvP god practically.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Hehe, ok... one second here.  A chanter in my guild caught this...<br />
<br />
"Wizard <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am a wizard' <br />
Trizpo Tobbnokcog says 'Cool then you'll probably be wanting the mask, cloak, gloves, choker, belt and staff I have."<br />
<br />
Since when do NPCs use the word "cool"?  Makes this highly suspect.  The armor quests part at least.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Uhh, way to go.</b></p>

<p>Sunmoon took down the info entirely because the ranger armor wasn't listed?<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's a ranger board.  But guess what?  People that don't play rangers read it too.  People that don't play Rogues read the Safehouse.<br />
<br />
Next time some ranger gripes because the rest of us aren't up to speed on some problem with their class, I'll point to this example of how non-rangers pretty much got told to look for info elsewhere, and Laaaaaugh.</p>

additionally, there will be ranger armors, and those can be added in to a complete table at a later time.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Well I post rangerly info on my guilds site for our referance and i had posted that info that is now removed. <br />
For fear that this would be considered a advertisement from Echelon it is not But I make sure that alot of important rangerly info is posted  at <a href="http://www.everquestguild.com" target="_blank">www.everquestguild.com</a> on our forums. feel free to browse<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe I asked for this information to not be posted. I dont' care where else it is posted, but I don't want my boards associated with something that could face possible legal action. - Sunmoon<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Actually.. to you morons that try to come on by board lambasting me.<br />
<br />
I had two choices with this thread.<br />
<br />
One, turn over the IP to Verant for possible legal action regarding their NDA. (I was contacted this morning regarding the issue.)<br />
<br />
Two, remove the content and preserve the privacy my users have here.<br />
<br />
I tried doing two and explaining in a more rational way, but I see a few of you *******s have decided to come here and voice your displeasure.<br />
<br />
Now, do I need to bring out the ban stick on your mindless trolls, or should I do a little creative IP checking myself?<br />
<br />

<br />
And thats impressive. Verant brought the Real Life Nerf Stick to bear, and told you to take down the NDA violating stuff?<br />
<br />
Seems odd.... Luclin is pretty much released now. In fact the Safehouse was discussing this, saying that NDAs dont apply to information that could be obtained from other means, I.E. parsing speff.dat or what not. <br />

<p>I guess I'm party to blame. I gave the site address out to a BUNCH of people including some open IRC last night when the post was brand new, in about 15 minutes it had almost a 1000 or so views.<br />
<br />
I read it, it was "spoiler" info but the only thing in it that wasn't already known or couldn't have been learned in the first 5 minutes of SoL was the name of the NPC's who gave out the quest for the armor.<br />
<br />
Oh well we'll all know in time. Kinda junky VI decided to do that since it was posted after the servers came down and everyone was going gagga for info. A little leak would be nice. I guess it has to be VI sanctioned as Muse has maps out already of some zones and they hold a lot more spoiler info than the one posted here.<br />
<br />
Later.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>You first post it has nothing to do with rangers, then you claim it's legal crap. Stop being a child and repost... Because it's not ranger spoiler info, doesn't mean you can't have it here. The Safehouse has spoiler information all over the place, and they actually got  "special thanks" from VI.  Just repost, maybe you can live this down.<br />
