<br />
The first one is amazing because of the lighting/coloring.  The way the yellow light from the spell is done is quite impressive.<br />
<br />
However, i think she looks abit to manish :)<br />
<br />
<br />
The second one is just a great sketch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He'll ink and color the sketch, eventually.<br />
<br />
Click the link in my sig to check out Saraquael's website.  There's a link on the left for EQ related for all the cool EQ sigs he's done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Very nice.  I've saw his page before, hes very talented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The boy has talent. He needs to stop doing Female Barbarians tho - he's got that box checked.<br />
<br />
Oh too mannish?<br />
<br />
High cheekbones, and those two large, well rounded....erm 'floatation devices' coming from her chest? Looks pretty female Barb to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've yet to see a lizard from him, or an ogre or troll . . . <br />
I wanna see one tho. <br />
<br />
Also more male barbs . . tho i think the dood has a serious b(_._)(_._)b fetish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno...The squarish form of the face makes her seem abit to masculine.<br />
<br />
Look at glori's pic, the face is nicely curved, but this one seems kinda too manish. <br />
-<br />
<br />
And i knew that the other one was gonna be colored, i was just saying it was a fantastic sketch :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The boy has talent. He needs to stop doing Female Barbarians tho - he's got that box checked.<br />
<br />
Heh, he does signatures on request, so he does what people ask him to do.<br />
<br />
He has done some other stuff, but it wasn't shaman related so I didn't post the pics. If you click his EQ related link, you can see some of the other EQ sigs (lots of casters).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">still waiting for mine ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gloriana, you need to talk him into trying his first troll sig :) <br />
<br />
I contacted him but didn't put in a formal request for a sig as it seems he is pretty busy, but he said that if he gets some free time he will contact me back about it hehe. I would love to see some troll work from him. Thanks for posting link to his site too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Those look great!<br />
My question is about those fingers, the index fingers on both models are about 3 times bigger than the other fingers!  Is that a stylistic thing of his?</div></div><hr />
