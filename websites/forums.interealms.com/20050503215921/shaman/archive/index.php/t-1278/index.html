<br />
On Wednesday, May 8th, at 2AM PDT, (9AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. Due to the nature of these updates, we do anticipate additional downtime to occur. Most likely, the servers will be coming back down briefly after they are brought live for all players. <br />
<br />
Therefore, the initial downtime we anticipate is 8 hours. Once the servers are up, the next 4-6 hours could see several smaller patches applied which would require the downing of all world servers.<br />

I /applaud the effort, but it's something they should have been doing all along.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what this means is that there will be more downtime than sol release</div></div><hr />

<br />
/sigh. I bet most of you guys crying about patches are playing mainly in USA timezones. You should try it from other peoples point of view. Come home from work, get stuff done round the house, have dinner, log on. &quot;World coming down in 5 minutes, find a safe place to camp&quot;. <br />
<br />
Same time, all the time. Stop your crying ya pussies, at least by the time YOU get home from work you can play and have a good time with a lot less chance of emergency patches. I'm dreading PoP release, just like I dreaded Sol and SoV, every night being unable to catch up with online friends or kill stuff due to nightly 4hr patches and it not affecting us anyway cause verant delivers our copies of the expansion 3 weeks late. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cortez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So, let me get this straight - if I live in the US and whine about the emergency patches I'm a ***** but if I live in another part of the world it's okay... Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just think about how bad us non-US have it. If there's a scheduled patch it means we don't play that day. Going down for 8 hours at 3am for you means it's down between 3pm and 11pm for us.<br />
<br />
Meh, it's not the patches that bother me. More the thought of getting up at 5am for raids. :(<br />
<br />
+8GMT is .w.a.y. powah!<br />

After the 8 hour patch they are not really sure what it is they have patched so they have to say that there might something so drastically wrong that they have to bring the servers down again. Im not impressed.</div></div><hr />

1) I'm amazed Zorlac missed that.<br />

2) Amen.<br />

So what you're saying is your ready to go to work for VI? (Might be overqualified:)=)</div></div><hr />
