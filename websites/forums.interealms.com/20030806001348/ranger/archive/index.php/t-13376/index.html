<br />
They really mess up an xp group when you have them get all their buddies and come beat on you. A group of 50's I was with was getting 1%/every other kill I'd like to get some tactics on how to effectively experience in this zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
My ideas are this pull iksar kill, kill all rats, then root the sentries at the door so they don't run.<br />
<br />
For those of you who don't know when you attack a sentry instead of fighting back they run around the hallways &quot;getting help&quot; then poof back on top of you eventually all their friends come and &quot;help&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beolorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the swift response we tried this and it was quite fun to deal with the adds :D.  However when I suggested doing it the next time our enchanter paled and curled up in a ball crying I heard  something about rats and targeting??? I beat him with my shovel for a while but he didn't respond like enchanters normally do!<br />
Any suggestions on how to deal with a hesitant chanter other than shovel bonking?</div></div><hr />

 The only thing I can think of is tell the chanter &quot;your going to die anyways&quot; &quot;so lets die doing somthing cool.&quot; once he hears that then i'm sure he'll be in...if not then..hmmmm... tell him youll do your best to keep him alive...as its &quot;our&quot; job.</div></div><hr />
