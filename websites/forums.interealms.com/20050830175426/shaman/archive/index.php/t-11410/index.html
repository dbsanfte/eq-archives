<br />
I bought new expansion and it shows up as &quot;all expansions enabled&quot; on the server selection screen.  And yes, I did make a froggie.<br />
<br />
But last night when I went to Stonebrunt and attempted to click on the boat doors to zone into new zones, nothing happened.  I tried about 15 minutes and kept watching others zone in.<br />
<br />
This happening to anyone else?<br />
<br />
I /bug reported it but otherwise have no idea how to fix.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Huh?  I'm sorta tech challenged....doesn't the patcher patch everthing it needs to each time I log on?  Or are you suggesting that there is some option I could toggle on/off?<br />
<br />
If I need to repatch all of LoY that could take a while......<br />
<br />
My froggie and all other new features seem to be working fine, just cannot get to new zone.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmmm delete that zone only from hard drive and then log on and have server automatically repatch it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">go into options in the patcher and make sure u have LoY selected for downloading my friend had the same plm, was missing the LoY zones and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Twidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make sure your registered or ya cant access the new zones )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Friend had the same thing happen.  He had to set the patcher to check everything again, apparently it missed some files.  Took him about 20 minutes to get it back up and running so he could zone in.<br />
<br />
You'd think they would give you a message or something that says &quot;your files are corrupt or missing&quot;, etc, not just let you click on that door so nothing happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wasn't stoneburnt an optional patch?  I've found that sometimes my settings under &quot;advanced&quot; on the patch screen will unclick themselves.  Make sure they are all still clicked.<br />
<br />
Also - All three of my pc's had to repatch several files when I did a &quot;complete file check&quot; (or whatever its called).  I only noticed it because of another problem oneof the computer was having.  If I recall correctly stoneburnt was one of the ones that repatched.  I think Gunthak repatched also (on ALL 3 computers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, turns out I had to reselect download options on the patcher.  <br />
<br />
I had downloaded Stonebrunt and all optional zones, and was initially downloading the LoY zones, but must have been &quot;deselected&quot; when they changed patcher graphics.<br />
<br />
Anyhoots, I'm in! Woot!</div></div><hr />
