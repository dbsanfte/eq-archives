<br />
What do you do in your down time? You know, lil quests you can solo or whatever.<br />
<br />
Not interested in tradeskills ATM. A lil burnt on that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I surf the web.  /shrug.  That, or log in an alt and get some AA's done on them.  Or, just sit and chat.</div></div><hr />

Jinheim, I used to do Rubik's Cubes in under a minute for free burgers at MacDonald's back in '81 when I was in college. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol I like playing with Rubik's cube but not dedicated enough to learn a method for doing it in under a couple minutes. Most people I know are impressed enough that I can solve it at all lol. I have been working on epic bits and peices when I got the time while waiting in LFG land. I also spend a lot of time reading various forums and whatnot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Constructive:<br />
<br />
1) Go to a zone you've never been to before and explore. If you've never tried it, try to solo and old-world or Kunark boss mob. Run invised through Kael Drakkel all the way to Cobalt Scar and beyond.<br />
<br />
2) Go back to your starting city and buff newbies free. Answer their questions. Help them out. Give something back.<br />
<br />
3) Go to PoK and buff people for donations. Boring but can be good for the bank balance.<br />
<br />
4) Farm greenies for tradeskill items to sell in the bazaar. Spider silks, anyone?<br />
<br />
5) Related to 3), PL a friend, guildie or a newbie.<br />
<br />
Not so constructive:<br />
<br />
1) Create a wood elf illusion potion and some prismic dye. Drink the potion and dye your armour green. Turn on /role and pretend to be a ranger. It shouldn't be too hard, just die often. :-P<br />
<br />
2) Have competitions with friends to see who can train the most gnolls to the snake pit in BlackBurrow. Then see how many you can take down using melee weapons only in a given time limit. No buffs for this one!<br />
<br />
3) Get your character drunk and try to pull off a daring feat, e.g. running down the aviak ramps in KFC. Best done in a group of friends.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the devious minds here can think up plenty more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssseven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1 i like to go to bb and killthe guards<br />

<br />
3, put in a cd and turn the sound up all the way or just normal  ( but i like to wake up the people living next to me be cause they do it to me all the time lol)<br />
<br />
3, practic shooting my air soft gun in the house with out moving from my spot<br />

<br />
Though, some good real life ideas anyway.<br />
<br />
I dunno, i logged in last night, put up LFG and just sat there. I couldnt think of 1 interesting thing in game to do. So i am sure im just missing out on some neat lil things that i have forgot about or not discovered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">lol.. i feel for you lit.. i used to do the exact same thing, and then i quit :P</div></div><hr />

Ditto.  3 really bad back to back to back pick up LDoNs helped seal the deal, wasn't even excited anymore about my &quot;screw up my velious dragon faction solo and use the look to help twink out my ranger&quot; quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Look for an high lvl mage and get some summoned weapons that proc.<br />
Then head for freeport/newbie area or Oasis and use your lvl 29 charm on a wolf/crocodile. Hand a weapon and superbuff it. Now you can zone out and zone back in and watch newbie01 been killed really fast.<br />
Those lvl 1-4 mobs procs like crazy for some reason.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You could cast levi on yourself, then cast bearform, click off bearform, cast bearform, clickoff bearform, repeat, and see how high you can go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I run to the new zones in GoD expansion and see how far in I can get before I run into a invis seeing mob..Or I sneak into Plane of Torment and snoop around and explore...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">lol Finn that is a fun trick. I couldn't get too high up in PoK but it was enough to get me to some fun spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you want stuff to do in EQ, get a guild.<br />
<br />
Putting aside all the pro's and cons etc etc; if you can find a guild that fits your playstyle, you will always be busy and happy ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've had the exact same experience lately Litgruv.  Several things I've done to alleviate boredom in game:<br />
<br />
1) soloed Halls of Testing in ToV (won too, whee!)<br />
<br />
2) Tried to do the hardest parts of Cazic Thule zone solo.  Then when I failed at breaking the silver temple solo, I brought a lowbie friend along for kicks.  Might as well have company in death haha!<br />
<br />
3) Grabbed a bunch of lvl 55's and since they were all &quot;flagged for PoValor&quot; I decided they must be good enough for that zone.  I was the healer, and we went to the back cave camp and attempted the Sleepwalker without mez and without another healer.  Failed twice, but the fights were spectacular!  Second time the fight lasted over 10 minutes until wipe!  (Note: lvl 55's do NO dps in that zone).<br />
<br />
4) Annoy my guild with pleadings for GoD groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Theres hardly any true noobs left, it use to be fun to buff them all out and hear wooow. <br />
My favorite thing to do was go in any zones you've never been in before(been alot for me). Go in old dungeons you use to have a hard time in and unleash doggy on them(only thing he's good for? j/k). I enjoyed pl different chars to see what there playstyle was like.(2-boxed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I work on the BiC quest.<br />
Same here, and in farming for Talwin journal pages-I found that soloing mobs near zi from Qinimi is pretty easy. I do that(still need those %$#@ journal pages)when I don't feel like a real challenge but I want to keep busy. They aren't very resistant,  they are easily rootable/VP'able, don't summon, don't have many hp's but, depending on gear level, if you get caught face to face with one...it might chafe.</div></div><hr />
