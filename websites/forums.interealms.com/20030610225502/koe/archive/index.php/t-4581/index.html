<br />
Well well well, another defeat for a sub par team.  Revenge is so very very sweet, especially this late in the season.<br />
<br />
As far as turnovers go, we kept them under control.  I've been a stickler to get rid of Hakim aka &quot;dropsies&quot; all season, but Kurt sure stepped up tonight.  As did Faulk, who didn't play in our last meeting.<br />
<br />
The Saints flat out hurt themselves -- they had 16 penalties for 132 yards.  And that failed onside kick along with the fake field goal was the funniest thing I've seen!  OMG, you should know if you're not the Rams you can't do that LOL.<br />
<br />

<br />
&lt;b&gt;&lt;U&gt;And I want to stress this next section...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/U&gt;<br />
<br />
Not to mention your &lt;b&gt;Below-par fans&lt;/b&gt; after the call didn't go your way.  You just earned a spot on the disgrace city list New Orleans, right there with Cleveland.  No class fans.  You wouldn't see that happen at any Rams home games.  <br />
<br />
I'm glad we don't have to deal with you anymore in our division after what could have been a respectable departure of our two teams, as you head to the NFC South.  This only ends it on a sour note, thanks to drunken, sore-loser fans.  Wish your fans could have made a more respectable showing than they did tonight.  Good luck with Tampa Bay next year, you'll need it.<br />
<br />
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;B&gt;RAMS 34&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/b&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, that bit was real wack...after all, it's not soccer. ;)<br />
<br />
Your rams have gone as far as they will, though. I predict they will lose 2 of their remaining 3 games, while the 49ers will win 2 of 3, tying the division.<br />
<br />
Who will go to the bowl? Flip a few coins...I'm betting that the 49ers don't have what it takes (though they're doing amazingly well this year), and its time for the rams to fizzle out...so probably Chicago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nah, the Rams are going to the big game again this year, Traz.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question is, who else is going to show up?<br />
<br />
<br />
That thing with the fans was a clear illustration of how you determine mob mass intelligence.  Take the lowest IQ in attendance, and divide it by the number of people in the crowd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you know, there comes a time when certain people (read: Traz) need to just admit that the Rams are the best team in the NFL today.  The all-star crew that they have assembled have set more records than that meat-head-tank, Waran, can count.<br />
<br />
Rams about to fizzle out?  <br />
PSHAW!!  WHATEVER!!<br />
<br />
our boys are getting themselves another ringi this year and I pity the team that stands in front of them waiting to get bowled over, 9ers included.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My prediction stands. If I am wrong, so be it. Time will tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ROFLMAO!  Man I needed a good laugh, thanks bud. :D<br />
<br />
Still the disbeliever eh Traz?  Keep dreaming, your Whiners aren't going anywhere but &lt;B&gt;BELOW&lt;/B&gt; the Rams in the standings.  Come on, when are you going to admit that your team isn't the best?  :D  <br />
<br />
Look who we play next:<br />
<br />
<br />
Carolina - You have to be dumb or brain damaged to think we won't win this one.<br />
<br />
Atlanta - We've proven time and time again, we own Atlanta.<br />
<br />
Indianapolis - Good team, but no challenge to the Rams.  Our defense can shut down the Colts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sooo looks like we take 3 of 3 and &lt;B&gt;WIN&lt;/B&gt; the NFC West.  That's my prediction, your &quot;prediction&quot; of us losing 2 out of 3 is laughable at best.<br />
<br />
Now look who you play next:<br />
<br />
<br />
Philly - You can bet Philly will be fired up when they play you Saturday.  They'll be playing for the NFC East crown that the last time they won was 1988.  They'll have their game face on, will your Fourty Whiners? :D<br />
<br />
Dallas - We'll give you this one :)  If you don't win....*shudder*<br />
<br />
New Orleans - You can bet the Saints are going to be wanting to move up in the West after their beat down on MNF.  You *might* win this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if you somehow manage to tie us in the West, we win automatically by default, because we've beaten you twice this season.  We have the tiebreaker if necessary :D<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note, where are the Saints fans on the board here?  Still down in the dumps from last night, or just can't dis the Rams now that we took you down on National TV?  Little of both perhaps? :D<br />

<br />
/grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">But Waran, what you don't know is that in the last week the 49ers completed epics for both the offensive and defensive lines, not to mention getting Jeff Garcia his clicker.<br />
<br />
Either way, the 49ers and Rams have both made the playoffs. Best of luck to you. =)</div></div><hr />
