<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Throughout the history of EverQuest there have been quests that were epic on proportion. In the olden days they were our particle weapons, specifically the shaman Spear of Fate. In Planes of Power it was less creative, but the charm that recieved statistical upgrades as you progressed through the planes. This wasn't implemented until the Legends of Ykesha expansion though, if I remember correctly. In LDoN it was an epic augment for a charm. The creativity is somewhat lacking here. And now in today's EverQuest, the GoD expansion, there is an epic quest for an augment for any slot, that is quite nice.<br />
<br />
There is an excellent guide available for this quest &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.frmug.org/~archer/Breakdown.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/A&gt; but I wanted to take it a step further and analyze the quest from the perspective of a shaman.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
&lt;H3&gt;Qinimi&lt;/H3&gt;<br />
<br />
First you need to collect three items to make the Stone of Entry. The Stonedust Particles in Riwwi colloseum area is self explanitory. Just head to Riwwi, invis to the arena, and you can pull the mobs there single. There are 2 doors in guarded by 2 golems each, and if you are keeping the golems dead there are two wanderers per spawn cycle. Any of these mobs can drop them. Also if you are lucky you might also get Reyna's Bloody Earing for the Riwwi portion of this quest. Mobs in the arena don't hit hard so you can tank them or root rot them, but note magic based root tends to last the duration while Virulent Paralysis does not.<br />
<br />
A Glob of Mud from the sewers. Later on in the quest you will need a mechanical type drop from each sewers expedition. The drops are only off of the named, so you will be spending some time in them for those parts. Along the way you will get many globs. I have even seen one mob drop 2 of them before. They are far from uncommon. Sewers can be sloed either by root rotting or tanking and using heal over times and patches. It all dpeends on your style.<br />
<br />
Lastly you need a piece of chalk from any mob in Riwwi. If you look farther down there is a part in Riwwi where you need to collect 10 keys. One of the keys drops randomly off of nocs and kyvs in Qinimi. What I did was killed two birds with one stone. Invis over to the Riwwi zone line. It is nothing but nocs over there who have a chance to drop the ley and the piece of chalk. These can be rooted if I remember correctly, but any mob in Qinimi is basically trivial.<br />
<br />
Once you complete your stone of entry you will need to gather a group of friends. You will need a tank, a cleric, yourself, and I find that 3 high dps classes will work well. You can bring an enchanter or bard if the crowd control makes you feel secure. The event is described in the walkthrough. My tip for this is that as soon as the named snake lady dies, slow the executioner and run up to it. If you don't agro him soon enough he will slay the gnome, and you will have to do this again. When you win the event you hand in the Stone of Entry to the gnome and he hands you the Writ of the Magi. There is no limit to how many people can turn in the stone, so you can do it for all 6 people in one go if they are all up to that point in the quest.<br />
<br />
The final portion of Qinimi is an 18 man raid. you will want that many as there is a timer and dps is key. You may or may not have trouble with this depending on how helpful your guild is. Throughout this event there was me and another shaman, and both of us had Turgur's and Nihil up because the mobs came in waves of 6 and overlapped each other. As soon as the named archer dies, some AE stun goes off, so you will want EVERYONE against the wall, or they will be within melee range of the remaining mobs, and will more than likely die. This trial loots 3 quest pieces, so try to have 3 people that need it there, as people aren't too fond of these events.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&lt;H3&gt;Barindu&lt;/H3&gt;<br />
<br />
Part one is collecting two journal pages. Any mob in Barindu can drop these. Barindu mobs are pretty tough. Some of them flurry and rampage so if you are going to tank them you should be geared somewhat like me. You can also root rot the vast majority of the mobs, although i recall the nocs are not rootable, and they rampage. A failsafe is that you can get a sewer expedition before any questionable pulls, and just zone in to it if you are not faring so well. Once you get these hail the appropriate npcs.<br />
<br />
More collecting! You are going to need 2 drops from natimbi. The zone is so unbelievably trivial to a 65 its crazy. the tide feasters are in the river in its north most part that flows east and west. It may take a few to get the drop.<br />
<br />
Any hynid in natimbi can drop this item. There are some on the main island, and some between the KT zone and Qinimi zone. Kill these until you get the drop. When I was doing this I got a flowing thought necklace off of a hynid and was able to sell it for 80k.<br />
<br />
The last two drops are from the sewers, and evaded me for a bit. i forget what themes have the mobs, but the sludge lurkers drop the slime, and the larva mobs drop the larva item. Sewers mobs are sometimes rootable, but be prepared to tank them and be warned that they can hit you for 1000.<br />
<br />
Once you have these four items you can make the fruit. After you have the fruit you talk to a few more npcs and recieve a serving tray. Now for the fun part!<br />
<br />
Ikaav Ixvet Pox. Make sure she's up before you get people together. We only needed a little more than two groups for this, but we clear time in 5 hours and have beaten ikkinz 4. If your guild is only elemental, or you havent quite made it to elementals yet I would suggest stopping by Barindu to slay this as part of the nightly raid schedule. The loot is pretty good and you can get 3 people the quest item at once.<br />
<br />
We met up at the Tipt/Vxed zoneline. We cleared our way to the building Chiaka is in and proceeded to pull the golems out of Ikaav's building. I handed in the tray and fruit and that npc went in and &quot;died&quot;. I was told that if you kill the 2 Aneuk Controllers at the same time that the golem will not go live. We however did not use this method. The aneuks and ikaav are rooted, so stay away, but if the golem goes live, he is not rooted. Everything is slowable except the ikaav, who doesn't hit too hard. We killed one controller, the golem went live, we offtanked the golme and killed th eother controller, then we slayed the golem. Then everyone burned the ikaac down. The quest pieces are on the remains behind the ikaav. You will have to melee attack it to get it open.<br />
<br />

<br />
At this point you should be well on your way to recieving your first augment. I must go exp right now, but I will edit this post when I have time. Next post I should be adding Riwwi and Ferubi which takes you all the way through the first augment. If you have any questions please ask. I will answer them as fast as I can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Color me obtuse, but after reading the full (Emphasis on &quot;FULL&quot;) writeup, it seems that the * final * reward is a very nice augment. Now, it also seems that there are intermediate augments that you can't use because to un-equip it for the next step would destroy it.<br />
<br />
There are also the usual drops associated with the named.<br />
<br />
Nice Aug, and I can see why people would want to keep it once the piece of equipment it was on became obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The augment reward is the same as the Adventurers Stone. You can remove (destroy) the augment, and hail the quest NPC to receive a fresh augment at the stage you're up to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That and the fact that SoE will be implementing (soon) a way to remove your aug's and not lose them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You can destroy it all you want. All you have to do is talk to the npc where you started the quest after removing it and you get the augment back.<br />
<br />
I was a bit paranoid of trying to remove it, even after people told me about it because of all the work that goes into that quest, but yes, you do get the augment returned from your last completion point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The difference is this is a raid only quest. You cant even get out of BDC1 without a 3 grp raid. How many of the other &quot;great&quot; quests directly fit that bill (not including the flag progression &quot;quests&quot;). Aid Grimmel does kind of since it requires flags but if you are flagged it requires nothing of greater than 1 grp (and arguably not even that if you can buy the stuff or farm it solo/duo).<br />
<br />
I keep reading this quest and going, damn I wish I could do that :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've heard that you can actually keep each augment.  Say for example you have aug 1 and have all the stuff to get aug2,  you die and leave aug1 on corpse and go hail to get a replacement.  Do the turn-in get aug2 and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, eqphreak that is true right now.  Just look at my magelo.  However, many (not me) consider this an exploit and will belittle you for doing it.  On that note, it is getting made soon within the week that each augment is considered the lore of the others, meaning you can only have one of the augments period.  That will put an end to the corpsing of the old augments and getting a new one.<br />
<br />
On and all, it was a very long quest.  Some of the parts require raids to finish, but most of it was one groupable stuff.  I soloed in the back of the Yxtta caves to finish up the final pieces of the augment (11 of 14 done).  Any day now I should have the 12th completed.. as soon as Noqufiel dies.<br />
<br />
As I've said before with this quest, if anyone has any questions or concerns about this quest, feel free to send me a tell anytime and I will help you with the best of my ability.  I've helped Rtugok, Lemonade, Serbitar, Collecta...etc with the quests and if I had a minute of spare time I will do what I can.  You can also PM me anytime and I will respond as soon as I see it.<br />

Last thing, here is the link to the safehouse thread that gives out some helpful info, albeit a little bit jumbled.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">does the chalk drop off the mobs at the qinimi zonline?  You say it drops in Riwwi but I think that was a typo.  Can you clarify how long it took to get that?  I am pulling my hair out becuase kill after kill I get nothing ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had five chalks drop for me within two hours as I was camping the Barindu Zoneline in Qinimi.  So, they are a common/uncommon drop as you cycle through all those mobs in the immediate area.  I was able to kill all the mobs up to and including the second stairs within 30 mins, and I was not even trying hard.  There is a roamer, so best be careful when you pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So they must have a very low drop rate on the other side of the zone,  thanks for the update :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So they must have a very low drop rate on the other side of the zone,  thanks for the update :)<br />
<br />
More nocs on the other side :P<br />
<br />
The kvys cannot be rooted, so they are not good to kill.<br />
The dogs cannot be rooted, so they are not good to kill.<br />
The big guys can be rooted, but they summon, so it is a pain in the ass with them.  I must say, it was funny trying to dot between summons. :P<br />
<br />
On the Barindu zoneline, there are nocs:<br />
<br />
2 - at the stairs<br />
2 - in the room above the stairs<br />
4 - in the water chamber thingy<br />
2 - down the stairs<br />
1 - roamer<br />
<br />
They seem to have a low aggro radius.</div></div><hr />

So were the epics when they were introduced.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There was a rumor that was told to me even before during God beta that spoke of a huge quest involving every GoD zone that was going to be very difficult, and the end result would be a face item that was equivelant of 10th ring, Talisman of Vah Kerrath, tradeskill pop earring.. ETC all in one.  This is the quest that that was stated from.  So, while the end result will not be figured out until Tacvi is beaten (prob in 2 more months or so), this is what I'm expecting, and i'm already very excited about the great augment available from this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just imagine if they wouldn't nerf it and you could have all 8 progressive augs. ****</div></div><hr />
