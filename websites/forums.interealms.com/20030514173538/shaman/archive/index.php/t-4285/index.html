<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've tried the test of Patience 3 times now in the past week. I've failed 3 times - twice, I couldn't find mobs that spoke, even though I was at the right location. I'm getting pretty bummed out over it, I'd really like some advice.<br />
<br />
I'm a level 49 shaman. The first time, I was 47, and I Went in with EB+iva+lev and stayed in the water, chatted with dillon and Safron, and I got eaten by a shark when my invis to animals went down at a bad time. That's my fault. My poor guild cleric ran all the way from dreadlands to help me get my body out of the water and give a rez... ouch.<br />
<br />
So the next time I tried levving on top of the water. I was exactly over the spot - I heard all of the guys talk as they arrived, and as the left. I heard Dillon the Drowned, Safron the Soaked, Froghorn the Forgotten, and Abe. I didn't bother to hail abe or ask for his arrow, because everyone says it's worthless. Then I waited for the greater spirit. Then I see:<br />
<br />
&quot;A greater spirit says 'Shaman? My time will soon be at hand and I fear I will never see our friends again. But the arrow must be given, our holy broken arrow. Shaman, will you bear our obligation and [give them the arrow]? You will know who to give it to when it is time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Note, it said &quot;a greater spirit&quot;. Not abe. And he didn't cast inner fire on himself either. <br />
<br />
So I jump into the water, and start searching, and I can't find him. I don't hear any leaving messages, I even summon my dog and drop invis to animals, and we run around in circles with him trying to find the nearest animal, and we can't find him. I tried using a vision spell, looking near the top of the water, near the bottom, up, down, sideways....<br />
<br />
After an hour, I petition and leave.<br />
<br />
I figure, ok, maybe I need to get that arrow from Abe.<br />
<br />
So I go back the next day, and I lev on top until I hear Abe say his message about the arrow. Then I jump into the water. But Abe is nowhere to be found. Once again, I summon my dog. Once again I swim around and around. I never hear Abe's leaving message (which I heard on try 3), I never hear the greater spirit. After an hour and a half, I petition, I bug report, I cry, I leave.<br />
<br />
My guild has been wonderfully supportive, they'd like to accompany me on try #4. What I want to know is, could it be possible that Abe &amp; the greater spirit are spawned in the wrong spot because of my screwup on try #2? I'm wondering whether I should wait for a reboot before we go and try it again - I am very glad for their offer of company, as this is really bumming me out, and if it screws up again, I will have another eye witness.<br />
<br />
I've not heard anything back from my petitions or the bug report.<br />
<br />
On a side note - I tried to faction my way past this quest - yes, I want to do the quest myself, but I've tried to do this test 3 times and twice it's not worked right, so my heart is there even if I couldn't do it.... I got my faction up to Amiable (thanks, translocators), and I tried to turn in envy+woe+promise of marr to the wandering spirit. But it said, I will not help your kind in any way, ate my items, and walked off. Grrr. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any advice? Any similar stories? This is really depressing. Everyone seems to have done it flawlessly on their first try at like level 20, and here I am sitting through this hour and a half quest three times, and getting zip, zilch, squat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just did the test of patience last week, seemed to work fine for me but I didnt lev above the water, I swam down to the bottom of the ocean at the loc in the guides.  It was a royal pain in the arse though because there seemed to be a bug with 1st person view down there, I couldnt see ANYTHING in 1st person view, it was all grey.  I couldnt even see my pet.  I switched to 3rd person view and I was able to see the spirits and talk with them.  You may just want to try sinking to the bottom and switching your view out of 1st person to see if that helps any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mieky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I also had to retry this part of the quest several times. the time that i got it to work i brought my 52 ranger wife had pet up before hand in had us all buffed then did hand in.  after going through the dialogue the ogress headed out and of course i lost her when she hit the water now here is where i was screwin up the loc that was in my guide (which was from allakhazam i believe) was wrong it was the second number i cant remember off the top of my head i think its 2400 but is supposed to be 4200.  had wife swimin around checking track constantly finally get the ogre back on track and swim out to her then wait... having ranger check track every couple mins for next spawn.  and wait some more had to kill a few of the sharks but with pet and ranger they wernt too bad i think the entire encounter lasted 90 mins or 2 hrs. anyway i know a lil long winded hope it helps though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes it does take a long time i died 1ce or 2ce doing mine but the time it took me t 0 complete it was around 45mins be4 the new ui and all and hopefully wont have to do it again</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not broken, but it sucks to try to see in the water.  I failed on my first try the same way you did on your second.  The spirit told me to get my arse in gear (basically...not his EXACT words; I'm paraphrasing) and I hopped in the water...couldn't see crap.  Had to log afterwards.  Second time, I dropped into the water right after I heard Abe leave (IvA and all that), and swam around a bit, always staying near the /loc...well, as I'm sinking I catch out of the corner of my screen (you know how when you're turning, sometimes mobs'll just pop and depop..no?  that's just me?  Damn!) a dog...so I turn towards it and it's not there.  I run over, and it pops in front of me.  Viola, I've got a new gem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I finished the test on Friday :)<br />
<br />
Happy happy joy joy.<br />
<br />
However, I want to note that if you see the message &quot;A greater spirit says, 'Shaman, my time will soon be hand, blah blah, give the arrow blah blah' - then you missed the spirit.<br />
<br />
Cause as soon as he says that, he poofs.<br />
<br />
This time I hailed abe, got the arrow. The spirit showed up, I got the gem. We hung around a bit (guildmates and me), and we were discussing where to go next when the spirit told us to go, and finally said that line and poofed.<br />
<br />
So if you're waiting on top and you hear that, you just flunked your test.<br />
<br />
FYI.</div></div><hr />
