It all started in December 1982 with the Texas Instrument TI99/4a, which ran on a 16 bit TMS-9900 CPU at 3MHZ. Ah the memories of a freshman hacker, coding for hours to get a cheap rip-off of Pong. Those were the days.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then in 1988 came The COMMODORE Colt. It was based upon the INTEL 8088 at 4.77 Mhz.( or 7.16 Mhz. turbo). MS-DOS 3.2! The days of Loadrunner, a Bard's Tale, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Many a college term paper were written on this barn burner.<br />

1991. The year that will live in infamy! Well, Little Bert went off and joined the Navy. The computer world was changing. I saved almost four thousand dollars, enough to buy a decent car, and purchased the next best thing, a 386DX40 with 4MB RAM and 80MB hard disk. My first Hardrive! Add in an Adlib Soundcard and 12 more MB of ram and I was the envy of all my Red Baron Rivals!<br />

1997, I'm out of the Navy and got my first contracting gig, a 65 day outage at the local nuke plant. Time to celebrate! Compaq Presario 4880 with a PENTIUM 200 MMX processor 64 MB of ram, 3.2 GB Harddrive, 3DFX add-on card paired with a S3Virge and a second generation DVD player! WOOHOO!!! Ultima Online is the BOMB!!!<br />

I'm gonna party like its 1999! To ring in the new year after Cyrssi released me from my bedroom I went hog wild. A Pentium III 500 Mhz, 16x DVD, CD-RW 60GB Harddrive, Soundblaster Live Full and Geforce Video card. Lovin Life and playing EQ!!!<br />
<br />

2001, Its time to jump ship. The AMD 1.2 Ghz is calling my name. 1GB of ram, 80 GB Harddrive, Geforce 2, then 3, then 4. Same old trusty Soundblaster Live Full sound card. Planes of Power, no problem. But the X-files directory (read pr0n) outgrows itself and requires a second 60GB HD of its own.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Well its 2003 and its that time again... Back to the Intel bandwagon. The online order is submitted. Couldn't pass it up. The outage was good to me this year. Pentium 4 3Ghz 800 Mhz frontside bus with another GB of cas2 Corsair PC3200 DDR XML matched ram on an Asus P4C800 Deluxe MB with more RAID, Serial ATA, and firewire ports than a med cruise. All wrapped up in a nicely modded Antec SX1040BII Tower with fancy blue LED lights and fans.<br />
