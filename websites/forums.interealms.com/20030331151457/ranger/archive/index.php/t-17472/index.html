<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Armarand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there. Looked through the epic guide, and was wondering if anyone had a guide on just doing the Swiftwind, without the earthcaller steps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I was hoping I could clear up any rooms on when the min level a ranger can obtain an epic (provided that plane pieces are MQed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haven't tested any minimums . . .<br />
<br />
But, the epic quest is just one quest.  There really aren't any steps you can avoid when working on getting swiftwind.  <br />
<br />
The only two I can think of would be the obvious one of not getting the SEoC from Hate, and the less obvious one of not handing in the chunk of mithril that the ancient dwarf gives you when he's done refining the blade Telin gave you (ie - if you don't ever want earthcaller, there is no real need to hand in that chunk to Kinlo to get the other blade; but its rather dumb not to IMO unless you know for sure that you'd simply destroy that blade and would never go to Hate and and also never buy the SEoC MQ).</div></div><hr />
