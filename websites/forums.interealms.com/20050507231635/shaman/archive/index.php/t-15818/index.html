<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cosmoleena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone!<br />
This is my first time posting here on the board and I had some questions about something that has been bugging me lately.<br />
I've heard of shamans soloing Guardian Wurms in Skyfire before, along with other classes capable of soloing them, (necros being another).<br />
I tried a week or so ago and it was just downright ugly. I expect to get summoned and was prepared to deal with that using Quiescence but my spells kept getting interrupted during casting due to being hit pretty hard. <br />
I didn't have any problems with adds because I pulled with slow (stuck nice), to the west wall from the VP zone. <br />
So...my question is this, does anyone have any tips on soloing mobs that summon? <br />
I'm up to date on all dots and spells pretty much as well. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They hit hard, and if you get a bad streak of hits, you'll probably need to use tnarg's or KM occasionally to keep up with it.  Other than that, it's a standard fight, tank him while the dots + dog kill him, and don't die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best advice I can give is to make sure the Wurm's HP's reach zero before yours does. <br />
<br />
hehe /jk<br />
<br />
I have soloed a few of these and you really have to get kinda luck with channeling through Torpor/Q.<br />
<br />
I had Virtue &amp; KEI on myself so some will say thats not soloing, but screw'em. :)<br />
<br />
Summon pet. Pull GW with Malo/Malos, Slow mob. Have pet attack from the back of the GW, Cast DoTs and start casting Torpor/Q ASAP. I always did so before my health was below 75 pct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">with quickbuff or some sort of spellhaste you can cast between his swings if you keep him slowed, just use tnarg's to supplement every now and then, with just epic dot and a haste duel wielding pet they take about 10 mins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>thatguy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just curious, never soloed these. would yas compare it to mabe Gantru Dralkenr or A Gantru Raldukan ? if so sounds like a fun fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Really fun when you first solo a guardian wurm, I first soloed one quite late at lvl 63 and missed a load of spells then. When I did it then it was close encounters. However now at 65 and in VT/Elemental gear and 150 aa can do them with like 80m left and hardly any risk. <br />
Hmm maybe get a cleric buff before you try, and also look for haste of mithaniel item(theres a shaman range only one) to improve chances of channelling quessience. Also you can get mage ring if you want to forgo that hp. Just remember when fighting it keep it slowed! I remember first time I did it, slow wore off. Luckily I landed it at 20% health but I wasted a load of mana. Also stack poison dots, use a pet(with weapons maybe), and a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Putting your back to a nice solid wall helps a lot as well.  A lot of times the reason we get interrupted is not due to being stunned but due to being knocked back by a hit.  If we were able to perfectly move you could move back to where you started casting before you completed casting and you would complete you casting with out interruption.  This is the number one reason why it is so difficult to cast spells underwater as your pushed back very easy by hit in the water.  So if your having difficulty getting spells off due to interrupts plant that little butt next to the wall and face out.  It'll be 90% easier to cast that spell then.  Trees and rocks work as well when no wall is available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They arent tough now, anyone, regardless of gear, should be able to solo em with only self buffs at 65.  As long as you have cann5 as well and Quiescence or Torpor.  Keep Kraggs up too, the mana \ hp ratio for that is nearly as good as qui \ torpor, and since you dont have to wait on it to heal you over time, its nice to use after a cann5.  Also if you are having trouble with mana, just use epic dot and dogdog for dmg and focus all your mana on keeping him slowed and staying alive, you should be able to win np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A lvl 61 shaman w/cann 5 and topor can solo these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pull with malo/s towards a safe spot (VP entrance is pretty safe, although not 100%). Then root the wurm before it reaches you, it will not summon if you have not damaged it. Slow and cripple, you can change spells and canni a bit before engaging him. <br />
<br />
Quies on yourself right before you start fighting. Keep the pet (dualwielding, focused and hasted) in the wurms back, also get Spirit Call pets in its back if you have it. I have canni5 but have never used it while fighting guardian wurms, too risky for me with low hp without clr/dru hp buffs. Keep Quies on yourself all the time, kill with pet, epic, jbb and possibly more dots if you have the mana. Keep Tnargs up for emergency heals when the wurms gets a few lucky shots (which he will ;)) It is really not that hard.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This sounds like a fun challenge, I might try it.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'd be more likely to try it if I had a cleric bot available in case of disaster :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I &quot;soloed&quot; a GW at 61 with virtue on my 4th try (only died on 2 tries).  I had Cann5, doggie burn and SCRM for AAs.  Having Tnarg's though makes this encounter MUCH easier so trying it at 62 should be simple.  Fight took 8 minutes, I only used Pox once and ended the fight at 15% mana on a few quick canns.  It is VERY important to time your slow spell so it doesn't run out during the fight.  If you do not have Tnarg's then cast KM before 50% health as you will be interupted most likely.<br />
<br />
Buffing FR isn't critical at all but it helps stop a little extra damage that regualarly hits at 61.  Use a DS potion and a greater FR potion.  I also gave the puppy a couple of mage summoned fists.  I have the logs published some where if you wanna see em.  Really though, although I'm very proud I soloed a GW at 61, many shaman have done better.  I had 1103 AC and around 4100 HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Guntak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I solod these at 60 with no malo. It was close, but I always won. It got a lot easier when I started boxing my CH cleric tho :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A lvl 61 shaman w/cann 5 and topor can solo these? <br />
A level 60 shaman with no AA can solo these.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, the best tip I can give that hasn't been mentioned yet, is use root. You can root, fully debuff, and regain all your mana before you ever engage him. Also use root to back out and get a spell cast off when it's critical. Dog isn't the best tank, but he can always take a few rounds for the team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They don't summon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They don't summon if you don't do damage to them.  debuffs do no damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">They don't summon if you don't do damage to them. debuffs do no damage<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know that, but <br />
<br />
... Also use root to back out and get a spell cast off when it's critical. Dog isn't the best tank, but he can always take a few rounds for the team.<br />
<br />
I guess you could back out, take the summon, back out again and probably get the spell off before resummon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I guess you could back out, take the summon, back out again and probably get the spell off before resummon.<br />
yeah, also from my experience once you've engaged the GW and then you back off to KM/tnargs yourself I find I don't get summoned much (like you suggested).  That said, the puppy cannot go toe to toe with the GW long and it's frequently better to engage and stoicism/torpor/Q yourself than stoicism/torpor (not Q) your main source of DPS (pet should be doing as much if not more dam than you, otherwise you MIGHT be spending too much mana and you'll lose).  Oh, timing is everything (you know this already, this comment not directed to you) if you get summoned it'll interupt you more surely than any bash, so it's good to run out of aggro (doesn't do much good if you are snared by torpor/stoicicsm) and mind the time from last summons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Mobs don't summon if they're rooted and something (pet) is in melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They don't summon if you don't do damage to them.  debuffs do no damageIs this only true of Guardian Wurms?  I was doing no damage to vanns in epad last night in BoT but I got summoned occasionally after a malosinia/slow combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No mob will summon until some damage is done to it, but it doesn't mean you won't be the one summoned if a tank or pet damage it. <br />
Hate lists control who gets summoned, but it will never happen until it has been damaged by something.</div></div><hr />
