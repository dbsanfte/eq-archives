<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at level 51 and don't have all my spells yet.  Should I stop leveling right before dinging 52 and put all epx into aa until I get them or should I just keep right on leveling even if I can't afford to buy them?<br />
<br />
Not much reason to level up if you don't have the spells that come with it.  I know levitation and enduring breath aren't game breakers but any helpfull hints on this from the more exp shammies outhere would be very appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of your 51+ spells are buyable in FV, and most of the rest are really really dirt cheap.  As you level you will find money will come much easier and you'll be able to buy the more expensive ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Getting to 60 even without spells tend to be better than doing aa at lower levels (getting runspeed 3 at 51 is good if you do alot of indoor zones though). You will need to get a few levels under your belt in order to gain access to the better aa's anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do people actually buy their vendor-bought spells in bazaar for hundreds of pp? <br />
I know i see those type being sold there a lot at horrifyingly extravagant and unnecessary prices, but I assumed that was to catch the idiots out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're refering to your level 52 spells, you won't have those for awhile.  Some are truly intended for level 52 Shammy's (i.e. SoS, Regrowth and Insideous Decay) but the other three aren't.  Disinfecting Aura is more a level 60 camp.  Pure Blood is a rumor.  Primal Essence is such a tough/useless camp that most level 65's don't have it, because they haven't convinced a group to sit there (and we all want it, because of the extra STA portion and stackability).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As long as you have turgur's, you'll be fine. When you have a few more levels on you, you will be able to go with a good group into the deep and get levitation. I don't know much about the camp for everlasting breath, but I've heard it's not very fun. I still don't have primal essence either, but I'm not holding my breath for it either. The idea of more single-target buffs that don't stack with my main group buffs isn't that compelling. Also, if you're worried about disinfecting aura, it's very cheap (one of the few cheap spells, like acumen) on my server in the bazaar. I've seen it as low as 50pp.  Before I ramble anymore, my point is, keep levelling. THE level 51 spell is turgurs. THE level 52 spell is regrowth. The rest are just icing on the cake. ;) They're worth getting, but they'll come in time. Just keep at it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sedax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lv's are more important than having all your spells imo. You can pretty much get by on vendor spells up until 59 and the drop spells up to 59 can usually be bought for pretty cheap in baz except for PE, Lev, and EB. Leveling helps you to reach the places that drop the higher lv spells that people are typically missing along with usually generating more pp to buy spells. Where it becomes a problem is lv60 and getting Torpor and Malo. These 2 spells are the most beneficial to us and the hardest to find since every shaman wants them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The drop spells 51 to 55 are not really all that critical.  Some are nice to have, sure, but they are not make or break.<br />
<br />
Level 55 is where the rubber really starts to meet the road, with Form of the Great Bear, Spirit of the Howler, and Torrent of Poison as dropped spells.  From 55 on count on struggling to get all your spells if you don't have a strong guild support network to help you get them.<br />
<br />
However, I STILL would not let a lack of spells pre-60 stand in my way of levelling.  The simple truth is you get resisted less, you resist more of the mobs' attacks, and farming plat to pay for spells gets easier.  Pre-60, get Run 3 but go right back to levelling.</div></div><hr />
