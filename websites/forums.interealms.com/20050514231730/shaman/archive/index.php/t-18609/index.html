<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's the situation:<br />
<br />
I'm a 65 shaman in a mediocre group in BoT.  I slow as soon as the MT engages, cause if I wait, he get's pasted and the cleric whines about it.  Plus, with Q on myself, taking a few hits when the giant summons me is hardly going to make me break a sweat.  <br />
<br />
This is the same basic tactic I was using back when I was 64, with Torpor and I rarely had problems with being resisted more than once.  At 64, if I did get resisted, I blasted the mob with malo, re-slowed and was good to go.  I did this for a good long while, and never had any significant issues with resists.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, however, I would slow, get resisted, malo, re-slow, get resisted, get summoned, get mad, reslow right on top of the mob and it would finally stick.  And this happened a LOT.  Now I know that some of the nameds in BoT seem to only be slowable from within, or very close to, melee range (Gaukr is one I noticed like this).  So I started watching and came to find out that anytime I was close enough to the giants for them to hit me, slow landed the first time almost everytime, and at the very worst, once malo'd slow was never resisted.  When I casted from range, even with malo on, slow would be resisted alot.<br />
<br />
Is this normal and I just haven't noticed it before now, or is this just the RNG being flakey?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I get 1st slow resists about 1 in 4 in BoT. I've just gotten used to leading off with Malo(s)every time - Kriegers can still be problematic (gotten triple resists wiMalos)  but it should take care of your problem.  Range to target has nothing to do with resists (except in special circumstances on certain dragons where you must be in melee range to land anything).  Sounds like you've just been unlucky. As far as your cleric goes, explain it will cost less mana for him in the long run if you can malo/slow than if you have to slow/malo/slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's normal to be resisted 1 in 4/5 times you cast slow, it doesn't seem to matter what range you're at. Krigers, as mentioned above, resist like mad even after malos. Sometimes with malos/tash they still resist. There's nothin ya can do about it, cause verant sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How does Verant suck in this case? I think it makes the game more interesting if you get resists. A dull grind can suddenly have a little excitement if slow won't hit. There shouldn't be a case where slow hits every single time you cast it against dark blue mobs. Otherwise you can argue that if the mob is dark blue Verant should just assume that the Shaman would slow it, and make it slowed as it enters casting range. Then, you could assume that the mob will be killed by the group as it is slowed.... etc... etc...<br />
<br />
I think the ratio should be somewhat constant over time, but never a gift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I'd have to agree it's the Kriegers. It becomes very annoying to see slows bounce double and sometimes triple the times that it would normally do on the other three sides. Just be well prepared for beatings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I was slowing an add in an LDON adv and got 5 resists in a row on it.  After a string of obscenities I finally said screw it and gave up.  By that time the main mob was dead and the add had 1/3 life left.  After that I landed slow first cast ALMOST every time, including the yellow con named on the assassinate mission.  Last night I went to MMC (5th mission there aside from the 4 I did in beta) and I couldn't land a prayer on anything.  Almost every slow bounced once, many bounced twice, so I broke out the obscenities again.  Everytime I swore the enchanter would slow ... saved me from loading my &quot;resist&quot; hotkey and spamming the group.<br />
<br />
BoT is a harder zone for slowing mobs due to higher MR mobs.  I always Malos first cast and if the cleric bitches I tell him that better the plate class MA with LR5/ID5 than the chain class priest with LR1.  Generally, this shuts them up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am not at all surprised that the slow bounced 5 times. I average about 3 or 4 mobs who simply REFUSE to slow in any LDON adventure (Melee range or not). By the time I have Turgurs land on those few, they're down to one bar of health anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">in my opinion, if a normal exp mob has malos on it, it should not be resisting a slow 2x. 1x I can understand, rarely.. but I often have mobs resisting slow a ton of times even after malos. Just something I don't think is right and should be changed(of course I know it's not gonna happen)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why should it happen I didn't see your reason why besides it just being annoying.<br />
<br />
Some monsters just have higher resists than others.. and some mobs are higher level than others..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I guess it just goes back to the old days. I'm an old-timer(been playing since 99) and never had trouble with resists anywhere.. all of a sudden I get to tier 2 pop and resists all over the place. You guys are right, it shouldn't happen. But I'd still like to see it happen.<br />
<br />
The major thing with this comes from being on a pvp server. I hate when I malo something(someone) and still can't get anything to stick. It comes from my personal standpoint of what a resist debuffer should do. Just ignore me and move on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am not at all surprised that the slow bounced 5 times.

<br />
I encounter the same thing sometimes in LDoN (although rarely 3-4...usually just 1 or 2 seemingly completely resistant bastages even after a tash or something) and it drives me nuts...but it does add spice to an adventure.  Usually my group can tell when I'm getting consecutive resists because I'm jumping around the room, yelling obscenities, /ruding mobs, and doing /randoms - anything to change my luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Haven't been playing my Shaman as much, but as a 61 in a 65 adventure, even leading with Malo I've been bouncing multiple slows. Of course level has a lot to do with it.<br />
<br />
But since the patch on the 18th, As Warrior and MT for exp groups I've heard tons of grumbling from the Shaman and even Beastlords I have been grouped with in BoT about resists on slow. This was over the course of 2 days and three seperate play periods. Over a 5 hour group we had 2 65 Shaman with nice spellbooks. They commented that things went fine for awhile, then after about an hour or so resists started happening more frequently. We switched Shaman and same thing happened.  If once I would have said RNG...but 2x for 2 different Shaman seems a bit more than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well I am glad that I am not the only one seeing this happen.....I do a few BoT groups when I feel like breaking the LDoN grind (which I really really do like a lot) and since the last patch I do see many more resists in both LDoN and BoT.<br />
I dont mind 1 bounce or even 2, it happens, and if there is a chanter NPC around buffing, I dont mind it even more, but getting (no **** here) 5 bounces on 5 consecutive mobs AFTER a Malo and a Tash is just sick. Even the wizard in the group I had today was getting partial resists and he was highly PO'd. After he sent me a tell saying can you please Malo/s each mob WMP and me saying that I was doing just that, we both came to the conclusion that there is something being tweaked with resists.<br />
Call me paranoid, no I dont have parses, but geez 5 resists on a slow AFTER malo and a tash on 5 CONSECUTIVE mobs?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jennifa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree with the majority of the posts here, when in BoT I always start off the mobs With Malos or Malo which ever you have and then get in close to slow.  <br />
<br />
Since I have been doing this tactic, I have only a few resists per every few hours, mostly on Krigers.  Since Malos isn't resisted, I cast it on every mob for not only slowing purposes but for the Casters as well.<br />
<br />
Also, if I see a Kriger Inc I will throw a Quiescence on the MA in case I can't get it slowed on first try, we all know how fast they can drop in HP's with an unslowed Kriger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I actually had meant to post something about this a few weeks ago.  I don't really group much in BOT anymore (working on getting more LDON armor) but when I did it seemed like suddenly after some patch or another the giants got a whole lot more resistant to slows.<br />
<br />
I didn't remember them ever resisting after Malos (except Kriegers/named perhaps), but now it seems like every other one did it.  Was there a stealth magic resist buff to the BOT giants?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Kriger's are just trouble. Sometimes slow will land first try, other times it takes 4 or 5 and thats after Malos. One fight I cast Malos on INC and then had 4 resisted slows, just as the 5th one landed the MT went down and I got the pleasure of tanking him the rest of the fight. Just happy we get plenty of practice with keeping our defensive skills up and channeling skills, cause I managed to keep Quiessence running and landed a Tnarg's or 2 on myself or I dont think the cleric would a been able to keep me standing.<br />
<br />
Otherwise like everything else your a slave to the RNG and rolling under 10 4 times in a row on a random 1 1000 may not seem possible, but it does happen and I think its as much the rng being mean is it is some mobs having a higher resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Now I know that some of the nameds in BoT seem to only be slowable from within, or very close to, melee range (Gaukr is one I noticed like this).<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope. The reason you bounce so often on gaukr is because they buffed the **** out of him and he's a little bitch to slow now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">With Malos and slowing from point blank i rarely have problems in BoT, but in most cases i have a pally or two who can stun the mob for me when i bounce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Have slowed Gaukr Sandstorm 3 or 4 times before,  maybe 1 or 2 resist after malos and in close proximity.  Yesterday Hit him with malos, slow bounces, hit with malosinia, it bounces,  kept repeating tugurs, malosinia  until he dies 3 or 4 minutes later, never got a single one to land.  I did recast malos after several failures on the off chance it had worn off.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have problems with him lately?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was just in BoT tonight and I didn't notice any greater resistance to slow. I ALWAYS open with Malos, all mobs in this zone are highely resistant. Yes, even after Malos you will get slows bounced, its part of being a Shaman. And no, I don't think it adds spice to the game, its just annoying.<br />
LDoN is especially bad for resists because the fast pacing doesn't really allow for you to debuff every mob (normal level anyway.) For those of you who have chanters in your group slowing on your resists, have them tash instead. Your there to slow not they, and tash will help you do it. It will also help nukers do their thing, and the melees procs to land, besides making it easier for them to mez or charm.<br />
And range to target has nothing to do with spells landing or not. Think about it, how often do you get resisted in LDoN? How close are you generally, to the mobs? Almost on top in my case anyway. Newer expansions have simply added more resists to the mobs. Thats why XP'ing in the &quot;old&quot; world is so nice when you can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I repeat ..awhile back they buffed the crap outta Gaukr's resists. It is still possible to land a slow on him once in a blue moon..but don't expect it to happen. I've had bards debuffing him with me and still bounced slow and malosinia the entire fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">or is this just the RNG being flakey?<br />
<br />
Grazts RNG<br />
<br />
I have streaks of BAM Mobs slowed all over the planes on first try, sometimes with Malos and sometimes without....<br />
<br />
THEN<br />
<br />
I can get streaky resists that just annoys the hell out of me...<br />
<br />
Everything working as attended.... &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Resists like that are normal in BoT.<br />
Gaukr is the main reason I bought a tash stick...<br />
FA myself, Malos, then just melee while trying to slow hoping for a proc and tossing patch heals as I can.<br />
I will usually try to stick Malosinia after I proc a tash too.<br />
Just doesnt ever seem to land if you dont get a tash on first.<br />
<br />
Even then its not guarenteed I will get him slow before he is dead.<br />
Have to try though he is much easier slowed if you can get lucky.</div></div><hr />
