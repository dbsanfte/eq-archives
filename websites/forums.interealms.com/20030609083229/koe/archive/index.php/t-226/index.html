<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been moving.  Thankfully if GTE (Verison) keeps their promises, I will have DSL at my new apartment on Friday of this week.  I'm still unpacking so in reality I probably won't be able to logon again until Monday, but starting Monday, expect to see me on a more regular basis.  I will also be playing Sherazad (my gfriend Eden's character) on a regular basis as well so I can help her catch up to me in levels.  She is a level 15 high elf paladin, so any suggestions on best places for easy xp, let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/drool DSL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bagfra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if only DSL wasn't so expensive over here, I would start playing more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Welcome back Sori.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well it looks like I won't have internet access till next week.  &gt;:-(   Damn Verison (GTE) bastards are really pissing mehoff.  So I won't be seeing you guys again till next weekend.  So till then, see you on the boards and happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you thought I was pissed before, I'm REALLY pissed at them now.  It's been over 3 weeks since I last played EQ.  Now they are telling me that they don't see an activation date on my account.  JEZ, I thought I settled this on the 20th.  I'm still on hold, have been for the last half hour so, I will reply to this message again when I know for sure when I will be active. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well after 45 minutes of hold time and almost vomiting from the lame Verison hold music....<br />
<br />
Got a really nice guy named Bill.  He's going to try to force an activation to go through later today.  I'll find out for sure in about 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good Luck I hope the idiots get there act together and get you account activated soon.<br />

A good place for Lv 15 paladin to hunt solo is in TD the skeletons on the island just east of the ogre/sporic island.  Take the barrel raft from Oasis to island.  then run east to shore edge.  follow shore edge around until first number on loc is pos 6000.  Swim east to next island.  I think there are 12 or so spawns of Iskar skels there Lv 12 to 15.   They are static spawns on around a 16 - 18 min timer.   The spawns are spread around the west side of the island.  Do not try the Bandits at the north end of island.  There are 3 close together and are Lv 16 to 19,  lv 21 for the Bandit leader.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well unless superviors help me any more thank everyone else has at Verison, I think that you won't be seeing me in Norath until May 11th.  I'll try to keep you guys posted, but until then, PEACE!  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well no thanks to the folks at Verison, looks like I'll have DSL no sooner than the 11th (a week from today).  But, I am going to try to get a 56K modem working on my box so I can at least get online to for example attend Aranuil's wedding and Abash's wedding.  See both of you, your counterparts, and everyone else in the guild who will be attending tonight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ack! Sori looks like he's getting skinned by these guys...<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well to cut a long story short, I had to cancel my old visa check card number and order a new one from my bank.  Well between then and now (still haven't gotten new card), my EQ accunt needed a re-billing.  Well, let's just sat that there was no card to be billed so they canceled my account.  So even though I got online with a 56 modem to go to Aranuil's wedding, I couldn't because my account was dead.  HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!<br />
<br />
Oh well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well of course my account is reactive again, people have seen me online, but FYI my DSL is also back again, so no excuses on why not to play more often as I have promised!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Now... I dunno what level you are...  but im playing with a few lower level applicants in the low 30s to low 20s.  Yes that is why Utee is out.<br />
<br />
so.. find me online...  we have been in the Lake of Ill Women area.</div></div><hr />

Did you not notice my signature, I'm level 25.<br />
Anyhow I'm currently on Unrest, helping level my GFriend's character (Sherazad).  Once she hits level 20, we'll both come back to LoIO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I will see you later then...</div></div><hr />
