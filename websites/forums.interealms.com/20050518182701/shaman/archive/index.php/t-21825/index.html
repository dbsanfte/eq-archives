<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It’s been a couple hours since I read the update from the summit and I don’t understand were SoE is coming from.  I remember sometime ago there was some talk about what a Shaman is?  Did we as Shaman ever come to an agreement about what our class is in EQ.  If tomorrow someone told you they were starting EQ and said what is a Shaman what would you tell them.  I know personally I would tell them that a Shaman is the master of nothing.  If it is important to the game Shaman can do it but will do it the slowest and usually the weakest for the most part.  Was wondering what others might say?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">shaman is the guy who power levels alternate characters the fastest.<br />
<br />
oh yea, he is also widely ignored by anyone who is in charge of anything in the game (spell testors, expansion dev's, yadda yadda)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Much of my problem answering this question stem from the dualityof my thought concerning shaman.<br />
<br />
I have in my head one idea of what a shaman is, and I have in practice another idea of what a shaman is.  First, to my thoughts on what a shaman is:<br />
<br />
A shaman is a priest.  With the notable exception of frogloks (who should have had enchanters and NOT shaman to fit in with then current game lore and practice) shaman are the only healers of the &quot;primitive&quot; races: barbarian, troll, ogre, iksar and Vah Shir.  A shaman of these races is charged with healing their warriors in battle and using magic to equip them with the ability to wage war.  A shaman, as a product of a more basic civilization, is trained in the art of war and while probably not able to deal as much pain and damage as his brother warrior is still competent enough to earn his enemies respect.<br />
<br />
Through his ability to heal sickness and cure disease the shaman has gained a mastery over the forces of posion and disease, allowing him to use those dreaded  plagues as a weapon against any that should stand against him.  Able to weaken his enemies and rot them from the inside out, a shaman is truly a fearsome enemy to have.<br />
<br />
That is what I thought of when I read the original description of a shaman that came with the Kunark Box.  I was a healer...so like a cleric but not.  Cool.  I can DoT...cool.  I'm gonna be a battle priest....very cool.<br />
<br />
And then, after 4 years of playing I have a more accurate description of shaman in practice:<br />
<br />
I can slow a little better than others.  I can spend large amounts of mana on stat buffs that may or may not make any difference to the outcome of any given fight.  I can dot, but unless I know that the fight will drag on for a few minutes its not mana efficient to do so.  I can patch heal while I wait for a real healer to do some efficient healing to my targets.  I can do damage via melee, but only if I am going against targets that are long green or in content 4 years old.  I can, however, take a good beating because of my heal over time spells.<br />
<br />
I wont get into raiding with a shaman because I stopped doing that over a year ago.  We can only stack 2 or 3 deep and still be effective.  Any more shaman than that show up get to try and DoT (with our no resist mod huge agro dots) or play FA whore to all the people that can make a difference in the raid (damage dealers).<br />
<br />
Am I bitter?  A little.  Am I discouraged?  Alot.  Am I angry?  Well, when I hear and see bards soloing 30 exp mobs at a time and then hear people say that my class is overpowered because we can solo dragons that used to take a group and dont even give noticible experience or appreciable loot anymore, then yes, I get angry.  When I hear devs that have no idea what happens in the game beyond level 50 (when they all apparently stopped playing) tell me that I'm fine, then yes, I get angry.  <br />
<br />
Somewhere along the line, someone got confused about shaman.  And something needs to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman, we try to be the groups mana battery.  Our slows, they save the clerics mana.  Our nukes we can chain nuke, so the mob drops a hair sooner and we save a wiz 1 nuke worth of mana.  We heal good enough to let the cleric med an extra tick before needing a cheal.... yea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I must admit that I too felt as Thorzion felt when I rolled my Shaman . . . battle priest.<br />
<br />
I was pleasantly surprised as I leveled to 61 . . . it was more than I had hoped for.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the closer I get to 65 the less pleased I am.  This is not as it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A shaman is like a farm tractor. <br />
<br />
Rugged, versitle, reliable, and slow.  Hardly ever gets stuck, can pull others out of the mud, not afraid to enter any situation, and is regualrly left behind by any modern mode of transportation.  <br />
<br />
Like the farm tractor, the shaman is a specialist.  Shamans are best at long haul fights, where the poor quality of most of our abilities is over come by rapid manna regenration thanks to cannibalization.  Like a farm tractor, we rarely are without traction, (meaning that we always have something positive to contribute to a situation).  And like the farm tractor, we are not very useful in most modern situations, where speed and power are more desireable than long term durability and surefooted traction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like a fitting comparison to me.  Since my notion that shaman are not longer priests, but a debuffing necro hybrid, I've tried to come up with the perfect analogy to describe our class.<br />
<br />
Farm tractors seem like it.  While on some levels farm tractors seem like a very versitle &quot;utility&quot; class the reality is, because of its slow speed, a farm tractor is a very specialized vehicle, master of a particular setting but of little use outside of the muddy farm dirt.  I hate to say it, but this is the direction that the shaman is heading (well ok we're already there, but after reading the summit reports from Glor, I fear we will continue down this road of specialization).  Shamans will continue to be the best debuffer it seems by a small margin and unable to fill any other role.  <br />
<br />
On the face of it a farm tractor could do anything, haul tv's, pick up groceries, take the family to the movies, a night out on the town.  With its ability to towe anything all one would need to do is hitch up the right wagon for your tractor, and your good to go.  But in practice this notion is absurd.<br />
<br />
Shamans are aporaching the status of a specialist. Our specialization seems to be debuffing, and rapid personal manna regeneration.  For all the talk of shamans &quot;untility&quot; the truth is often hybrids can best us in all our secondary area's of ability.  We are a specialized class, our general &quot;utility&quot; has diminished with every expansion. I hope that we get better debuffs that justify our specialization status.<br />
<br />
I started my shaman thinking I would be a &quot;battle priest&quot; a primative healer, but SoE has disuaded me of that notion.<br />
<br />
edited to add to a thought (and correct an error, thanks Fuudce)</div></div><hr />

<br />
shaman's are not longer priests, but a debuffing necro hybrid<br />
<br />
First of all it's Shaman, not Shaman's. Secondly I see that we're a Necro/Beastlord hybrid :D Which would make beastlords very confused indeed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Jack of all trades.<br />

We can buff/heal/dot/nuke/debuff. Not superb in any area (except debuffing were we are great, but with mitigation that has become lesser and lesser).<br />
<br />
My personal idea of a shaman is someone who:<br />
<br />
1) Makes life very sour for his/her enemies with curses and other nasty debilitating stuff.<br />
<br />
2) Helps his tribe and friends with curing ailments and wounds and making them more resistant against such things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its sad how many people today dont know that shaman are a priest class.  I cant count the number of times Ive met people that started playing post Luclin that think shaman are beastlord/druid Hybrids.<br />
<br />
Its sickening, and very saddening</div></div><hr />

havent you heard of prequels?  the beastlord was infact here before shaman and shaman was a off shoot of them that speciallised in debuff only, forsaking power so that they could bore themselves to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&gt; Necro/Beastlord<br />

<br />
<br />
that's actually not too bad.<br />
<br />
If <br />
<br />
sham=necro/beast<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
beast=monk/sham<br />
<br />
Then it is infinitely recursive...<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
sham=necro^N+1/Monk^N<br />
<br />
The beast lord part drops out as N approaches infinity. <br />
<br />
Now if we examine this using standard SoE logic it says that we are an infinitely powerful hybrid of a monk and a necro and are therefore balances, go us!</div></div><hr />

Unless you're kidding, i am inclined to say, BST came AFTER SHM.  BST came with Luclin and the Kitties.  SHM came out with, what....Kunark?  BST are a MNK/SHM hybrid.<br />
<br />
SHM= jack of all trades, master of nothing (post PoP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For the journey of 1 to 60 in a group setting, old world(s), I think shaman are still very strong and fun.  You can really make a bad group good, and a decent group great and not a bad soloer.  I really enjoyed my shaman to 60 as my only character at the time and there is a lot they can bring to a group of 6.<br />
<br />
That said, I will also say, I enjoy having my shaman more as a bot now, makes my rogue even more fun to play, easier travel, etc. and makes for a good powerleveler and pretty decent as a duoer.  In most raids, a bot will suffice since so many other classes can cover what they do.<br />
<br />
And Budana, that doesnt mean you can quit/reroll, still nice to leave the bots at home from time to time and someone focusing on their main shaman can always add more to a raid than a bot :)</div></div><hr />
