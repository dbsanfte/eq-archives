<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All the DoT spells are not sold in Halas. They are sold in Everfrost.<br />
<br />
If you follow the left hand wall when you zone out of halas you will (eventually) get out of the canyons and onto the Tundra - you will know when you have reached the Tundra because there are 3 barbarian NPCs guarding the entrance to the canyons, and also usually a Wolf NPC called Snowfang<br />
<br />
Keep following the LH wall along the edge of the Tundra, but keep looking to your right - you should eventually be able to see a large ruined temple. Head to the temple and have a scout around on the raised area of the temple - you will find a Barbarian standing behind a fallen column - he seels a lot of our DoT spells, including the ones you mentioned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shmokie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DoT spells also sold by a Troll on a big stone hand in the north/middle-ish area of Innothule Swamp, or inside Cabalis if you're an Iskar.<br />
