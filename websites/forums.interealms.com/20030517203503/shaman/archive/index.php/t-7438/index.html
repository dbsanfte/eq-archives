If I can get a solid group of mid-50s, would this be enough?  I'm really eager to get my epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had a solid mid 50's group and another group of high 40's-low 50's.  We didn't have much of a problem.  It was more difficult on the crawl all the way into that dungeon.  By the time we got to Kirn I think I had maybe 10 people left.  We invis to undead and went up to him.  We didn't have any difficulty with him with two groups.  One could probably do it if you can make it to him.  Heck, if you can do the jump in it should be a walk in the park.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did this part just this past weekend. We had two groups let me see if I can remember makeup.<br />
<br />
Group 1<br />
60 Paladin(my guild)<br />
54 Paladin(my guild)<br />
54 Ranger(my guild)<br />
55 Cleric(epic'd)(my guild)<br />
53 Shadowknight<br />
49 Druid(my guild)<br />
<br />
Group 2<br />
53 Shaman(me)<br />
55 Necromancer(my guild's alt)<br />
48 Druid(my guild)<br />
53 Magician(my guild)<br />
61 Enchanter<br />
56 Bard<br />
<br />
We went in for both mine and the ranger's epic mobs. Had no problems getting to ranger's mob, and the trip there was a blast. Did his turn in, got a little hairy when we got a few adds and one of our druids accidentally nuked the non aggro version or ranger mob, but we won out with just 1 death.<br />
<br />
We continued on to Kirn. This dungeon design is great, as the mobs spawn time keep you moving but don't overwhelm you. We get to Kirn and start clearing out the revenants around him.<br />
<br />
Had some fun when what's her name the cold showed up and our necromancer, for some reason only gnomes know, blinded her and she took off running! Luckily our pallies caught up to her and rooted her until blind wore off.<br />
<br />
Cleared out room, asked if everyone was ready, and turned in idol. Magician was still sitting so he became the lucky recepient of Kirn's HT. :) After that he went down very easy with no other deaths.<br />
<br />
Highly recommend anyone doing the quest to not skip this part. I am in a far from uber guild(just ask anyone on our server) but with some help from some friends, we went in and had a blast. Definitely my high point of EQ to date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've heard it said that if you can grind your way to Kirn, you've got the force required for Kirn. And that seems to hold true. You do need a coordinated force to get down there - 2 or 3 groups of 50's and high 40's. But if you can get down there without wiping, Kirn should go down easy.<br />
<br />
Kirn was a PITA for me, because people kept killing him but leaving his pet up, so we'd get down there to find him not up, repeatedly. What an annoying bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did Kirn the other with 8 people, all 56-60.  We had no issues whatsoever grinding the way there.  We even got he Cold chick and even she was nothing for our band of adventurers.  I got a Rune 5 for my turn-in and only ate 300 pts of HT, then slowed and tanked him cause I could.  No deaths whatsoever, not even close.<br />
<br />
Don't skip this part, it's just too much fun.  You don't need the uber groups to make the trip, maybe back when Epic first came out, but no more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hiho,<br />
<br />
1 group is doable, but not easy. Especially if you all are mid 50s. Try to bring 2 groups including 1 enchanter that knows his stuff. Far easier to move through the city then.<br />
Furthermore make a brell follower rogue, transfer him to the entrance of the Hole, bind him there, sow him (potions are good too) and go scout the zone. Most mobs (the elementals) should be non-KOS to him. Get the feeling for the zone, check where the mobs stand. And such a brell follower helps a lot when you need to do CR.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I still Had my DESK still active at level 50 My guild and I  went in with another guild to help  their Shammy and Our Chanter get the epic pieces they needed.  We had something like 8 groups maxed out with  a healer, crowd controller and tanks in each group.  We had one odd person who happened to be  an monk and he was our puller.  With everyone there we managed to work our way to the res[pective areas needed for the epics heck quite by accident  my DESK managed to pick up part of his Epic  item as well lol.  But when it came time to  use IVU myself and  a necro had no problems cetting peeps past where we neded to get to the objective and when all was said and done I was quite surprised at how easy we took down the Shammy Mob  I happened to be part of .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my DESK is a very nice oak with built-in bookshelf!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep it's true those monks are very odd people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1 group doable, can be easy if you're good on the slowing / crowd controlling.  the hardest part si this one hall where you might get about 4-5 golems...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did this with 2 groups of mixed levels, 45th to 60th.  Nice thing was, we picked up 2 items for ranger epics, 1 item for chanter epic, and the ring from Kirn.  Look for volunteers, it's not too hard to find them with all the epics that have parts in the Hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only thing I would suggest is if going with 1 group get a good 56+ chanter, higher the better. <br />
<br />
You can get some godawful trains there with some of the pathing, 2 groups of mid-high 50's I was with wiped there once due to a train from hell - thank god for Brell level 1 halfling rogues :). <br />
<br />
Also those golems have high MR, especially when you are in low to mid 50's will be difficult to slow, maybe try to get some tash's on them if having problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Maybe I should just convince everyone we're going for their epics, and hey, why don't we do mine while we're at it?  hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have been and had a chat with Kirn twice, but since my faction isn't quite good enuff, havent completed that part yet.....how? By offering our guild SKs to conduct a raid for them to kill Mummy of Glohour - which lives at the bottom of Kirms tower...and then its only a short fight to get to Kirn.<br />
<br />
Did it a week ago, and also on saturday with 2 groups 50 - 60 (level 60SK puller / MT)...dead easy</div></div><hr />

11) Organize raids to get OTHER people loots. Constantly asking for help getting yourself loots is a good way to get ignored eventually. <br />
<br />
It works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We did it with agroup of 60's, was a push over. I would guess that a solid group of mid-50s would be able to do it without too much trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yep, Kirn can be done with one to two groups easily. The only thing in the hole that can stop even the best group is a misplaced Nortlav.  Someone had pulled him to the tunnel between the city and the undead tower - Nortlav can wipe an unexpecting raid in seconds.  The problem is that, while conning indifferent, will assist any mob that attacks you.  And his lifetap makes VS look tame.  If you ever run into Norlav, don't fight anything in his vicinity, unless you have a good CR rogue.</div></div><hr />

Yah, I know.  I've spend my entire guild existence helping everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i helped on so may frikken epic raids for everyone else that I had lost count. Then I said ok, this has got to be a two way street.<br />
<br />
So, when I got told &quot; Epic raid for insert random class here, can you slow, I just said nope. When asked why I said well, I have attended the last 63 epic raids for 63 other people, and so far I have had nada, zip, zilch, zero help with mine....go figure. <br />
<br />
Funnily enough, I got a shaman epic raid pdq after that. I help my guildies again now, and will continue to do so until I want to do another epic piece heh heh heh.</div></div><hr />
