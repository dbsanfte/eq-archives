<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Njaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">YES!  There is a life outside of EQ!<br />
<br />
I'm Njaal Stormhammer a majority of the day ... but when I'm not, I'm Mark, an overworked underpaid overstressed husband, father, student, and worker.  I live in Sandy Eggo, CA with my wife and daughter, work 40 hours a week in a warehouse, and go to school for 8 hours a week on saturdays so I can get my EMT Basic certification.<br />
<br />
When I'm not logged on, I'm usually watching movies (Sci-Fi/Fantasy, Action, Comedy) or TV (mostly true-life drama such as cops, the various shows on the learning channel, and also the simpsons and jackass), or I'm gaming with friends.  Currently, I'm involved in a long running AD&amp;D campaign (been playing the current game for 6 months and in general for 15 or more years) and about to start a Vampire: The Masquerade game.  I also am an avid Star Wars fan (much to my wife's chagrin), as well as a tabletop war gamer (Warhammer 40k and Mordheim from Games Workshop).<br />
<br />
My wife and I actually get out of the house at least once a week to go hang out with friends at Effin's, a local college bar with a strong irish theme, or go and play miniature golf.  When she can't blast me outta  my computer chair, we usually are reading or I'm writing (short stories and such) while she's devouring another book.  And yes, she plays EQ as well (54 Magician/40 Paladin).  We both love watching football, and while we live in San Diego, we're big Ravens fans.<br />
<br />
Ummmmmm, I'm not sure if this is what this thread is all about ... but yes!  People do walk away from the game from time to time!<br />
<br />
Here are some cool San Diego links that I love:<br />

http://www.101kgb.com/main.html  (local classic rock station ... the morning show RULES imho)<br />
<br />
http://4thandb.com/ (bar downtown with live shows and quality drinks)<br />

Thanks for reading my prattle!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My EQ personalities are Mohawk Timberwolf, Canabull Godsmack, and Bullzie, my Druid, Shaman, and Ranger, respectively.<br />

IRL I'm a college student from eastern KY, so close that I commute to a WV school.  I worked in a coal mine for a couple of years after failing out of college (recently diagnosed with ADD), and finally am about to get my life in gear.  I'm overweight, a savant at math, a former football player, and a hell of a big brother.</div></div><hr />
