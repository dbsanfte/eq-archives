<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you use a charmed pet to tank for you....you and he kills a mob...he's at (insert percentage here) health...and then you kill your charmed pet...do you get experience for him?<br />
<br />
And yes, this sounds to noob to be true lol....but wouldnt that be a fast, and easy way to get xp?<br />
<br />
Course, Im almost positive I screwed up this assumption somewhere :)<br />
<br />
tanks!~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A charmed Pet does not get Expierence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You would get experince for killing your pet after charm broke</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">but its not efficient<br />
90% of the time charm will break before the 1st mob is dead, cause our charms suck.<br />
then you have 2 mobs on you, and both are angry..<br />
<br />
however my friend powered through some lvls by charming (he's a chanter) the giants by kael ent in EW, snared them with druid (his 2nd account) and rampaging through the zone.<br />
<br />
He raked in exp fast cause they are so over powered...<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway I tried the charm thing , and I feel our charms just suck to much to be good...<br />
<br />
However I once saw a monk, like lvl 16, solo'ing dw crocs in oasis, and KS&quot;ing people (uber twink) just cause he could...<br />
<br />
charm'd a dw croc, buffed the crap out of it, zoned real quick and ran back, of course the monk was fighting it, and couldn't figure out *** was wrong, and why his jboots couldn't outrun it :)<br />
<br />
May be mean, but he was a dick so I don't care.</div></div><hr />
