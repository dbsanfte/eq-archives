<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
   Ive been a lurker here since i've been back to EQ (a month or so now) and have found alot of information here. <br />
<br />
I am a lvl 31 ogre shaman and I am looking forward to starting on my epic quests soon. My only question is if there is a level requirement on starting the epic quests? I am familiar with doing the them, I'm just wondering if I will mess something up (factions?) starting them too early? Or if the npc's will give me the quests at all...<br />
<br />
Before I quit EQ (about a year ago) I had a level 53 ogre shaman that I sold when i decided to leave EQ for DAoC (mistake). I'm pretty confident with my playing skills and have a decent set of gear for my level so Im not so interested on whether it is dangerous, just wondering what the hard level limit is, if there is one.   <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No limit to start it.  I started it at level 26, and had my Black Fur boots by 32.  Got progressively slower since then, and I've not even finished it yet at 55.  If you get the people to kill the mobs for you (and you just loot), you can have it done by like level 3 or so (from the XP gained upon hand-ins), as long as you do a little faction farming, but don't say that around here...people get touchy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just what i wanted to hear :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick reply.  <br />
<br />
/em waddles off to start epic...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A necro, wiz, warrior . . . heck a lot of classes can solo the Dire wolf.  Make a friend or bribe someone to help you with it.  It's way easy when done right by a high level person.  <br />
And insta-sow boots are invaluable at low levels . . . just very very nice.  Quest came out when I was 47, I got my boots then.  I remember wishing the epic quest was out earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">whoa u can get the boots below 51 ?<br />
<br />
I thought epic mobs do not accept items or respond to hails from ppl under 51?<br />
<br />
And if i get my boots can i click them at lvl 35?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

As I said, I got 'em at 32, and was clickin' like hell soon as I put 'em in inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">just curious how did u kill the dire wolf?<br />
like how many ppl were with u and what levels were they?<br />
<br />
200 dmg per hit is pretty scary since i only got 1310 life at lvl 35<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, luckily we had a bard in the guild that wanted Mistmoore drums, so the whole lot of us turned up one day to tear Castle Mistmoore a new arse.  While we were there, we killed the Advisor, and on our way out we stopped by Black Dire (who wasn't up when we went in).  The rest of the guild took off, but the group that stayed consisted of a Malo/Torpor 60 Shaman, a 55 Cleric, a 37 Wizard, and me (32 Shaman).  Was very easy, as the other Shaman single pulled BD from his wolves, and the group just beat him down.  He was very resistant to everything I cast, so basically I just sat there till he died, and looted his corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Damn u had quite some muscle with u.<br />
Guess i am gonna have to wait till soem high level ppl get in there and ask for help.<br />
<br />
At what level do the wolves that guard it turn light blue or green so that u can single pull it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>deien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well i made a shammy he is lvl 29 right now =) but i have a 60 bard you think i can get him upto that the boots part with just my bard and maybe a a healer ? or maybe even a 60 war and another shammy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As mentioned above, Dire's hideously resistant to spells and the like, but he thankfully isn't all that resistant to well-made weapons.  A 60 war and a healer are more than enough from what I've seen.<br />
<br />
And I've said it before (and no doubt I'll say it again):  The shaman epic is truly epic; you can start it in your youth and progress throughout your career.<br />
<br />
Sad, that some of the others won't let you start until 51 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slayerfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My Real Life Friend, the Lvl 60 Shadowknight, and a Cleric completely OWNED Dire. I coulda done it Duo, if I had a better heal, like the 58 Shaman Heal, but the Boots are always in my inventory. Also nice for those Pesky dispell mobs.</div></div><hr />
