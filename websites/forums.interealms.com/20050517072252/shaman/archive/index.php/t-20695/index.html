<br />
After having played a lot of Natural Selection(halflife mod) and went through WC3 again and got WC:tFT, Everquest just doesn't seem like as good a game.  The whole lack of plot or real (human) competition has made the endless grinding and such seem kind of pointless.  I'm gonna miss my guild a lot, but when I have to play a game that makes me fall asleep or wish I was doing *anything* else, I can't really enjoy their company as much as I used to.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info and laughs.  Have fun in EQ or whatever, see you on WoW message boards.   :p</div></div><hr />

Open beta and gold version may be far but wow is the only real Promising game. Lineage 2 went to ****. i say no to non consentual PVP. Gettign killed by level 10's when u are level 1 sucks :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know alot of people will disagree with me but personally I can't wait for EQ2 to come out. EQ2 is going to be so far ahead of other MMORPG's it's not funny. Especially with the latest feature they have released: Voice Integration. Check out this video:<br />

I think NOT good sir.  I don't understand what's the big deal about voices on NPCs.even if they do manage to implement this... instead of it becoming a feature for &quot;later expansions&quot; a little bit of window dressing isn't going to make the game any better if the play is crappy or classes unbalanced.<br />
<br />
as for the 3D rendering on the character models... how is it that even the crappiest playstation games manage to have nice graphics when EQ2, horizons etc look like they're been created by art school students just learning to use 3d toolsets</div></div><hr />
