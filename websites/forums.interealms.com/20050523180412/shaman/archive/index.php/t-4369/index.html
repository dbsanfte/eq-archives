<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seczar Panebringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to know everyone thoughts on Hitpoints versus Wisdom.  I personally know that Hitpoints are more important overall than wisdom.<br />
<br />
Given the fact that Shaman can convert Hitpoints into mana at any time and that having more Hitpoints means more cannibalizing and therefore better mana effeciency for Complete Heals (from a cleric) and what not.<br />
<br />
I have a few dissenters in my guild that would probably believe it more if they heard it from a well established community like the Crucible readers.<br />

I wish they would just keep the classes's roles distinct. The previous big patch we got a 10% boost to our heals, and now they've gone and given us Complete Heal. Next time I log in my Shaman I bet I'll see a Feign Death button.</div></div><hr />

Care to explain to my WHY you would go str/dex at all?  Why would those 2 stats sway your decision from 1 piece of equip to another?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's a balance that's important.  Personally, I get the best AC on a slot that I can find that has some wisdom, mana and hps on it.   Certain things are so great in the AC/Hp department that you forgo the wisdom requirement (ie; Vindi BP).   I aim for a balance of around 1000ac, 200wisdom and as much hps and mana I can get on the items I wear.<br />
<br />
AC is very important for the soloing or debuffing Shaman on a raid as you're going to get hit.  Probalby alot.  AC will help you take less damage, and not dying is always good.  Taking less damage means you have more HPs left to convert to mana and less of your cleric's mana you'll use up.<br />
<br />
Once you get the Canibalization alt ability HPs becomes KING due to the massive chunk of your life you're going to use up in one go.  Again, AC is still good to keep those HPs.<br />
<br />
Wisdom and mana become less important due to how fast you can recover the core of your mana pool.  Every 69 seconds you'll be able to get a net gain of 800 mana via Cani5 and Torpor.<br />
<br />
And btw, we dont' get Complete Heal. :)<br />
<br />
At the lower level game, get good ac and wisdom items if you can and items with some hps and mana on it as well if you can get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">and now they've gone and given us Complete Heal<br />
<br />
I think he is just implying that it will be more efficient for the Cleric to cast CH on the Shaman if the Shaman has more HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Depends on where you are in your shamanly career.<br />
<br />
Prior to 60-with-torpor, your most important gear stat is regeneration.  Period.  AC, HP, Wisdom, yadda yadda yadda... all of that is secondary.  With nothing but a fungi tunic I could solo all day long... it's all about regen.  That's why in all of the &quot;Starting a new shaman- what to buy?&quot; threads- the answer inevitably includes an Iksar BP, Fungi staff, or Fungi tunic.  Mana regen and HP regen are similar for us, since we can convert one into the other anyway- it's just the HP regen items are cheaper.  :)<br />
<br />
Think of focus effects as a minor form of mana regen.  My crystalline torque reduces the mana cost of every spell I cast by 10%- it's like getting that mana back as soon as I finish casting the spell.<br />
<br />
I'd say the second most important attribute to look for in gear is mana free damage.  The JBB lives up to the hype.  I'm hoping the epic (or as I like to call it-  &quot;that piece of gear with nice stats I got through a lot of faction work&quot; (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1333&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=3), once I get it... that is, /wave Glori) does, too.<br />
<br />
For the low levels, when you'll be tanking most of your mobs anyway, the next most important stats are haste and a nice weapon (this is your mana-free damage at low levels.)  This remains empowering until well into the 30s, and definitely doesn't hurt even after that.<br />
<br />
If you're post-60 with torpor and on the AA grind, HP becomes your most important attribute, but mostly because it enables Cann5, which is mana regen.  <br />
<br />
The whole AC/WIS/HP/Resists debate is a lot more incremental and, for the most part, situational.  If you're a solo tanking shaman, extreme AC/HP is probably the way to go.  If you're a raid shaman that rarely gets aggro (3rd on a raid or something), resists are probably more important.  The general philosophy is that it's good to be able to take a hit, and that since one of our defining characteristics is out ability to quickly regenerate mana, the size of our mana pool (Wisdom) isn't that important.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In response to your question I recently switched to alot of HP/Sta gear in preparation for someday getting Canni 5.  I am down to 140 Wis and I don't have much of a problem with the smaller mana pool.  My only concern is that when raiding the smaller mana pool means more of a chance of going OOM on Turgur's resists.  Having to canni down to cast another slow could be deadly.<br />

That's one of the nice things about the shaman class. You can still be a very successful shaman no matter what you put your points into. My base wis is 79 and I turned out ok!<br />

<br />
HP are irrelevant for a shaman's mana regeneration until they are L 60 with the Canni 5 AA. Before then, more HP does NOT equal more mana. At least, not in anything approaching an efficient manner. If you need 100 extra mana fast, it's a hell of a lot easier to have 100 extra mana from your wis/mana gear, than it is to have 200 extra hp and cannibalize a few times to turn that hp into the mana you needed 10 seconds ago (by the time you get it). <br />
<br />
HP's ARE good to help you survive aggro from failed slows, and tanking tougher mobs when solo'ing. No question, they're useful. But, before Can 5 and torpor they don't do anything for mana regen. Once you have Can 5 a large HP pool to let you use it without low hp aggro or risking dying is clearly useful. <br />
<br />
What DOES matter for mana regen? <br />
<br />
Flowing thought (obviously). <br />
<br />
HP regeneration - this affects how much you can cannibalize over time, and thus mana regeneration rate.  Your total hp don't affect that at all. Clerics will very very rarely CH a shaman unless he's L 60 with tons of great hp gear (if even then), as Celestial healing/elixir will be more efficient at most levels, especially if you're not wanting the shaman to canni down to 5% hp due to potential aggro. <br />
<br />
Armor Class - high AC means you take less damage when you do get hit, which means you can put more of your natural (and item/spell) regeneration into cannibalized mana. High ac actually helps your mana regen more than high hp, at least before Canni 5. <br />
<br />
Kriel<br />
<br />
P.S. Nowhere in there did I say that 200 wisdom is critical for a shaman, or that you should max your mana pool at the expense of AC or HP.  I just said that HP don't do everything that is sometimes claimed around here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Kriel, didn't know you posted on this board.<br />
<br />
I agree.  HP regeneration seems to be the most important factor.  I'm not sure why some cut off that factor at 60 with Torpor because Torpor is still HP regeneration, just much faster.<br />
<br />
Keep your AC as high as you can (keeps you from losing hps), keep your regen as high as possible and don't worry about Wisdom too much.  Wisdom, at least for me, was one of those stats that took care of itself.</div></div><hr />

Preach it, brother.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I know that a lot of shaman claim regen is king - while I never had a fungy to try it I personally am more comfy with a lot of AC.  I <br />
have more HP in &quot;less damage&quot; with a high AC BP then I can regain with that extra 5/15 regen per tick.  I think only if you are a root/rot specialist that never gets hit a fungi would be advantageous over a JB/SS/Vindi Bp.  Son, unless you can wear a fungi AND keep 1000 AC you might want to look for a more durable BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't have a Fungi and I try to have a lot of AC.  I slow a lot, get rezzed a lot.<br />
<br />
Try playing your shaman without regen (no bearform, regrowth, iksar BP, whatever).  It's no fun.  You'll have to sit a lot.  If we didn't have things like cannibalize and regen, I'd pretty much be looking for FT items I think.  AC is nice but regen/canni is what makes my shaman fun.  Also, when I do get hit, I can regen it back a lot quicker.<br />
<br />
Think back to your shaman before 24.<br />

For most of those levels, I found myself in the minority of shamans who decided to go with as much wisdom as possible.  Now, I'm all about some balance.  Without greater bearform and wis buffs, I sit at 209 wis and 807ac.  (putting up laughter shield here)  Slowly, yet surely, I'm going to raise that ac on up and just test for myself, for that is truely the only way to really find the answer that best fits my playing style.  The Crucible has been an invaluable asset to the shaman community, and is a great motivator to try new gear combinations.  <br />

 <br />
<br />
I beg to differ there.  I do not have Cann5, and don't anticipate it in the very near future (too much raiding, shards bah etc) and HP certainly means quite a bit for me.  I can cann more and more safely than you will.  How do you think people got along prior to cann5? :D  AC is meaningless after a point, I can go in with 1100 or 1300 ac in a boss mob run and still die at either one.  Although same could be said with HP there as well.  Hp doesn't have a threshhold of where it starts having less impact though ;p<br />
<br />
Wisdom and FT sorta come hand in hand now, so I don't really see any point to argue there.  AC is just a nice side benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">&quot;HP are irrelevant for a shaman's mana regeneration&quot;<br />
<br />
Rephrase that to &quot;HP are not significant for a shaman's long-term mana regeneration&quot; and you're fine.<br />
<br />
Extra wisdom will give you a larger mana pool, which generally makes a significant difference only in situations where you're pushing your limits.  Same thing with HP.  In the short term (during a fight) you have a little more HP or mana to burn- in the long term, your regeneration rate (and thus your ability to give and take damage) is the same.  Yes, CH efficiencies can come into play here... but if you're on a CH rotation you've got much bigger problems than the most stat goals.<br />
<br />
Generally (it's the use of the absolute term &quot;irrelevant&quot; that caused the problem here) extra HP and extra Wisdom don't matter a whole lot, since you're not getting close to the limits anyway.  Cann5 changes this because it puts many people close to their HP limits.  Generally, if you're this routinely close to the limits, you're either supremely efficient, or not very efficient at all- and you get an exemption (feel free to concentrate on hardcore stat tweaking.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You need Canni5 to completely appreciate a high HP total as anything but an extra buffer between you and your prey.  Don't get me wrong, hps are definitely nice and WILL help you at any level.  However going all out hps before you have canni5 will make you less of a shaman than you otherwise could be.   <br />
<br />
Wisdom is necessary for keeping fizzles down.  I think this effect stops at 150 or 160 wisdom.  If you have less than that as a working wisdom, you'll get frequent fizzles.  With all the gear out there to choose from these days, you should have no trouble getting 160wis and 850 AC at level 51.  If you are a man/woman of means, I'd expect to see a 200wis/1000 AC total by then.  After that point start thinking about hp upgrades, since more of either wis or AC isn't going to make as big a difference as HPs will make.</div></div><hr />

There is a ton of easy to get gear out there that gives hitpoints, wisdom and AC.  My guild recently renamed ourselves to the Bixie Company as a statement of how unuber we are.  See my Magelo in the sig.  ALL of that gear was either bought, or gotten with two groups or less.</div></div><hr />
