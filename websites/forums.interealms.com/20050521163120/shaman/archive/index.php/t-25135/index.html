<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I've got all my 66-68 runes from soloing in NC pretty fast, but I still have all my 69 and all my 70 par Blood of Yoppa left to get.<br />
<br />
Has anyone found a soloable named that has a chance of dropping 69/70 runes?<br />
<br />
I attempted Ornia the Foul in RCoD and managed to get her to 50% HP. However after she'd used all her mana she began sumoning more often, approx. every 4-5 secs so i was unable to run oor and cast spells inbetween.<br />
<br />
Her DPS was too much for BoT to keep my HP up if i tanked in teh face soi found myself running oom chaining yoppa's mending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The trick to soloing nameds in RCoD is to kill them as fast as you can.  I try to keep 4 dots on them until they are dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">was using wunshi, bane, yoppa, epic here. Will stick on saryrn and chain spear next time.<br />
<br />
Then again you have about 1.6k more unbuffed HP than me :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here is how you win:<br />
<br />
- Root with Petrifying Earth<br />
- Cast Malos<br />
- Cast Slow<br />
- Cast Malosinia<br />
- Cast Crippling Spasm(Cripple)<br />
- Cast Putrid Decay<br />
<br />
Get FM<br />
<br />
- Re-root with Petrifying Earth<br />
- Mem Breath of Wunshi, Breath of Ultor<br />
- Cast Breath of Ultor, Breath of Wunshi in that order<br />
- Immediately cast Spirit Call(not Advanced Spirit Call!)<br />
- Mem Blood of Yoppa(if you have), Blood of Saryrn, Curse of Sisslak(if you have), Bane, Anathema(if you do not have Sisslak<br />
- Cast as many as you can before the pets die<br />
- Cast your best HoT on you when only 2 of the pets are left and be ready to get summoned<br />
- Reapply all DoTs as they drop<br />
- Keep the HoT up on you, if you can add epic or Ancestral Aid even better<br />
The mob will be dead in no time.<br />
<br />
This is for people who are a little undergeared and can't or don't want to tank for long.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've killed Ornia the Foul about a dozen times have yet to see a 69/70 rune.   One thing about killing her is that you need to do it very fast from the initial pull.  She is a caster and will spend a lot of time casting spells.  During this time her melee is pathetic (ranger tanking her w/ no healing needed beyond regen).  When she goes OOM then her melee dps really goes up.  I would pull w/ Malos and do sinia asap.  From there, start laying on the dots because she will move to you but stay out of melee range while casting some spells.  When she does her pet, root/slow it.  I would save pet swarms until after she starts getting low on mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mikshal, I can't seem to PM you the info :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have never killed Ornia the Foul, what I posted is how you kill any of the other nameds(who do not cast like Ornia, but just melee from the start) and taking as little damage as possible.<br />
<br />
I can see how you'd have to kill Ornia fast, if she acts as described above, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahh.  Your correct then.  Many times i'll malos and cast root w/ my ranger almost immediatly on the dragorn laborer just so I can debuff, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mikshal, I can't seem to PM you the info :/<br />
uh was not enable, it works now.<br />
Thx for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">FYI Ornia doesn't drop any runes, dunno why you're camping her unless its for the no drop arms item for OOW armour. Labourer and Stonesmasher are the only ones that drop greater and glowing with any regularity i.e. 1 in 20 kills</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Does Labourer also summon fairly quick, meaning you must always 'tank in teh face' ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Does Labourer also summon fairly quick, meaning you must always 'tank in teh face' ?<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Use the &quot;tactic&quot; I posted. Stacking the DoTs before hand will make it easier and you will have to tank in the face for less time. Since he's rooted he can't summon you with the dog swarm in melee range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because I can single ull here to Laborer spawn and she drops loot that fetches a decent amount in the bazaar.  If your there, why not pull her.</div></div><hr />
