<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anyone had experienced the shenannigans of Beefcleaver on CT recently?<br />
<br />
Last night he was in PoN training everybody for hours. He was losing levels fast, but basically the entire zone had to empty out. Apparently he'd been at it for a couple of days in other zones, but last night it got to the point where every Planbe zone was on fire with chat about him. There were no GMs on for hours, and by the time one did show up he logged.<br />
<br />
One person brought Nightmare to a standstill, and was about to move into Disease  before the GM showed up.<br />
<br />
Any else on CT there for this mess? Any thoughts? Any way to stop it barring having a quicker response to damned petitions?<br />
<br />
The worst thing is, I kinda know him. He always made me laugh, and was a much liked player up until recent events. People were wondering if his account had been hacked or a pissed off spouse had decided to reclaim the marriage.<br />
<br />
Very disappointing to see a once friendly char suddenly go schizo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We have a guy like that on Drinal too (Lanirab), although he manages to stay at 65. The stories of him training Velketor to the zone in velks pre-pop are legendary and he apparently takes pride in causing as much disturbance as possible to any zone he enters. I (and many many others) avoid BoT after a certain time after he has gained entry. <br />
There is no doubt that he has a certain amount of skill, but he is proof that you can be a good or even excellent player and qualify for the &quot;should have been a stain on the sheets&quot;-award.<br />
<br />
There's really nothing you can do about it with the level of costumer service these days, so I just pack up and go to Tactics, CoD, do some questing, or log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Every server has at least 1 griefer like this.   Generally a guy with a decent amount of skill and knowledge about EQ.   Generally the type of guy who had his lunch money stolen in school and vowed he'd have vengence on the world some day.  Generally they play Druids :)  On Torvonnilous we had 2, whom have both retired and moved on.  They were a pair of Druids named Axem and Swiller.  Axem was one of the first people in our Server to get a 9th Coldain ring, and did so at the expense of repeatedly training all the Giant Fort mobs in East Wastes all over the place killing everyone around until he found a way to beat the encounter.   He never got a 10th Ring, because, big shocker.. he had no Guild and not enough friends to help him.<br />
