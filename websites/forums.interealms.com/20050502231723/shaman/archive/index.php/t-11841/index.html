<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there is a huge difference in BoT at 1100 compared to 1300AC. <br />
<br />
At 1358AC I can easily tank mez 2 adds in a BoT group with just Quiesence on me ...... at around 1100AC, I can only handle 1 with Quiesence <br />
<br />
Never parsed, don't know if I am unlucky with only being able to do 1 consistently at 1100 AC, or whether its AC, CA or LR making a difference.<br />
<br />
after read that AC/HP thread and see Tekno post AC can make huge difference(almost tank 2x better with +200ac ?) I do some parse today to see if AC is that good<br />
<br />
parse is base on A stormrider(melee one, not nuker), and I tanking same stormrider for both parse, Parse A is fully buffed and equiped; after Parse A is done, I rooted stormrider and back off, then take off 6 piece of my gear to make it 1002ac then enter fight again for parse B, here is parse result :<br />
<br />
<br />
Parse A : 1288ac, 280agi<br />
Time = 0:21:31<br />
total damage  = 67,437<br />
dps = 52.24dps<br />
total hit = 321<br />
hit  = 205<br />
miss = 116<br />
hit% = 63.9%<br />
max hit = 555<br />
min hit = 142<br />
average hit = 329<br />
<br />
Parse B  : = 1002ac, 280 agi <br />
time = 00:21:31<br />
total damage = 70,423<br />
dps = 54.55<br />
total hit = 328<br />
hit = 235<br />
miss = 93<br />
hit% = 71%<br />
max hit = 555<br />
min hit = 142<br />
average hit = 300<br />
<br />
<br />
yes, this parse is small, it is boring to tanking it for almost 1 hour :( , and I didn't notice much difference after drop 286ac , if you have time and bore and want better parse, try tank same mob for longer period<br />
<br />
the result show mob hit me extra 2.3dps or 4% of total damage if I drop 286ac, below is log if you want parse yourself</div></div><hr />

<br />
That he would be missed more. I'm 99% sure Lightning Reflexes grants an across-the-board improved chance to be missed, regardless of AC. It's almost like an innate dodge. It wouldn't skew the test results, he'd just have a higher number of misses than a shaman without it.<br />
<br />
Let's just say that your conclusions that AC is completely meaningless in PoP are a little . . . questionable.  It may be true, but how do you answer my questions?<br />
<br />
Even for a skeptical view that sounds like a pretty harsh return on his parsing. No need to be mean :) The post referred to said he had better results around 1350 AC, so I'd say the parse shows the &quot;soft cap&quot; for AC in PoP is well above 1200. It would be interesting to see higher levels of AC (&lt;1300) parsed in a similar manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still don't know how how added over 280 AC to his total from buffs alone.  That was my major question.<br />
I can't see him being able to add more than about 120-130 AC from buffs.  Which would put his AC at around 1130, not 1288.  The only explanation I can give is that he's not updated his magelo since winning about 7 or 8 pieces of VT/elemental quality loot.  Which seems unlikely, given that he has updated his magelo recently enough to have noted LR5, Spiritcall1, and RC1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are currently some bugs in magelo that do not correctly calculate AC, I think it's mentioned in their forums.  That may be where the discrepancy lies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hey Landragoran, my currently magelo only show my best HP combo, with my back up AC gear(Vindi boot, Iron scroll, kael helm arm etc), I can get about 1130ac unbuffed, it become 1288AC with buffed(Virtue, BSS, CoR,SoS epic haste) <br />
<br />
<br />
I tank with 1288ac for first parse, then rooted mob, back off and bag my helm,leg,boot,range,arm,bracer(to make it just above 1000ac) for 2nd parse <br />
<br />
hope you understand how I make that 286ac difference between 2 parse<br />
<br />
check my Magelo, I made a alt profile about my best ac set up from banked gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">since Stormrider is alway lvl61, so if you have higher AC with same AA as mine(CA3, LR5), then you can try parse on melee stormrider to compare my result<br />
<br />
there are 2 type of stormrider, one is melee and other is caster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am a n00b in the ac mitigation crap. But heard there is maybe an ac soft cap o 1200 or so for casters.<br />
<br />
Anyway i think it depends on ATK of the mob. The higher it is, the higher are the chance it hits for max damage, and you cant mitigate max melee damage. (CS3, ID5 useless when mob hit for max).<br />
<br />
As a quick conclusion and intuition, on normal exp mob, i would say 1200 ac around is a sort of soft cap. Getting higher AC allows you to mitigate better high ATK mobs, and maybe PoP named. In some sort it make CS / ID more usefull on high end encounters, as well as our &quot;natural&quot; ability to mitigate damage. Btw you get hit for max nearly everytime you are naked, so yes CS / ID dont help if your ac suck.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">nice to see somone put some numbers up.<br />
<br />
I know nothing about high lvel EQ today, but in my time, kunark and below, mega high AC was no better then medium high.<br />
<br />
<br />
People just get it in to their heads about something, they &quot;feel&quot; it is better, spread the word, and boom, it is truth.<br />
<br />
Just like warriors and strength, doesnt really matter much between ultra high and medium high.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is why I fall of my chair laughing seeing an AC shaman at level 30, running out of mana constantly, trying to play tank, and generally being a bad shaman. Doesnt matter when a person is twinked out of his hairy butt, but a real, start from scratch grouping shaman is better off maximizing mana and hps before worrying about AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Moot point in high level now, anyone with less then 5000 hps, 3000 ac, 800 wisdom is considered a newb I hear. Haha.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There's gotta be a soft cap on ac.  My guess is that it's some where between 800 and 1000 and hasn't been updated since Kunark.  That would explain the diminishing returns you get from 1000 to 1300 shown in Shamam's parses.</div></div><hr />

Experience tells me that even with a larger sample size there is not going to be anything more than a marginal difference in damage taken vs PoP mobs.</div></div><hr />

Would be interesting to see the same test in Old worlds, SoL and PoP. Also need to test a few mobs, as some of them definately have better atk than others. Testing on the Steelwarrior.org show a good relationship between mitigation of damage, and the difference between mob atk and player ac.<br />

I completely agree. I'm a mage that switched over to a shammy. The mage boards parse EVERYTHING (they have to, cause of all the bugs with the pets the VI/SOE never admitted to till we proved it)<br />
<br />
Its REALLY nice to see shammys start to do this. I'm thinking of doing a round of parsings this weekend with my gimp 923 ac self buffed :P<br />
<br />
Anyways, to summarize. Yes damage mitigated for a certain AC matters on the attackers ATK. However, the question is if you have a VERY high ATK, at what point does a shammies AC hit a softcap and there is verry little, if no returns above that?<br />
<br />
Based on the gut feeling of this post, and of the board in general, i think the AC is lower than most people think. Maybe in the 1k range. I think its a holdover from the Kurnark era.<br />
<br />
As with al lthe problems mages had, vi/SOE will not address it (And in the mages case was not even AWARE of it) until you do a ton of parses, have real proof, then start bitching like madmen.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for doing this parse. :)<br />
I know this is a very small sampling, and that the dataset isn't perfect in the first place, but I noticed one or two things that were definitive enough for me to make a judgement for my own personal gear choices.<br />
<br />
At 1288 AC you took just over 67k in damage in 21 minutes.<br />
At 1002 AC you took just over 70k in damage in 21 minutes.<br />
<br />
Okay, now I figure that's a fairly good damage average for A Stormrider.  So now let's break it down to an average exp fight for a single group by using 10% of the above numbers...<br />
<br />
At 1288 AC you would likely take 6.7k in damage over ~2.1 minutes.<br />
At 1002 AC you would likely take 7k in damage over ~2.1 minutes.<br />
<br />
So if an average fight against A Stormrider (melee version) had the shaman tanking the entire time, and the mob dies w/in 2.1 minutes, the difference between the 1002 AC &amp; 1288 AC is going to average around 300points (plus or minus a few hits of course, which w/ their damage could be ~1k easily, so the &quot;average&quot; will suffer from greater deviation.) or so.  (Obviously, I wouldn't be able to kill a Stormrider in that period of time on my own, but in a single group setting I think that's a fair time.)<br />
<br />
Considering that it isn't likely that I personally will be tanking A Stormrider for an entire fight in most cases, this is significant to me.  It shows me (and opinions will vary widely I'm sure) that if I invest in a huge amount of AC gear (to get to 1288+), I'm PROBABLY only going to see a 5% decrease in my total damage taken, an average of a few extra misses on me by the mob, and a 5-10% decrease in my damage taken per hit.<br />
<br />
Since I'm NOT going to be a MA in most cases, and my tanking will be short duration (resulting in my death or the MA retaking the aggro), I don't see AC anywhere near as critical as I once did beyond 1k.  When I am soloing and tanking &quot;in teh face&quot;, I don't see bonuses given by a ~150 improvement in AC (since I'm around 1130-1150 buffed I think) important enough to sacrifice any HP over, since the difference is merely overcome by one tick of Torpor on an average fight.<br />
<br />
I've been a proponent for HP&gt;AC&gt;Wis for some time now, but this definitely seals the deal for me.  My AC is decent enough now (somewhere over 1k unbuffed, definitely not above 1100) as is that I don't need to worry about improving it unless the upgrade comes with a concomitant improvement in my total HP.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for sharing!<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I must say that Frekkels opinion sounds reasoned.<br />
<br />
One thing to consider, and has been noted by the plate classes,  is that the attack rating of the mob has a large impact on the ability of AC to mitigate.  <br />
<br />
If the attack rating is very low then adding more AC does no significant good, and the same if the attack rating is very high.<br />
<br />
I would expect the effectiveness of 200 ac to very quite a bit depending on the attack rating of the mob being tanked.<br />
<br />
I also find it quite interesting that much of the new items coming out of PoP have great stats and hp but a fairly small amount of AC.  When combined with the high attack ratings of the mobs in PoP and the high damage output,  It seams clear to me that SOE is pushing for a migration from AC to HP.  Consider also that cleric CH has been limited to a maximum number of HP and this functions as a soft cap on the efficency of using HP.  This will make it easeir for SOE to design encouters that stay balanced for a long time because the equipment of the particpants does not matter much after a certain point.   A main tank with 20k hp is no more effective then one at 10k hp when ac no longer has an impact on mitigation and cleric CH is capped.  They both die at about the same time when the healers run out of mana.<br />
<br />
In would expect a very similar parse of pre PoP mobs to give a different result.  I think SOE changed methods in PoP in an organized maner to correct problems that showed up in previos expansions.  It may take significantly longer time for PoP encounters to become trivial in comparison to those in the past.<br />
<br />
Unlike Millman,  I still think high ac is a great way to go for a shaman into the lower 50s or so.  A large HP pool has much more to do about safty then efficency just like a large mana pool, and more AC yealds significant gains in damage mitigation pre-PoP.  Each time a young shaman asks for equipment help,  I would hope the Profits of the crucible would keep in mind that hp only becomes king late in the game and structure their advice to help the young shaman.  All to often I just see advise that is based on a rather rarified view point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This is good stuff, but it's possible that some PoP mobs are fine tuned to disregard ac (sort of a reverse mitigation).<br />
<br />
I know with my ranger, that against high level mobs (57+) ac doesn't seem to help all that much, but when I farm light blues or greens there is a BIG difference in how they hit me.  Often they hit but don't won't do any damage, if I am naked I will take damage.<br />
<br />
I'd try the same tactic against a level 52 or so mob.  The Centis in Maidens Eye would be a good example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd be very interested in seeing how many times you got stunned by a bash or kick with the higher AC setup in comparison to the lower AC setup.<br />
<br />
Any chance you could post that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Interesting test. Too short to prove anything by it's self but still interesting.<br />
<br />
Looking at your parses you took about 4% less damage, missed about 7% more and 10% less per hit on average. Maybe not as much as you would hope for from that large an ac change but it is large enough that it maybe an indication of a definite benifit for the higher ac. Part of the reason that it might be a small difference is that some of that ac may below the min ac to have any significant effect.<br />
<br />
People have long beleive that there is a so called soft cap, or a point where adding more ac doesn't add any significant benifit. I've always beleived that was true on the low end too. That at some point your ac is so low that decreasing it further doesn't have any significant difference either. The result is what you could call an ac sweet spot where you do get a noticable change from increasing your ac but too far above or below that point and it's not gonna matter much.<br />
<br />
For example if you redid the test again at 800 ac I would expect the results to be pretty simular the 1000ac tests. I'd also suspect that if you tried 1100 ac you might find it pretty simular too but going up to 1400ac for example might provide a noticible benifit.<br />
<br />
I might have to see what I can get my ac upto with ac gear and buffs and see about testing something in the closer to 1400ac range altho my results won't match since I don't have LR5 yet, still at CA2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I know nothing about high lvel EQ today, but in my time, kunark and below, mega high AC was no better then medium high.<br />
<br />
Actually Mill I think the opposite... back in Kunark days the AC vs Wis debate was in full swing and the difference between a lets say 900 or 1000 which I remember being pretty high (not uber but high) and 700 or 800 (wis gear wearers were even a bit below this) in dmg taken was HUGE and easily visible.<br />
<br />
Chalk it up to mudflation I say.  Some would argue that using buffs makes the difference and if he had used &quot;hard AC&quot; it might have shown difference or something... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">This is good info. It is a little short to give totally accurate info, I think I may try this too. But what I think is really interesting is the percentage of attacks that missed between the parses. There is a 7% difference with the higher AC. That was 10% of the actual hits. That's big. I think because the test was so short those numbers weren't really indicative. In a longer test though, dodging 10% more hits would be a huge difference. Very interesting info, thanks for posting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">is that the attack rating of the mob has a large impact on the ability of AC to mitigate. <br />
<br />
<br />
Let me simplify that. For tank classes, the &quot;softcap&quot; is the mob's attack for anything after kunark. If mobX has an attack of 1300, the softcap for plate classes is just above that(1350 for example, it does seem to go up in hops of 50). If mobY has an attack of 1400, 1450ish would be the point of diminishing returns.<br />
<br />
Do *NOT* try to figure priest or caster soft caps the same way. That'd just be silly, given the caps for defensive skills, etc. <br />
<br />
When you take in the big picture of shaman ac softcaps, you have to understand that we won't be tanking THAT big of mobs(IE we're not gonna MT the AoW, even though I'm sure it could be done with the right shammy) for any length of time. In other words, there's no use trying to get 1400ac for say Statue, because the only time we're gonna be getting hit is if we have aggro from slow. Given that, and the fact that normal experience mobs have lower attack(thus lower softcaps), it makes more sense to choose better  insurance against sporadic damage(hitpoints) than constant damage(ac).<br />
<br />
That is, basically, why I believe a good target to work towards is 1k unbuffed ac and then go all out for hp.<br />
<br />
--edit--<br />
I forgot to add that another good reason for choosing HP&gt;AC is AE damage, which occurs much more often these days than say a year or two ago.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, the parse (though short) does seem to show conclusively that you would only see a significant benefit from having higher AC if:<br />
<br />
a) you were tanking the entire fight, every fight<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
b) you were tanking one mob specifically to see how much your AC really benefits you<br />
<br />
In practical terms, you will *never* see the benefit.  When you are in an experience group, something is seriously wrong if you have agro for any extended period of time.  You COULD have a fairly effective group (such as 2 rogues, 2 monks, a cleric, and yourself with you using one or two poison DoTs to keep agro) but honestly it happens rarely.  In normal experience groups, you will have agro for 3 or 4 hits while the MT attempts to get agro off you.<br />
<br />
It seems like you would be best served by raising your AC to a reasonable level (say, 1020 unbuffed) and then focusing your gear choices on HP gear.  <br />
<br />
I have never really bought into the HP &gt; AC &gt; WIS or AC &gt; HP &gt; WIS or WIS &gt; ALL or CHA &gt; INT arguments since they all imply a lack of balance.  Ultimately, I think a balanced shaman is the strongest shaman.  Reasonable high HP, AC, AND WIS seems a reasonable course of action.  Raise them all as high as you can without making any of them suffer unduly and you will be a strong shaman.  <br />
<br />
Thats just my opinion.  Let the flaming commence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I seem to recall a post by Furor saying that he noticed an effect around the 1800ac mark in higher tier PoP, as a tank.  If you consider the many arguments that the effectiveness of AC is relative to the mobs ATK, then Furor's statement would seem to indicate that PoP mobs have a fairly high attack rating and that until you start closing in on that you're not likely to see a major benefit to additional ac.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I've had no problems keeping my unbuffed ac over 1000 for quite some time and any extra ac I think of as bonus more than necessity.  I'd not be surprised at all if 1000 and 1300 ac showed very little difference even after extensive testing, but I still aim to keep my ac over 1k at a minimum unbuffed.  <br />
<br />
Is a 10ac gain worth losing 50hp or a bunch of resists?  IMO, hell no and it never was.  There is no 'god' stat, it's a balancing act.  PoP seems to make resists and hp top priority though.  Boss mobs with neg 100-150 adjusts on their AEs mean you need to hit 350-400+ (buffed) if you want to consistenly succeed the resist check and that seems pretty common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yeah I recall furor mention the same types of things. I looked for the post he made looking at it and parsing it out but couldn't find it.<br />
<br />
I know from my guilds experience there definitely seems to be a noticable effect from ac once you get into the right range. Doing one of the named in PoF that was fairly nasty we noticed a definite benifit from ac. The particular mob ramaged every round and hit for up to 2924 on people like little old me. We had 2 different tanks, one mting the other setup to take the rampage. There was about a 200ac difference between them. The mt, with higer ac, was getting average hits around 1100. The secondary tank was getting average hits around 1600. The added ac made a major difference.<br />
<br />
If you look at alot of high end, elemental planes guilds lvl especially the ones going after the gods, you'll see a large amount of them stack the plate drops on a couple big tanks. Not only to give them the hps but also the ac that elemental armor gives tanks. Having a high ac mt seems to make a world of difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">what was their aa difference? Did they both have the same AA pool put into the same defensive spots?<br />
<br />
IN any case Taraddar, this is not about tank ac, this is about shaman ac. World of difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">what was their aa difference? Did they both have the same AA pool put into the same defensive spots?<br />
<br />
IN any case Taraddar, this is not about tank ac, this is about shaman ac. World of difference.<br />
<br />
Both have maxed defensive aa's.<br />
<br />
The second tanks profile is at http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=581393<br />
<br />
I don't have the other tanks profile off hand since they are in our allies guild and not my own.<br />
<br />
My reason for bringing up tanks is just to point out that our ac might be low enough that we aren't going to see significant benifit from increasing it not because ac isn't significant but because we can't or can't easily get our ac high for it to matter.<br />
<br />
The example I sited is just one of numerous that I've seen in the elemental planes that show me verant has changed things around and ac does matter especially for those that should have the most of it, warriors. No longer is a monk a better tank because he has higher defensive skills and good enough ac.<br />
<br />
I would of corse expect that a god or a mob in the elemental planes would probably have a bit higher attack than your average golem in PoV or giant in BoT so we may not be hopelessly lost there and who's to say we won't have 1900ac after the next expansion comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Hmm, I don't think the conclusions some of you are drawing are correct.  <br />
<br />
The guys on the Steel Warrior have done a pretty good review on this topic.  <br />

<br />
The so-called &quot;AC cap&quot; is merely the relationship between your AC and the mob's attack, sorta.  Thus, depending on the mob, it will vary.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, there clearly is a relationship and the effect of AC does scale up the more AC you get - and it's not trivial in my opinion.  Although not many of us will reach 1800 AC.  <br />
<br />
But it's at least good to have a better understanding of the relationships.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I would really be intrested in seeing the different from pop mobs and &quot;old world&quot; mobs. I think its possible that pop mobs are setup to ignore AC more then the past.<br />

You guys using Eqcompanion ? I might check this out myself. If not what parser you using</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The softcap on ac pre velious was 1100. Velious and after it depends on mob attack values. Attack values on pop mobs are a good deal higher than all earlier exp mobs, so you have a higher softcap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second hand info - a cleric friend of mine tanked the same zone in mob in HoH (max 508, min 115) with 1000ac and 1500ac respectively. He wasnt quite done when I got these numbers, so his final result might differ.<br />
<br />
- 1500ac, 1070 hits (hits, so excluding miss/dodge), avg hit of 294<br />
- 1000ac, 600ish hits, avg hit of 300<br />
<br />
I think these numbers speak for themselves (and no, I dont have the hit/miss/dodge ratio). This was with LR5 but no CS.<br />
<br />
Incidently I had tanked another type of mob in HoH with the same max/min hits with 1298ac earlier for around 770 hits (also without any CS) and gotten an avg dmg of 294 too.</div></div><hr />

I guess thats because chain is better for defense than silk :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, based on everything people have said so far, it would be because int casters generally have ACs well below the 1k point.  If 800+ is diminishing returns or something, and your enchanter has 600 ac, then yeah ac will matter to him.<br />
<br />
Also defense skills and other things might make us better tanks even with identical ACs, though it would be interesting to test that (in the red corner we have the enchanter tank, in this blue we have the shaman; the first fight will last 0.5 seconds ....).</div></div><hr />
