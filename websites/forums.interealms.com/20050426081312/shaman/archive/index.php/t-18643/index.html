I am trying to get Ornate Chein leggings off of Oreen Wavecrasher, so I'd like to put my name in for EK groups/Forge or Tables for a crack at him.<br />
<br />
While I'm waiting for groups any decent place I can solo in boT, and what tactics do you use?<br />
<br />
I heard sand giants are doable? where can I find them?<br />

You can find sand giants in the burned woods, you'll need the snare AA and the lvl 63 pet spell for it tho.<br />
<br />
Gluck!</div></div><hr />

Why are you posting Bst tatics on a Shaman board?<br />
<br />
Here is a good post on some mobs that are soloable by Shaman in BoT Stormriders (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13873)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MekuDeku the burned woods reference is an old timers joke.... used commonly for feeding trolls<br />
<br />
(and no i wasn't calling anyone a troll...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LR5 helps a lot.  Then you can probably solo the bottom level giants in the south and east wings.  It won't be easy since you have to tank em IN TEH FACE, but im sure its a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />

Oh sorry. I forgot all about that Burned Woods story. Carry on. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually it wans't a troll, but a straight out mockery :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i did it many times at the GY killing stormriders,toe to toe.<br />
<br />
there are some who are casters and others are melee.<br />
melee are easy,pull whit malos (or malo) send pet when they are near you ,slow should be about to land on the mob,keep Q or torpor on you.<br />
<br />
for the casters (healer):i pulll whit malos then aa root  or root/then slow...i get back...mob can t  melee you so he will chain cast at you (few damage whit Q on you) . cast some dots on him,and after  about 2 minutes  cast all the dots you can  and  some dd when he get low hp.<br />
<br />
for me, i don t need other  heal  then Q.(rarely need to use fast heal).<br />
self buff i have about 3800hp and 396 aa. 1200 ac.<br />
<br />
i soloed also south and deep south mobs,they are harder than the one in GY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I solo the south wing giants (earth) when I'm really bored sometimes.<br />
You'll find them the easiest to pull by yourself and don't resist everything you throw at them like the other wings (excluding west).<br />
They all summon so you'll have to be able to tank them.<br />
I find virtue and kei help alot for efficiency sake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I choose to solo here, I will normally pull from the earth wing. Mostly because it's easiest to pull solos here. All the melee giants(krigers, militis, and tyv) will summon. The profets and the elementals will not summon. Profets are shaman, and they will malo you and attempt to dot you or nuke ya. They'll also gate when low on health, so be careful.<br />
<br />
On the elementals, I'll just root/dot em. On the giants I'll tank em in teh face and have my pet beat on em.<br />
<br />
Each wing is resistant to different types of spells.<br />
<br />
The wind wing is highly PR, but dots will land. Also they are somewhat resistant to other spells.<br />
<br />
Water wing is completely cold and poison resistant.<br />
<br />
Earth wing is completely disease resistant(no VP)<br />
<br />
Fire wing is resistant to fire(don't effect us unless we nuke em down with burst of flame!)<br />
<br />
Hope this'll help ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>atana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are realy only 3 places where a shaman can solo in BoT with any kind of efficiency:<br />
<br />
Courtyard<br />
Easy kills, all our spells can land<br />
Easy singles<br />
<br />
South wing<br />
Harder kills, forget about trying to land disease based spells<br />
Easy singles<br />
<br />
West wing<br />
Easier kill then in South, but harder then in CY. Everything lands except fire based spells (Like we care about that).<br />
Harder to get singles unless you are used to pulling.<br />
<br />
I don't remember if the stuff in CY summons, but the giants do for sure. So you gotta be able to tank these if you wanna solo here.<br />
<br />
I don't recommend doing North or East cause most of our spells are resisted there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>zinastik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just had a quick question about CY in BoT...<br />
<br />
I 2 box a 65 mage and 65 shaman, and I have done the CY several times...  It is quite easy, however sometimes a little stormrider turns into an epic battle because it CHs itself about 6 times, then gates, repeat...  For the mage pet, I usually go with the epic, which does stun...  Am basically just wondering if you solo shaman find a way to avoid the CHs or if you just deal with them and kill it when it runs out of mana</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I used to do them I would kill them at their spawn spots as I find the gate annoying. The CHs weren't a big problem. Just root em and dot em some, stand out of melee range and they wll waste all their mana trying to nuke you. Then go in for the kill.</div></div><hr />
