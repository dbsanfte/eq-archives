Some of the new models are nice looking...for the most part I love the old models and was to use to them to change. I also have Velious textures on and for me, it helps the world look alittle more interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use all pre-Luclin models, except for barbarians.  Cuts down on lag and load times a lot.  Oh, I have high elf female models on too.  It's a risk v. reward thing.  And, um, dark elf females I guess . . . I have those on too.   And I think wood elf females.  <br />
<br />
Umm, those are stuck.  Sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
But no halflings.  Gotta draw the line somewhere.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use some new, some old. <br />
<br />
New: barbarian male, human female, high elves, dark elves, wood elves, ogres, trolls, gnomes, vah shir<br />
<br />
Old: barbarian female, human male, half elves, dwarves, hobbits, erudites, iksars</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Interesting thread. <br />
<br />
I changed out my own (ogre) models, simply because it was a nice improvment. I still like being called &quot;fatty&quot; though. Habit. <br />
<br />
All other modles make males look gay and females look even more like cheap gutterwhores. Gratz SoE on making the game look like a friggin porn show, giving the anti-gaming community, women's rights activists and alot of parents more ammunition to fire at EQ with. <br />
<br />
EQII - Uniform for all chick models will be 3-foot of dental floss.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Waxed dental floss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Smert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I use luclin humans male/female, and female elves &amp; barbs, and ogres male/female. <br />
Basically I just turned on the ones I thought looked better. Kinda miss the old Ogrrs and humans though, may go back. <br />
<br />
Lag is not generally a big consideration these days, for whatever reason. Esp if I remember the basics like turning off particle effects. <br />
<br />
Being a troll, and having been quite happy with my appearance prior to luclin, I'm still annoyed that those with the new trolls on see me as a giant string bean, and not my proper appearance. Overall that's what I still see as the biggest drawback is that you may pick your appearance, but that still may not be how others see you. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

The game runs SO much better. SOE really need to go back and fix the Luclin models.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you get the Velious textures on old models? I could never figure out how to get them on after Luclin came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I may have to dive for cover after saying this, but I love  the new models and I have them all turned on.  I had to upgrade my PC before I could hunt in Jaggedpine, so I certainly understand about lag issues for older PCs, but I feel the upgrade was well worth it.  I still have lag issues in PoK when I’m around a lot of people and of course the Bazaar is still a pain to try to move in.  But most zones are fine.<br />
<br />
I recently turned the old graphics back on to see how much of a difference it made in lag and found myself almost falling out of my chair from laughter.  After getting used to the new graphics I felt like I’d stepped into an episode of Gumby and everyone was playing blockheads.  Lag issues or not, I had to turn the new graphics back on.  I liked the graphics when I first started playing EQ, but I really do feel the new character models are a huge improvement.  Granted, all barbarian males look like professional wrestlers, but I much prefer the smoother lines of the art.  They just look more real to me than the blocky style of the old models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just use the barbarian new model.  Use old models for everything else.  They have style, if fewer pixels.  <br />

The Luclin models, and especially the animations, blow.</div></div><hr />

i happen to like the new Iskars and everything else..but that is just me it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I used the new models for a while after they were released and got used to them, really liked most of them.  Seems like everytime I zoned after a raid (rezzed or whatnot) I would crash to desktop.<br />
<br />
One day I decided before a raid to turn off all the new models.  I was in the nexus and I couldnt believe the difference in choppyness/lag.  It was like night and day.  Took me a while to get used to being back to the old models but it was well worth it for the difference in lag, especially in raids.  And Im way too lazy to turn them off/on every time I raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I dont turn on any models.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Gildana,<br />
you need to open your eqclient.ini file and edit the line that reads &quot;LoadVeliousArmorsWithLuclin=&quot; Im assuming your is set to FALSE...change it to TRUE. Know, however, that if you load Velious textures and have any Luclin models turned on...the models that are Luclin enabled will appear without chest armor. Its kind of nice running through places like PoK...allot of the npc's there are dressed in various Velious armors...more interesting to my eyes than Luclin models...imo anyway :)</div></div><hr />

! haha I forgot that was even there...yep, a face only a mother troll could love ;) and my pleasure on the help. Like I said, its how I prefer to view EQ....theres alittle more variety in PCs and NPCs alike...although I do like some of the Luclin models.</div></div><hr />

Turns out under old models its a POLAR BEAR HEAD graphic.<br />
<br />
I turned off new Barb Models to check it out and decided it looks pretty funky. Clashes with my Black armor dye job but oh well.... with AC 40, +100hp/mana 15 wis and 20 sta it could look like a damn Tea-cosy for all I care!!!!<br />
<br />
W.T.F. is with lots of uber Luclin gear looking like Leather or Cloth??? My new VT legs have a kilt graphic /lol<br />
<br />
We got a guy or two running around in Shei Vintras leggings and let me tell you, an old model Ogre in his Underwear IS NOT PRETTY!</div></div><hr />

Precisely the same here, I have high poly Vah Shir on only as the low poly model is just plain broken.<br />
<br />
Everything else = Low Poly and looks better to boot imho =)<br />
<br />
Shame though really, the new models wouldn't be that bad if they were not posed and animated so terribly, they really were a wasted opportunity imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">All new models on all the time here.  I think they did an incredible job with them!<br />
Then again, I've expressed my distaste for the old models several times in the past here before.<br />
Guess it's just a matter of taste /shrug<br />
<br />
I do wish they'd revamp some of the new animes, tho (like swimming).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Achzizra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">All old models on, except female iksar because of the horse :/<br />
I loved the velious gfx but can't have it on at the same time as new model iksar. Moving to the new iksar model was horrible. Went from slim and scaly to a bloated monstrosity. The fact that the iksar model is just a barely modified Vah Shir model doesn't make it any better. And the swimming animation.. *breaks down and cries*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Hmm, I like all the new models.  Granted I have no lag so perhaps that's why. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, the Luclin models look cool, but the animations need some serious work. Not to mention, but if you look at most female models from the side, being frank, you'll see the boobs aren't that big, but when you look from the front, or if they have a BP on, they look like they should be having some serious back pains.<br />
<br />
If the models didn't have such bad animations, I'd use 'em, but otherwise, Vah Shir only and even then I run like I have a spear shoved up my rectum ... =/<br />
<br />
and the &quot;low mem&quot; Vah Shir just plain look like they need to gain some weight or see a doctor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I have all new models on my main PC.  I like most of them, now that I've learned to ignore the goofy animations.  I have to have female barbs on for horsey and find it convenient to have the other females on for using horsey with an illusion pot.  At that point it bothers me less to have all the new models, so they look like a matched set.  But some are definitely better than others.  (Dark elves and female high elves, yay!  Iksars, boo!)<br />
<br />
But I, too, miss the bear head.  That backwards baseball cap thing that replaced it is just BLEH.  I also miss that graceful swaying run I used to have.  I dislike looking perpetually constipated when I run and about to fall on my face when I stand still.<br />
<br />
But then, that's one reason why I have all but female barbs off on the second PC.  It's capped at 386 RAM but that's fine with me.  I like seeing the old models from there.</div></div><hr />
