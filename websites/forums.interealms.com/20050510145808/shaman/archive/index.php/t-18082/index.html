<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">WOw Im so excited to save mana with the talisman of Brute and Cat!! Feels great to only have to HoS the tanks in preperation for battle after the groiup buffs are applied IE brute + cat + regen + Bih Lih + hOs. What a mana saver. FEEL MUCH LESS STRESS WHEN STARTING AN ADVENTURE OR GRP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your buffing life is too simple.  Allow me to complicate things a bit.   :D <br />
<br />
Pick up IOS if you haven't.  Notice that IOS stacks with Kragg's and pretty much every other class buff.  (There are exceptions, but it's pretty compatible.) It also stacks with your single stat buffs.  Stack IOS + Kraggs + Brute + Cat + Dex + STR.  Now, you've maxed out your melee's stats and you can give a ton more HP to your casters so they don't get eaten so fast.  The stamina boost from this, plus the HP boost from Kragg's is a significant difference in HP.  Also, don't forget your AC buff when in a group without a CLR. <br />
<br />
The caveat is that this takes a ton more mana, buff slots, and time.  I usually reserve it for LDON, close friends, or if we are hunting in an area where we are in significant danger and the extra HP will be needed.<br />
<br />
Now, when my group has a death or a wipe and I chose NOT to use IOS, I'm always wondering if the situation could have been avoided if I had just went to the extra trouble of using IOS.  I am a Troll afer all and so I'm pretty lazy.   :p <br />
<br />
This is also good for aggravating BST's since they don't get IOS until 61, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alot of work 100 HP difference. But I see your point!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aw crap.  Now I gotta do math.<br />
<br />
Okay, I don't know the STA to HP conversion for melee's (it will be higher I'm sure), so we're just gonna use you as an example.  This is based on the buffs you should have at your level.<br />
<br />
Traditional HOS-based buffage: 351 HP, 67 STR, 50 DEX   <br />
<br />
HoS<br />
HP = 251<br />
STR = 67<br />
DEX = 50<br />
<br />
Brute<br />
STA = 50 x2 HP per STA = 100 HP<br />
<br />
Infusion Stack buffage = 561 HP, 118 STR, 105 DEX   <br />
<br />
IOS<br />
STA = 45 x2 HP per STA = 90 HP<br />
DEX = 55<br />
STR = 50<br />
<br />
Brute<br />
STA = 50 x2 HP per STA = 100 HP<br />
<br />
Kragg's = 371 HP (at level 57)<br />
<br />
Maniacal Strength = 68 STR<br />
<br />
Dexterity = 50 DEX<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, it's a difference of 210 HP, 51 STR, and 55 DEX.  <br />
It is even more on melees due to the higher STA:HP conversion that I can't seem to find, lol.  My guess is at least double that.  When performing a test with an SK, the difference was 400+.  Afterwards, he never let me HoS him again.  <br />
<br />
My brain hurts now.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A search on SKO revealed about 5.8 HP per STA for Knight classes.  (Not sure what level) So, the difference with a Knight class is around 381.  I would imagine that WARs get even more STA:HP so it just goes up from there.  Of course you have to consider that well-equipped characters will max out on STA with all these buffs and that changes the STA:HP value.  Characters 60+ get more STA:HP.  So, results will vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In most groups I'm in there just aren't enough slots to do the IoS stack thing.  So, I put IoS on clerics by request (since they don't really need it in most situations and only ask for it they're gonna melee) and use it solo occasionally.<br />
<br />
I just hit 57 and I'm liking the extra group buffs too.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can't say what Knights and the other hybrids get for stamina, but a Warrior will get 6 HP for each stamina point up to 255 at level 60, more if they have stopped leveling and started getting AAs like Natural Durability and the like. At 57 I think I was getting about 5.7 or 5.8 HP/sta, For a Warrior, there really is a huge difference in HP using the IoS/Kragg/Brute method rather than HoS, but as said it is rather buff slot intensive, so Usually don't use that on Raids, but it's good for Adventure groups and exp groups</div></div><hr />
