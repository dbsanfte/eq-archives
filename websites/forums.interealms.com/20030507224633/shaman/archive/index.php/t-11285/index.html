Jeees I spent alot of time looking for her way back when - I had a crush on her but she never returned my affection so I had to move along.  She never was one to be around very often - hard to find - I used to hang out on the island right out in front of guk entrance and kill everything that came by in hopes of spawning her.  That was fun - finally find her and start pumping rubies - it seems like that everytime I got a hoop it got harder (more rubies) to get another one.  I was standing there throwing the hammers on the ground, feeding her rubies, cursing randomness.<br />
