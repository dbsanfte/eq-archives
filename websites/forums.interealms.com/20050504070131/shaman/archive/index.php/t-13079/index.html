<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would have to say that I love EQ for many things, but one thing that I do not really like in it is how it lowers our spelling/typing skills.<br />
<br />
  I know it is a petty concern, but really since I started EQ, I think I have increased the words per second I can type about 2 fold, and yet my typo rate has gone up WELL more than that, and I dont' even care about most now.<br />
<br />
<br />
   And I also notice the spelling attrocities of others, and sadly they wear off on me too :(   Large personal gripes are too, to, two... there their and they're... and lately I have seen a LOT of soft C's being replaced by S's (like SinCe, and adviCe)<br />
<br />
<br />
   Anyhow, wanted to vent.</div></div><hr />

I know exactly what you mean. My rate has incressed by my accuracy is awful. I just dont even care anymore though. if I get my point across thats what matters hehe  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Talk about hitting the nail square on the head. It's not just EQ, but the lack of spelling and grammar correctness is everywhere on the net. I'm an older guy, and I still can't read stuff where numbers are used to replace letters, letters are transposed (like the nearly universal teh), etc. I guess it's considered cool in many circles. I just hope these people also know how to do it right.</div></div><hr />

I'm an old guy too.   I could never spell, no point of starting now.<br />
<br />
Now that EQ can be ran in a window, we can run MS Word at the same time.  All we need is cut and paste.  hehe<br />

Or maybe embed at spell checker in the game or maybe ......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not just EQ.  It is mainly doing anything online that requires typing or communication.  I refuse to use extreme shorthands like &quot;wut r u doing?&quot;, but I have noticed that my grammar and spelling skills have gone to crap in the last few years.   I had better writing skills when I was 15 than I do now (at 20), all thanks to years spent playing MUDs and MMORPGs.  NO ONE I know uses proper punctuation/capitalization, and very few use complete sentences when talking in game or on instant messenger.  It freaks me out when my mother IMs my, because she says things like &quot;Hello John, how are you doing today?&quot; and I reply &quot;im good&quot; and she says &quot;Oh, I am glad to hear that.  Would you like to come by for dinner tonight?&quot;  I answer &quot;ok what time&quot; and she'll say &quot;It will be ready at about 6:00, but you should show up around 5:30.&quot;  Wierd =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for spelling and grammer I have never really been a pro at it.  But EQ often has me trying to type something while running and since I use letters to control movement instead of the arrow keys.. I have to get what I want to say out before I need to make a turn. &gt;__&lt;</div></div><hr />

Although when you have an all black keyboard, and you're typing in the dark, not even looking, you tend to get a few typos.  :p</div></div><hr />

I don't want to wait for a response to a tell, even if it means that the spelling/grammar is incorrect. I will take a few typo's over the constant waiting every day of the week  :cool: <br />

You are right, people don't speak in the manner referenced in the latter example.  My issue stems from the fact that, given the opportunity to hold a conversation in text, and given the inclination to even attempt to type in an intelligent manner, they fail.  Example, using your prior example ---<br />
<br />
&quot;hello there brian&quot;<br />
&quot;hi wuts going on?&quot;<br />
&quot;atm, not much.  last nite i traveled down to UConn to atend a party their&quot;<br />
&quot;ahh, that must have been a fun time&quot;<br />
&quot;indeed it wuz, however, do to mass drinking, the cops had to come.  their was kaos everywhere&quot;<br />
<br />
That is much closer to something I'd encounter in a text conversation, if the person on the other end were even trying.  It's sad.</div></div><hr />

Everytime one of these threads, someone pulls out this dead excuse.  No one I know would bash any Euro, Asian, or non-American for improper use of the language.  I doubt many of us Americans can speak a foreign language as well as they speak and write American English.  It's not the non-Americans we're frustrated with, it's the 15-year-old high school students that can't form a proper sentence, use punctuation, spell, or even capitalize appropriately.  <br />

I don't even think they're bad people -- but by not learning to type fast enough to effectively communicate in a text-based game, they're not going to add as much to my gaming experience as will someone who's a good typist.  Or at least a slower typist who cares what they sound like.<br />

:)<br />
The worst problem I have with typing now is transposing letters - I find myself doing it more and more, whether I am in-game or not.  I think it has a lot to do with pulling a lot.  I, too, have my directional keys mapped to S-F and D-E, so I type REALLY fast when I am pulling.<br />
<br />
My biggest pet peeve with EQ grammar is actually with the message boards:  it drives me freakin CRAZY when people can't capitalize, punctuate properly and throw in an occasional ENTER.<br />
<br />
Dude speak annoys the crap out of me, too, but I pretty much write those folks off as morons, anyway....but I hate to see an intelligent response to a good thread absolutely RUINED by laziness: CAPS, PUNCUATION and PARAGRAPHS: they are your FRIENDS!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">wat r u all talking bout????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">One of the things that this reminds me of, was the whole Ebonics question.  If it's too hard to learn American English, then let's just make up a grammar without rules or structure.  Forget that this is the language that gave us Hemingway, Steinbeck, Melvile, Thoreau and Twain.  Twain you say?  Wasn't everything Huckleberry Finn saying colloquial?  Yes, but almost all novels of the period were full of flowery speech and prose, where Mark Twain broke through that to show that there was a beauty in the language of the common man.  But even after creating the first truly American novel, Twain didn't abandon structure.<br />
<br />
Abraham Lincoln's most famous speech was such a breakthrough because of the same principle.  All speeches made in his time tended to be very long affairs and flowery.  When he gave The Gettrysberg Address, people were stunned.  It was incredibly short and to the point, without all the fluff they were used to.  We still feel the impact of that speech in oral communication today.  But Lincoln never abandoned grammar for expediency or effect.<br />
<br />
Now, we find ourselves in a game where communication is key to succeeding.  The company that make sit has NO IDEA of what grammar is.  Almost every action you see written is in passive voice (which is something use rarely and only for effect).  We get little gems like &quot;A Orc&quot; all over the place in their code.  I read their dialogues and wish I had a red pen handy.  They set a VERY poor example.<br />
<br />
But it's also an example that we don't have to follow (see?  passive voice for effect).  Take the time to write it right.  l33t sp34k has SUCH a better impact when used in moderation.  And don't cloud the impact of your statement by confusing your and you're, etc...</div></div><hr />

As for &quot;d00d&quot; speak.  the only one i use a lot is &quot;u&quot; for &quot;you&quot; dunno why but its stuck.  its so bad that if i am typing something official i will at least once have to go back and fix it.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Plz&quot; and &quot;thx&quot; - if they're asking for something, or thanking you, can't they at least spell it out in full? I have been known to refuse to buff someone who asks without saying &quot;please&quot; in full. :)<br />

first off, i want to say i dont mean to single you out, but as an example of something i guarantee most who posted gripes here are guilty of. you used the abbreviation &quot;EQ&quot; to refer to everquest. why is it ok for that to be abbreviated, but you cant use &quot;pst&quot;? why is it ok to shorten words for items, such as JBB and REIF, but you cant shorten the word &quot;you&quot; to &quot;u&quot;. why when talking about zones, everyone can use CoM, or DL, or CC, but using &quot;thx&quot; is not appropriate? my guess is the answer would be something along the lines of &quot;we all know what you mean&quot;,  and/or &quot;it saves time typing a few extra letters that are unneccesary&quot;  well, ummm, isnt that the point of &quot;u&quot; and &quot;pst&quot; and &quot;CoM&quot; and etc etc? seriously, you people need to relax. i hear this rant alot, and yes im guilty of using &quot;u&quot; and &quot;pst&quot;. why? because it does save time typing unnecessary extra characters. when im running around in a circle with a mob on my ass, im not going to worry about grammer and non-abbreviated words. im going to say &quot;help one on me&quot; or something. im not going to sit there and type &quot;please help me my fellow groupmates as I have a rather annoying fellow chasing me around and i will be killed if you dont help me&quot;, then run a freaking spell/grammer check, submit it to turnitin.com, etc etc you get the idea (yes i know rediculous analogy)now, that is the only time i wont use a grammatically correct sentence, i will use shorthand forms of words, but my sentences will make sense, they will be grammatically correct. what is the big deal if i dont use the full &quot;you&quot;, you still know what i mean. punctuation? while on a long post like this maybe i can see the point, but in game i say one line at a time, why the hell do i need to capitalize the first word in the sentence. no apostrphes? are you that much of a moron you dont know what i mean when i say &quot;dont&quot;. personally for me, im not a good typer, im a fast hunt and pecker, never learned the &quot;proper&quot; way to type. so since im slow enough as it is, i have to get my point across asap, which means shortening up some words.</div></div><hr />

you prove my point again...why is it laziness and d00d speak to say &quot;u&quot; but not EQ. &quot;rez&quot; ? never seen that word in the dictionary but thats ok?. to me, thats borderline kid talk, as there is no &quot;z&quot; in resurrection. will typing the few extra letters in everquest or city of mist get you killed? only a few extra letters than you. please, do not consider this a personal attack, its just lame because the arguments make no sense, they are not logical. &quot;commonly accepted acronyms&quot;? says who? and why are those deemed acceptable and not others? i see &quot;thx&quot; and &quot;ty&quot; in a lot more places then in eq, and the only people i have ever heard the slightest gripe from was the people that play eq. now, i can see that the 10 year olds playing, using d00d talk, is what has soured you all. you see some idiot saying things &quot;lolz&quot; and gay stuff like that, and they also use &quot;u&quot; and &quot;thx&quot; , so it gets associated with those kind of people, and stigmatized. have any of you ever been in a chat room? or any place outside of everquest on the net? using those abbreviations are quite common, and accepted. if you dont like it, or dont want to use them, fine, but its not fair at all to flame someone who chooses. its called hypocrisy and even a little narcissistic because you feel what you use as acronyms or abbreviated forms are acceptable, but others arent. let me reiterate that i DONT use d00d talk, im 26 with a master's degree, im hardly some little kid. i just dont see the need to type out the full word for some things, just as some do for locations and such. and to be honest, i think its less ok to abbreviate items, zones, etc, dont we all remember when we were new and had no idea what any of those meant? im still new and learning, but what i have decided is that its ok to use certain shortened forms because you sound like you are smart, that you know the game, that you are in some small elite group and that you sound intelligent. using other examples doesnt add any value to peoples perceptions of you, maybe even lower them, as there is that stigma surrounding it, so using those ones are frowned upon.<br />

For you, since obviously it is SO difficult to know what I'm saying, I will use capitalization. Relax for God's sake, don't be overdramatic and say how hard it is to understand what I wrote. No need to be immature, like in grade school where you would say (with the person right in front of you) &quot;I don't know if soandso is talking to me, but tell him I'm not talking to him...&quot;, etc. Anyone with a 5th grade reading level could understand what I said. My thoughts were cohesive and DID have struture, despite what you say (Stucture is not the lack of capitalization, it is the organization and arrangement of the IDEAS). So, if my post was SO illegible, and made no sense, and you couldn't read it, why waste time and be a dick to me? How can you sit there and critique me? You can't give an informed critique without knowing the topic. It's like reviewing a movie that you didn't even see. So, read my post through, no matter how &quot;trying&quot; it might be without a few capital letters, before you decide to chime in please.<br />
<br />
I said that in game I don't have the time to use 100% correct English, I don't have time when I post either. You are right there is no rush to hit the reply button, but my time is my time, and I'd rather spend it how I want to, rather than do what I feel is a waste of time. You don't like it, fine, don't ****ing read it, and don't ****ing replying to it....simple as that. No need to fan the flames and continue this discussion that has grown out of hand, to the point where I'm being misinterpreted.<br />
<br />
For anyone that couldn't read my last posts, for whatever reason, I'll restate them. I wasn't defending d00d talk, not the slightest bit. I said why give people a hard time using shortened forms/acronyms, when the same people use them at times themselves. If it bothers you, fine, it bothers you, you have the right. But don't sit there and flame them, especially like that guy who use &quot;prolly&quot; in the midst of his comment (I didn't even think to reply to that one, I think everyone caught that one). I say again, it's a double standard. And yes, they exist in our world, and most of the time they will never be changed unless confronted, and many will never change at all. There was the argument that many agree with the idea that certain things were immature and d00d-like, I'm sure that is true, but there are also many who don't. I've typed the way I typed since I began everquest, I won't stop, and I have NEVER had one complaint from someone saying they couldn't understand me. You don't agree with me, and don't see it as a double standard? No big deal, just leave people alone, there is absolutely no reason to get enraged and insult people for it. And, whoever made the office job analogy, that has to be the most rediculous analogy of a double standard I have ever heard. Where is the double standard in the company that won't hire a man who comes in for the interview not wearing a suit, or looking presentable? Or, where is the double standard in the business world that demands people to look presentable? Think about your analogy before using it, there is no double standard there, there is a standard, not a double standard. EVERYONE is expected to look professional, that is a standard. Maybe I missed something, but it has nothing at all to do with the topic at hand.</div></div><hr />

I was a bit disappointed to not get a single comment regarding my previous post so I will endeavor to be more serious now. (And possibly my words will gain more weight as my post count increases.)<br />
<br />
The /pst issue stems from the individual using it indicating that the appropriate response is a tell, not an /ooc, /auction, /shout, or /say. It is a specific direction that does have meaning given the many methods at our disposal for communicating in game.<br />
<br />
While I can sympathize with those of you who find the clipped text speech of many EQers abhorrent, it does accomplish its goal of communicating. We all understand &quot;Inc&quot; to mean incoming and &quot;Plz&quot; to mean please. Unfortunately, those that use it all the time do not realize that it may not always be appropriate to use clipped language in every situation. Just as the language we use with our friends differs from the language we use in a job interview, the clipped text is appropriate in battle and possibly informal settings with friends but not when asking for favors from strangers. Some EQers are too young or have not been taught how to be discriminate in social settings. (Look at how many of them dress for school as if they were going to a ball game.) I have found the best response in game is to ask the individual using clipped speech at the wrong time to rephrase their request more formally if they are asking me for something. If it is in general /ooc or /shout, I just ignore it.<br />
<br />
&quot;l33t d00d&quot; speak I find to just be obnoxious. It stems from a psychological need of teenagers to rebel. Those who are not teenagers who use it might be missing their childhood just a bit too much.</div></div><hr />

Nah, I think most people use it because its the trendy thing to do, same as u, ur, etc., although many say that it's to let people responding to an auction know to send a tell.  Asking a price in ooc, or shout, etc.. is in really bad taste, and I think is just an indicator that alot of young kids play the game. (I could write a book here about bad trends in parenting but I'll just shut up ;)) While I personally can't stand rugrats, I'll concede that social faux pas such as this will happen when they're involved.  The answer, however, is not to sink down to their level, and put a stupid acronym in your auctions to prevent people asking price, etc, in ooc..  its like being called a poopypants and responding with a 'your mom' joke.  Simply ignoring them or sending them a tell should get the point across just fine.</div></div><hr />

This is true to a point, but its not hardly a double standard. I work in the office environment, since I graduated college 5 years ago. I've worked for three different corporations, and now I'm at a university. How it always went regarding dress was Friday was casual day, meaning no tie, just collared shirt. The exception was if you had an important meeting, or some type of interview. I don't call it a double standard asking people to look their best for an important business meeting. If you think that, then it follows people getting married in formal wear is also part of that double standard? Don't take it personal, I have no problem with you, I was just making a point, which I still stand by, that it's not a good example at all of a double standard. <br />
<br />
Looking back in a few years and laughing? Just to make sure you are aware, I'm 26 with a MS in Information Technology, I'm hardly some young high schooler who hasn't matured yet and will look back on my youth and laugh. And as far as people taking me seriously, with all due respect, I don't give a **** really how people view me in a game. If they think I'm some snot nosed kid because of what I do, no problem, plenty of other people around in the game to interact with, I'm hardly going to lose sleep over some loser who places that much emphasis on not capitalizing the first word in a sentence, etc. in the middle of a fast paced game.<br />
<br />

CoM, EQ, and even PST are somewhat acceptable simply because they actually save a significant amount of typing, and a certain degree of that is expected in this game.  Typing &quot;u&quot; for &quot;you&quot; saves a whole TWO friggin' letters.  Typing &quot;4&quot; in place of &quot;for&quot; saves most people NO time, because who the hell touch types numbers?  And once again, that saves a whopping TWO characters.  CoM saves nine characters.  EQ saves seven characters.  The only question then becomes &quot;Who sets these rules?&quot;  Well, society in general has always set the rules for these things.  If you hear people speaking in a manner similar to the dialogue in Mark Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; (to steal a point from above&quot;), you instantly form an impression of that person.  It's the same with &quot;u&quot;, &quot;plz&quot;, and &quot;thx&quot; in this game.  However, if enough people use these abbreviations, they become commonplace.  Nonetheless, there will always be educated and intelligent people who think that it is a travesty.<br />
<br />
In a game where text is the main form of communication, it matters how you present yourself.  Personally, I will continue to classify the people that type these abbreviations as mental midgets, &quot;k3wl-d00ds&quot;, or just morons, as is my right.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Abbreviating names of places and things has always been acceptable. <br />
<br />
Abbreviating direct covnersation to or in reference to another person is not, especially when those words are there to express gratitude. Using &quot;thx&quot;, to me, says that they are only fulfilling the obligation to placate you for doing them a favor without actually meaning it. It's simply rude. <br />
<br />
As for foreign players, I've found that generally their use of our language is quite better than those of us to whom it's native. They may have trouble wrapping the words they know into the package they wish to deliver, but I have found that they rarely take the language for granted and butcher it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
D00d speak is fun for talking about phat lewts and stuff, but it's NOT the form of communication I want to hear from a begger in Nexus when I'm sitting there /fuming/ over a futile death from a pathetically bad pull.<br />
<br />
Put on your &quot;sunday best&quot; when begging, at least you could take some mercy on my shattered sense of confidence in my fellow players at that sensitive moment and say a complete 'please' and 'thank you'.  A person who asks politely might get a full set of high-level group buffs, I'm not doing anything with this mana at that moment anyway.  <br />
<br />
A d00d is going to get an OOC something like this : /ooc Begger_01 is a dirty pathetic beggar.  Please ignore this creepazoid. ...along with a direct /tell to please crawl under a rock and never speak to me again.<br />
<br />
Again, people may say I'm an elitist...but I worked my butt off to get to my level, and I didn't do it by begging every high-level person I met.</div></div><hr />

I can spell like a mofo and I piss people off all the time by correcting their spelling.  Fiancee loves me to check her school papers.  But when I play this game, I no longer care about perfect grammar; 'cause in this game you're not only typing; you're playing.  As long as they get the point, that's all I care about.<br />
<br />
I also type in dialect.  I shorten because to &quot;'cause&quot;; &quot;you all&quot; to &quot;y'all&quot;; &quot;doing&quot; to &quot;doin'&quot;; &quot;you&quot; to &quot;ya&quot;; &quot;got to&quot; to &quot;gotta&quot;.  That's how I talk in RL, so that's how I type.  I type like I talk.  Just 'cause I'm aware of correct pronunciation or grammar doesn't mean I feel like using it all the damn time.<br />
<br />
A typical sentence from me in-game may look like &quot;how ya doin'? i was wonderin' if ya could meet me in nexus instead 'cause i gotta pick up Whatshisface in IC, cool?&quot;....</div></div><hr />

If I can understand what someone's saying, that's fine with me.  Most people that use abbreviations know better, they're simply conveying their point that much faster.  Sometimes it's even entertaining to see what people have come up with, to me at least.<br />

BTW, FWIW, I learned to type by playing Everquest.  Several people have, AFAIK. ;) <br />

In emails, message boards, and other composed, typed communications, I'm as much of a stickler for form as I am with handwriting. But in EQ, I hardly capitalize anything and usually construct massive run-on sentences using commas instead of periods. However, I don't say things like &quot;u&quot; and &quot;ur&quot; and &quot;plz&quot; because they are weak abbreviations that serve to make you look stupid, not clever or terse.

Says it all  :eek: <br />
Anyways, now to the whole part that I say something that has some sort of meaning.  I always try to talk 'normally' in game when possible.  Obviously, there are occasional screwups and situations that require me to type quickly and have some typos and such.  I also try to not use 1337 d00d most of the time.  Granted, I greet most of my friends with 'sup' or something like that.  I guess I am kinda uptight about typos though, I always backspace to delete typos that I make...  if I see them  ;) .  I would like to think most of my typos are accidental at times.  My worst ones are when I accidentally don't place my hands on the right spaces on the keyboard, so literally every letter I type with that hand is wrong.<br />
Also, to all the people that complain about getting little beggar d00ds asking them for buffs, I know feel your pain  :( .  My shaman is my first character that actually can buff people well, and so now I get lots of requests.  I have had the occasional nice people that donate platinum just for a sow and a regen, which is always a nice surprise.  I also make sure to always ask nicely for buffs like KEI and such, and I always say 'please' and 'thank you.'<br />
I also think the biggest thing I've seen is the word Gratz.  I admit, I say Gratz as well.  Although I was offered a nice surprised yesterday when I leveled and had someone say, &quot;Congratulations Korsib.&quot;  Which is certainly something I have never seen before.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">When I'm chatting, I use colloquialisms and slang because that's how I speak in real life. I say:<br />
&quot;Howdy&quot;, &quot;Ya'll&quot;, &quot;Lemme check&quot;, &quot;I dunno&quot;, &quot;Gimme a break&quot;, &quot;Dammit&quot;, etc. When speaking most, if not all, people slur their words together. It's reflected in the language by contractions (I'm, we're, he's, let's). However, there are many phrases that don't have a contraction, but they're pronounced as one. I listed a few examples above. Does it appear &quot;uneducated when written? Maybe. Is it improper? Probably. Do you understand me? More then likely. Clear pronunciation doesn't truly exist in the spoken language and will probably never exist in chat, emails or EQ.<br />
<br />
It doesn't really concern me. I play the game to, well, play the game. Not flex my cerebrum at people. I am a very casual person, not only in attitude but in speaking. I have the ability to be formal, but opt to live my life otherwise.<br />
<br />
I don't go so far as d00d-speak, but I do type the way I speak. When people meet me after chatting or corresponding via email, it's not hard to recognize me from it. <br />
<br />
My personal pet peeve...<br />
<br />
acronym - A word formed from the initial letters of a name, such as &quot;NASA&quot; meaning National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or by combining initial letters or parts of a series of words, such as &quot;radar&quot; for radio detecting and ranging. Scuba, snafu and fubar are also all acronyms.<br />
<br />
abbreviation - A shortened form of a word or phrase used chiefly in writing to represent the complete form, such as MA or Mass. for Massachusetts or USMC for United States Marine Corps. <br />
<br />
Simply put, if it makes a pronounceable word, it should be refered to as an acronym. If it doesn't, it's an abbreviation. Acronyms are abbreviations, but not all abbreviations are acronyms.<br />
<br />
SoW, CoM and HoT are EQ acronyms. JBB, REIF, DL, and VT are abbreviations. &quot;Lammy&quot; is a slang term (or &quot;C: none of the above&quot;).<br />
<br />
I see EQ as being a lot like the military or the computer industry. It's so different then &quot;real life&quot; that it develops its own vernacular and/or slang. Words, phrases and ideas are often used out of context to describe things. Examples of this are &quot;training&quot;, &quot;bunny-jumping&quot; or &quot;c**k blocking&quot;. The terms themselves would be almost unknown outside the context of EQ, but are still totally out of context within the game. Training has nothing (or little) to do with instruction or locomitives, rabbits or actually jumping has nothing to do with bunny-jumping and the male member itself, while it may be a penis thing,  is not actually used in c**k blocking.<br />
<br />
If the idea is properly conveyed, I don't really see it as improper. Why? Because it would be too cumbersome to describe it in &quot;proper&quot; terms, so it's given one of its own. And in some cases, there is no &quot;proper&quot; term for it.<br />
<br />
What it comes down to is that English, or any modern language for that matter, changes. There are new words added to dictionaries every year, and old words removed. Who calls a &quot;Q-tip&quot; a cotton swab or a &quot;bandaid&quot; an adheasive bandage? Dictionaries in the 1950's make no mention of a &quot;walkman&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">The other interesting thing is the constant use of the terms: lol, rofl, roflmao and the smilies. xD :) and so on and so on.<br />
<br />
There are people who use &quot;lol&quot; in every sentance, and xD in every one as well.  Not that there is anything wrong with that I supose, but I wonder how many of them are actually rolling around on the floor laughing their arses off while playing EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
take a word i used: kool. &quot;k&quot; is SO MUCH CLOSER to &quot;o&quot; and &quot;l&quot; than &quot;c&quot;, so why not use &quot;k&quot; ?<br />
<br />
i'm 15 right now, and someone commented on 15 year olds being childish/immature/whatever (can't remember. took too long to read the thread  :p ). i HATE  (hope that works  :D ) when adults make that snap-assumption about teens, just because they were like that when they were that age or that's how alot of us act. it's called &quot;stereotyping&quot; and the world doesn't need anymore of that so cut it out.<br />
<br />
if you even halfway knew me at all, you might think a little les harshly of other teens before you meet them. i'm NOT your average teenager (ok...in some ways i am  ;) ) and when teens get judged before they're met, THAT'S a pet peve(sp?) of mine.<br />
<br />
everyone has pet peves(sp again?), don't like this, don't like that...what is the big deal ? if you can understand them enough to argue about it, then you get their point and that's THE END. if it bothers you so much, tell them they should give changing a chance (don't tell them to; much easier) and if they don't.../ignore<br />
<br />
ok. i'm done now. and i know i'm gonna get flamed for some words in this post...but whatever. i actually kind of tried this time...you should read soem of my more...interesting posts  :D . Laterz d00d</div></div><hr />
