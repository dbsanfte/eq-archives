<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...But I'd like to see about getting a group of people together to help get me, and others if possible, flagged in PoJ.<br />
<br />
This is one of the few Saturday's I'll be free on, and I really want to see about getting this accomplished.  Plus I've really really missed you all and have missed being able to raid with you guys when you're out in about in the Planes that are past the part I'm stuck on.<br />
<br />
Like I said, don't know what you guys have planned, but I'd thought I'd see if anyone was willing to help me :)<br />
<br />
I'll be on early Saturday and off and on tonight if anyone wants to give me a shout.<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Plopnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is there any way a lvl 57 probably 58 by this weekend could make it through Exec. trial?  Entium and I have dreamed of the giant slaughter in POS from time to time.  I know he's eligable now but was wondering if there was any way i could squeak through.  <br />
<br />
If I get a brave group that wants to try I'll acommodate as to the time.  If so count me in Waran.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We'll have to see what's available - and what's called for raids, etc etc.  I actually have taken tommorrow off but it's to go to movies etc -- I should be playing much earlier than I normally do, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tweedl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I too am now one of the few that hasn't been flagged from the trials.  So time willing, I'd definately be on board to give it a go!!!  If possible, post details about what time you thinking of getting this rolling.</div></div><hr />

Was hoping somewhere in the time frame of before noon CST, but can do it earlier if plans are already set in stone.<br />

I'll be on sometime soon after 10:00 Central tomorrow and we'll go from there :)</div></div><hr />
