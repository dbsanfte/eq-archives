Quickest way to get an exploit fixed is to spead it all over the net.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />

Kudos to the guy who posted this info - if everyone knows how to do it, then they have no choice but to fix it:  They can't just ignore it.</div></div><hr />

/rude SoE for caring more about $$ then people playing fair.<br />
<br />
Thats never changed and it never will. They might ban a few here and there to try and scare people off, but they seriously need a mass total baning to make a message. As for all the hubub about the macro bans I don't know one person directly that was baned as a result of that.</div></div><hr />

I kind of appreciated the biting sarcasm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just can't believe that people will believe a class is overpowered just because they found a loophole which worked for a week at most.  If there was an exploit that let every other class get free xp EXCEPT shaman, would you think every other class is overpowered?  Maybe you should go try and find an animal with faction to charm and make your own little bear/wolf war and then go to other forums and see all the people who say that shaman/druids are overpowered...<br />
<br />
Edit: And in case you were just joking about saying they are overpowered, its hard to tell sarcasm from blunt stupidity without the random  :rolleyes: or :D or ;) or (insert random smiley)</div></div><hr />

Does it really matter anymore?  Give a shaman 500+ aa's and we still have level 51 slow as our end all.<br />

Tactics pit is like a year old, and the evils/goods on our server exploit it daily, know what?   We been petitioning this for a year, nothing happens, I doubt sony will care even if its posted on every board.

all are over 55. <br />
<br />
how is this so hard to believe? <br />
<br />
name one thing a monk, mage, or ranger can solo that a shaman cant. <br />
<br />
name one group that would take a ranger, mage, or monk over a shaman that doesn't already have one. <br />
<br />
IMO shamans aren't over powered, but its all about comparing. <br />
<br />
and who gives a rats *** if they ARE over powered?!?  <br />

if you do, its because you're on a PVP server, jealous, or just need something to bitch about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously - you need to think your statements through.<br />
<br />
a) Soloing is less effective now than at any point in the game. There is no soloing in LDoN, and the recent changes to the grouping xp bonus make grouping far more efficient than soloing, anyway.<br />
<br />
b) A group that would take a ranger, mage, or monk over a shaman. Gosh, that's hard to imagine. Any group which already has a slower and a haster? Cleric, tank, chanter... just add 3 DPS. I'd take the monk, ranger, AND mage to fill out that group before I took a shaman (in terms of maximum efficiency). Druid could fill in for the cleric, and BL or bard for the chanter.<br />
<br />
c) We care if classes are overpowered because there's such a thing as game balance. We care because we want to stop seeing our core abilities diminished or whored out to other classes.<br />
<br />
Does that clarify things?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">One wonders if it was a Druid only exploit would the Grove be so quick to either: a) Post it, or b) Poo-poo it.<br />
<br />
If you want to see how deeply people think about this game, and if they REALLY understand the mechanics, ask them what the highest DPS is.  Oh sure you'll get the usual - Wizard, Necro, AM / EQ 3 Ranger.<br />
<br />
The answer is Enchanter. Granted there are huge risks, but the risks can be mitigated to some extent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) your right, <br />
<br />
b) a group that would take a shaman over a DPS class is..a normal group who would send me a tell like this /t ogath wanna join a LDoN group? you'd slow buff and back up heal. <br />
the difference i see here is people dont want monks mages and rangers as much as they want shamans. when i play my mage, my monk or ranger im looking at AT Least 30 minutes of zone to zone running /ooc'ing LFG. before i can find a group, most of the time it takes quite a bit more time. <br />
<br />
c) i gave up on class balance when i realized they us warriors to gauge all melee and wizards to gauge all caster, AND PVP to decide which class is &quot;overpowered&quot;  <br />
personally i think shamans are fairly well balanced, compared to what 90% of EQ fights MOBS. not other players. <br />
a shaman VS a chanter in PVP would be rough for the shaman, if both had near equal skills, <br />
same with necro and SK Vs shaman, <br />
a shaman vs monk, warrior, rogue, ranger (before AM3/EQ) would have the upper hand, land a slow on a monk and all he is, is HPs with druid tanking abilities. <br />
but i dont PVP so i couldnt care less who would win. <br />
<br />
anywho i think we are on the same page, i dont think Shamans are &quot;r0x0ring l337ne$$&quot;   they are just the way i like them. <br />
<br />
In fact monk is the only class that i think needs work....as a whole class. there are, of course things in each class that need some attention. <br />
and i think beastlords could use a tune down. as with rogues. but ONLY Compared to OTHER classes, by themselves against mobs they do fine. <br />
<br />
but what im saying is MOST people that dont play the shaman class think they are overpowered. <br />
<br />
damn i miss the days when shamans were ignored, underestimated and left alone. <br />
now its like a given for an &quot;uber&quot; player to have one.</div></div><hr />

Yup and most if not all of the risk can be removed by adding a snare class and a stun class for charm breaks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just cuz you suck at PVP doesnt mean the shaman class is flawed, <br />
<br />
PVP is stupid. period. <br />
i was a GM on RZ, shamans get more complaints than most classes combined. <br />
<br />
so dont whine to me about how the shaman class is underpowered, ive already said what i think, and SOE happens to agree with me.<br />
<br />
btw the monk AA is called purify body, and its like # 10 on the list of AA's that good monks have. and get. <br />
only guild pulling monks get it, &quot;unless your on a red server and have to protect yourself from the 12 year old &quot;I R 133t&quot; generation of EQer's.&quot;<br />
<br />
and the re-use time is so long that you would have PLENTY of time landing a spell, after he uses it. and you dont have to use dots, they take too long in PVP anyway, use your cold nukes, and if he resists you have debuffs. melee and resists. like mala...or malo however they spell the shaman version of this debuff.</div></div><hr />
