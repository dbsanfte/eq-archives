<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've only passed through RCoD to get to an instanced zone once, but I hear that it's WoS-like XP and nameds, but less crapola and named-stealing.<br />
<br />
I'd like to take my group (will be half pickups tonight, lost two to EQ2 already) out of NC and over to RCoD, but will be me (7% from 68), uber 69 Bard, 66 Monk, and a rent-a-tank, cleric/druid, and dpser.<br />
<br />
What are the camps in RCoD (I've heard 'benches' camp is the best), and is it really all  that?<br />
<br />
Or should I stick with NC, or try to get a WoS camp? I only have one each new spell, 66 (sense), 67 (dog), 68 (group sense), and could really use not only armor drops, but any/all spell runes as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've spent a little time in RCoD, in the Granitesmash camp area, spitting distance from the benches.<br />
<br />
Most of the wandering mobs in this area con 66, with names conning 67-68<br />
<br />
a decent group can kill for hours with no downtime, other names are nearby, all in a large area thats easy to keep clear<br />
<br />
just watch for other groups, its very easy for someone to come in and set up camp when they don't see others around, but nowhere near as competitive as WoS.<br />
<br />
the EXP there is good and there are some zonewide rare drops that are really nice, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31412&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tome of Forceful Projection&lt;/a&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 4 is a favorite camp of mine. I dunno what it is called on other servers but the 4 is 4 named that are single pullable by anyone. The exp is pretty bad but its 4 chances at a named. Kyv Hunter or something like that is one of the named. Dont remember off-hand the others but all are somewhere in the middle of the zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One of my favortie camps is the room with Filingo the Slayer, and untargetable NPC; On druzzil this room doesnt have a solid name yet, but usually is refered to as Bowlord Rorn's Room, which is fitting in that he is the better of two possible named in that area, he drop a very nice Shaman Only cloak, Tattered Cloak of the Fallen, and fairly often for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I duo in RCoD as much as I can.  We usually target Named PHs, and there are three that we kill.  My friend and I are typically here for spells, so we really do not xp that much, but we get about 5% per kill.  There is a named Ukun that you need to be aware of.  He is a mean mob that hits in the 2k5 range, sees through invis and SoS.  He roams across one of the bridges near the bridgekeeper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've done a lot of hunting in RCoD. xp and loot is better than WoS imo, plus the zone is usually not crowded. I'll post my map labels when I get off work :), I have most of the nameds marked. <br />
<br />
Korelen is correct about the roaming named Ukun, he is one nasty sob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow, thanks, that'd be great!<br />
<br />
Was in NC when I saw in /gu Selevar's Shoulder Guard rotting in MPG!<br />
<br />
Scary run, but I got it, and dinged 68 last night, too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here's a link to some RCoD info posted on the warrior boards: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=9240<br />
<br />
It's a good zone, imho.  As mentioned, watch out for the named ukun on the bridge, and there's a big wandering murkglider (Souldrainer, I think) that's pretty mean as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beawolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just wanted to add that I can personally confirm Greater Muramite Rune's dropping off of Ungi the Swift and Granitesmash and Glowing Muramite Rune from Stoneworker Stonetooth.  Me and a buddy cleric, usually with a melee 3rd bounce between Kyv Bowhound, Granitesmash, Ornaia the Foul, Stoneworker Stonetooth and Ungi the Swift unless stonetooth camp is occupied then we switch to Noc Slavehunter in it's place, makes for a good farm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How easy are the named?  Will most likely be 3 boxing there (ranger/shaman/mage, rng/shm are time+ gear).  I currently do WoS tents when its open, but thats only because its easy to get there w/ a port.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Melkiah, thanks a bunch!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, the obvious answer is &quot;it depends on the name&quot; (souldrainer can be a handful), but generally not too hard, they are higher level and last slightly longer than the normal mobs.<br />
<br />
my gear is no where near time, but in a pick-up group of similar geared people, we can handle pretty much all of the regular named mobs, I've seen a high-end necro solo them, I'm fairly sure you could handle them with three people, but as with every new place, use caution, sometimes things can surprise you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've been there once before, with a similar geared group.  We even took down the hard named Kyv how has the TZ style AE (4min+ fight, had 11.5k/2800AC Pally tanking).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The camp called the 4 is really easy. Named are Granitesmash (labled #1 of the 4) Dragorn Laborer (#2) Ornaia the Foul (#3) and Kyv Bowhound (#4). The group that i had take em out was shaman (me) 67 mage, 65 cleric and 70 wiz. All elemental (no Time gear between all of us). We had the mage pet tank and could do so easily when slowed and cleric healing. I was even able to heal the pet with the mage helping when the cleric went afk, although i hesitate to do so on a named. All the named are single pullable even if it looks like they arent. Great farmable spot but all the loot is dropping in price. Still worth looking into. Hope that helps. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I managed to keep up a paladin with 4.5K unbuffed HP while healing and slowing at the '4' camp (known as statue camp on AB) against the normal mobs and the nameds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Any normal named are easy, just watch any ukuns, nocs and kyvs elites or named they have a 700ish proc which procs often, even a 11k tank can lose half his hitpoints on pull. If the tank dies just root mob and res, only the named summon.<br />
<br />
I'm done with RCoD now, how hard is PG in comparison?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There is a large gap between RCoD and MPG. EVERYTHING in MPG summons as far as I could tell. They all are around level 70, named higher. Some see-invis but for the most part its safe to run around except for named. Everything seems pretty resistant too, even after malos i would still get two or three resists on turgurs. GoD slow would obviously help but intrest in GoD farmin is about zero right now. Pulling seems easy enough, monk was able to chain pull. Some really nice drops come from there for shaman. A shoulder piece and a ring that i know of and have gotten. Those two seem to rott quite a bit so if you just hang out around the camps, u'll get one. MPG requires a good tank and a cleric or REALLY uber druid. Normal stuff hits for around 1k and very, very fast. With 6.5k hp, i died very quickly when the tank went down. The exp is worth it though, best group exp i have found in OoW. Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I just want to say a lot of people from my guild live in this zone and I am one of them. The camps and loot are very good and the quests you can do with warmly loyalist faction rock. You can quest for  a neck slot, earring, 2 rings, a range slot, and all the tier one armor rares. My alternate magelo profile has a lot of the quested items in it if anyone is interested. I figure these items are a good way to gear up for elementals since my guild skipped ssra and VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Melkiah, sir, you are amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The 4 camps I have heard also called The Statue camp . <br />
<br />
Great camp, but be aware that someone might come steal Bowhound camp, as it is not in the same valley.</div></div><hr />
