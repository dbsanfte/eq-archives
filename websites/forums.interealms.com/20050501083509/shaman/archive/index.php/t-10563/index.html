<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">god help me.  I am considering getting MGB.<br />
<br />
I have focus of the 7th.  I am in a guild that has been 2.5 groups or so for a very long time.   Recently we have grown a bit and are now getting about 3.5 groups on our biggest raids.<br />
<br />
The other shaman with Souls doesn't play as often as I do, and the other shaman in my guild (Gwain!) claims to be doing Canni5 before levelling to 62.  Bastard.<br />
<br />
The problem is, I can't get 3 Fo7 casts on one tank of mana, unless I use Cann5 and then I am still needing to do another group and stamina on everyone.  This annoys me.  I am also in a position where I am, more often than I might like, playing a cleric on raids and just having Henora come to buff.  So I am looking for a way to reduce my stress, doing shaman buffs and cleric buffs = oh so much fun.  We are still working on getting a copy of HoV but we have an MGB cleric, so when we do cleric buffing will speed up from already fast, to like faster than I can get everyone buffed with shaman stuff.<br />
<br />
It seems like it would be much more fun to MGB 7, then canni5 and do grp sta on everyone and be done.<br />
<br />
<br />
So my questions are:<br />
what's the refresh on MGB again?<br />
<br />
If you had fo7 and only needed to buff, at most, 4 groups regularly, would you find MGB a good investment?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For reference, I have 90something AA, including SCM3, QB3, ND3, etc.  You can look in my magelo for specifics.<br />
<br />
Help me.  AA is easy, but 9 points is still a lot.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just purchased MGB this week and I'm glad I did. HOWEVER! I am frequently on raids with 50+ people, and I'm the only shaman with fo7. For max 4 group raids, I wouldn't bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont have MGB, but i hate it when im the only shaman, and have to buff several groups.  Even 4 groups can be alot of spell casting.  MGB would help IMO.  It speeds things up, lessens your workload, while still getting the job done, etc.  You have most the good AA's anyway :)  <br />
<br />
I say get MGB, because you never know when its really gonna come in handy.  The reuse is 72 minutes btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehe having the same problem henora.<br />
I had 5 AA banked and had no idea what to do.<br />
I asked the guild if they wanted, no help at all there.<br />
So I bought SC instead :)<br />
After I got SC I decided that once I have a copy of Fo7 I'll go for mgb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Totally off topic, but your sig is absolutely hilarious Fattn. You play on Innoruuk, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">3.5 groups is essentially 4 groups when doing group buffs.<br />
I think you will find it is well worth the 9aa to your guild (and your sanity) to reduce your buff times.<br />
I frequently find myself the only Shaman on 4-9 group raids.<br />
I can run down MGB Focus (still Khura atm :(), sta, agi with on stategic can5. Then I can start singling FoS and IoS as needed and can5 comes back up. Nine groups it helps to have a Bard and Necro feeding you and a Cleric to Cheal you over torporing to speed things up even more (and of course KEI or higher).<br />
Another nice addition to that is a low level horse.<br />
<br />
All-in-all I think once you grind out MGB you wont have cause to regret it and your guild will love you for it. Faster Prep, faster recovery after a wipe, etc.<br />
<br />
MGB timer is just over an hour (72 min).<br />
<br />
Fair warning though make sure you announce when you plan to MGB enough ahead of time and that people are actually in range.<br />
After a few death threats from my Clerics I give them enough time to get out of range now ;)<br />
Plus there is always at least one person who decides to go oor during buffs and when you give warning they have no excuses.<br />
<br />
Well prolly a lot you already know and more than you asked for ;)<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Totally up to you.  Although I think that your guild's ambivalent response to your query says a lot.  They would know if they needed MGB.  <br />
Personally I would say that 4 group raids is not enough to worry about MGB.  However, if you commonly join forces with other small guilds to take out large PoP targets for flagging, you might consider MGB.  <br />
<br />
Once again, it's a worthless skill unless you raid and raid in a big way.</div></div><hr />

That says it all ... yes , get it ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i dont have MGB yet but i can jenaraly buff 4 -5 group's easy<br />
what i do is cast FO7th on one group then canni 5 then cast it on next group each time rebuffing my FO7th and healing me by doing this i can just scweek out 4 group's worth of buffs wait about 30 sec and canni 5 repop's with KEI and bard song it dosent take long to get mana back agen for other buff's<br />
<br />
<br />
one resone i still done have MGB is im in a guild with about 7 other shm 2 of witch are alwas on raid with me<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally I love mgb. Currently only shaman in the guild with 7th and we do some fairly large raids at times.<br />
<br />
MGB virtue, 7, 9, symbol and the raids ready to go. It's great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hehe I have MGB and I couldn't play without..<br />
I m in a raiding guild, I was asked to get MGB before any other AA (even cani5) and I don't regret that.<br />
Buffing 12+ group with Fo7 at the same time worth the 9 AA.<br />
Now for buffing 3 or 4 groups, I know I would use MGB to save mana / time but I know some that prefer casting single instead of MGB for just 4 groups. <br />
For me, it's just easier.. click mass group buff, cast spell, unmem buff, cani5, ready for action !<br />
<br />
72 min refresh seems long, but we rarely wipe before it poped back so it's ok ). Also, without AA or focus, Fo7 last 1.20 hour.. I usually use the MGB timer to refresh Fo7 before it fades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Back before I quit the raiding scene I loved having massive group buff. Didnt think it would be that great till I got it, then wow, it saved me tons of time and stress. Of course I havent used it in 6months now heh but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Go ahead and get MGB.  When doing buffs, do the group stamina first, then just as you hit enough mana to cast Fo7 pop MGB and cast Fo7.  You will get done much quicker that way than doing MGB first.  Doing MGB Fo7 first is bad because it will wipe out all of your mana.<br />
<br />
From your Magelo I see you got about 4k mana, so doing MGB Fo7 first will take 3800 mana leaving you with only 200 mana.   Now if you first cast 4 casts of Tali of Boar (525 mana each) you'll use ~2100 mana, leaving you 1900 mana, which is just enough to cast Fo7, which is all MGB checks for.   So cast ToB, pop MGB, cast Fo7, then hit Canni V bringing you up to about 25% mana.  Shouldn't take more than 6 mins or so to get everyone full buffed and you back to full mana.<br />
<br />
Reuse time is 72 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Definately get MGB.  Back when PoP first came out I was thinking about whether or not to get it and decided to hold off for a bit.  My guild already had 3 shamans with MGB, so i figured that I wouldn't ever need it.  Then, one night, I had to keep 7 groups buffed through a 6 hour session in NToV all by myself.  Once we were done, I went straight to valor, abandoned SCR at stage 1, and got 6 more aa points to finish out MGB.  Very glad I did it.  Even if you aren't in a large guild, it is still a nice skill to have.  You never know when you might find a pickup raid to go to where you'll wish you had it.  This week, a guild was clearing pog for tunare, but by the time they finished clearing it was 3 am and they didn't enough people on to kill her.  Thus, they let all the other high end guilds know that they needed some people to come and drop tunare.  The loot was OPEN CLASS LOTTO, so of course I went ;)  I was the only shaman there with MGB, and I'm very glad I had it then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, MGB is nice.<br />
<br />
We don't have a single fo7 copy in the guild, alas, and only I have a copy of talisman of the boar.<br />
<br />
So recently, since we get raids of six or seven groups of late.... the other shaman mgb fospirit, I mgb boar, then we hit the key players with fosoul.... with my scrm, my boar wears off four minutes after her EE III spirit, which makes for a nice buffing break....<br />
<br />
Would absolutely love fo7. Single buffing fosoul is a royal pain in the patoie. Not to mention all the people who send tells demanding it, when you explain, if you're not on the MT list, you don't get. Never seen it for sale. Don't have anywhere near the 150k people want for malos of all things, so doubt I would be able to afford. Explained to a malos hawker that malo gets overridden by malosini and malosinia so fast, that malos isn't worth 150k... he didn't get it... but I aint paying that much for that, I've got malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">MGB is cool if you have Fo7, you don't really need to MGB group boar since it easy buff 10 group with boar with canni5 and boar doesn't last long enough for next MGB; <br />
<br />
I don't have Fo7 and tank complaint about why I buff them with Khura focus(dumn lazy shaman heh) ,I been buff 9 groups with single Soul everyone, that take like 10-15minutes lol <br />
<br />
anyway MGB is really worth it to save your time when buff 2+ group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A hint for anyone who may not have noticed it, to maximize the reuse time on mgb....<br />
<br />
The MGB reuse timer starts when you press the button, not when you cast the spell.  Whenever I get to raid setup point, or get rezzed after a wipeout, I try to hit the mgb button right away.  Depending on circumstances, by the time everyone is actually gathered and/or rezzed for me to cast the buff, the timer has already been ticking for a while, and it gives me a much faster refresh.  If you're in a situation where you won't be casting any group buffs for an hour or so, you can pretty much do two mgbs back to back, ie for Focus and Talisman of Epuration/Tribunal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can probably buff 5 groups with Khura's Focusing and Talisman of the Brute faster than a Cleric regains mana from MGB BoA. So what's the point in getting MGB if I have to wait for the Clerics anyway?<br />
Sure it's annoying to permacanni while buffing, but buffing is part of our job, and there's MANY more aa's that make more sense for a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Honestly MGB is the best AA investment I've made so far.  I am in a small guild that is part of an alliance.  There has been many times that I was either the only shaman at a raid or the only one with Khura's Focusing.  Even now that we have a couple other 60+ shaman, MGB still makes life MUCH easier on all of us.  I will usually focus bomb the raid party while they take care of any other buffs.  By the time the buffing is done, everyone (including the clerics) are up to full mana.  We just set it up to have the clerics start with BoA casting first unless we have our 1 MGB enabled cleric bot there.<br />
<br />
Recast time on MGB I believe is 1 hour 12 minutes.  It has generally worked out that even in the event of a wipe, MGB is back up in time for rebuff.  Within 3 minutes after MGB, I'm gtg again.  (No I don't have Canni V yet.  Still 1.5 points away)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">at least you have Fo7 :p<br />
<br />
yeah MGB is painful but its worth it.<br />
<br />
You can MGB the whole bazaar with uber uber dexterity!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">most guilds with requirments ask for MGB.  Personally, I find it an essential part of your character as it benefits everyone.  Besides, 9AA isn't really that difficult to accumulate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm having trouble deciding whether to go for Cann V or MGB first.  Cann V is obviously better for soloing/grouping, but I am frequently on raids with 10-12 groups.<br />
<br />
We have 4-5 active shaman and at least one other has MGB, so it's not crucial to the guild or anything.  But it would be really nice after a full or partial wipe to have a second shaman with MGB to help rebuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">C5 for sure, if you have Torpor.  It's amazing, and it will help you get MGB faster.  The reverse is not true.<br />
<br />
MGB is great as well.  You're never going to say, &quot;Damn, I sure wish I couldn't buff this entire raid in one cast.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Henora,<br />
<br />
You and I are in the same spot. My guild is 3 groups max or so, and I have Fot7. Honestly, I wish I had never scribed it. Feral Avatar or Quiescence would be much more helpful to me, and I probably could have worked a trade with someone in a bigger guild.<br />
<br />
Like your cleric, I have a 62 enchanter as well (played and leveled by me and on the same account). I am frequently having to log in my enchanter to buff c3, but usually find that Ximix is more valuable to play in raiding and grouping situations. <br />
<br />
I have not been able to bring myself to buy MGB either. I have about 70 aa on Ximix, and I am currently working on SCRM. After I finish that up, my tanking aas seem like a better investment than MGB to me. ND, CA, CS, LR etc. I guess I will wait until I find that I REALLY wish I had it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I regularly do 5-6+ group raids as only shaman (or only focus shaman), our alliance is just into tier3, (killed Grummus, aerin'dar and AOW this weekend etc; regularly clear NtoV etc)<br />
<br />
In these situations alone MGB has paid for itself many times over, takes a lot of time out of the buffing process, and I can blow 6k mana and buff 5 groups with khura's/group boar in about 3 mins and be ready to fight.<br />
<br />
It's most valuable when 'racing' or mobilising fast for a target<br />
<br />
*Bang* MGB KEI/AEGO/FOCUS raid moves, fill in the crap as we clear trash ;)<br />
<br />
Personally i would kill for a copy of Fo7, have only got one rune so far (seen a few drop), thankfully that was Quiesence ;) When we have a good percentage of our shamans turn up (ie: 3+ 62 on a raid) all the melees will get souls and I will 'bank' MGB in case of a wipe etc ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heh, just get it so you don't have to think about it anymore. That's why I ended up doing it, and I had about as many AA as you do currently when I made that decision. And besides, from here on out nothing will ever cost you more than 6 points!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Jaradis - thanks for the reply, that one sealed the deal.  Thanks for the tip on order.<br />
<br />
Gonna start working on it this week.  Thanks everyone for your advice. <br />
<br />
BTW - racing is the main reason I am interested.  Convenience for me is a close second.   We are in a high competition group these days and we need to be fast.   We've always been pretty good at quick mobilization and I would like to keeep it that way.  This weekend, we zoned in to Kael, cleared mobs while doing full buffs, pulled Vindi, looted and AE trans'd out in less than 30 mins... with less than 20 people on our 5th kill, which made me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">first off, someone asked about  MGB or cann5 first, cann5 all the way. its shouldnt be a question, cann5 does SOO much more.<br />
<br />
Regarding MGB, i got it when my guild was averaging 4-5 groups we now average 6-8 groups.  it was awesome then its awesome now.  I think its very worth it.  We still dont have a Fo7 in the guild, go go 4 copies of malos.  and even with 3 shamans casting FoSouls on the tanks its still takes time.  Its a time saver its super convient it saves a lot of unneeded stress.  Sure a shaman can technicly buff the entire raid without MGB but the difference is amazing.  i recomend it.</div></div><hr />
