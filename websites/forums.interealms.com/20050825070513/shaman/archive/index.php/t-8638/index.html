<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sandadarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im lvl 37 shaman and I have no clue where I should hunt. Kunark is too difficult for me and im to laggy anywhere in luclin. Any ideas?:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hrm, though not a lot of people (atleast on the Brell server) Xp in the lower levels in old world here are some ideas for the 37-40ish range, First you could try to find a grp in Lower Guk it is a pretty decent dungeon with lots to kill and plenty of ways to get totally lost for days LOL or you could pop on over to Permafrost (i havent had a lot of experience with hunting here :P ) but if you say that Kunark is too hard because of trying to find a grp you could very easly solo in both Fronteer Mountians or at the Golras in Timorious Deep or with a little more diffucluty the Tundra Yeti in DL. In short there are alot of places you could hunt but i am not really clear on what your specific problem is with Kunark (though i totally understand the Lag issues in SoL) Please eather post what your issues with RoK is or contact me in game (by serverwide tell if nessisary) I play M-F from about 1800-2230 and am on as my shaman Ssarahh or my necro Terro. another option is to sift threw these pages and see if something might interest you this board is unsurpassed on its information for where to go when and with whom....<br />

Enjoy and Happy hunting!!</div></div><hr />
