<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings.<br />
<br />
I think the time has come for me to remove myself from the position of Correspondent.  I find that my time spent is not producing worthwhile, or even noticeable dividends with regards to the Shaman class in EQ.<br />
<br />
Since I will be &quot;highly unlikely&quot; to continue in EQ when EQ 2 is released, I think it's best if I do this now rather than later.<br />
<br />
I had hoped to give this &quot;experiment&quot; six months to work.  I had hoped to see progressively more response, communication and positive change as a result of this.  I have given it three, and I have been very disappointed.<br />
<br />
I am not leaving EQ, nor my Shaman, at present.  I am simply taking a less visible role, in expectation of leaving completely when EQ 2 goes retail.<br />
<br />
I'd like to thank all the folks who have encouraged me over the last three months, your thoughts are appreciated.  I'd like to thank those who have disagreed with me, you forced me to constantly evaluate my perceptions to be sure they were accurate.<br />
<br />
I hope that things change.  I know, and have tried my best to communicate to Sony, what the problems facing the Shaman class are.  While things may be temporarily alleviated by the current expansion, the overall problems still exist and will exist until truly addressed.<br />
<br />
It's been a fun ride, but as the end of my ride here nears, I choose to spend it enjoying what I can and ignoring what I can't.  I wish you all the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for what you've done Sud.  I can imagine how much crap 'help' SoE has given you, especially if it's anything like that i've seen from the dev's at the EQlive boards. <br />
<br />
I hope you can enjoy the rest of your life in EQ while you have it.<br />
<br />
Wish ya the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for trying.  It is sad, but not unexpected that this experiment was a failure.  SOE doesn't understand the current situation with shaman, doesn't want to understand, and doesn't want to fix it.  If they did, they would have listened to the shaman community and addressed the issues presented.  Instead, we see other classes make exponential leaps forward in power and abilities, and we lag even further behind.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Otani</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry to see you go man :/ I'm sure you put in a lot of time and effort that we didn't see and I hope you don't think that it's all been wasted.<br />
<br />
As far as what SoE has done, I think they have turned this a bit more to what I was looking for.  Some Positive things they've given us:<br />
1- Longer fights with mobs that dont have the DPS of Gates mobs.<br />
2- Buffs that mean something.  Sense and Might are very cool<br />
3- Group Avatar<br />
4- Summon Corpse gives us lots of utility if the cleric gets wiped or if we are tag team healers with a druid and no rezzer (my standard group of Druid, Shaman, Rogue, Sk, Monk, Wiz).<br />
<br />
I'm not saying they are done fixing shaman I'm just saying they have made a few changes that have me very happy as of late.  I'm having more fun now than ever before and I feel like I'm usefull again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ1 and EQ2 are, at the moment, completely separate development teams.<br />
<br />
I base my desire to play EQ2 solely on my knowledge of that game and not upon my EQ1 experiences.  It looks fun.  It looks &quot;fresh&quot;.<br />
<br />
If I'm wrong, there are other games in the pipe.  EQ1 will always hold a special place in my memory, but soon I think it will be time for it to be just that, a memory.<br />
<br />
Not yet.  But soon.<br />

I really believe you gave it your all and SoE did little to support you.  I do truely hope that the efforts you put in will keep the shaman class alive still until SoE decides contraction is necessary (look at BL vs shaman epics to see the reasoning behind that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a question for you.<br />
<br />
Are you stepping down from the post due to a lack of SoE's meeting of your expectations. Or because of outside influances like time and such?<br />
<br />
Or in other words has SoE failed you?<br />
<br />
Also. Since you are stepping down I just want to say thank you. We are an unruly bunch but you have handled yourself in a classy manner, despite some hardballs lobbed at you from time to time.<br />
<br />
I will be sad to see you go. And even sadder because noone will be able to comport themselves in quite the same manner. <br />

I am sure it must have been a tough position and grats to you for sticking with it for three months.  Who knows, maybe they will do something with out top ten list eventually.  But to be fair, OOW is a significant improvement over Gates (Bane actually ran full duration and I was main healer in the group last night :-)  I am still having some fun in EQ1 but will probably try EQ2 as many of my friends have left EQ1 but are planning on trying EQ2.  I am sure EQ2 will be interesting for a little while just because it will be new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
on the other hand you do realise that eq2 is still a SOE project, separate dev team or not they still are the lamest game company I have ever run across in the customer service and support departments. <br />
<br />
cancelled eq and theres no way in hell I am buying eq2 unless it comes equiped with a nice blowjob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">To answer Snoww:  <br />
<br />
I think I see what you are driving at, and I'm not sure this will answer your question, but let me take a stab.  <br />
<br />
My &quot;beef&quot; with the whole situation I suppose boiled down to communication.  My definition vs SOE's definition.<br />
<br />
In my little world, communication is a two way street.  There are two parties involved.  In order for communication to occur, both sides must both listen carefully and respond in a meaningful way.<br />
<br />
I suppose SOE only disagrees with my definition in adjectives.  Their definition seems to be In order for communication to occur, both sides must both listen and respond.<br />
<br />
I guess it's a matter of degrees.<br />
<br />
Allow me to close with an example.  Please don't dissect this as anything but an example of &quot;a breakdown in communication&quot;.<br />
<br />
Say I present a very thought out, fact based explanation of where Shaman healing was in the past and is in the present.  I've shown how Shaman were once able to function as MH for a party.  I've shown why that is no longer the case in many instances.<br />
<br />
My extremely well stated, fact based statement of something I (and the community) felt was broken is met with &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Currently being evaluated&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do not feel as though that is &quot;communication&quot;.  I can reguritate those answers ad infinitum and say nothing.<br />
<br />
SOE on the other hand feels as though that is acceptable communication.<br />
<br />
Your choice as EQ customers is to accept SOE's definition of communication and go forward, knowing that this is all you can expect.<br />
<br />
Or you can move on.<br />
<br />
While it is true I am not moving on at this point, I am certainly moving forward as soon as the opportunity to do so is there.  Some argue that I am still staying with SOE.  While that may be true, I am no longer supporting (at that point) a game which I feel is &quot;broken&quot;.  I am supporting a game I hope is not.<br />
<br />
Companies don't make games, people do.  I am &quot;gambling&quot; if you will, on the &quot;people&quot; who are making EQ 2, not the company who will publish it.  I may be wrong.  If I am, I can easily move on.<br />
<br />
The only thing SOE has &quot;lost&quot; at this point is my loyalty.  I will go where I go because I enjoy it.  For now, I am enjoying my last few weeks (months?) of EQ 1.  I hope to enjoy EQ 2 for a while.  If I don't . . . SOE will lose my &quot;vote&quot; completely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will play it because I believe that it will not suck from the outset.  Future development (or lack thereof) may cause it to suck, but I believe it will be enjoyable in the beginning.<br />

I think SOE must have some secret corporate plans with EQ compared to EQ2. Everything else doesnt make sense. I just dont think their plans will work since they managed to aggravate and infurate so many customers with their insistence on catering to raid-only culture in EQ.<br />

Not nice to be invited to help, and then told by SOE to shut up and go away because they aren't listening to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Well, I am sorry to see you leave this position Su. I think you made a difference. The shaman class is not easy to define, most of the people posting here cannot even agree on a pure definition of our &quot;role&quot;. That being said, trying to communicate the issues to SOE had to be a difficult task. <br />
<br />
But, something got through. There is absolutely no question that the game is purposely better for shaman. Its not an accident. The adjustments made in OoW have put us back into the &quot;Top 5&quot; IMHO, and you WERE a part of that process Su, even if it felt like you were talking to a wind-up brick-wall (I love mixed metaphors, LOL). Lets just take a look at what has been adjusted:<br />
<br />
- Longer fights, mobs have more HPs. Slow matters. DOTs run. There is time to get nukes in. <br />
- Buffs that people want. I get non-stop tells on Raids for Sense and Might.<br />
- Heals are approaching the level we want them to be. Sure they arent there, but what did we expect? We asked for $100.00, they gave us $75.00. I can live with that. <br />
- Damage upped across the board on our new spells. Again, we asked for 100, got 75, maybe 50 this time, but its better than nothing.<br />
- Quality AAs that actually help. The roup, MGBable HoT (popped this the other day in a messy WoS pull, everyone was like &quot;Whats Ancestral Aid, did Druids get SotW upgrade?&quot; Yeah, I got some &quot;in-the-dark&quot; folks in my guild, but they are good people!) the rez, the HoT crit-tic, more healing, more nuking, more DOT crits.<br />
- The possibility that we will actually get a pet worth more than a mid-40s disease DOT for DPS and tanking (when they get around to fixing it).<br />
<br />
All these things add up to Shaman being a MUCH better class balance-wise vs the content. Yeah, we can compare ourselves to some other classes and still come up short, but overall, I think we are back. <br />
<br />
And Su, I think you had something to do with it. You dissected the multitude of opinions, ideas, rants, etc, you gathered them up, refined them, distilled them, and gave them to SOE. It may have seemed like they didn't listen, but I think they did. I realize its discouraging to talk to a wall, but if the wall moves as a result of your conversation, then you have accomplished something. <br />
<br />
Thank you Su, for helping us to put Shaman back on the map in this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You seem to have had bad experiances with SoE on their lack of addressing many ingame issues.  (I would agree)  Leads me to wonder why would you go to EQ2??  You know they won't change.  Their CS will still be the worst in the gaming industry bugs will go unfixed for years...  Also remeber SoE didn't develop Everquest.  The people that did no longer work for th EQ team and havn't for along time.  SoE inheritied a great game and slowly is making it worse and worse.  <br />
<br />
Star wars galixies is a game they themselves produced and made ... And as you can see that did so wel (SARCASIM ! !! !! ! !!)  SoE created and developed lords of everquest and that did even better ( AGAIN EVEN MORE SACASIM)<br />
<br />
I still like playing EQ but more and more of the things I like leave every week.  I will never play another SoE game after EQ</div></div><hr />

You are right, I do not appreciate the manner in which  in game issues are addressed.  However, what I've seen of EQ 2 at this point leads me to believe that there will be less need to address in game issues.<br />
<br />
What do I care about their customer service if I never need to use it?</div></div><hr />

What do I care about their customer service if I never need to use it?<br />
<br />
You see what they want you to see =) hence the point of advertising.  It could be a very good game.  But it is virtually impossible to create any program that large without many bugs poping up throughout its life time.  Speaking as a Computer Engineer it just isn't possible.  So inevitably they will be faced with in game bugs and issues they will have to resolve, and to me they have shown a great lack of the ability to do so.<br />
<br />
Anyway though I won't clutter up your farewell post any more.  Have fun with EQ2.</div></div><hr />

I have had almost zero problems in game that are showstoppers. Way back when Me and a group were camping the Froglok hunters for seblis keys and one would spawn under the world. A Gm came after about 30 45 minutes and I explained to him how and why. And sure enough he warped to the hunter and depopped it for us. <br />
<br />
Another time We were camping plane of storms for the Diaku medallions. when they bugged the zone and all the placeholders got stuck in the mesa's I figured out how to get them out. I died alot. But I got it to work on a regular basis and avoided Gm interaction. <br />
<br />
Another time a friend was stuck under the world. And no GM around and no petition was being awnsered. I got a mage to come call him out. <br />
<br />
Another time My shadowknight got stuck in paineel in the tower with no exit. I snuck down there with my thief and handed the sk a gate potion.<br />
<br />
The customer service has gone downhill yeah but when things go kerplunk I tend to find an awnser myself. <br />
<br />
What pisses me off is the Out of game customer service. The lack of communication and the contempt that the developers hold towards thier customer base. I know we are the end users. and all End users are idiots to programmers, but If I was a GM in a pen and paper game and Noone was happy with the game I wouldnt have players. <br />
<br />
That is the Developers problem primarily. They are 3rd year GM's that have gone through all the classic mistakes that new GM's go through. Monty haul campaigns. Treating the players as the enemy. Favored monsters rather than balanced adventures.  <br />
<br />
GMing or creating adventures is as much art as science. It depends on interaction between the creator and the (Muhahaha) poor bastards you are about to run through it. You will get filler rooms, encounters that are simply something to do while they progress. And many other types of things with new GM's that don't understand their players.<br />
<br />
The crazy thing is SoE has some of the best chances for ideas coming in every second of every day. The message boards both the offical ones and the Player ones are fonts of incredible ideas. That SoE ignores because of the noise to signal ratio.  Thier failings to take advantage of that is primarily a failing of  thier corporate culture.<br />
<br />
To truly show that they are intrested and care they need to start by getting a rep from each class who can give real awnsers and adress them in a timly manner. Then they need to take a dev and task them with the archtypes and start towards fixing them properly. The fact that they have offered placebo after placebo and instead of concrete awnsers just shows that they don't really know what the hell they are doing. <br />
<br />
They did a good job with omens. As long as they can follow it up with the older issues there will be a good future for EQ 1 But I tell you right now EQ 2 hold very little intrest for me as it stands. I play EQ because of the history and because of the friendships I have made. I put up with SoE for the same reasons. I have none of that with EQ 2. And no reason to put up with SoE for that game and 1 huge reason to never put up with them, thier track record that I have personally experianced over the last 5 years.<br />

This is a pretty key point, some other fabulous games stretched out their shelf-life by YEARS simply by being receptive to the ideas of the people playing. Doom and Quake, Starcraft, Half-Life, Tribes, etc etc all have had significant contributions made by PLAYERS, for FREE. <br />
<br />
I will give SOE some credit in this department though. They have taken some of the ideas we see in 3rd party programs and incorporated them into the game. They have built on ideas from other MORPGS and used them in EQ. But honestly, they could do better, and these &quot;class reps&quot; were the PERFECT oppertunity to get a massive influx of brainstorming with very little financial committment. <br />
<br />
Considering it wold seem SOE operates from a &quot;pure bottom line&quot; standpoint in many of their decisions, this particular deficiency doesnt make good corporate sense.</div></div><hr />

I won't be going to EQ 2, played around a bit with the cheapie character creation disk and was really horrified at how UGLY the models were. I really think the original EQ models were better looking!<br />
<br />
I tried for over an hour to make an attractive Barbarian female - all of my attempts ended up looking like they had Down's Syndrome, huge linebacker shoulders and man hands. I also think they did a terrible job on the woad - please see that chick in King Arthur for an example of cool woad.<br />
<br />
I tried with wood elves, high elves, humans...the hair looked goofy, the elves were fat. For all the modifications to faces, there was very little actual deviation in faces, nothing like how different the faces looked in even the original EQ. <br />
<br />
No ability to get true red hair, we lost tons of eye color choices (no violet eyes?), very difficulty to use the color palette to get the tops/bottoms of the newbie outfit to match (really need the ability to enter RBG here).<br />

Developers are just developers.<br />
<br />
People keep pinning things on the &quot;developers&quot; (&quot;devs&quot;) but if you do that, you are admitting that you have no idea how corporations or massive projects are operated.<br />
<br />
Developers code what they are told to code.  They say what they are told to say.  They fix what they're told to fix, whether they know it exists or not.  Most &quot;developers&quot; I know *never* talk to the customer-base.... that is left for reps or project managers.  The fact that you all expect the devs to come on here and divulge their guts is rather funny.  Developers are &quot;low man on totem pole&quot; in these types of things.<br />

I think you correctly identified what is wrong with the corporate mentality when applied to games. A game has to have a substantial creative and interactive component which means you need someone who can see how the code and the game combine, and has the power to make decisions on that basis.<br />
<br />
With SOE whenever we meet a developer it's painfully clear that they don't understand the game well enough. The CSR &quot;fronts&quot; don't understand either code or game, but then their just damage control. However (and yes, this is more than a little fanboyish) go read some of Enoyls posts on the blizzard beta board. This is a person who can connect the world of game and code and has the authority to speak. I can still disagree with his decisions, but at least I can see the logic. I suspect the EQ &quot;vision&quot; period might have been similar, but that was before my time.<br />
<br />
Here's a quickie link incidentally;<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/thread-search.aspx?ForumName=wow-general&amp;Author=EnoYls&amp;Cluster=WoW<br />
<br />
Now if EQ had developers like that my confidence in the long term viability of the game would... un, exist. Which is more than I currently have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Well, kinda...  <br />
<br />
&quot;developer it's painfully clear that they don't understand the game well enough&quot;<br />
<br />
This is where you need to change your thinking.  The developers know this game better than you can imagine... that doesn't mean they can do anything about it.  I mean technically *they can*, but that's not how it works in a corporation.  Hiring a developer just to fix things isn't standard.  They hire developers to develop new functionality, ideally.  My applications aren't perfect, and I could spend almost 100% of my time going back and perfecting and adding new functionality to them, but my corporation doesn't want that.  In their eyes, the application is out there, it works (for the most part), and they want their money spent towards me developing new stuff that they can put in their metrics.  Corporate politics.  And there is nothing you can do about it really... everything is about the bottom-line, about results... &quot;Fixing things&quot; isn't highly visible in quarterly metrics and statistics.  New development is.  Cost savings is.  Etc...<br />
<br />
It's not like you have people just sitting there waiting to fix things.  Our team does not have a designated &quot;maintenance guy&quot; who goes around cooing with the customers and fixing problems...  as much as we all would love to have a guy like that, there is no room in the budget for that.  If something comes up in an existing application, the developer must then put his current new application on hold while he fixes the old one, and that doesn't make boss happy.<br />
<br />
My point is, blaming the developers is like blaming the drywall hanger in a construction project for a building that leans to the east 3 degrees.  Everyone is pointing to the wrong people.  Which actually says a lot about the customer base... they recognize something wrong, but aren't informed enough to know who is actually responsible, so then you got customers who look like idiots.  You need to look higher up the chain if you're unsatisfied with a product.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes people do both.  Still, don't confuse the developer with the programmer.  The people we should (and do) blame are generally the developers.  In fact, you're generally right on the money when you abuse that asshat Rytan.  He handles most of our spells, and he can come up with some justification (usually wrong) as to why some anti-shaman piece of **** code should be put in, or kept in.  Yes, I'm serious.

<br />
There are systems analysts and systems engineer and systems designers for what you describe...  but developers code code code.<br />
<br />
They might bleed over a bit.. as a developer I've done some design and some engineering.. but my main focus was writing code to do what other people wanted to do, and I'd give my advice for performance and ease-of-use, all of which they could ignore which happened quite frequently.</div></div><hr />

The problem starts when the business decision is made to release a product with buggy code. Buggy code can be fixed, if management decides to do so. The other associated problem they have is in quality assurance. Code just isn't properly tested before being pushed live, and that's a business decision, not a technical one.</div></div><hr />

At the bottom of his post, he posts exactly what I'm trying convey --- he's only a programmer, not a designer, although he can give input or redirect ideas to the &quot;right people&quot;:<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I'm just a programmer here, and I don't speak for the design team, but I'm trying to help make sure that the solution to the problem we have decided to fix is the best of the available options. I'd rather just see the system behave in a way that is fun and not exploitable. <br />
<br />
My current favorite solution to this problem is to add a new component to the PBAE line that would give the NPC a random chance to have the ability to summon the person who landed the DOT on it that granted this ability (ie the bard). Seems like if we did this, the spells could be left largely intact and it would stop PBAE from being the problem it is. And bards wouldn't ever have a reason to stand still (I don't like that part either)<br />
<br />
If you have other suggestions that are different from the ones proposed above, please let me know. I'll try my best to keep up with this thread and to forward useful comments to the right people. <br />
<br />
He's just a programmer, and honestly he's going above and beyond what a developer needs to do when he relays info from design meetings to the customers...  it's not Grumbuk's &quot;job&quot;.  Of course coding and design go hand-in-hand and they work closely together, but a developer is not a designer.</div></div><hr />

sorry poguk, as developer myself i highly counter this equation.<br />
<br />
a developer is waaayyy more than a coder.<br />
you can put a trained monkey in front of a computer and let him code stuff, thats just training for the fingers for a good developer<br />
developer is way more, its leading projects, solving technical problems of a larger scale than just in one class/subpart of a program, to have the knowledge and experience to anticipate possible problems that could arise while implementing the program, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
so developer != coder by far.<br />
but yeah, i doubt that soe-devs have the last word in design-questions, but they definitely will have an influence. And sometimes i am really sorry for them when i read lines like &quot;it would take 5 minutes to implement this or that&quot;, because that just proves that the guys posting it most often have no clue about complex programming and the consequences of the legendary &quot;5-minute-fixes&quot;, hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dev - Any of the people who get paid to work on EQ.  Could be ANYONE . . . they even consider their CSR's (Brenlo &amp; his crew) to be Devs.<br />
<br />
Designer - These are people like Rytan who actually make the decisions about things related to gameplay &amp; content design.<br />
<br />
Artist - responsible for . . . duh.  Art.  Textures, models, etc.<br />
<br />
Programmer - This is people like Grumbuk who do the coding.  They don't make gameplay decisions, they are the ones who implement the gameplay decisions in code.  These are the folks who fixed all the DX9 collision bugs &amp; stuff.<br />
<br />
Love it or lump it, those are the terms that SOE uses.</div></div><hr />
