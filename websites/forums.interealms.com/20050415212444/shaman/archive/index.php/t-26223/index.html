Which targets would you consider for best Shaman drops?<br />
<br />
Here is a link to 5th Anniversary NPC<br />
<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=273<br />
<br />
you can click on them and view 5th anniversary drops and know that the 6th anniversary drops are much better but more difficult to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What targets do you think would be worthwhile for shaman drops, Jandora? I'd much rather evaluate your thoughts than go do your homework for you..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't pull up the page at work but looking at the ae's that where showing up it looks like all the old raid mobs where pushed up. The dragons, vs etc. I'd expect that the fabled versions will be raid mobs too. From the one peice of loot i've seen and the ae's stuff has it's looking like time+ range most likely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That fabled Necklace of Superiority looks really nice. Think Fabled Drusella will be one groupable? =)<br />
<br />
Yes, I suspect that anything with ~125-140hp will be tuned as single groupable because that range is around the elemental mini range. Some of these fabled drops with 250+hp will be a little harder. Maybe only warbear would be able to solo those, the rest of us would require a couple of groups, or a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fabled incarnidine bp is set at approximately the elemental BP level, so I expect that encounter would require a Time RZ/Quarm capable guild raid. There will most likely be a range of encounters though, that would be the high end of them. Most of the fabled mobs will probably be the same as the 5th aniversary ones though, I expect, with some newer ones in Kunark.</div></div><hr />

Its because the clicky effect on the Fabled items are the same as on the older items.  Unfortunatly, this should have been upgraded in the same way that focus effects have been bumped.</div></div><hr />

Not an overly impressive earring, But it is an easy to aquire instant click.  Fabled Grach spawns off of any goblin in the zone just like regular Grach. When I was there there were about 5 people in the goblin fort so I went to smaller camp along the east side of the zone nearish Cabalis, I killed 10-15 spawns (per cycle and had to wait for respawns) and got the earring in about an hour and a half. I saw Fabled Grach up on track in the goblin fort about 4 times in that time period too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went to Seb after the patch, VP'd my way into the crypt and cleared it. The Fabled Baron was up and I very nearly got him too....<br />
<br />
The strategy was to Q the wolf and myself, then charge the named - Nihil stuck, mostly slowed. The pet was proccing Leopard like mad, and I unleashed the wolf pack. Leopard went on each of the wolves, then it was a case of popping SC and chain healing my pet.<br />
<br />
The Baron was down to ~40% by the time the pack melted away and from then on chain healing dogdog was the way to go (he can take a full round if buffed with Wunshi, triple 827 was the highest I saw).<br />
<br />
Then, just as it was going so well, the mob enraged, dogdog dropped in less than a second and Nihil wore off! Splat - free trip to bind.<br />
<br />
However, if you pay attention the Baron is soloable and I'd wager the Arch Duke will have the same stats. <br />
<br />
My stats were 6K HPs self buffed, no other buffs.<br />

Regular Eldak is L50 and drops nothing, Fabled Eldak doubles for 552, is mostly slowable, enrages and (presumably) summons. I used the same tactics as with the Fabled Duke in Seb, but it was overkill - Fabled Eldak was dead before the wolfpack went home.<br />

I was able to solo this guy at 68 with shaman buffs and a KEI.  By the end of the fight I was getting low on mana but I had full hp.  This guy is unrootable so you will have to tank for the entire battle pretty much.  Just dotted, mellee'd and kept SoL on the dog.  You should be able to pull Eldak without pulling the guy standing next to him.  <br />

Just wanted to say that this is a bit of overkill. =) I soloed this guy with a level 65 shaman, no defensive AAs, and Spirit of L. Tanked him in the face. Hit's for around 300, and does not have *that* much hp.  Just be sure to lay a few DoTs on at around 12%, becuse at 8% he starts rampageing and kills dogdog.</div></div><hr />

With Cann V and Q he was simple - pulled with Malos, sent pet, Slowed, Dotted, and Tanked in the face - wash rinse and repeat.  Pet did have Mage toys.<br />
<br />
I was able to Cann V and Q while battling and never got worried - ended the fight with over 60 percent mana each time.<br />

&lt;A  href = &quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82769&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<br />
Fabled Ring of Eldak  x2&lt;/A&gt; ---- From The Fabled Eldak Howlingbear in the Frontier mountains at the back of the giant fort tunnel...&lt;br&gt; He can be done with a 60+ tank and a decent healer.<br />
&lt;a href = &quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82759&quot; target =&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<br />
Fabled Face-Piece of a Medalion &lt;/A&gt; ---- From The Fabled Rotting Skeleton in the Dread Lands, the one for the VP key (he also still drops the peice needed for the VP key) &lt;br&gt; He can be done with a tank and a healer, or a high level tank. He owned me when I tried to solo him. (57 shaman)<br />
&lt;a href =&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82751&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;&gt;<br />
Fabled Tattered Mantle &lt;/A&gt; ---- From The Fabled Gullerback in the Burning Woods. He is a wandering mob, and particularly nasty.&lt;br&gt;He can be done with a decent tank and a cleric. Make sure the tank is 60+. He butchered our group when we tried him. (50 someodd cleric, 52 warrior, 45 ranger, 62 shaman, and 57 shaman)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br />
This is a just an item I dont really use but picked up doing my scavenger hunt.&lt;a href = &quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82744&quot; target =&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fabled Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring &lt;/A&gt; ---- From The Fabled Grachnist the Destroyer in Warslicks Woods. Not really that great of an item, but it has a fun graphic and the clicky is usefull if your going to be doing melee.&lt;br&gt; Can be soloed easily for 45+. &lt;br&gt;<br />
&lt;br&gt;<br />
The shield from Chardok, and the sheild from sebilis are both very nice, and the best target zones for good fabled items would be Charsis and Sebilis.... &lt;br&gt; <br />
Also another nice item for a 50-65 shaman would be: &lt;br&gt;The  &lt;a href = &quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68252&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fabled Mithril Breastplate &lt;/A&gt; ---- It comes from The Fabled Kobold Priest in Nagafen's Lair. &lt;br&gt; This was a very hard mob to take down. We had a high level palladin tanking it and a three cleric CH chain to take it down, and many other people hacking at it. &lt;br&gt; This guy hits like a frieght train (1800+ on me, (yes i died... (twice))). &lt;br&gt; You would need a small raid force or a few level 70's to take this guy down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size = &quot;-2&quot;&gt; Note: the fabled items i have are also in my profile. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I got a Fabled Dragon Hero Bracer off Sev, although in retrospect I probably should've passed on it for a melee, didn't notice the accuracy and strikethrough until it was too late.  See my magelo for stats.   I believe Fayd also drops the same bracer, but can't confirm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Savas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I've ended up getting quite a few upgrades for my shaman, bst, cleric trio.  I've been able to do any fabled thats 65, We tried a fabled 70 in seb herio, Though it would be possible with a few attempts getting down there for them would suck and we didnt try.<br />
<br />
We've gotten the ft ring, tolans, elder spirits gloves, supple scale arm band from kc, as well as a tranq staff.<br />
<br />
We've also gotten the fabled tattered mantles.  FBSS and evil eye bags.    <br />
<br />
Tonight we're going to charsis to try for fabled there.  Hoping to try to get a sash of dragon born and elder spirits shoes.  <br />
<br />
Great upgrades for my nonraiding trio.  Oh and my shaman and bst is 65, clerics 58.  I'm really impressed my bst is taking 1000 hitters now.  We didnt think that was possible.<br />
<br />
Oh and that fabled kobold priest pisses me off to no end.  I wanted to get the bp for my cleric and to see them update him to a 1800 hitter and level 70 is just @#$% wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Fabled aren't real &quot;1000 hitters.&quot;  Besides being Mostly slowable, which is really extraordinary for mobs hitting that hard, their vitals are really low.  AC I mean, resists, and particularly ATK.  A random 600-hitting Wall of Slaughter junk mob puts Fabled dps to shame.  These rare mobs just have a splashy-looking max hit number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Savas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Hey, dont tell me the truth let me live in my deliousnal i trio'd a 1000 hitter on my own!</div></div><hr />

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82715<br />
<br />
i am going to get one for each of my toons...the exstended classes on the fabled make it great (plus the stats and delay is better for when it is actually equiped...)<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82733<br />
<br />
personally i like the idea of being able to summon throwing daggers... this bracer is ep qualilty statwise though<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82718<br />
<br />
i am going to get one of these for each of my toons... neck is an impossable peice to find outside of raids... also, the effect + ac is very nice...<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82704<br />

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=82744<br />

When you go after her, could you let us know how it goes? I am esp. interested in knowing the spawn time of Fabled Dru.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
