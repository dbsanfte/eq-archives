<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Damn it I am upset I have not logged in about a week but I kept up on events.<br />
When I logged last night after having to add numerous lines to my xml files that were broken (thanks SOE) I went to  neriak to see this new &quot;city&quot;.<br />
We got 3 rooms. 3 ROOMS.<br />
<br />
This is a freaking joke. Was it REALLY that hard to make a new zone off inno or sro for example for frog city?<br />
Or even one off guk top (add it liek u added Jaggedpine). Sure Grobb was ghetto but that's what made it fun.<br />
Now we got 3 rooms :(<br />
I at least expected a cave system dug into neriak somethign more homey.<br />
<br />
Didn't realize how much this change sucked till i saw it.<br />
And u can't choose to play as &quot;OLD&quot; froggies which lag less and looked much cooler :( U are stuck with a luclin style model which will add extra lag. BAH<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't think they are planning on keeping the trolls in neriak, atleast thats the vibe that I am getting about this whole situation.  I am thinking the new city may not even be on antonica, something about the multiple mentions of trolls at sea leads me to believe they are heading else where.  Perhaps kunark or something along those lines.</div></div><hr />

 i guess we will find out soon enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If it's anything based on the old maps, there's a little island south of Grobb that's called Broken Skull. I guess you'd have to catch a raft from SRO to get there. Plus, if it's a civil war ('course there's nothing civil about us trolls), Broken Skull clan and Midnight Keep would be at each others' throats. Imagine, newboe trolls killing newbie troll NPCs for experience. Hid E us.<br />
<br />
They finally moved the Grobb Forge to Neriak and called it the TROLL forge....there were already 2 regular forges in Foreign Quarter that were 10 feet apart. No ergonomix going on in that place.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think the trolls will ever be regening there former city (Or there pride *snicker*)<br />
<br />
If you have been to Grobb lately you will notice that they didn't just stuff abunch of frogs inside.<br />
<br />
Hell the frog guards even give directions to certin places if you ask them, why would VI bother if there planning on sticking them someplace else in two weeks. <br />
<br />
Though there are a few things that would make me think they are planing on moving.<br />
<br />
A few quests (That arnt working) require you to retrive items that arnt currently in da swamp (A large severd rat ear for one)<br />
<br />
I have noticed something cool about the frogs, they have buffing NPCs, I think the idea is pretty cool.<br />
<br />
They wouldent buff my Barbarian Shaman but I made a HE worshiping Marr and ran him over there. I could get Strength and some armor/hp buff (Very low level) from a few of them at the entrance. They also said they would give me a better buff for a 5 gold donation, I didn't feel like transfering cash to my newly created char so I didn't bother.<br />
<br />
Some of the diolauge going on in Grobb is damn funny :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK, its not going to be a LOY city for trolls, because not all trolls will buy LOY, unless they give EVERYONE the zone. Broken Skull and Grobb are enemies, so I dont expect to see some kind of alliance there. Plus too many faction issues to deal with in neriak. This isnt going to stay for long.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Once they tie up that fascinating Luclin storyline, and then do the storyline that explains why Ogres are reverting to their original status, I am sure that they will get right on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Lets look at Verant's options if they are going to let us trolls have a city of our own.  That would mean that Sony were using:<br />
<br />
Plan 1: Relocate trolls and use Grobb as new Frog city. Costs are:<br />
<br />
1.  Redesign Neriak foreign quarter for temporary housing.<br />
2.  Design new Troll city<br />
3.  Design new newbie zone for trolls.<br />
4.  Redesign Grobb for Froggies.<br />
5.  Redesign Innothule (newbie zone)<br />
6.  GM/Guide time dealing with trolls finding themselves bound/camped in a KoS city etc.<br />
7.  Pissing off a lot of trolls (customers).<br />
<br />
Why do that when you could simply use:<br />
<br />
Plan 2: Just put in a new city for the frogs.  Costs are:<br />
<br />
1.  Design new Frog city<br />
2.  Design new Frog newbie zone.<br />
<br />
Plan 1 doesn't make commercial sense.  Nor was there any compulsion to do it:  there's no special connectivity from Grobb to anywhere else, there were no constraints due to established Lore (its a new story line).<br />
<br />
I think that Sony decided that as Grobb was very underused, there was no need to retain it as a hometown for trolls.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Also for the record, it stinks that the Trolls are now the only homeless race.  We had crappy starting quests to begin with and it seemed that most things trollish were simply an afterthought.  Oh yeah, lets throw a bone to the Trolls.  Being a shaman AND a Troll I feel like I'm gettin double shafted lately :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I hope this is not the case ... because if it is there are a number of other races with limited membership and low useage starter cities.    Ogguk would be next ... though where to kick Ogre's to would be a problem.   But NO race truly needs a stand alone starter city anymore with Shadowhaven and PoK in the game.   Lazy SOE dev's could just &quot;reuse&quot; a &quot;old&quot; starter city in the name of dynamic content.    <br />
<br />
Why Freeport could be used for 3 new expansion's itself ... think of the cost savings.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
BUT there may be a Plan 3:<br />
<br />
Broken Skull Clan has a starter city zone for Trolls.   Trolls can use either Neriak ~or~ Broken Skull as a starter.   Problem with Broken Skull is it requires LoY Expansion to use it otherwise Neriak is only option.   This allows both zones for those with and only Neriak without LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Go to the evil section.<br />
<br />
In the building near the Overthere &amp; Paineel portals look for the troll vendor on the ground floor.<br />
<br />
Read the book there on the prophecy &amp; the trolls.<br />
<br />
It would seem if the prophecy comes true the trolls are moving into a new age of unity. My bet is they are going to have a new home, most likely Broken Skull. <br />
<br />
My hope is that the trolls are given some sort of bonus for this storyline like up to par trade skills. Would be nice to see a little more bonus for paying that extra 20 percent xps.<br />
<br />
Till then walk with the shamans...walk with the wind</div></div><hr />

Ummm - I think Iksar can only be Necros.  Most player races don't even have 1 int caster.<br />

It is a weird range of classes for the frogs though - especially since the guk frogs can be necro, enchanter, and mage.</div></div><hr />

ah they used to Qeynos was their natural home, but the humans basically started to live there and take it over hehe.<br />
<br />
anyway halfelves are a mix race, so they have  a home in human cities n any elf cities, they have it best really :P</div></div><hr />

Based on what?   2 posts - Mar 02 registered data - ?<br />
<br />
If it's true that there is No new starting city for Trolls ... then every starting city should get impacted instead of just the Trolls.   Every starting city should be moved someplace else ... after all this is in the name of dynamic content.    Why not just move everyone into Freeport, Neriak, Sony (Whoops Qeynos) ... and reuse all the other cities for some uber expansion fodder.   <br />
<br />
Then once a month we can pay $20 more to download new &quot;dynamic&quot; content such as &quot;Kaladim turning into a dwarf bowling alley ;) &quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoK portal still reads Grobb, and is still found in the Evil section of town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Most of the expected amenities are available here, if you're a member of Clan Broken Skull <br />
<br />
So tell me this Schuleta, since all trolls right now are products of Grobb, and hence Clan Ykesha, where are the members of Clan Broken Skull gonna come from?<br />
<br />
Looks to me like new trolls will get two options, Clan Ykesha and your starting city will be Neriak Foreign Quarter, or Clan Broken Skull and you start out in Dulak's Harbor.<br />
<br />
Not saying you're wrong but just coming here and blurting one liners isn't going to convince me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>schuleta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">In the beta, new trolls start in Neriak only. That may change but I doubt it. All of those zones are geared for 35+. Hence no newbie area. All of the new zones are in one place, Broken Skull Rock. <br />
<br />
Now, that isn't to say that Trolls can't work on Faction to be able to call Dulak their new &quot;home&quot;, but you won't start there. Maybe we are in an argument of semantics, there is a new Troll City, it just isn't a starting city.<br />

I see them Changing Grobb to a dark city(Gunthak?) and either Kelethin Felwithe to Gukta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right my bust. I could argue that Clan Grobb came from remnants of Clan Ykesha. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm still thinking that what I said above it gonna happen though.  Or more specifically I'm hoping that what happens. It just wouldn't make sense that a horde of Grobb trolls would suddenly turn traitor and begin working for their mortal enemies. But this is Sony so I should just throw sense out the window. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was my first reaction.  But having thought more about it (from a RP perspective), I'm a troll - I'm evil, devious, untrustworthy - so I'll do whatever suits my own best interest. <br />
<br />
Hell, in real life a pretty large proportion of people are like that.</div></div><hr />
