<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I have been thinking lately about starting up a second account as I have been having a hard time finding a group.  I would like to start up a Ranger or SK to help me safely hunt in some new locations.  What I would like to know is if there is special software that is required to run EQ on the same computer?  As of right now I don't have access to 2 computers that are close enough.  If someone could point me in the right direction it would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EQ PlayNice (http://teqim.sourceforge.net) <br />
<br />
That used to be a great site. It would cut down your EQ resources and only use 50% so you could run more then one account easy on your comp. This is what I used for quite some time, but now they changed it where you have to subscribe, and I haven't tried it since then =\ Maybe someone else can post about what its like now that you subscribe and give you a bit more help  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EQW (http://www.eqwindows.com/) <br />
<br />
That is what I use.  I think you can run two versions of regular EQ as well but EQWindows works great for me.<br />
<br />
*Edit* I would go with the SK instead of a Ranger too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since the change, EQPlaynice is pretty worthless.  When  minimized it reduces the load on your system, but when running EQ in the foreground it doesnt do anything.  EQ still takes 100% of the availible rescources when running  foreground.  I was kinda upset about it, but then I realized that I had never paid for it and it was nice while it lasted.  Someone else will make code something similar before too long, and then things will be wonderful again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heymu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your computer better than P4 2.0.<br />
And VGA card better than Geforce 5600<br />
You dont need use EQPlayNice.<br />
EQW is good enough for 2 box,but close some model if you feel lag.<br />
<br />
Shaman + Sk is best 2 box combo that I think.<br />
Haste + Slow + Snare + FD pull + err....sunnmon corpse to safe place for rez<br />
Or you can play with Mage,My guildmate play Shaman + Mage,He can solo a lot place too<br />
Mage DD and pet and sumon weapon make more DPS than Sk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">with 1 comp go with sk.. ranger is nice for root rot/kiting fire and such but youd want 2 comps for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I run three characters on one of my systems with EqW and I do great. The one thing I recommond higher then any other though is 512Mb ram per character. I would also reccommed the SK for play on the same box. Theres some classes that just don't work great on the same machine. I personally always play my cleric on a completely seperate box so I can manage him without looking at the screen or the kb, I just reach over and hit the button, while at the same time playing say my sham, dru, and mage on my primary system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been thinking of writing a dual boxing guide for anyone that is interested in it. Anyone that might be interested in me doing this, please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KaeruWak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd also like to point out that you can simply go to Microsoft.com and download the Application(?) Compatability Toolkit.  With the ACT, you can disable the entry for EQ which disables ALT-Tab.  The only problem with this is that you cant run 2 patchers (i.e. start both accounts at  the same time).  You also don't have to have 2 folders of EQ, or anything like that.</div></div><hr />

only run patcher on patch days...Ta daa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>junaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wow Thanks for all the great information.  Looks like I have some playing to do when I get home from work.  You guys are always so helpful.<br />

<br />
I would be interested in this.  Even if it was just something quick and you just had some quick tips for setting up the character or hotkeys etc...  That would be most helpfull.</div></div><hr />

I would definately be interested darkpaw... Been toying with the 2 box idea for some time.  Heck, I might even take Aik off the shelf for it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well seems theres at least some interest. I'll work on it when I got time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I box a Bard and Shaman on the same computer just fine. Turn off new models and lower clip pane some, but EQW allows for a fast and smooth transition from one window to the next. Switching windows fast is a key thing for 2 blxing so EQW you are going to want to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hehe a topic after my own heart. Stick with the SK if you are set chosing between the two.<br />
<br />
Technical issues: if you have the machine, SOE boxing works just fine (download the MS program as mentioned). Personally I 3 box/2 box and single on 3 machines to do my 6 box. All are SOE only, EQW needing to be updated on patch days is concern if you are using it. I have adopted the brute force approach in that I carry 2gb+ ram on the 2 boxed machines and weakest is 2.8Ghz while the 3boxer is a HT 3+ Ghz machine. Fast HDDs (serial) and video cards (Radeon 9800Pro and better) helps as well. Bband is very helpful but I have 3boxed in a stationary setup (pull to grp) on dialup. But if you die on one all will die as the load lag will kill you literally :)<br />
<br />
As far as boxing goes, you have to figure what works for you. Two main rules apply IMHO.<br />
<br />
#1 get a good base setup. This means machines/classes/hotkeys, etc. that work for you. Personally I run shammy/chanter/warrior on top layers (principal character on each machine) and wizard/pally/cleric on lower layers. Notice a couple things, the complicated guys (chanter/shammy) tend to be on top. The easy guys (wizard/cleric/pally) tend to be on bottom. Pally is for dps/grp heal/BSS/LoH only. He is a no aggro setup. He is likely soon to be replaced with a ranger for better dps and track so I will likely rework the layers so I can autofire the ranger (which means he has to be on solo machine). Warrior is currently solo on a laptop as he is the sacrificial lamb and main tank (8K+ unbuffed) so he can save the grp with AOE taunt and enable me to get a evac off if needed. Overall notice the tendency to stick to simple classes when boxing. Boxing a bard is not recommended unless your others are single function classes (wiz/cleric). Pet classes are not good for boxing either as the tend to require more maintenance relative to mob placement (the tendency to push creates issues). Hotkeys should be setup to do main functions (nuke/heal) etc. and you will likely want an /assist and potentially a /follow function hotkeyed depending on how many you are boxing and how you play. I rarely cast a spell (or take any action for that matter) in combat that is not hotkeyed.<br />
<br />
#2 thing and most likely the more important of the 2. Boxing is about control. Places where you can not at least partially control the environment (i.e. adds, roamers, places with large aggro range) are not good for you. The more you box the more true this becomes and is especially relavent 4+. Having other live players helps :) Simple mobs (not lots of AE effects that have to be dispelled) is helpful as well. Funny thing is this describes a whole lot of the 1grp content anyways. Know your limitations but also your strengths and play to them. With strong characters you would be shocked at what you can duo.<br />
<br />
The best part of largescale boxing is the control (and the loot) the bad part is 1) no social aspect and 2) when things go really south you are likely talking CR. I am better able to rescue situations up to a point (I run all guys so I can control what happens) but after that point you just cant mash enough keys to fix it.<br />
<br />
Oh and shammy is likely the #1 boxing partner because they literally do it all in boxable content. Cant beat heal/cc/slow/dps even if shammy arent the best at it all. This is especially true if you have uber shammy. My shammy tanks (well offtanks actually) all content under 1000hitters so I can take 4 pulls in LDoN hards fairly ok if I survive the first 5 secs (i.e. get #1 mob slowed and 3 and 4 adds mezzed while warrior tanks #2). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Heymu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Because we are Shaman.<br />
So....2 box was fun.<br />
because.....<br />
we can play with any Melee you like.<br />
we can play with any caster you like too.<br />
<br />
But ...If you are a war......hmm.....only a heal machine that you can choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">But if i was going to choose now I would go a warrior.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the tanking gap between warrs and sk's now is so great that the utility of the warrs doesnt make up for it.<br />
<br />
Main prob with shams is slow heal.<br />
<br />
Sheet hits the fan then hit defensive.<br />
<br />
sk has no equivelent.<br />
<br />
Better still go with a wizzy, crappy partner in a dual boxing sense but very desirable as a guild bot.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Classes go up and down in relative power all the time. 9 months ago, warriors were hurting and knights were on top of the world. 2 years ago Monks were deemed to be overpowered and then they got hit with the nerf bat. Who knows where knights will be 6 -12 months from now?<br />
<br />
Also, Warriors still require good equipment to be good tanks, more so than knights who can establish an agro lock with their low level spells. The Provoke line of abilities helps, but BoC helps even more :)<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Not exactly an equivalent, but FD/Gate works pretty well :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, that depends on whether he wants to level a partner or a guild bot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The power ballance shifts all the time.<br />
<br />
And the question of what he wants to do with it is important.<br />
<br />
If its a guild type of thing then damage that doesnt need a lot of maintenance is good cause shams can make themselves pretty bussy.<br />
<br />
Mages are good cause thier pet does all the work.<br />
Wizzies are good cause its point and shoot. Both of them set up a pretty effective macro script (hint hint).<br />
<br />
But if you want to go places and kill things, the SK is awesome fun. I duo my two in solro tower at the moment and FD pulling and tanking etc is great fun.<br />
<br />
Although it can get booring after a while, rinse repeat.<br />
Nice for adding aa's and pharming ornate.<br />
<br />
Then again shammies are so group desirable I rarely go lfg for more than a few minutes, even though I play in down time hours.<br />
<br />
Mages tank up to a level then thier pets start to fall behind. summoning mobs ruin your day, and anything pop and above summons.<br />
<br />
However mage + shaman is a great dps combo.<br />
<br />
I find pets to be fun as well.<br />
<br />
In summary sham + SK or pally is great fun. Pally cause you can make a halfling one and level faster or SK cause they put out more dps so can level faster....<br />
<br />
And snare is the dual boxing tool of choice.<br />
<br />
That and the fact that with a few defensive aa's you can pretty well comeplete a ldon on your own with sk + sham. The other gropu members just make it go faster.<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I decided to go with a monk. I know the sk would probably be a better choice but I really enjoy playing the monk. His damage output is pretty good and the way I figure it, if I can tank a slowed mob, so can a monk. As far as snare, I never had a problem with a runner when fighting in close quarters, I just spammed my ornate legs.<br />
<br />
Hey, do like I did. Try a few classes and see what you like. The BL is pretty nice and isn't as equipment dependant as the monk so you'll end up spending less to equip and he deals out a lot of damage.<br />
<br />
My line of thinking is when 2 boxing, keep it simple. If the monk is doing enough damage and the shaman only has to slow and heal it makes life simpler but if you like a ultility character that does medium damage and can snare and has a mana bar, etc then pick an SK but keep in mind that your shaman may have to help make up for the lack of damage and you'll be switching between windows that much more. <br />
<br />
My thoughts on WinEQ and EQPlayNice. I purchased the pro versions for $10 for 3 months. I have a p 1.5 512meg with a gf 256 vid and I run 2 windows np. I can do 3 as well but it takes a little hit but is still playable. I do notice one thing, when logging into a new zone it sometimes takes a min before the choppyness &quot;wears&quot; off. I assume it has to do with the textures loading into memory or something like that. Anyway, keep in mind that 2 of the 3 chars have the clip plane turned down and no sound or models. Sony is including something like that in the next patch so you won't have to pay for it where you can turn down the framerate on the background windows. We'll see how well it works.</div></div><hr />
