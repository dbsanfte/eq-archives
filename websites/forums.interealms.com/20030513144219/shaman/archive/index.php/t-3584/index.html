<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have done the beginning of the epic, but I didn't follow the normal path.  I need a shield so I did up to the part where you first meet the spirit in Karana.  I just talked with him, and got the shield, but never went to Rathe to get the next items.<br />
<br />
 If I go on to Rathe and kill the 2 fools, and return their items to the spirit, will I receive the next gem? I looked in my inventory  (and bank) and don't see any special gem (I did the quest eons ago, and don't recall what else I received with the shield).  I'm afraid I may have messed up and have to start all over =(</div></div><hr />

Killlling the fools and turning Woe, Envy, and Marr's Promise over to the spirit will result in the gem and sufficient faction to let you do the next step.</div></div><hr />
