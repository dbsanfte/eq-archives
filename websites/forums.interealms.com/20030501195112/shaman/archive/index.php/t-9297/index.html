Sad but true.</div></div><hr />

Everything he said was truth, but he didn't say every truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good take. I wonder if elizabeth wooley has wind of this yet. His frequent use of the word 'addicted' plays right up her alley.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno , this is someone to me that has more issues then EQ being too addictive. I couldnt even read it cause it was such a whine fest. i had to stop.<br />
<br />
Not to say NONE of it is valid, i dunno , just dont see things from that perspective i guess /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is one person's experience, trying to extrapolate it to everyone's experience.<br />
<br />
I play EQ because I enjoy it overall.  Are there times when I don't enjoy it?  Sure, but what game/sport have you ever played/participated in where you enjoy it EVERY TIME.  I love to swim.  There are times when I used to swim for exercise that I HATED getting into that pool.  Overall, I love to swim regardless of those times that I didn't want to be there.  The moment that the game becomes not fun even half the time, is the moment that I quit.  It is a game darn it not my job.<br />
<br />
Overall I love EQ.  It is something that I and my husband are able to do together when our child goes to bed.  We would be couch potatoes otherwise, and you will never convince me that sitting in front of the bube tube is better.<br />
<br />
So I am sorry Mr. Whiney A-hole, don't talk for me, not all of us are playing with your experiences.  Some of us chose to play EQ for healthy, socially expectable reasons, and live happy well adjusted lives.</div></div><hr />

He wrote a persuasive argument and filled it personal bias.  The first few paragraphs only cause him to loose credibility.  Its sad, because some of the points he made were well phrased, and addressed some valid points.  EQ's customer service is horrible.  It always has been, and it probably will be that way forever.  When I first started playing eq several years ago, I was amazed at the things that Verant got away with when it came to customer service and tech support.  Sound problems anyone?<br />
<br />
Many of his arguments are over simplified generalisations that he uses to only show one side of the story, and some are just not true.<br />
<br />
I'll never believe that someone can be addicted to Everquest, or any online game.  People who claim addiction are weak minded individuals, who probably don't have anything to fill the time slot that everquest took up.  Others just don't want to quit.  They are having fun in Everquest, they enjoy Everquest, so why quit?  How many times have you had a friend of family member tell you to quit Everquest, and then call you addicted when you tell them no?  Just because you don't want to, doesn't mean you can't;  and just because you enjoy doing something alot, doesnt mean you are addicted to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">EQ probably doesn't cause addicton...it's a drug like every other drug and easily replaceable. <br />
The problems rise if you have to drop it alltogether without any replacement. <br />
So yes, playing EQ is like consuming drugs and consuming drugs over a period of time is addictive no matter why you first started(not just on a physical level). Ergo you are an addict if you play EQ(for an extendend period of time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is quite common now for these sorts of changes to come completely unannounced and unexplained, leaving the players themselves to bug test, figure out what happened, what is wrong, and leaving them again to wander off to the Dev Board asking what the purpose of the change was. Far too often in this process, the sheer discoordination and incompetence at Sony is revealed, as the changes happened accidentally or were not intended to occur in the manner they did.<br />
Sounds an awful lot like the slow mitigation issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&lt;----Has never had anyone even suggest that I quit Everquest.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because I lead a normal, productive life outside of Everquest.<br />
<br />
I know I am not the only one who plays EQ, who is not a social misfit.  I mean hell, I went to college, was president of my sorority, dated, got married, had a child AND then began playing EQ.  <br />
<br />
I always read fantasy when I was growing up, and I enjoyed it.  I even played a little D&amp;D with my older brother when I was 12 (I wasn't very good at it).<br />
<br />
But never, ever have I been anything but your normal person, who gets along in life fine and dandy.  I have friends who don't play EQ, but I also have friends (through my hubbies work) that do. <br />
<br />
What bothers me is the preception that EVERYONE who plays EQ is doing so because they have a social problem relating to real people.  Some of us play because we would rather not be watching TV, and we would rather not be pawning our children off on others so that we can go out all the time.<br />
<br />
This wasn't really in the article so much, but in some of the responses to it.  In case you are wondering why I went off in this tangent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i dont the the &quot;world&quot; is ready to believe perfectly normal people are choosing to play mmorpgs. the looks i get from my fiance's family when we talk about EQ (or rather they ask about it) are amusing at best. i never played D&amp;D, i've never been involved in any type of table top RP or LARP. i just played a heck of alot of console rpgs and mudded to keep in touch with my bf when he left for college and i was still in HS. i guess that evolved into me playing muds. it's nothing about rp for me. i'm not some freak who needs to &quot;be someone else&quot; in order to enjoy my life. i'd much rather have my kids, or people i know playing an mmorpg rather than sitting in some chat room somewhere. atleast EQ uses some sort of brain skills.</div></div><hr />

Let's assume you play 5 hours a day currently, do you think your life would have been like that, if you had &quot;discovered&quot; EQ earlier?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The casual players come and post here on the crucible.  These sort of people have somehow avoided the manic pressure to &quot;win&quot; the game and can enjoy the game, in whatever form they are &quot;allowed&quot; to enjoy it.  Be that tradeskills, casual pickup groups, an occasional raid on a largely undisputed bossmob, . . . whatever.  They are happy doing the content that was old already a year ago.  <br />
<br />
The people who wanted to progress, who have PUT in the time to move forward, who haven't got many responsibilities, have a great computer/ISP, and a good guild are the ones who are also more or less satisfied with EQ.  I say more or less, because these are also the people who will never be satisfied with ANYTHING unless they are &quot;winning.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The people caught in between.  The people who put in &quot;casual&quot; amounts of time and yet, still want to progress towards the &quot;win&quot;, have at least a small slice of the &quot;uber&quot;, who want to still experience the PoP content they freaking PAID for.  Those are the people who write these kind of essays.  <br />
<br />
I see people above me posting on how they are perfectly happy playing.  Obviously they fit one of the first two profiles.  Don't diss on the people in the third category please.  We already feel bad enough as it is.</div></div><hr />

5 hours a day? Between work, college, and my wife &amp; son, I'm lucky to get 5 hours a week. But I do play and manage to lead a perfectly normal life without being sucked in. That's not to say that there is anything wrong with playing 5 hours a day. Most of my co-workers do because they don't have as many outside responsibilities as I do. I'm just surprised that people think that EverQuest requires a five hour investment of your time everyday. This is a totally false statement.<br />
<br />
It really comes down to the individual playing the game. IMO, it's an issue of laziness. There are people who neglect things they shouldn't in their lives due to EverQuest. But EverQuest is not the reason they neglect those things, it is only the tool they use. There are a million different things someone could get caught up in that would pull them away from what they should be doing, many of them are seemingly innocent at first. To paraphrase a famous quote, &quot;EverQuest doesn't make people screw up, people make people screw up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or something like that...<br />

There should be no &quot;but&quot; there in your sentence, the word you are lookng for is &quot;therefore&quot;. If you played 5 hours a day you would be a social outcast.<br />
<br />
If you read my post, my message is that EQ isn't addictive(probably). EQ won't suck you in. EQ is not the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't play 5 hours, I play more like 3.  I don't play every night.  I like to read, watch TV (though very little, an only shows that I don't *need*to watch ever week to understand), and do other things *cough*.<br />
<br />
If I played the amount of time that I do now (when I could play more if I wanted to but don't) and didn't watch TV in college, I would have led a pretty simular life. Hell my grades might have improved if I had stayed in once and a while and not drank so much.<br />
<br />
Casual doesn't mean you don't want to win though.  It just means that you are happy to take things on your own time.<br />
<br />
I started playing EQ right around Kunark's release.  I am quite content to be year behind on content and take it at my own pace.  I am enjoying PoP more then any of the other expansions that I went through.  No complaints here.  Darn, something must be wrong with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I play 5 to ten hours a day sometimes.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I dont play at all.<br />
<br />
Other times I get on for 20 minutes to say hello and find out what is happening.<br />
<br />
Other times I play all damn day From 10 minutes after I wake up and shower to ten minutes after I have laid down to sleep (Running things through my mind of the days events.)<br />
<br />
Of course at various times in my life I have had other hobbies that I did things like that as well. Or if not one hobbie. a multatude of them. <br />
<br />
Right now I play Eq rather than Watch TV. It is the cheapest form of entertainment for the time spent in the world.. And you know what.. I have fun.<br />
<br />
Yet somehow. People think that 4-5 hours a day watching TV is okay? It is the social Norm is all.  Think about all the time People who are at home spend watching soaps.. (Shudder)<br />
<br />
Besides one other simple thing. People who bitch about EQ after they stop playing can attribute anything they want to it.. It doesnt have to be true. And everyone has an agenda.  I am sure 15 years from now I will laugh and say &quot;it seemed like a good idea at the time&quot; Like I have said about some of my other hobbies that I poured Sweat and tears and laughter and money and time into. But Just like those hobbies I hade before hand. I will have met a few nice people who liked the same things I do. I will have some good memories to take up brain space in place of what I learned in kindergarden And most importantly I will ahve spent the time the way I choose. Doing something I enjoy. <br />
<br />
Anyone who would begrudge me that, who would call me some sort of freak while Worshiping the scores of a football team or sucking up to thier boss for an additional 50 cents an hour by working weekend or night can kiss my ass.<br />

I can't feel the pain of european players who never see spanws after patches cause they get killed hours before they can even get back from work since i live on EST time but i understand the frustration.<br />
<br />
As for the customer support he was absolutely right. Nowadays ppl are total JACKASSES to other on purpose and train others and ks and then when others say i will petition u they laugh in your face cause GM's are never around and there si no way to prove anythign so they keep on training and ksing.<br />
<br />
Also if u happen to play a class that si not really required in the high end game. well u are SOL. Takes 50+ levels to realize that the class u absolutely love cannot get into groups and you are not wanted. rangers and necros coem to mind. Won't mention any other classes cause last tiem i did i got flamed.<br />

<br />
(1) Why did I had to wait 4 weeks to get 3 items restored lost from a bug? Awesome GM support. Customer support in EQ is utter horse$hit. <br />
(2) High endgame is nothing more than a race to mob X. Whatever you like to beleive it or acknowledge it. It's retarded, to race for entertainment content. Plus you have the usual blocking spawns, griefing and blowing spawns.<br />
(3) Stealth nerfs.<br />
<br />
All these points are valid and are pointed out by the person in the rant/whine/garbage/article/comment, call it what you want. If you ignore/deny those facts, then you need to seek professional help. Or you are simply clueless about the state of the game.<br />
<br />
Plus there is point 4, wich is in a grey zone: the addicitive nature of EQ. Is EQ addictive or not.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself this: How would you like to watch TV and not being able to watch your favorite show because your neighbour is watching it? Welcome to the endgame of Everquest.<br />
<br />
But yeah, if someone posts a coherent, well written post about *HIS/HER* opinion, that people don't agree with, it's automatically a whine/cryfest/call it what you want it. Oh ... wait, forgot this is the Crucible, silly me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I thought it was a very good observation, if slightly biased (OK, a lot) towards the negatives.<br />
<br />
The most important observation I felt, was pointing out the love/hate relationship a lot of people feel towards the game.  Now I, as a lot of people freely admit, there are times when I've wanted to pack it in.  But something always drives me back, and I use all manner of excuses to justify this.<br />
<br />
I can only speak for myself here, but since the days of 'Legends of kesmai', we often dreamed of a 3D MMORPG.  Everquest was nothing short of a miracle in our eyes.  I'll never forget my first login in freeport, it brought a big grin to my face.  I was stunned, it was everything I could have wished for.<br />
<br />
Things have changed so much since then, I don't play for the original reasons I wanted to explore EQ.  Another great point was, that if you give up your account, you are putting an end to a great time sink in your life with nothing to show for.  This is the paradox, because we all know in the end, no matter how high a level we reach, we will have nothing to show for it.  Sure we were entertained, but in these uncertain times, could we have used that precious time more constructively.<br />
<br />
I've spoken to so many EQ player who've all said the same thing, &quot;after EQ I will never play another MMORPG, because I know how addictive they are.&quot;  But EQ doesn't end, it keeps growing and we still feel that urge to be the best and not leave until we are.  <br />
<br />
That's the scam, it's a very hard addiction to break.  To leave is to admit the time sink was pointless, bob help us all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If no, then you need to seek help.  Otherwise it's a replacement for TV..and I for one am enjoying my emancipation from 'must-see TV&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Necro or not may have written it, much truth is expressed in his or her words. It should only be played if you feel the need to sit and relax. I agree with Csin, its a replacement for TV and a form of entertainment. <br />
<br />
Looking back to the post, replacement or not of TV means you have to spend hunderds of hrs to get anywhere in the game. It takes a whole guild to advance to the end of it. Zorlac knows exactly what i am getting at, being from the guild like awakening. It takes alot of ppl to get to the higher ending of the game.<br />
<br />
Deny the truth of that persons post and your agreeing with the fact your lost in an fantasy world. This isnt the first article i have seen lately, some even where on TV.<br />
<br />
So is it over addictive? good question. I enjoy the little time i am on to play a few hrs here and there, on weekends. The time i have been playing doesnt seem to be enough thats for sure. <br />

That to me sounds like either 1. addition or 2. its the best game you ever played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Zorlac:How would you like to watch TV and not being able to watch your favorite show because your neighbour is watching it? Welcome to the endgame of Everquest. <br />
<br />
Hahaha, excellent comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Landragoran hit the nail on the head, IMO, with his 3 groups theory.  I am in the sort of casual player group (47 days played on 1 character since May 2001).  Everquest is a great game when you have so much more content available than time to pursue it.  If you can let go (or never acquire) the feeling that you must progress to a certain level, the game is really enjoyable and not &quot;work&quot; at all.<br />
<br />
The other point missed in the necro's article is that when real people are involved in the game, we care about our performance in a completely different way than we ever would in a single player computer game.  If you are late on a backup heal, the cleric dies, the group wipes and there is a PITA corpse run, you feel guilty and bad--because of the real people you let down.  That emotional weight just doesnt exist in the single player game.  And when things go right, the victories and heroic feats are all the sweeter because you helped others succeed.<br />
<br />
I think many players are driven to play more by trying to be good guildmates and active members of the team, than by the attraction of acquiring uber-loot_01.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ is a very personal experience and activity, and as such I don't think it's entirely accurate to pigeon-hole people into three categories. From my own experiences, the enjoyment of the game varies as often as the people who play it. Some are end-game and loving it, while others are low-end and hating it. Still others are someplace in between with a somewhat varied sense of accomplishment and enjoyment. <br />
<br />
The bottom line has always been as follows: EQ is what you make it to be. If you're trying to win the game, there's a very good chance you're not going to enjoy playing. If you're playing it only to give yourself something more to complain about, you're not going to enjoy playing; and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Ideally, people are able to distance the events in-game from their own reality. If you're finding you're having a terrible day because guild X ganked boss-mob Y from your guild, you might need to find something else to do for a while.<br />
<br />
There are as many variations on the problem and solutions as there are people in EQ. What works well for one happily-adjusted married couple may not work so well for the next.</div></div><hr />
