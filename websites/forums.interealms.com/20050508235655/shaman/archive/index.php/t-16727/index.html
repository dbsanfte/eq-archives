<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently creeping out of another EQ downcycle, and during my downtime I've played some other games and done some thinking on some fun new ideas for EQ.  I'm looking past fixing quests and balancing classes, and really just thinking of the &quot;fluff&quot; that they like to add with every expansion.  I'm interested in hearing other people's ideas as well. Try to keep ideas at least mostly within the constraints of the EQ engine (ie, no flying, no removing zone lines, etc). <br />
<br />
Player Housing<br />
 - DAOC's implementation of housing is nice, imo.  You can purchase tradeskill items (kiln, etc), you can sell your wares, have a teleporter, bind point, etc.  It could also serve as storage, and the way they use trophy items is also pretty cool (be nice to have a Vulak head gracing your mantle).  Not only would it be another way to spend time, it would also be a way to spend plat and get some out of the economy.<br />
<br />
Guild Vault/Guild Housing<br />
 - Similar to player housing, but for guild members.  It could have private meeting areas that only guildmembers could access, guild vaults, etc.  <br />
 <br />
Visually Magnificent Armor (Epic Armor)<br />
 - Before everyone pukes at the thought of another round of epic quests, I'm thinking more along the EQOA line of epic armor quests.  Quests that could be completed by a single group.  The armor would have a very distinct look, and while the stats should be nice, they wouldn't replace the normal battle gear of a time-equipped character.  As an alternative, maybe have the &quot;rare&quot; part of the quest be something like the emperor's power sources, something that drops in large number on a kill.  <br />
 <br />
Item Insurance<br />
 - I'd love to pay an NPC 500 plat and have him insure all my items.  Essentially, he'd have a copy of my items in case I died and chose not to retrieve my corpse.  I set the price high, so that people wouldn't use it as a way to not get corpse summoned etc.  Obviously there would be some ugly logistics (how to ensure the armor didn't dupe, etc) but I dig this idea the more I think about it.<br />
 <br />
New Coin type above platinum<br />
 - Let us trade in 100 or 1000 plat for a mithril, or something similar.  More than anything, it would allow us to travel with a little more money (my first char was a monk!).  <br />
 <br />
Offline Messaging (Mail)<br />
 - EQOA has a great in game email system, that even works while offline.  I'd love to see this, and even expanding on it to allow Guild leaders to email all members, and possibly even offline mail reading.<br />
 <br />
War Zones<br />
 - Dynamic zones to add to the storyline.  Give us a swampy zone where the trolls and frogs are in a fierce battle, and we can join in and choose a side.  Possibly make these instanced type zones so that your guild could go in and help the trolls win a key city (obviously, not grobb because we wouldn't want it to affect the normal game), and in return they reward you.<br />
 <br />
 Thats all I have for now.  As you can probably tell, I'm sort of weary of the treadmill of slaying mobs, and looking for another level of depth.  I am curious to hear other ideas.  And please don't flame, I'm certainly not suggesting Sony drop class balancing to give me a house!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ability to become some sort of god.  Once you have become &quot;good enough&quot; you would get your own castle (where you could move traps around and whatnot) and henchmen (npc pets).  Guilds could then come raid you...sounds kinda dumb but it would be neat.  They could loot what ever is on your corpse and once you die you get replaced with someone else.  I always though it would be cool to fend off a pc raid force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">id like to see quests for gear thats comparable to elemental planes. i did the raiding guild thing for 4 years, got tired of it, helpd form a small guild that can usually field 1 solid group.

oh and i want to be able to warp space-time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 :p LOL :p   That one will still rear it's ugly head when EQ 10 comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">More quests which yield measurable experience and are sufficiently do-able that you don't feel compelled to look at spoilers but instead enjoy the puzzle of it without having to have memorized background text from PCs in zones throughout Norrath.  It would be nice for them to be mostly doable solo, perhaps with some of the harder bits requiring a group.  Requiring a raid to finish a quest blows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd like to see more practical things.<br />
<br />
- A way to assign a merchant's &quot;sell&quot; button to a key on my keyboard so i don't have to work the mouse between bag and merchant window.  Selling 5 bags worth of stuff is tedious.  Likewise, doing something similar would be to assign a key for the &quot;combine&quot; button for tradeskilling.<br />
- I can 'lock' down many of the windows in my UI, but I can't 'lock' down my bags.  That'd be changed.<br />
- Group buffs that not only work on the players, but also on their pets as well.<br />
- Way to interrupt spell casting on a horse.<br />
- Better ways to manipulate and sort text.<br />
- Since i can already see exactly how many hitpoints i have, I see absolutely no reason why i shouldn't also be able to see exactly how much mana I have.<br />
- Second the idea to have group members show up on the map.<br />
- When you click on a link, a window comes up.  When you click on another link, another window comes up.  I hate this feature, and would have it so that only one window comes up, replaced everytime you click on a new link.  Or maybe have it so that only two windows come up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fly<br />
No really.  Though you said no flight, everything is in the game already to allow it to be done reasonably.  <br />
<br />
- Make it a travel only spell, same coding as Scale of the Wolf.  If you attack or cast, the flight spell ends and turns into normal Levitate, so you don't 10k on the fall.<br />
- You can't fly when you have agro.  Similar coding to how you're not able to Summon Companion your dog dog when he's got agro or is attacking.<br />
- Doesn't work in some zones.  Obviously there are some zones where you wouldn't want this to be an option, but it's just like the coding for Levitate-free zones in game already.<br />
<br />
I just really want to be able to fly around whimsically for the pure fun of it.<br />
<br />
Temporary Class Shifting <br />
Through use of potions or expensive merchant bought charged items, or something, I'd love to see the ability to temporarily change into another class for a minute or so.  <br />
<br />
- Doesn't have to be everything; ignore the armor/items stuff, just transfer over the skills and/or spells for the duration.  (eg. Shaman changes to Warrior for a minute and has greater attack, new melee tables, dual wield, etc. , but lose all our spells for that time)<br />
- I doubt this would require much balancing since it's just like having another character there instead of yourself for that time<br />
- I'd strongly suggest it be a Merchant purchased item, selling for around 1000pp per charge for 1 or 2 minutes duration.  This would help to drain the plat out of the economy.<br />
- It'd allow for a lot of tactical and strategic thoughts for all encounters.  Stuff going bad?  Do you want to change into a druid and port your group out, or maybe go cleric and group CH.<br />
- Possibly help out the PvP area of the game...or make it much much worse ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a couple of dreams o' mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Real Voices:<br />
- Allow people to use a microphone to communicate in game.  <br />
- Only people within /say distance should be able to hear you normaly.  <br />
- For raids the raid leaders should be able to communicate to the whole raid.<br />
- Of course you could turn off this feature, or do things such as shut others up.<br />
- You could toggle hands free, or have it turn on only when you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Guild Vault/Guild Housing<br />
- Similar to player housing, but for guild members. It could have private meeting areas that only guildmembers could access, guild vaults, etc.<br />
<br />
Add to that a few more membership levels to go along with the guild vault, perhaps some guild &quot;currency&quot; to handle purchases from the vault, and remove the silly association between a single account and ownership of a guild. <br />
<br />
That last item alone has caused so many CS headaches I'm surprised they haven't changed this already.<br />
<br />
Ummm, and remove the NO DROP flag. Its one of the dumbest, non-roleplay aspects of this game. With all the people that ebay entire accounts, it just doesn't make sense to keep this in game anymore. (okay fine, they can leave it in for the newest expansion to encourage people to buy it, but remove it from any content more than 1 year old.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yossarian Runningwol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Loot all button...I see on Test server there's a Link all button but I'd also like to be able to loot everything (save no drop stuff) at once.<br />
<br />

<br />
Being able to cast shrink on people out of group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dream ideas:<br />
<br />
I would like a shortcut on the desktop labeled Gloriana/Emarr, I could just click it and load straight into the game.  This would probably never be feasible, but it would be so nice!<br />
<br />
I've also wanted some functionality that used to exist in a Mud I used to go to, the /rev command.  You could use /revtell /revshout /revgu /revg (or whatever) to quickly display the last 5 of those types of communications received.  I used to really long for this in the past, but with the advent of the separate chat windows it's not quite so appealing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I haven't got much trouble with other players so far, but i would like (in addition to several of the already mentioned):<br />
<br />
- some ability to check groupstatus of a existing group before joining group or even be in the same zone<br />
<br />
unknown_player_01: want to join us in xxx?<br />
me: /groupstatus unknown_player_01<br />
<br />
shows list of groupmembers with name/race/lvl/class/guild, if not anon<br />
<br />
me: hey, that's half of my sh.. list<br />
me: /tell unknown_player_01 no, but thanks.<br />
<br />
- some ability to list all character names of an account per server<br />
<br />
To limit the rampant hiding of loot whores, scammers and other fine folk behind mules and secondary characters. Make it, so you have to be in same zone and maybe 'once per game day' to avoid abuse. It would not be perfect (you can still buy a second account for your 'deals'), but i think it would help to limit the problem.<br />
<br />
- some may disagree with that, but disable /anon and /role inside a group (edit: true already for raids, thanks Gloriana :o)<br />
<br />
I don't see any game or roleplaying reasons to hide your basic character info towards<br />
people, you just agreed to fight with. No biggie here, but still a smaller annoyance, when<br />
you start or join a group and want to figure out buff requirements as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally also like the idea of more &quot;epic&quot; type quests in terms of length that doesn't result in a raid force being required to finish the last few parts of it or huge levels of tradeskill knowledge.  I'd be quite happy if such a quest had a maximum requirement of a group though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Id like an item that has unlimmited charges of the level one magician spell Summon:dagger.  I dont care if it is a tinkered thing that I have to recharge every 10 uses or whatever; just something, anything, that will keep me from having to pester ever mage in my guild and in PoK for weapons and/or keeping an entire 10 slot pack full of rusties.<br />
<br />
Id aslo like an upgrade to Bih'li.  Im over the fact that druids get better heals than we do but it really chaps my ass that they got upgrades to sow and we didnt.  It took us 3 expansions to even get a good upgrade to sow, and druids have recieved more than we.  Keep your damn wolf form; I give a rat's about that.  But increased speed would be really nice to have.  <br />
<br />
I like the idea of guild housing as well.  Add a plane where you can build the houses so that you dont have guild ruining the landscape of Norrath.  Put a bank or two there and let the players go.  If single players could afford to raise the captital to establish a house let them.<br />
<br />
I would also think that it should be a huge money sink.  Every month the guild would have to pony up the plat for  the rental of the land.  Depending on the size of your house and the utilties you have the price would vary.  I call them utilities, but I mean things like Looms, ovens, kilns, merchants, bankers, etc.  Over time, the different areas of the plane would generate more revenue than others so prices in those areas would increase.  Public works could be started, adding fountains and tree groves to nice areas, and other areas could become more 'slumy' (think Qeynos Aqueducts and the evil section of PoK).<br />
<br />
It could also be interactive.  Your guild house could be attacked by thieves and looters and you have to defend yourself.  The guild house could become an instanced pocket.  If you defeat the looters your house is unharmed; if you fail, you could need to repair/replace things and you suffer financial loss.  You vendors would leave and you would have to pay more to get them to return, because hey, who wants an unsafe working enviroment?<br />
<br />
Guild war might actually have a use in this type of area, because then you could attack your oponents house and seek to do them harm.  All members of the warring parties are in a pvp status when in the zone (but not in the rest of EQ; that would lead to too many headaches) and can take out thier frustrations as they see fit.<br />
<br />
neat ideas so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">#1 wish: a way to interrupt spellcasting while on horseback.  No, I don't need to be able to duck on a horse.  But I need to be able to interrupt a spell on a horse.  And why are we ducking to interrupt spells anyway?  (Answer: because it works, not because it makes sense).<br />
<br />
I think melee deserve a cheap bind-self item.  It's just dumb that they can't bind where we can.  A 10p potion, a tinkered Gnomish Binding Device, an AA skill, remove the melee bind restrictions, whatever.  No, they don't need any more access to Gate than they have now, but Bind, yes.<br />
<br />
Some shorter LDON-type adventures that can be done with less than a full group.  Give me a 45-minute adventure that is playable by 3-6 people, getting harder and giving more points as the number of people go up.<br />
<br />
Stuff that's been discussed above that I like -<br />
<br />
I vote for Offline Messaging.  Being able to send a message to someone who's not currently online would be really nice.  &quot;I waited for you but the baby's crying so I'm gonna log, call me at xxx-xxxx if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Epic armor is a good idea.  Make it equivalent to LDON armor - slightly below VT level.  It would be a lot of work though since there are so many pieces of armor per class.  And I doubt seriously they could make it look any different - too many additions to the global data file.  Although maybe they could add a spelleffect like epics get...<br />
<br />
Epic II is another decent idea.  Start the quest by turning in your epic, end with an upgrade.  Boy it would be nice to have my epic DOT be relevant again.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of a currency unit above plat, but it should be implemented as a gem that you buy from a vendor for a flate rate, and can be sold back to the vendor for the same price.  Stackable, of course.  Have one that costs 1000p and one for 10,000p.  A stack of the 10k gems would be worth 200k and weigh almost nothing, and no interfaces have to change to accomodate it.  (This was a much bigger deal before they added the bazaar, but it would still be convenient.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tolban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">How about an option for a 2box account.  Maybe it cost an extra five dollors each month.  But it gives you the ability to play a second character from your account.  It could be done with a hot key box kinda the way pets are handled now.<br />
<br />
Also a command like DAOC &quot;STICK&quot; command that would make you auto follow a mob when in combat would be handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I would like to be able to memorize more spells at once.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I also think that a Reputation feature would be nice.  It would have to follow you from server to server, name change to name change.  Someone ninja loots a nodrop item without rolling. /reputation soandso negative<br />

/soandso doesn't look to trustworthy or<br />
/soandso would stab his own mother for 1cp <br />
or something like that.  I would have no idea how to moderate it but maybe you could only /reputation against someone one time in 30 days or something.  Something like this would help with the &quot;play nice&quot; aspect.  <br />
 Your bad reputation would lower ALL NPC faction standings in the game, good or evil.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What WOULD be a useful feature is a personal reputation list, where I could tag someone - even if it's only good/bad/indifferent(default).  For those names that are really familiar, but you can't remember why until it's too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I am currently creeping out of another EQ downcycle, and during my downtime I've played some other games and done some thinking on some fun new ideas for EQ.

I'm interested in hearing other people's ideas as well. Try to keep ideas at least mostly within the constraints of the EQ engine (ie, no flying, no removing zone lines, etc). <br />
<br />
Player Housing<br />
 - DAOC's implementation of housing is nice, imo.  You can purchase tradeskill items (kiln, etc), you can sell your wares, have a teleporter, bind point, etc.  It could also serve as storage, and the way they use trophy items is also pretty cool (be nice to have a Vulak head gracing your mantle).  Not only would it be another way to spend time, it would also be a way to spend plat and get some out of the economy.<br />
<br />
Guild Vault/Guild Housing<br />
 - Similar to player housing, but for guild members.  It could have private meeting areas that only guildmembers could access, guild vaults, etc.  <br />
 <br />
Visually Magnificent Armor (Epic Armor)<br />
 - Before everyone pukes at the thought of another round of epic quests, I'm thinking more along the EQOA line of epic armor quests.  Quests that could be completed by a single group.  The armor would have a very distinct look, and while the stats should be nice, they wouldn't replace the normal battle gear of a time-equipped character.  As an alternative, maybe have the &quot;rare&quot; part of the quest be something like the emperor's power sources, something that drops in large number on a kill.  <br />
 <br />
Item Insurance<br />
 - I'd love to pay an NPC 500 plat and have him insure all my items.  Essentially, he'd have a copy of my items in case I died and chose not to retrieve my corpse.  I set the price high, so that people wouldn't use it as a way to not get corpse summoned etc.  Obviously there would be some ugly logistics (how to ensure the armor didn't dupe, etc) but I dig this idea the more I think about it.<br />
 <br />
New Coin type above platinum<br />
 - Let us trade in 100 or 1000 plat for a mithril, or something similar.  More than anything, it would allow us to travel with a little more money (my first char was a monk!).  <br />
 <br />
Offline Messaging (Mail)<br />
 - EQOA has a great in game email system, that even works while offline.  I'd love to see this, and even expanding on it to allow Guild leaders to email all members, and possibly even offline mail reading.<br />
 <br />
War Zones<br />
 - Dynamic zones to add to the storyline.  Give us a swampy zone where the trolls and frogs are in a fierce battle, and we can join in and choose a side.  Possibly make these instanced type zones so that your guild could go in and help the trolls win a key city (obviously, not grobb because we wouldn't want it to affect the normal game), and in return they reward you.<br />
 <br />
 Thats all I have for now.  As you can probably tell, I'm sort of weary of the treadmill of slaying mobs, and looking for another level of depth.  I am curious to hear other ideas.  And please don't flame, I'm certainly not suggesting Sony drop class balancing to give me a house!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The ability to purchase an item in the bazaar from the /bazaar window without having to run all the way to the opposite side to find the person (Ever notice that the person selling is geographically as far as they can be from you?)<br />
<br />
And, the ability to leave a mule up in the bazaar at all times. Make it a popup window that you can open and see the status of your mule. By all means make it that you have to go to the bank to transfer items in and pp out but you shouldn't need a second account or be in trader mode overnight to sell your stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'd LOVE to see a higher form of currency aswell.<br />
<br />
but top on my list is fix the damn mod rod bug in the bazaar that makes it so you can't see someone that's got a modrod on their cursor in the /bazaar search<br />
<br />
and I'd pay an extra 5 bucks to be able to 2box with the same account..DEFINATELY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>khazmun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I think they should have a casino in the bazaar, hopefully it would put all those idiots that keep spamming me with their odds out of business.  Why would someone take a chance with a PC when the game is guaranteed to pay its winners?  I'm sure this would open up a whole new can of worms with regard to the economy and if the system would create too large of an influx of cash, but /shrug, just an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Unpredictability. Unexpected stuff happening. Uniqueness. Utilitarian gov... ok i ran out of U words.<br />
<br />
Thats basically it. EQ feels like a talk doll with three different modes, and you're forced to play the same ones over and over and over.<br />
<br />
As rich as EQ's content is, it could do with a bit of havoc randomness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">You know the game is pretty good now....but<br />
<br />
LDON - fixes<br />
<br />
Add a few % more collection items to make collections equal in risk compared to assin, rescue &amp; kill.<br />
<br />
Add a slightly lower raid setting so a raid force of 62s-65's can have a reasonable shot at winning.  Downgrade the loot of course.<br />
<br />
LDON - Additions<br />
<br />
I think LDON is great but the dungeons do have similar feel... every everfrost one is about the same, etc.  I would think that it wouldn't be that tough to make them unique so when  you zone into one you would say, ahahhhhhhh, I remember this one.<br />
<br />
I also would like another option to give you the choice of no drops except on bosses.  This would eliminate the not-so-fun task of looting everything and splitting if the group chose to do so.  Reward for bypassing the 1.5-2k of junk loots? Oh, pick your poison, but how about 600k plat on boss/rescue/58th kill and 1-3 augments. Just make the reward about 50% of the usual drops.<br />

I collect words with my necro, and i dont know in what bag the **** Words of --- are, so i have to look the bags one by one to find where to put them or have multiple stacks of same words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">A &quot;spell slow&quot; would be very nice.<br />
<br />
A spell you cast on a mob that increases his casting time, giving your pet/tanks a better chance to stun/bash and interrupt the spell.  Against chanter mobs and priest/self-healer mobs, this would be extremely useful.<br />
<br />
Shamans and Chanters have the strongest slows, so shamans and chanters should be able to use the spell.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to see the /tgb feature affect everyone in BOTH groups, instead of everyone in the other group and yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Amarusia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Friends list - <br />
<br />
Let me be able to add a comments to each name in my list so I know who I am talking too.  I many time add alts of ex guild members that have come and gone, and have no clue who these people re on my list after about 2 weeks of adding them....<br />
<br />
Love the group buff hitting pets also idea.....althought that would prolly be too good to hope for.<br />
<br />
Ama</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Excellent posts for the most part.  For those who can't seem to post without dribbling negativity, you should probably question your motives for continuing playing.<br />
<br />
I'm a big numbers guy, so I'd love to see more numbers...mana, avoidance/mitigation, etc.  <br />
<br />
Also, maybe implement some AAs that aren't given for exp, but rather for completing quests.  For instance, a quest might be to gather some components, with one being a scale from Trakanon, and upon completing the quest you might receive +3 to your innate poison resists.  Nothing as big as Cann5, but a nice little bonus other than pittance of exp and coin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">How about a working casino in high hold keep. Should be a good way to take some cash out of the game. Have all kinds of games. Maybe have some games in the secret areas like a cockrice fight. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Adinaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">A mage spell or AA that would automatically summon and equip weapons for all pets in a group.<br />
<br />
Alchemy recipe for invisibility that is actually cheap to make. And while we are talking about invisibility, a set duration invis for shaman.<br />
<br />
Make some kind of distinction between people looking for group in raid or not. Maybe LFRG.<br />
<br />
Right now, almost everyone wants a 'kill a certain number of mobs' adventure for 2 reasons. First<br />
because this is the only consistantly successful choice. Second because there is no real reward in choosing anything else. The assassination bosses don't drop anything, the one you rescue doesn't give you anything, and the stuff you collect is junk. The risk/reward for adventure needs to be looked at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">A button out in the middle of EC that says &quot;You Win&quot; in 50 foot flaming letters that when pushed plays a video showing your character being crowned God of Norrath while deleting all of your characters and removing EQ from your machine.  :)<br />
<br />
Have seasons change occasionally.  Have landscape, spawnscape, drop table, climate, storyline, etc. change based on unique quests that can only be done once per server.  Make big deals out of it when the quests are completed and make sure there are quests like this for all level ranges.  Zone content is way too static.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Ummm, and remove the NO DROP flag. Its one of the dumbest, non-roleplay aspects of this game. With all the people that ebay entire accounts, it just doesn't make sense to keep this in game anymore. (okay fine, they can leave it in for the newest expansion to encourage people to buy it, but remove it from any content more than 1 year old.)<br />
Let the nodrop stay, but allow them to be put into the shared bank space. You, the player, earned it. And you are free to put it on whatever character of that account you want. You are suposed to be the only user of that account according to the EULA anyway. You're not hampering the economy by selling it, just transfering it to your alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">shouldnt be able to transfer nodrop items between characters.. i know people already get highend nodrops for their twinks.. but it would just be insane if ANYONE could do that, not just the uber guilds who have already equipped mains with the best stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Haven't reread the entire thing so might be a dupe, but<br />
<br />
Ability to join an ldon raid after its started. I log in 2 minutes too late tonight becasue of traffic and get to sit around twidling my thumbs while guild raids. <br />
<br />
Also being able to replace people mid aventure, for raids and groups.</div></div><hr />
