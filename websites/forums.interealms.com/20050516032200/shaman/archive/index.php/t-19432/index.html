<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not for scaremongering or anything other than curiosity, do you think you will continue playing your shaman as a main post GOD assuming things are delivered as they appear today?<br />
<br />
I for one am unsure, I know I will roll a Ber for interest, and expected I would likely return to my Shaman after I had learnt a little about the Ber class but after hearing shaman being openly mocked as 'sucking post GOD' in numerous channels on my server over the last week I am seriously considering rolling a BL.<br />
<br />
What about you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">after hearing shaman being openly mocked as 'sucking post GOD' in numerous channels on my server over the last week I am seriously considering rolling a BL.<br />
<br />
Let me give you some advice.  90% of the people who talk in public channels about how one class or another sucks are complete idiots.  If you don't believe me, join chat next time servers are down and just read.  It takes about 3 minutes before my eyes begin bleeding from the raw stupidity that people spew out.  There is just so much idiocy that I can't even begin to reply and correct it all, so I don't even try.<br />
<br />
Basically what I'm getting at is that most people don't have a clue what they are talking about.  How are shamans going to &quot;suck post GoD&quot;?  Do we suck now*?  We aren't having anything taken away from us, so I don't see how we could get worse.  I personally think the new slow and cannibalize look awesome.  Disease dot is worthless and the AA aren't impressive, but I don't think they are done yet.  We'll have to wait and see.<br />
<br />
*If you think we suck now, then I don't know what to tell you.  If you feel underpowered most of the time then either you aren't playing your shaman right or you just whine too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jin, take a blue pill mate, you think I dont know the world is full of ****wits? I assure you I am more aware than the majority.<br />
<br />
This is information gathering, as I said I'm curious, I play my shaman damn well and check my posts, I dont whine.<br />
<br />
You need to stop whining when people ask questions which could generate discussion around a subject youi have made your mind up about, dont dare bring my skill into question, you dont know me from a bar of soap and I assure you I am more than adequately skilled as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your valued advice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been tempted to switch to Beastlord (though my current twink is a 49 monk, a class even worse off than us ;) ), but I'd have to start all over again, 150 aas, flags, and raid level gear would be sitting on the shaman doing nothing.  Bleh!  Also, my guild often needs healing power more than DPS (raids and exp groups), and while I don't fill that role as optimally as a cleric or druid, it's usually enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jin, take a blue pill mate<br />
<br />
You mean Viagra?  I have plenty of personal problems, but that's not one of them :D<br />
<br />
My comments weren't addressed towards you and I wasn't saying you're a bad shaman, so perhaps you are the one who needs to chill out a bit.<br />
<br />
You said yourself that you heard shamans being bashed in public channels, and that it was swaying your decision towards making a new main.  If you are aware that most people are complete ****wits, why would you let what they think influence your opinion?<br />
<br />
GoD might not be delivering exactly what we all want or be turning us in to a superclass, but it definately isn't nerfing us or further decreasing our effectiveness.  If you're playing a shaman now and enjoying it, I see no reason to switch mains or quit entirely.  If you're playing a shaman and not enjoying it, it's probably for one of two reasons:<br />
<br />
1)  Shaman just isn't the class for you.  We can be effective and valuable in just about any situation, but that doesn't mean that you are going to like playing the class.  Think about clerics:  Clerics are pretty much always needed, but most people don't like playing them.  Same thing for shaman.<br />
<br />
2)  You just aren't playing to your full potential.  If you seriously think that shamans are a gimp class that are becoming more and more worthless as time goes on, then I think you're doing something wrong.  My reasoning for this?  In all my years of playing a shaman, I've never felt worthless.  I can always find a way to make myself effective and powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally I'll play my shaman right up until:  1) Duoing him alongside my wife's druid stops being mostly fun, 2) EQ2 comes out and sounds even better, or 3) other real-life interests take priority.  In any case, when I stop playing my shaman I'll stop playing EQ.  All my alts are minor diversions by comparison.<br />
<br />
If playing my shaman without raiding is still fun when EQ2 comes out, I might buy it.  I'll be hitting 65 in the meantime, so we'll see.  Frankly, it's as likely to be the Norrath economy as anything specifically related to shaman that finally tips the enjoyment scale over for me.  And as odd as it may sound, if SOE doesn't at least register the domain names for their own EQ2 servers, I won't even consider subscribing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is my one and only main since I created her, and will remain so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Jin,<br />
<br />
Yep, public opinion did sway me, but I am capable of filtering the chaff from the hay and I choose to listen to the comments from people I see as qualified to voice them. I'm sad to say that for 'some' reason a few of these people on my server have a very negative attitude to the new expansion.<br />
<br />
I would'nt listen to these channels at all if there was never anything to be derived from them, you suggest you listen to them also so I imagine you do the same.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I should point out that I play between the hours of 3am pst to 7am pst, the channels are much quieter at these times and dare I say it...'more mature'. There are certainly ****wits about but much much less than when I log on in prime time.<br />
<br />
I do my best to shut my eyes to the negative spin on shaman that is so prevelant, but if I were to censor it completely I'd not be a capable player, nor would I be visiting this board.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this poll will receive many votes, lets see what the results say, if my suspicions are correct I believe this poll will demonstrate Shaman are not quite as demotivated as people might think<br />
<br />
[edit] forgot to address.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Samanna said it all for me.<br />
This is my main, I made him in beta, I remade him in release and he stayed that way. My alts are just for fun, though I recently got another account and made a monk so I could PL him up and two box him when I feel like messing around or I need a monk for something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've often been tempted to play a Beastlord, because my brother plays a BL and I know VERY well first-hand how powerful they are.  <br />
<br />
At my current level, though, I am not experiencing any of the problems said to be inherant in the later levels.  So, at least at the moment, I will continue to stick with my Shaman, and if I feel a little burned out, i'll put a little more XP on my brother's beastlord.  He wont complain about that much. :)<br />
<br />
The only thing that would stop me from playing my Shaman would also cause me to stop playing EQ as well.  While there are games upcoming that I think may hold more interest for me, they are just entering Beta and will be a while before release.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have had a SK i played for a long time. Currently level 51.<br />
<br />
I have pretty much all classes ranging from level 27 ( warrior ) and on up. No class is as good as my shaman no matter how hard i try to leave. Something might catch my attention for a while and be fun, but the shaman and more so, the style shaman i play, is completely natural to me so there can never be another &quot;main&quot; i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still be playing with my furball if for no other reason then thats what I have my time and effort devoted too. If a GM offered to swap me for a equally equiped/flagged/AA BL I'd seriously consider switching, but otherwise I'm Hobbez (at least till WoW comes out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i created a warrior when I first started playing (I've always been a warrior on any game that i've played), but i hated playing one here.  I saw a shaman one day who was healing, buffing and meleeing good (was like level 17 so it was still early).  i decided at that time that I wanted to try a shaman so when i came back after quitting for six months, I created a shaman and have never looked back.  Hell, look at the playtime of my twink.  I created Val on May 11th, 2002.  I created my beastlord on Aug 17th, 2002.  I just dinged 65 on my beastlord last week, with 9 days played.  He didn't even hit level 20 until last month.  I love playing a shaman so much that I never even though about leveling him.  Do what you want to the shaman class, I'm here to stay.  In fact, the only reason that I even botherred leveling the beastlord, is cause of all the rotting leather stuff from elementals/time I figured it would be an easy and cheap way to get him some decent equipment.<br />
<br />
But, it's simple like what was said, either you enjoy playing your shaman, or you don't.  If you don't, then pick another class and play that one.  I don't know about you, but I can't go without may canni and malos spells.  They are just too valuable to me, that I miss so much when I'm playing the beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaman haven't had much given to them since Kunark as an overall class. I have been playing one as my main before and after. Another expansion will come and go and I will still be playing my shaman until I quit EQ for good, but am even contemplating a shaman in EQ 2 if the game is any good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well I've quit, nothing new or interesting is coming for the shaman, its all what we have already got. But I am at fault to an extent I was hoping GoD will readd a fun factor but already seeing the aa and spells its not the game I started playing, whether the reason is because of burnout of the class or whether its because of the lack of imagination of new spells since pop I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Been playing my SHM since i started EQ, ok that was on the luclin release but i love the class and will never change</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm abstaining from answering the poll, but I'll post my thoughts on this topic anyway:<br />
<br />
I've played almost every class as an alt at some point and my shaman is the third &quot;main&quot; toon I've had.  I'm frankly getting tired of being force-fed BS with a shovel by SOE and that's more or less what most of the expansions have done for shamans lately.  I've been building up a Beastlord for the past 2 weeks or so, and if things don't change I may well switch the Beast to being my main.  However, I will always play my shaman.  After 65 levels and 60-odd aa's, I'm not about to shelf him and let him gather dust.  I just haven't made up my mind yet about whether or not he'll continue to be my &quot;main&quot; post-GoD yet.<br />
<br />
If you went back and put an unsure/undecided option, that'd be where my vote landed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I rolled a warrior the day I started. <br />
I didn't like it,  then I rolled a shaman, and while I have had alts, I still play the shaman and will always play the shaman.  Even though SoE eventually tries to take away every CP we make (they want shamans to be poor... it's implied in their mandate) by adding other easier ways to get the benefit of our most purchased potions for cheap or free (after a little farming and some honest work)<br />
<br />
THat being said, I like playing my pally right now.  And my shaman.  Screw GoD, I haven't heard enough about it (it won't be enough till I am playing it).  LoY was a godsend to the paladin.  I mean really, 25 zones for easy group xp, 15 of which are filled with undead.<br />
<br />
Potentially, you could see other expansions like this, that are huge ups to various classes, and each one bringing it's own new differences and classes that get the screw.  Or not.<br />
<br />
Keep playing your shammy, we're fine the way we are.  unless someone takes a spell line from us, or gives rangers slow and clarity spells, we'll be fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'll still play my Shaman, I've not seen any major changes that will take place that would change my mind other wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've got one account that I label &quot;Melees&quot;.  I have a 61 ranger, a 59 monk and a 42 BL on it.  On my other account, I have a 65 shm with nearly 80 AAs.<br />
<br />
He compliments all 3 of the &quot;melees&quot; perfectly.  Whenever I feel like duoing a dungeon crawl, my shaman is the pillar, the melee is just the front-man.  I just pick and choose which melee I wanna team up with the shaman and go to town.  Droga, SolC, Kael, Tier 1 PoP, CT --- you name it, I can duo it.  And the shaman is what makes it happen.  A BL isn't.<br />
<br />
My buffs are 65% extended.  I &quot;buff 'em and forget 'em&quot;.  I love buffing people, and they love getting my buffs.<br />
<br />
I love to PL melees.  Shamans are great at it.  I still gotta PL a rogue and warrior!  The shaman is awesome at PLing them.<br />
<br />
So, heck no... I'm not quitting my shaman.  He might not be as powerful as a beastlord, but who cares.  BSTs are gonna get nerfed, 'cause a lot of people are crying about them.  And when that happens it won't be bad to be a shaman at all.  'Sides... shamans have a whole lot more heart than BSTs.  It's a goofy class if you sit back and look at it... even in this fantasy game, a large cat walking around controlling a super-tiger is just... goofy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Poguk pretty much described my situation perfectly.  My second acct has a Sk, Ranger, beastlord, monk and (one aberation) magician.  Thats pretty much what I do with my EQ time lately.  Because of the work hours that I keep, joining a raiding guild on my server is a non issue, so Ive got pleanty of time to PL my melees.  The SK is almost to the level where he can group effectively with my shaman, and then the fun can really begin.<br />
<br />
I still love my shaman.  But lately its been very taxing on me to log him in and fight with buff/slow bots for group slots.  I'll probably pick up one copy of GoD just to see what its like; still havent gotten the other acct LDoN activated because there just wasnt enough there to justify it for me.  /shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">if yer that happy with shaman , why are you pl`ing mellees? i think you confused. i certainly dont want to be just a pl class. i actually use my shaman as a main in group and raids. and i cetainly not got 2 accounts or computers to run 2 chars on. if you happy boxing 2 chars fine, but i wouldnt call that playing a shaman, it is playing 2 chars, thats is boxing a completely different experience than most main shaman.<br />
<br />
and from above seems you wont log shaman as  single char.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completely agree...particularly about the chat thing.  Whenever I go into chat when my server is down I become terrified - because one or more of those morons could be grouped with me at some point.  EQ chat is really amazing.<br />
<br />
Something I always tell my wife is don't worry about things that you know nothing about...it's just unnecessary stress....wait until you have factual information and then freak out.  (of course, this rarely works since she's a woman who seemingly lives to be upset about things...but I digress)<br />
<br />
I also strongly agree on the thing about people who think shaman suck now.<br />

Well said in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PLing is one of the many things I like to do as my shaman.  I actually spend about 90% of my time xp-grinding as my shaman.  5% of the time raiding, and another 5% of my time doing whatever I want, but that's the point --- I have the flexibility to do what I went, when I want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I consider my shaman to be my 'True Main', but Shazzog isn't being treated as a Main for now, and probably won't be for a while. My Guild suddenly (a few months back) managed to get 4 or 5 shaman that played all the time...and no Enchanters...thus my Enchanter was born on that account, and is now 61 and grabbing a few AA's before she heads for 65. Once I have her to 65, have my Cleric to 60 or so, and have my B Team leveled up (new Shaman and Chanter on second account, new Epic cleric on Shazzog's account), Shazzog can go back to being the one I always play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Im already playing a Rogue instead.<br />
<br />
At 65, no guild, and 60 AA's used and I am bored stiff.<br />
<br />
No I won't play the Shaman anymore, unless our demands are met.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Meryll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'll continue playing my Shaman as my main until I quit EQ... whether GoD will be the expansion that causes me to quit remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
I wont quit over new spells, or the lack of them... probably wont quit over new flags or key camps.. what would probably cause me to quit is lack of innovation by SOE, I don't want just another PoP or Ldon, I want something more fun.<br />
Do I think we're perfectly balanced? No... Do I think we've lost a lot of power relative to other classes since Kunark? For sure... but we're still one of the most fun and versatile classes to play either on raids, exp groups, or solo.</div></div><hr />
