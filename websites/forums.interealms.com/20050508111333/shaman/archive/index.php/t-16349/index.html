<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are all the new zones just these time-based dangeon crawl affairs?  Or are there some normal zones which you can just explore and group in, in the good old fashioned way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they are all timed dungeon crawl affairs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I havn't started a crawl yet but I hope to tomorrow. I'm the kind of person who thinks you cant make judgements before experiencing I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't personally experienced being mugged: I think we can (and do) judge things without personally experiencing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The time limit isnt as much of a hinderance as you might think.  You have 2 time limits to deal with, 30 minutes after accepting a mission to get to the dungeon and 90 minutes once you get inside to complete your mission.<br />
<br />
The 30 minutes to get to your dungeon is WAY more than you need.  Most dungeons are either in the same zone or one away from where you accept the mission.  the MM and deapest Guk are the only dungeons that require some real hoofing, and then only about 10 minutes if you run really slow and have to make a stop along the way.<br />
<br />
The 90 minutes in the dungeon is, from my experience, more than enough time.  I did a run through in Quicksand on hard setting with pally, warr, cleric, me, wiz, mage and we downed the boss with 15 minutes to spare, and we werent exactly moving at breakneck speed.  Our cleric and mage didnt have any 3rd party mana regen and our warrior died once.  Overpulls were common and I usually ended up tanking with the meatheads.<br />
<br />
Try it out.  THEN complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tyrika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I only did one guk adventure but when I did it it gave my group 60 minutes to get into it. <br />
The timer for the actual adventure doesn't start until the first person zones into the adventure. So you usually have time to run up and buff and med to full before going in.<br />
<br />
The time limit isn't that bad at all. Even if you don't complete your mission you still get good experience and loot for your level. There are weapons that drop regularly in the orc mines that sell for 3pp-5pp each (this is at level 45). <br />
<br />
I did 6 missions yesterday and got about a level and a half (44 to 45 and halfway into 45) and I only suceeded at one of them. <br />
<br />
You also do not need the pefect group to complete a mission. The main requirements to finish a mission is that every member stays and pays attention constantly just keep moving.<br />
<br />
All in all I think the experience is at least as good here as anywhere else.( keep in mind I must have died 15 times yesterday I did get some rezes but not all and I still gained that much exp) Plus you also have the opportunity to earn some points and this is much much more exciting than the usual grind for experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you just want a crawl with no time limit, pick a hard adventure and ignore the timer.  You will get exp, loot and challenge, and no adventurer points, just like a regular zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hi friends,<br />
<br />
Well maybe I'm in the minority but I think the timer is well thought out and adds to the fun of the adventure.  Now the corpse timer at 30 min, though, is a joke.<br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is pretty much my playing style.<br />
<br />
Solo: Slow mob, sick dogdog, cast sehd loads of Dots and maybe torpor.  Go do the washing up or something, then come back and repeat.<br />
<br />
Group: Buff group, cast slow when a mob is inc.  Read a book, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
The only satisfaction I get from EQ is exploring now and again or doing quests, so from my point of view, time limits suck and I don't need to see it to make that judgement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hrmm.. not sure what you mean here.  I have died in the dungeons.  I didnt have to wait for my corpse.. I just zoned back in, walked to where I died (well, slightly before so I wasnt in agro range) typed /corpse to drag my body out from under the mobs feet, and looted.  I left an item on it so I could get a rez later, and when the dungeon ended and I got kicked out, my corpse popped out as well seconds later.<br />
<br />
So, if the dungeon isnt ended yet, walk in and get your corpse.  If it has ended your body should pop almost instantly at the portal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Did the Mistmore one with some friends last night. 60 Pally, 60 Cleric, 64 Wizard, 62 Ranger, 64 druid and myself.<br />
<br />
I had no mind buffs and spent most of my time slowing/buffing and canning. No nukes or dots to conserve mana. Scooby had some mage toys though and that was the only DPS I was dealing.<br />
<br />
Paladin went LD once. His internet went down and was gone 15 mins. We only took two mobs down while he was gone (people got too cautious and were pulling very slow)<br />
<br />
The object was to kill 58 mobs in 90 mins. We did it with 8 mins to spare.<br />
<br />
90 mins is enough time for what we did and it definately added a lot of excitmement to the adventure. We knew soon after taking down a few mobs that we had enough time but we had to keep moving. <br />
<br />
Can't wait to do more. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did one of the Orc dungeons yesterday with some guildies.  Group was 2 shamans (1 lvl 61 w/Torpor, 1 lvl 60 w/o Torpor), chanter, necro, bard, and an AM2 ranger.<br />
<br />
Mission was to collect 28 orc bone studs and even after some dead ends and back tracking to find mobs we finished with 7 minutes left and no one died.<br />
<br />
The adventure was a real rush, constant pulls with chanter parking mobs, no time to stop and med..just kill, kill, kill, move deeper and repeat.  It was the most fun I've had in a long time.    The bard tanked, the necro pulled, the chanter parked mobs, the shamans dotted, slowed, maloed, nuked, healed and even meleed, the ranger made pincushions out of mobs.  It was everything high-end adventuring should be.</div></div><hr />
