<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rooser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have researched a few of the different sites about the Shaman Epic, but can't seem to find any information on how a Vah Shir Shaman would (or if they can) complete the quest.  I find the instructions for the four paths, but since Vah Shir are a 5th path added since epic was included, can anyone let me know how (or if) I am able to do the Epic Quest as Vah Shir?  Thanks in advance for any help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pick a path. The quest branches for about half a step, then everyone walks the same path again. The most common choice is to follow the smelly barbarians in their eternal struggle for justice. I chose to go with fear just to be different. The spirit sent me next door to talk to his cousin Vinnie, then I got sent off to find Oogly-one in Erud's X-ing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got creative.<br />
<br />
First time, I chose barb, and got to see the guy next door.<br />
Second time, I chose Troll, and got to see the guy at the other door.<br />
Third time, Iskar, I stayed where I was :)<br />
<br />
It didn't make any difference really.<br />
<br />
That's about it for race specific stuff.</div></div><hr />
