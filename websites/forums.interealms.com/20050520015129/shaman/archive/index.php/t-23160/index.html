<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is the shaman &quot;charm animals&quot; spell worthwhile?  With access to a snarer, is it worthwhile to use the animal charm in any planar zones?  I used to charm ravens with a druid in PoN and it went pretty well.<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a level cap on shaman charm that prevents us to charm anything deadly.<br />
<br />
Unless its used when you have just gotten it, its just a toy, and not even that really.<br />
<br />
Dogdog will get you a lot further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">charm animal was only good for obtaining totemic, back in the day.<br />
<br />
and that was even before they nerfed it.<br />
<br />
mammys in EF and Elephants in SKarana; had an aggro of the whole zone.  you could charm one, and start /pet attack soandso, and if soandso was up in the entire zone, the pachaderm took off after it.<br />
<br />
basically shaman tracking for our first class armor.  <br />
<br />
also in those zones, in pvp, you could send the pachy and if your target was not on your 'team'; off he would go.<br />
<br />
they nerfed it by cutting down the aggro radius for pachys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">About the only thing I ever used it for was charming owlbears in hollowshade in my 30's I think to farm acrylia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Charm animals was great when I was XPing in Marus Seru.  Charm a greyhopper and let him go to town on then next one.<br />
<br />
With practice and more bravery than I have you could probably learn to swarm kite for really fast XP.<br />
<br />
Only works for a couple of levels though then anything that still gives XP won't be charmable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the max level we can charm is 36 or 37 or so. at 34 when we get it it would still be handy if you hunt walruses in Eastern Wastes or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Folks are forgetting the real reason for charm animal... go to a newbie zone and charm the bear or what ever and buff it to hell then gate away.  *I* never did that but I do know folks that have.  I knew of a Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Chanter group that would go to zones and charm a mob, buff it with everything they had the chanter would go invis and mez the mob... they'd pull another one etc etc till they had a pile of rooted/mezzed mobs that were buffed with an extra 2khp and hitting like trucks.  Then they'd gate away for some poor sap to get mowed down by the mobs on steroids.</div></div><hr />

Way back when you could still buff mobs without charming them, those were the days. Not that i ever did it myself, but there was nothing that could strike fear into your newbie heart like a bunch train of SoWed gnolls in Blackburrow.<br />
<br />
Or a couple of Vengeful Skeletons that was impossible to outrun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">USed Charm Animals spell in 3 different places since I bought it at whichever level we got it.<br />
<br />
First time and oftenused, was wheni was hunting in Kael Drakkal. Charm a dire wolf (more hp and a bit meaner than dogdog) to help me whack giants.  Used it in East Karana to charm griffons to assist me in killing spiders a shade faster, and then in west freeport, charm rats, buff them stupid, and gate :p</div></div><hr />

Fun with charm while leveling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I must admit I charmed a noob animal, gave him pet toys and buffed him to the teeth. I felt bad after I did it attacked a zone guard at halas(the ones right before you zone) zoned out zoned back in to finish watching the fight</div></div><hr />
