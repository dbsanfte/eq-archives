<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Contemplating a return from retirement as a more casual gamer, and while I was online getting some Fabled Haste, I checked out some of the leadership AAs.  Honestly a lot of them sound quite nice, though I can see where a couple would completely blow if the numbers are too low (if the maxxed out regen is about 25 or 50.. nice.  if it is 3... not so nice).<br />
<br />
  Anyway, I am just wondering about the buff inspection Leadership AA.  How nicely does it work for those of you who have had a chance to try it out?  I know I get really sick of people not telling me that FA is down until a good minute and a half after it drops (meaning that I just recently refreshed it on myself, my pet, or some hapless rogue/ranger that I spotted on a whim).</div></div><hr />

It shows a list of the targets buffs in chat window with a timer next to it if they have level 2. Looks like this:<br />

It doesn't report by the second so for short duration stuff it may say 1 minutes remaining or 0 minutes remaining. It's cool.</div></div><hr />
