<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>n0id</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off im not twinked at all...spine chill spear and SBS is my pri/sec, with equipment that i could manage to buy as i went along. Buffed i have about 1500ish HPs, and 870ish AC.<br />
<br />
Now i finally got to 45 using the 1-45 leveling guides here, but need a spot and fast, cause im going crazy.<br />
<br />
I need to solo, because im a Troll shaman, and the exp penalty is horrid solo killing, group killing isnt even worth the time.<br />
<br />
From 39-44 i did the yeti caves, and the response i need is the same type of camps, Blue con, non-social, no adds, static spawns, safe pull area, fast constant exp spots :)  i LOVED the yeti caves.<br />
<br />
Places ive tried -- My result:<br />
<br />
Dreadlands -- perma camped...no wanderers theres so many people here.  Plaguebone camp is permacamped as well.<br />
<br />
Great divide -- Perma camped...Cant find a giant to save my life..a reminder of DL.<br />
<br />
CC -- Perma camped...i got the terror tunnel once...somehow trained the leech guy from the bank on me by pulling the front 4 spawns...almost died, so i left...doesnt help me if i die trying to exp :)<br />
<br />
Solb -- Permacamped...go figure ;)<br />
<br />
Echo caverns -- Perma camped...go figure :)<br />
<br />
Burning woods -- Wasps were bringing adds at the hive, and it was difficult to get solo's to kill.  Not enough of the lower end wasps to go around to make it worth my while.<br />
<br />
CoM -- Tried to break up the entrance, just couldnt do it, will have to just sit this zone out and come back when i can mass kill for my epic stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think thats about it....pretty much all the usual spots are permacamped and impossible to find anything for solo...so i need the above request (static, no adds, blue con to 45-50, safe spot to pull)<br />
<br />
Im trying to rush to get to 50 so i can raid with my guild...also once i hit 50 ill worry about making money for JBB and epic.  For now i need a spot to get me to 50 asap.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for your help everyone...need to get these levels behind me as they are making me crazy! =\<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Duo, regardless of exp penalty and I suggest BW. Oh, and Tenebrous if you don't care about cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coralis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A couple of other options might be EW or Scarlet desert.  You have better AC and more HP's than I do at 46th, so you shouldn't have any problems.  :D<br />
<br />
I found most of the mobs near the GD entrance were dark blue at 45th to me, and were easy to pull back to a safe spot just to one side of the zone path.  Giants were common there, and pretty easy kills.  Watch out for the manticores though, they can be pretty nasty.  Exp is kinda slow, but easier to find mobs than GD.<br />
<br />
Scarlet desert is a great zone, and very under used on my server.  I zone in and turned right, avoiding the revenants near the zone.  Setting up between the first 2 revenant camps against the wall, I could park my dogdog there and pull pretty much anything back to there.  Lots of wanderers, but none of them get that close.  Watch the revenants, as they proc a disease DOT which is quite nasty.. and check the names on em.. some are around level 40, but there are some that are about 44-45 and they are far harder to deal with.  You can get some of the drops for the Twilight sea armour quests here too..<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.. :)</div></div><hr />

Nuff said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wrynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a 50 Barbie Shaman [almost 51] and I mostly solo too but more because I don't die as much than if I'm in a group also it can take soooo long to find a good group then the xp can be crap. I have ok gear but hardly anything with wis because I play on pvp server so I went all MR consequently I always have KEI running to make up for the lack of a big mana pool.<br />
<br />
As far as where to level:<br />
<br />
1-10 Newbie Zones are fine<br />
<br />
10-14 Ocean of Tears: Alluring Sirens are great xp and easy kills <br />
-2 spots in zone: a 3 and 5 spawn on 6 minute timer. At the 5 spawn spot [3] of them require magic wepn to hit them and are a bit higher level so a magical weapons is a must.<br />
<br />
14-26 Paludal Caverns: You'll need group at first till about 20 then be able to solo but the xp is incredible...be prepared to fight non-stop.<br />
<br />
26-31 High Hold Keep [in basement of Keep] Another incredible xp place with non stop action...unfortunately its pretty much group only but a shaman/healer type is always in demand.<br />
<br />
31-34 Dawnshroud Peaks: Pulling the zelzniaks at opposite end from zone in from Netherbian Lair [ I forget what the city is called...] but pulling to the city gates there is safe in case of trouble, I kept on left side of ravine in front of gate...the right side was packed full of those blinding-spit lightcrawlers. The Tribals with a group for fast xp too if you want a change from soloing. Your slows are badly wanted, be ready for non stop action and fun!<br />
<br />
34-39 Great Divide: Giant Scouts are everywhere kill them all by pet kiting they go down nicely and give great xp. Most seemed to be around POP book and once a little higher down towards the ravine that takes you into eastern wastes.<br />
<br />
39-43 Tenebrous Mtns: Grimlings at the 2 caves are awesome xp but watch out for the geomancers the have low hp but hit hard as heck! [casters]<br />
<br />
39-45 Firiona Vie: The Giant camp, 3 giants on FAST spawn, you'll have non-stop pulling make sure to have KEI cuz you'll need it!<br />
<br />
45-47 Tenebrous Mtns: Sonic Wolves are easy once slowed, I could have gone here much sooner and spent more time in the 2 grimling caves which is great xp as well [ grims drop acrylia and windstones so you'll make a lot of cash] but the giants were very nice change of pace. Also the grimling runner for the Rallic pack is there so I would farm the packs at 600p each and make about 1800-2400p /day...not to mention the acrylia to sell. Trolls arent welcome in Katta I don't think [not sure] so have an alt there to pick up the pouches.<br />
<br />
47-51 Ocean of Tears: Seafuries and Gornit in Ocean of Tears TONS of Furies to pull and safe if you pull them to beach, I just slow them and tank without bothering with dot's so I have less downtime medding [I use KEI always] as e-bolt etc suck a lot of mana.<br />
<br />
I like constant pulls without waiting for spawns and where I can solo without fighting over spawns or arguing over camping rights, if that kind of scenario appeals to you then the above will keep you happy to 51. <br />
<br />
One last thing, I just bought a horse [10k after buffs and char items which was the one 2 up from lowest possible] with all my hard earned cash instead of waiting to pick up a Jaundiced Bone Bracer [30k] or a Fungi Tunic [80k] and so far I wish I had not spent the money....it runs much slower than my sow and I don't get that much more mana out of it than if I was just sitting as needed. The only good things are that I can med without getting agro or quickly change spells and rebuff as needed without getting agro. I've only had it a few days but thought I'd mention it.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Katta Castellum residents hate you!  Therefore, teach them a lesson.<br />
<br />
There are two good places at your level.  The Graveyard, inside the church.  Beat up that halfling.  While you wait for him to spawn, wander the graveyard and make the undead pop.  You and your dog should be fine.  (Do not mess with the Gargoyles.  They do not aggro unless provoked -- even if you kill the halfling right next to them.)<br />
<br />
Here is a hidden gem in Katta.  Fight the guards at the Tenebrous zone.  They are perfect for your level.  There is a two spawn that you will have to separate (Use Root).  After that, you are able to single pull to your heart's content.<br />
<br />
The possible downsides:  Occasional guard trains from other players.  Sometimes when you zone into Tenebrous, the guards will see you and attack (be prepared to zone right back into Katta).<br />
<br />
I enjoyed this for many a day.  Now, most of the folks in Sanctus Seru welcome me.</div></div><hr />
