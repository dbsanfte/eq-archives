<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dropped off named in Torg Mines.<br />
I think the name was The Broken Skull Seer. (Shaman I believe)<br />
<br />
Basically it increases as the player's weapon skills increase.<br />
<br />
Seer spawned as the middle mob in a 3 mob spawn room. There is also one wanderer that will come up the the edge of the corridor that leads to the room (no door).<br />
Aggro range is VERY low.<br />
<br />
I am a bit fuzzy on directions but I will try to give them from Nadox Zone-in.<br />
<br />
From Nadox Zone-in:<br />
1) Head down corridor and go through fake wall.<br />
2) Go straight and open door. (static guard behind door)<br />
3) Follow passage left and then follow it until you hit a &quot;T&quot; intersection. (wandering guard along this hall)<br />
4) Take the &quot;T&quot; to the right, be careful, if you continue ahead straight to the wall you will fall down a trap into a water area below. So you need to take the left just before you get to the next &quot;T&quot; at the end of the hall, and that will wrap around and lead you to the other side.<br />
5) I think if you follow this 2nd &quot;T&quot; to the right it will hit an elbow that turns to the left. As it does so, you will see an open doorway straight ahead, and one to the right.<br />
6) Follow the doorway to the right and it will take you down and to the left.<br />
7) you will enter a big room with exits on all sides and 4 static mobs in it. (also 1-2 wanderers pass through here)<br />
8) Take the left corridor. It will then turn to the right and empty into the room that the Seer spawns in.<br />
<br />
From my experience, only (some) nameds will see invis.<br />
<br />
Item is NO DROP and priests only. (CLR/DRU/SHM)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For all we know, it increases your chance to be hit in melee.  Without someone currently using an item in their charm slot, you can't see what the benefits are just from a link.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the lead, though, I hope it's a nice item.</div></div><hr />
