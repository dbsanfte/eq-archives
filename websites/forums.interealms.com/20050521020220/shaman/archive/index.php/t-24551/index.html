<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone has some information on Omens of War raid targets.<br />
<br />
My guild raids 2x a week, fielding between 40 and 50 people.  I think we have 1 or 2 10K tanks, on average we each have 2+ pieces of EP gear.  We killed RZ with 50 I think (but before all the buggy changes lately).  That should give you an idea of what level of game we are at currently.<br />
<br />
Although PoTime is our current target, I'm interested to see if there are OoW mobs that might be a good challenge for our guild.  <br />
<br />
Suggestions?  I don't need detailed info, I just want to know where we could start.  I don't want to waste valuable raid time dragging 45 people to Nobles Causeway to kill a 2grp mob, but I'm not wanting to send those same people on a 2hr CR trying a mob that needs Time equipped people to hit.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Biggest thing that you could do is get everyone their 1.5 epics.  I say that cause a good % of the 2.0 encounters drops loot that are better than time loot.  Just like we have two fights just like that.<br />
<br />
And, i don't know if you want to do it just to say that you are raiding in omens, but even better than that is to just hit up the ikkinz raids in god.  They drop some really good loot that can upgrade a lot of people in certain areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">agree on the ikkinz part, only problem would be to get the guild KT flagged, but with level 70 and the new spells, it shouldn't really be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Should be able to kill Velitorkin in WoS, he's not really much different than the two birds in PoFire.   Might want to give Pyrique and Hivequeen a shot as well. *Possibly* Hulcror.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Veltorkin for sure, and he drops a very nice sham usable bp...great stats, focus is ok--it's a 30% increase in cold based nuke dmg.<br />
<br />
Hulcror possibly, and this guy.../whistle...if you can do it, do it often. he's got some AWESOME pieces.<br />
<br />
aside from that, make your guild do Ikkinz. get KT flagged and get into this stuff. look up Bloodlink Chestmail and Mantle of Mending. both very common drops. also...look closely at the effect on the Bloodlink Chestmail and then consider what our core spells are. it's a 20% mana preservation with max effects up to 67, and scales down from there...but our core spells are really Malos, Turgur's/Balance of the Nihil, and now Yoppa's Mending (68 quick heal), as well as Pained Memory/canni....so of those, the 65 spells for sure are getting max effect, and the quick heal you save at least 15% mana per cast with this BP on. <br />
<br />
i could go on and on, but shouldn't have to. Ikkinz drops own. <br />
<br />
<br />
only bad thing is those god damned bard drops...we got 3 on four of the final golems of ikk2 friday. and had one bard on the raid.<br />
<br />
...who already had it since we got 2 on the four golems at the end of our LAST ikk2 run.<br />
<br />
luckily the Bloodlink Chestmail is common drop :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azmaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi! Have killed alot of the OOW raid mobs so far... Can give you what info I have.... First off In WOS Hulcror Does a AOE 800 a tick dot vary nasty takes PB x2 to cure it He does not see inviz Next up Pyrique Redwing at 50% she splits into 6 shadows weee have to have 6 tanks and the real one hits for over 500 tank calls it and atack that one 30 sec later they change!!! So much fun there. The Murkglider Hivequeen This mob can suck if you mess up with the eggs she lays every 30 sec Cant rember if it is 5 or 6 eggs any ways you have 30 sec to AOE the crap out of them or many many little Hivequeen looking things are born that will wipe your raid.  Cipheron Prity easy mob over all does a AOE FD and the chest will onaly drop if a chanter that dose not have the epic pice loots it. Velitorkin Have to have lev for this guy he does a nice little AOE GF sends the raid flying and a small DD not a vary had mob  Shadowhunter He is not realy a raid mob and not realy a 1 group mob I hate that. Max hit is about 2500 or so and does a AOE FD but whate there is more on top of that he also does a GF not to much fun there when your trying to heal the MT if your going to try and kill him would say 3 groups 1 group can do it if the have the DPS and healing power.    All most all of them drop 69 to 70 spell runes onaly ones who dont are Shadowhunter and I dont think Cipheron does eather well I have this helps you GL Raiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the responses so far guys.<br />

Guess I'll start with WoS, then start scouring for mobs on Allahs.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, i don't know if you want to do it just to say that you are raiding in omens, but even better than that is to just hit up the ikkinz raids in god. They drop some really good loot that can upgrade a lot of people in certain areas.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone loves to see new zones of course, but my main reasons are:<br />
<br />
a) I'm trying to explore the idea of OoW being 'easier' than GoD.  Bypassing the 4 sewer trials via Smith Rondo is on our list, but GoD as whole (with all the trials/flags) is still on the 'future plans' section of the board.<br />
<br />
b) Right now we are having a bitch of a time with Virt flags in PoP, we have some returning players we have to V-flag into PoFire.  I'd like to have a list of possible targets in unkeyed zones that drop comparable loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my guild trying to drag us into vex thhrall. i voted no, and sad we should conc on oow.<br />
<br />
only half guild has oow, so this one is raging on our guilds forum.<br />
<br />
imo vex thal is a waste of time now. am i wrong?<br />
dont wos drops from single grp named surpass VT drops??<br />
Thers alot of trash to clear in vt before u get to named mobs right??<br />
<br />
sounds like its gonna be frustration central ! counting in the keying up time.<br />
<br />
whatu think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Vex Thal has something WoS doesn't have. It doesn't have swarms of people in it.<br />
Vex Thal is a goldmine for any guild gearing up for elementals. The amount of loot that drops is nearly impossible for a pre-EP guild to pass up.<br />
<br />
Yes the upgrades are better, but they are few compared to VT. Plus, your guildmates will pretty much have to get Omens to continue playing.<br />
A level 65 just has less options available to him than a level 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If they like getting wisdom teeth removed without the benefit of anesthetic, then by all means, encourage them to focus on VT. If not, then tell them to get OoW. I'm sure that they will change their minds after the first 16 hour session clearing up to that hall with 20 odd mobs in it (oh, did I mention that some are virtually unstunnable to 65s [I think pallys can though], and when they gate they bring an army of friends back). All the rooms look the same, all the mobs look the same, and you kill thousands of them (seems like it anyway) to get to where the real loot is. Once you have been in there a while, and have your mage bots camped out in strategic locations, it goes a lot faster, but boy, those first half dozen or so raids were real killers. <br />
<br />
Point out that the BP that drops from AHR is not that much better than that smithed magnetic thing from OoW. Point out that epic 1.5 surpasses most (if not all) time weapons. Point out that VT level gear drops like candy from 1 groupable frequently popping nameds. Point out elemental level lot drops from the raid encounters for epic 1.5, and time level from 2.0 encounters. There are armor quests that yield VT+ stuff. There are so many gear upgrade options in OoW its not funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vex Thal is a natural progressoin step. Almost every guild on my server who has tried to pass it by, has had troubles in the elementals.<br />
<br />
Unless Vex Thal is heavily contested on your server, i heartilly suggest you clear it a number of times to get the average gear and skill levels up a notch or two before progressing.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the yardtrash clearing... that should be a breeze with a little planning and some AE groups...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I'll be the naysayer of the bunch.  My guild skipped VT altogether.  We went straight from NTOV to PoP, and never looked back.  Bertox was a tough fight when most of the raid was 61-63, but it was doable.  Heck, now you have level 70 available, and spells to boot.  It's very doable.  That extra 5 levels will help a lot.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree Vigdis... skipping VT isn't a very good idea. WoS drops only come close in stats... not effects, foci, and definitely not anywhere close in quantity. you'd have to farm WoS/RCoD for weeks to get the same number of USEFUL drops that you could get in one clearing of VT. 15-15 hrs for one vt clearing is a bit of an exaggeration. if it takes you that long to clear VT, then you're probably not going to be doing many of the harder OoW targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/agree Chutoi.<br />
<br />
VT is 5 expansions old.  You don't need it to progress any more.  <br />
<br />
There are some very nice items that are still useful from VT but I don't think they are worth the time sink for an entire guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you do not have 2-3 mages to park permanently in VT or a couple of rez sticks then skip it. We had a rez stick to solve our problem but shortly after it ran outta charges we hated going back and we lacked alt mages to park up there. We went back like 1-2 times before attendence fell off (plus we got a lot of upgrades) and then we ran into other problems, but suffice it to say a 5-7 hr raid sucks. Course in Sep we did VT like 9 times due to all the patches. And there are items in VT that I will never get rid of like my clicky KEI (MGBable and extendable) and my clicky malonisia. And the Ahen neck will be a mainstay on my chanter forever as I doubt I will see an upgrade. And the warrior BP has nice stats which which will hold ya over till either Vadd/Raex BPs come along. Some decent stuff and large quantity but OoW attuneable has destroyed a bunch of the usefullness of VT. The upside is with 35-40 68+ characters you can just run through it with your eyes shut (bad thing is you get so bored cause its sooo easy).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Vex thal, definitely some good and bad points.<br />
<br />
Yes it is an absolute ton of loot in a fairly short period of time.<br />
A number of very nice items that are hard to replace, aten neck, a couple handy clicky items etc.<br />
A variety of nice focuses like crown of ambivolence, bracelet of darkness etc that you can't really get anything comparable until time.<br />
<br />
on the other hand it is still an investment of time to get into the zone. Thats simplified by access to other gear else where, new aa's, spells and levels but can still be a difficult task for a casual guild. Especially since everyone needs to be individually keyed for Emps room and farm thier shards.<br />
Additionally alot of the vt drops aren't gonna be a big deal anymore. OoW drops especially are comparable stats to vt items often times.<br />
Many of the focus items are less useful now less useful being caped at 65<br />
<br />
There are alot of different options to get access to comparable gear now with out the major investment in time. You won't get them in the quantity of VT tho.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd probably say it depends. How far are you from vt? Has your guild started getting keys and is nearly done or have you not even started yet? How availble is VT? Is there a euro guild doing it regularly or is it sitting up not killed by anyone most days? Unless your nearly keyed and vt is almost always up i'd lean towards the just skip it side of things. You could already skip VT and start doing PoP. OoW just adds even more options for getting gear.<br />
<br />
Vt definitely can still produce a massive amount of gear in a short period of time but there are still other optionss for getting geared up. Heck in exp zones in OoW you'll see drops of the 1 group named comparable to alot of VT stuff. Riftseekers seems to have a nice ft3 bp for each type that compair well to the drops in VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Another perspective? This is a GAME, for goodness sake. You paid for content. Why in the world would you choose to blow off something you paid for?<br />
<br />
Go and experience the content that's there for you. If you don't like it, then you don't have to go back, but at least see all of the game.<br />
<br />
I've never understood people who don't know their way around in Norrath. I'm proud of the fact that I've wandered around in every zone in this game that I'm capable of access to, from seeing ToV from front to back (and zoning into Mischief from there) to every inch of Ssra Temple and VT all the way to AHR, the boss room in every dungeon in Kunark, Runnyeye from end to end and Permafrost the same, all of those godforsaken zones in Luclin that nobody ever goes to, Hate's Fury, every PoP zone including 7th Hammer's room in Justice, and now every zone I'm keyed for up to Inktu'Ta and all of OoW except Anguish. I figure I paid for it all, its there for the taking, why not reach out and grab it?<br />
<br />
And for VT itself: you can clear that zone in 5 hours once you have it down and you have mages in place. And those 5 hours yield around 25 pieces of gear. Time is the only other place you can get those kinds of return on investment. Yes, much of it is replaceable soon, but things like the clicky resist ring, the skeleton bracelet, and other items will still prove useful for a long time to come.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Does anyone else see what is wrong with have Bot mages in place to make a zone doable?<br />
<br />
Theya re talking about 3-4 Level 55 mages. On accounts. No wonder roleplaying is almost dead. Little bot armies of charecters who have been created simply to exploit The design of the zones. Hey need more healing. Plug in a few Macroquest Botted Clerics and boom content aquired.<br />
<br />
It is cheating plain and simple. Doing an end around. Of course I really don't blame the folks too much because when you go to those extremes to have fun then the design of the zone sucks. <br />
<br />
(sigh)<br />
<br />
Just another ugly little facet of the game we play. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's interesting to see how raid zone design can really affect guild morale.<br />
<br />
After suffering through VT (long camps, long painful raids), my guild really enjoyed the elementals. Sure, flagging was a pain in the ass, but it's almost easier to flag as a guild raid force than to beg 3-4 people to come to Sraa and camp a ring piece for Emp key.<br />
<br />
Time is a BEAUTIFUL raid zone. Easy to get to - so if you're late (because you have to work?) and want to join the raid after it begins there is no danger to get there. No see invis mobs, no long run. Just leave a two box alt in Time A, get an invite and you are immediately at the raid, ready to play with your friends, ready to enjoy your gametime immediately.<br />
<br />
Compare that experience to joining a guild raid already in progress in Uqua. Running to KT isn't so bad, but KT is a laggy zone, with see invis mobs making the run to Yxxta dangerous. If you die in KT, you're screwed, your guild is a zone away and no one can drag and rez you, your game night is pretty much over.<br />
<br />
If you make it to Yxxta you still have to make it past see invis mobs to the raid zone. If you die (and you probably will) it's a serious hassle, gotta get a rogue to come out and drag you, gotta get a cleric to come out and rez you. Shaman have it MUCH easier than a lot of classes, with lev, sow, invis (and improved invis, if you're lucky enough to have the spell). <br />
<br />
After 6 months in Time, my guild still gets a 70+ person turnout for Time, we can barely scrape 40 people together for a planned Uqua raid. If I'm leaving work on time on an Uqua night, I rarely even bother to log in. The thought of having to join an Uqua raid already in progress is unmotivating.<br />
<br />
I just find it really interesting that the SOE design team goes to such extremes between expansions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">An alternative to VT is LDoNs. Not really something you can do as a guild but the 1492 point gear is very nice, particularly fully augmented. Admittedly, you don't get the nice clickies or focii but it is certainly easier to achieve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">wow Kinedorf, I really have to disagree with that. I can't imagine how long gearing yourself up (we're talking about gearing up a guild btw, not individuals) with the best ldon armors and augs would take you. getting keyed for VT is not that terrible of a time sink, seriously. the guild has to be working as a team on it, and it will let you know who is in for the long haul and who isn't. I've vt keyed 2 toons (and 90% or so on another), and probably spent less than 2-3 wks on each key. <br />
<br />
15 high risk adv for one piece of the better armor, and you have to do this 8 times for a full set =\ <br />
11(?) for 1 40 hp aug X however many you want/need<br />
7-12 (guessing here, but close I think) for 1 foci/effect aug X however many you want/need<br />
<br />
thats a minumum of 33 high risk adventures just to get and aug one piece of the better ldon armor. to hell with that. even if you can do them fast as hell, that's probably close to 25 rl hrs invested in 1 piece of gear. crazy, imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My guild chose to do VT thoroughly... about a year ago, actually.  I never regretted it, but I don't think I would want to go through it again.<br />
<br />
At this point there is no need to go to VT to get acceptable gear.  Ornate is almost as good as VT gear and much easier to get.  OoW drops from 1- and 2-groupable mobs are better than VT gear.  LDON gear can be as good as or better than VT gear.  And Tier 1-3 of POP should be trivial if you all level to 70, so you should be able to go farm elemental gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree.  VT was more than just a candy store, it was a source for specific clickies that are either a) not found elsewhere, or b) not found elsewhere comparably easy.<br />
<br />
*ponders* 20 Shaman (+1 rogue :( ) marching on VT?  I haven't been back there in ages, but I was one of the few that actually enjoyed the zone (mostly!).  Yeah it was long, but /shrug, I'm a glutton for the zone I guess.  The only issue would be the 4-8 mob pulls, but with that many Shaman... not a huge issue at that.<br />

<br />
Might not be able to get that elsewhere, but you dont really need it either, and along the way you are going to get a lot of drops that will definitely be replaced as soon as you start raiding higher end PoP zones, and pretty much any raid content in GoD or OoW. I finally got rid of the last vestiges of VP about a month ago (legs and bp), and to be honest, neither of those items was much better than the OoW smithed magnetic armor that I kitted my little cleric out with. Is it really worth spending 2 months keying yourself and everyone else in the guild to get a 1 in 30 shot at items you could probably make in a few days for everyone by just running your guild through PG?<br />
<br />
One thing VP does have in its favor though is readily available 41% haste items, which might otherwise not be easily obtained by a guild at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">My guild only started going from casual to raiding about a year ago. Just around the time GoD came out we had a guild meeting and asked our guildmates which progression they wanted to take. We were just coming out of Halls of Testing, we asked them if we should hit NToV/ST, PoP or VT.<br />
<br />
The majority were excitied about VT. So we skipped NToV/ST and decided to get ourselves keyed for VT.<br />
<br />
Last night we took down Emp for the third time, so we'll be hitting VT very soon and the only guilds in there are just about on their way out. Only one other guild is behind us and still several months away from taking their first steps in there. <br />
<br />
Basically we'll have the place all to ourself. And with level 70's, new spells, and already being well equiped with some LDoN, GoD and OoW stuff we're expecting to be able to fly through there.<br />
<br />
Once we're done there and have everyone well equipped we're expecting PoP to be a relative breeze too.<br />
<br />
Not saying this will be real easy for us, but we're not a hardcore raiding guild. Our fear with going straight off to PoP was getting ourselves flagged for the EP's and hitting a wall because we're not equipped to handle it. We figured it's better to do VT now rather than later.<br />
<br />
We're all getting better equipment here and there in OoW but I honestly can't see the whole guild getting equipped any faster way than going to VT.<br />
<br />
Besides, We're just about done. The past summer was hell with keying but now the majority of the guild is keyed with only a handful of people missing some shards here and there. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Last night for us was a great example of how much different GoD is from OoW.  <br />
<br />
We had to do Keeper of the Alter again for some flags.  Many of the GoD fights are kill the named before you wipe to a impossible number of adds.  Keeper is a prime example of this.  Just do a full out burn.  Now GoD has a few interesting things (mobs who need classes/archetypes to kill), but thats it.<br />
<br />
After Keeper we did a trial in MPG.  Cant remember the named (from the Power NPC).  But the basic idead was your raid is fighting other PCs.  First wave is a Wiz, cleric, chanter, warrior, monk, and rogue.  The chanter will mez melee, the rogue will go SoS and BS someone (several K BS), the monk will FD and while he is FD, he cannot be attacked.  Although we lost on the second wave, it was something GoD isnt.  Fun.</div></div><hr />
