<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what is available and what the effects do.  Used to be pretty easy - increase damage - doh!! I could figure that out.  But,  E`ci is beyond my understanding.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How about clicking on the &quot;Sticky: Guide: Focus Items (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=2749)&quot; thread at the top of this forum?<br />
<br />
Dang, that was difficult. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got your difficult.<br />

Looking for info on NEW items NOT listed here.  And I can live without grade school sarcasm.  Your mom not teach you about talking nice to others?<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're no fun. :)<br />

Grade school sarcasm? My sarcasm is FAR more superior in wit to that of mere grade shoolers. It's AT LEAST as quippy as middle school sarcasm (even though I'm 38 :)). Thank you very much!<br />
<br />
Seriously though...didn't realize you were looking for information not contained in that post since you didn't specify that fact. <br />
<br />
Sorry man...my crystal ball broke last week and it's still in the shop, so I can't read your mind. Bummer. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/) tells you what the effects do, and often what items have that effect. You may find the Focus Effects list at Allakhazam's (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/focuslist.html) even more useful. Those are two big EQ sites I'm surprised you aren't familiar with yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">www.bjornstar.com (http://www.bjornstar.com) is by far the best focus effect site I've seen.  It has good descriptions of all the different effects, and links to lucy.ford.net where you can find the items that have the effects you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry I asked, and thanks for the sites.  You have to be an attorney to understand this stuff.<br />
