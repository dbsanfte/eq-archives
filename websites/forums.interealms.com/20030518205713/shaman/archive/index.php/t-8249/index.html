<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>robert135</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is a website that has alot of the classes Computer Science students have to take, with the lectures Webcast. The school is Berkely so it is not bad classes or teachers at all. <br />
<br />
So if your interested  in becomming a major, or are just interested in what is to come out of a class, Check it out.<br />
<br />
Berkley Webcasts (http://webcast.berkeley.edu/courses/schedule.html?group=54)<br />
<br />
BTW, this is where I think public education should be heading. Allowing free access to the content however paid access to teachers to allow for more indepth discussion of the content and questions.</div></div><hr />
