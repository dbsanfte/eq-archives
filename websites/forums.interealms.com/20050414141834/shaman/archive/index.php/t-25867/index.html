<br />
I bought the expansion Dragons of Norath and the concept is the same as LDON ( which i love 679 wins ranked # 3 on server) from what I have seen and been told. BUT the only problem is I couldn't start a mission. It seems you must do some kind of quest. Well after spending two hours trying to do by asking people wheres this and where do I find that  I logged off. <br />
<br />
Can anyone put out a link for this or write down what needs to be done ? I had assembled the group but couldn't select any missions.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />
<br />

Short story: on each server, the passage needs to be cleared, then everyone on the server will be able to access the content and get the missions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">so what are the missions like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Missions are about 5000 times better than LDON. They use instanced versions of regular zones of course, and they have fun things to do. One of the missions is to plant a type of poison bombs in strategic locations around the thundercrest isles to kill off the inhabitants. Once you get to the last spot, you have 20 minutes to set the bomb and get out of the zone or you get killed by the poison AE. I did a lavaspinners instance last night where you had to kill 15 each of 3 types of mobs, and loot 7 each of 3 different items to complete the mission. You get about 4% AA exp per kill at 70, so it's much better than ldon and much easier. Mobs hit for around 680 or so in the lavaspinners instance since it's one of the easier ones, the harder ones I assume go up by around 200dmg max hits. I'm going to be spending all my time doing these because they are more fun than regular exping and just as good of exp.</div></div><hr />
