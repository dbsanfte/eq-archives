<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I guess some uber guild (Order of Redemption) decided not to share Warders with anyone else after all.  I guess there is alot of namecalling and mass fall outs from the guild and such now because it was done at night by the GL without the knowledge of most of the members who agreed with the thought that it should be left open for other guilds... oh well i might not have even seen them with my new guild but hey its fun to dream about eh? :)</div></div><hr />

I still think the zone is fun after they're awake.  I just like the ambience of it.<br />
<br />
Don't go as much as we used to, but we got a primal 1HB last week.  Better than nothing.<br />
<br />
It's not like Sleepers is totally worthless after they're dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Having played on Fennin Ro for about 2 years before moving to Saryrn (the day I xferred there I think the resident uber guild awoke sleeper also) I have to say this doesn't surprse me. I know they had some sort of agreement worked out but Fennin is the poopiest of the poopy when it comes to honorable people. Someone will almost always wreck things just because they can. It's a bummer but blame the design too, here are these mobs waiting to be killed but don't kill the last one or it all goes bye bye. <br />
<br />
The temptation is too much for some people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fennin is the poopiest of the poopy when it comes to honorable people.<br />

Spend some time on Sol Ro... I was there from release to when I xfered recently... Fennin is a godsend to me compared to that pos server.</div></div><hr />

It's a guild's RIGHT to take out all the warders if they can and want to.<br />
<br />
It's in the game..that's the way it is.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, they are NOT ruining the rest of the server's happy happy fun time.<br />

<br />
For those of us that have real lives, jobs, family whatever that puts us behind the curve of the uberguilds, the only thing that redeemed EQ was the fact that it was okay if you didn't do it first, you could do it eventually. Get to 60? Took me two years, but here I am. Clear VP? About a year after it was first done on our server. Was I among the first to kill Inny or CT 3.0? Nope, but I have killed them.<br />
<br />
I'm glad that representatives from Verant have said they regret the Sleeper script and I hope they don't initiate any more &quot;one time events&quot; catering to the uberest of the uber.  (GM events, excluded).  I entered Sleeper's Tomb months after the Sleeper had been awakened on Emarr; Sleeper gone, Warders gone, the zone gutted and fairly uninteresting, just a farm zone now.<br />
<br />
I hope I don't sound particularly whiny; awakening the Sleeper was what the designers had intended, after all and the prestige of releasing the Sleeper was a challenge that few guilds could resist.  I would like to think, that if me and my guild had the choice of whether to kill the fourth warder or to leave the warders and the fun of killing them and the loot they drop in the game for others to experience, we would have chosen to share the experience, not end it.</div></div><hr />

It is more than primal there are some caster drops and the &quot;gnome mask&quot; that are forever gone now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Snacko, I think, for me, the point is that EQ is *not* a dynamic world.  From the first time you killed orcs and saw the same orcs pop back up again 10 minutes later, the idea of renewable Norrathian resources was established.<br />
<br />
If a new online game was created that was truly dynamic from the beginning, I would probably judge it by different standards than I judge EQ.</div></div><hr />

Hate to break it to you, but ST was &quot;just a farm zone&quot; before the sleeper was woke.  Only difference is there were 4 more things to farm.</div></div><hr />

That's the way it is.  The Sleeper script is your dynamic content.<br />
<br />
And yes, SoD, Mask of Tinkering, Dragon Scaled Mask, Clawed Guardian Bracer, Writs of Dragonkind (garbage anyway), and resistance stones don't drop anymore.<br />
<br />
While they all have appeal, the only big loss is SoD's.</div></div><hr />

That's the price you pay for dynamic events.  The world changes, and everyone is effected.  People for so long asked for different kinds of events in EQ, the dev team delivered, and everyone complained they could no longer their phat lewts.<br />
<br />
It kind of saddens me when I see those posts, because it means people would rather play in the 'skinner box', then experience a truely dynamic world where the actions you perform actually have meaning.</div></div><hr />

1) They dont get prestige or anything of the like for doing this... they are not the first ones through ST they were not the first ones to have the opportunity.  There was an agreement between the powers to leave the sleeper untriped as it didnt really do anything but screw the up and coming guilds.<br />
<br />
2)I posted this primarily to share the info with the people here... god forbid there be fennin people here who havent heard yet and also to share that the oldest server in EQ has now failed the stupidity test put in place by VI.</div></div><hr />

Yes EQ wont, and will never be 'now'.  The Sleeper was the test as to how people would treat dynamic events.  People proved that they do not enjoy them, so EQ will forever be a static world.  No matter what you do, your actions are completely meaningless when it comes to impacting the world.</div></div><hr />

Yes but with the way EQ was built it doesnt fit the dynamic world at all... it is equipment/level central... we all know that and having a situation where one can gimp a zone/server out of 95% the chance on getting what was in the zone before is just stupid in relation to what is already set as the precident.  Like Gloriana said if someone builds a truely dynamic content game then we can judge it for the apple it is... EQ's oragne is already old and moldy in comparison to be adding something this powerful onto it.</div></div><hr />

Why the hell do you think people don't awake the sleeper?... TO FARM THE WARDERS<br />

hey Gloriana I hear the short bus calling your name</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">*shrug* I never killed the warders, I guess I imagined them being more of a &quot;raid&quot; type mob involving some kind of tactics rather than the 3 named mobs which are just kinda &quot;yawn.&quot;   ie. killing the warders was more fun than just a boring run through to get the 3 named mobs and farm some primal, which is all we do now.  The only descriptions I've ever read about Warder fights, seemed to imply they were tons of fun.<br />
<br />
Nice to have you aboard, Slithe, I can tell you will be a fine addition to the Crucible, such wit (&quot;short bus&quot; ha! such a wonderful choice of bon mot)!  Truly a pleasure to debate with someone who can construct such fine arguments not to mention, state their opinion so eloquently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Soooo...you're calling whatever guild that killed all the warders on your server stupid, then.  Stupid for triggering an event no one else would do.<br />
<br />
So, while you're just &quot;reporting the news,&quot; you still wanted to get your opinion in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh well i might not have even seen them with my new guild&quot;<br />
<br />
http://www.eqguide.com/changingtide/members.htm<br />
<br />
Hmm..if your guild's webpage is up to date...<br />
<br />
Hrothgar (52)<br />
<br />
You're only ** 52  ** and you're complaining the warders are gone.  I'm going to go ahead and assume you weren't going to see Sleepers any time soon.<br />
<br />
Looking over your guild roster, as a guild, I don't think you were going to see Sleepers any time soon.<br />
<br />
Now, don't take offense to that - - I'm sure your guild has plenty of nice people, and you get done what you want to get done.  Don't take this as me knocking on your guild, I'm not.<br />
<br />
Looking over your news page and such, and seeing what your guild does, I'm (assuming again) you've never even killed any of the brood dragons for a Sleeper's Key.<br />
<br />
Anyways..my point.  Before you make such a big deal out of waking up the Sleeper and calling people stupid, play to 60, play the end game, and see just how little impact it makes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hey I orginally said &quot;one can dream&quot; no?  And I never stated my guild was an up and coming guild...  I said maybe/perhaps/possibly...  And I am well aware of the end game thank you very much.  I may not play it personally but I know it from here and from the 60 friends I have on various other servers.  But then again your just trying to circumvent the issue at hand with some cheeseball tactics.<br />
<br />
These days why does one release the sleeper or farm warders:<br />
<br />
1) PRIMAL - after sleeper is release this is lowered to about 80% of the original drop rate.<br />
<br />
2) perhaps the monk Shroud<br />
<br />
3) To stop other guilds from getting these items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ogreshm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't see what's wrong with guilds utilizing content specifically designed for them. On the other hand, I do have a problem with people trashing guilds because they screwed up their chance to farm primal weapons. That's wrong on so many levels.<br />
<br />
If you want to fault someone, fault the designers of the content. They designed it to be first come, first serve.  &quot;Agreement among the great powers&quot; aside, its the guild leader's choice to pursue content. Whatever issues the members of this guild have with their guild leader is something for them to resolve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kumari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">first of all, the Guild didn't want it done.  It was a few lamers in the guild that did it.  <br />
<br />
2nd, another guild killed the 3 hardest warders leaving the weakest one up.<br />
<br />
That is the one they killed to awaken the sleeper.  They didn't accomplish anything other then destroy the guild when over half quit the guild over this event and earn the ire of the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">the deal here is that the sleeper was awoken, against 95% of the will of the uber guilder players, behind the backs of the biggest guild on the server, in secret. and BY members (now ex-) of that same biggest guild. like an assassination or bombing if you will, that nobody expected. believe it or not, but there was actually an unwritten agreement between all ST enabled guilds not to wake the sleeper, because it was and is stupid. but these people just did it to be *******s, NOTHING else. they had their monk shrouds and stuff....so they just decided to be dicks.<br />
<br />
there's no excuse for waking the sleeper these days. every lvl 25 n00b knows excactly what happens, sleeper wakes, DT's everything in the zone, then goes to skyshrine and kills everything there. then poofs. you've all seen the screenshots. BIG deal....nothing is gained from doing this (essence items suck).</div></div><hr />

According to Hrotghar, it was the guild leader's decision. And obviously he had large guild support, since the warder went down (not something &quot;a few lamers&quot; can do, as I understand it). Anyone who leaves their guild over this shouldn't let the screen door hit them on their way out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kumari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">read the post. They didnt kill the 4 warders. Only 15 people killed the final weakest warder after another guild had cleared the other warders.</div></div><hr />

Order of Redemption, has come to an end. Put 6ft under by the gay leader's Real life brother, Solkunar, and some of his real life friends. Was the leader there? We have yet to confirm so I will hold all of my comments till I know for sure. But let me tell you this, all of my RL friends, and myself, will no longer take part in this gay guild.

Just curious who still hasnt.<br />
This particular incident seems a bit underhanded at first glance,a group of 15? people stealth into ST to kill the weakest warder left up intentionally by another guild.Thats really lame IMO. Waking the sleeper is one thing but slipping into ST in the middle of the night with a small force and taking down the one mob left up to preserve a server agreement is just sad.</div></div><hr />

When we went to ST last night, Zefah stated explicitly that we were NOT going to awaken the Sleeper. Solkunar and a few pals made a big stink about wanting to wake the Sleeper.

There has been a mass deguilding from OOR - all the people that have stayed loyal to their word have proved it here, and essentially weeded out those weak-willed (those that are staying with OOR regardless of the 9 (or so's) actions, and those that are the truely honourable players (those that deguilded - not a small number). Before you go spouting off at someone with an OOR tag, make sure you know how they stood on this :-p<br />

And no, I'm not in OOR, but on the server. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The Sleeper is still sleeping on Karana, though im sure we have our own misfits that want a one time high and will awaken her (it).<br />
<br />
all those that say big deal are missing the point i think.  This is a game and not everyone will be able to do or kill everything in it.  They should have the chance though.  It doesnt matter if a bunch of people that have no real life accomplish something in 2 days, that takes someone else 2 years.  They both pay the same fee to have the 'chance' to do it. <br />
<br />
The fact that there is loot  that will no longer drop and other loot that still drops, but at a vastly reduced rate just compounds the problem.  none of this loot is unbalancing or broken, which is the only time items have been removed from the game by the manufactor of the game.  This is the only opportunity for someone IN the game to deny this loot (or experience) to another person.<br />
<br />
Yes i am in a guild that farms ST, but that is beside the point.  I havent been as a shaman and would one day want to. <br />
<br />
EQ is not a dynamic world, so that argument is moot.  Legends is prolly their attempt at a more dynamic world and im seeing more and more people come back from it.<br />
<br />
The only reason to waken the sleeper is to deprive another person of the opportunity to kill the warders and be able to say... nah nah look what we did, you cant!<br />
<br />
primals are nice, but weapons coming out of luclin are better.  only reason most tanks use primal is to get avatar to proc and then switch out.  Personally i want every tank to have primal, im SO tired of avatar please.  Most think i have primal avatar, which of course i dont.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. It's not.  It's an experience in itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">As was stated, EQ is not a dynamic world. EQ team never knew the meaning of the word, and Legends is as dynamic as China is democratic. Pigs will start flying before EQ becomes dynamic, but by then it wont matter, to me anyway, as there are other worlds on the horizon. As for waking the Sleeper, to experience the &quot;one time event&quot;.. One time event of what? Getting your backside handed to you on a pink plate? Truly 'unique' experience, and event where you have no chance whatsoever to do anything other then die like a cattle, as simple as that.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that if the guild has agreed beforehand, that they do not do that, and then some shmucks in the guild go and do it - then these shmucks are lame indeed and the people who left, did the right thing. Those who stayed with the guild, should really reconsider - they were cheated once, by their OWN people, against the agreement. They showed their loyalty and did not leave the guild, albeit being betrayed once. What are they waiting for? Until they are betrayed for the second time by their own people? Third time? Loyalty and a guild as such are a 2-way road - you give some and you receive some. And most crappiest thing is to betray your own people for some brief, insignificant moment, which in the game terms means nothing, and in the long run actually screwes the things up for other players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">These days why does one release the sleeper or farm warders: <br />
<br />
1) PRIMAL - after sleeper is release this is lowered to about 80% of the original drop rate. <br />
<br />
2) perhaps the monk Shroud <br />
<br />
3) To stop other guilds from getting these items.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Slithe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">heck if I was in a guild that could do ST I would have it where everyone gets their primal and then we release the sleeper so no one else can get primals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Morbad you really have no clue. The fact is that since warders no longer spawn, now the zone is only good for farming Primal and priceless weapons. There is no caster loot, unless you count the 2hb primal. These weapons are argueably still some of the best in the game but now when casters go to help get it they have no chance of getting anything themselves. That and the SoD is absolutely one of the best Main tank aggro items in the game. The poster may be only level 52 but that doesn't mean he can't be disappointed. Your response is typical of the people that already have their items and want to remain elite thus preventing anyone else from obtaining the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">SoD is overrated.  Much better taunt items in the game Kriz flame would be one of them.  <br />
<br />
Leaving the warder one up is a stupid chance you take.  Personally I would of been a d1ck if it was left up and had it killed.  Gawmaker, you are absolutley correct it is a statment about already having items and wanting to be elite.  Waking the sleeper is something you and a lot of folks will never do, that I have.  Does it make me better then you? (maybe) but for the sake of arguement, Nope.   Am I am better person then you IRL? (maybe) but for the sake of arguement, Nope.  All it does is give me bragging rights in the playground.  Releasing the Sleeper doesn't even set back other guilds from doing the content you hav moved onto.  They just find different methods to do it with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I realize you 2 know everything there is to know about the game, and absolutely have put a ton of thought into this particular encounter (have you ever actually participated in it?  or just guessing and going off 2nd hand information?), but please for a moment just consider this:  Not 2 weeks ago FoH posted on their front page that the Lord Inquisitor was Unkillable.  Now the latest update on their page shows his corpse.  Isn't it possible that something someone said was unkillable 9 months ago might actually be doable?<br />
<br />
That being said, i've fought him, and i absolutely think he's killable.  If anyone on one of the servers hes still asleep on wants to give him a shot, find me in game and we'll talk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">The force that released him was 13-15 just in case you forgot to read that part...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Well.  It IS a thrill to see the Sleeper released, but..<br />
<br />
This IS a game.<br />
<br />
One definition of the word game from dictionary.com is:<br />
<br />
&quot;A competitive activity or sport in which players contend with each other according to a set of rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am kinda competitive.  I was happy to see the Sleeper released on Bristlebane.  I won't name any names, but the two guilds who deserved their ST loot got it.  The guild who jumped mobs in euro time to get keys was denied, and is run by an ex-banned cheater, no less.<br />
<br />
But, guess what?  They're still the number 3 guild, and do their own thing.  They're slowly building up primal.   It's not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
Sooo..I'm just gonna have to go along with Wildaar on my stance here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I'm not talking about your server Hrothgar.  Quite frankly you should be happy he was asleep that long, most people got what they wanted out of ST and closed it a long time ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sleeper...is...undefeatable...by...design....not...meant...to...be...killed.<br />
<br />
And yes, I was DT'd by him, yes, I saw him, yes, I saw how much he melees for, and yes, I know someone with whatever hacks or packet sniffers found out he has a billion odd HP.<br />

Not saying they won't ever change him to be killable, but he is not now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Just a quick window into my life back in summer of 01.<br />
Saturday 1pm EST. sitting in Sleeper's waiting for the rest of the guild to show up for its bi monthly ST clearing (we rotated with another guild ) at that point we had 40+ keyed members and usually 22-30 would actually show up, the zone was so exciting!<br />
<br />
Everyone shows up, so we start the clearing down, usually getting through the library is the best part becuase some overzealous rogues start blowing up a garg that has mana and it gates, library royal rumble, this part was actually fun.<br />
<br />
Kill that stuff, go down more steps. run down run down.<br />
kill a bajillion  ancient sentries and get to The Final Arbitard.<br />
knock him over and set up by the gate to the sleepers lair.<br />
<br />
This is where all the fun you people missed begins!<br />
<br />
Sit there, buff  25+ people. get float, casters hide  from AE, Koryo pulls dragon #1 to gate.  dispell nanz DS. assist heal, heal heal heal. dragon dead right away.<br />
<br />
Dragon 2# Tukaraak, no need to buff becuase he nobody died from dragon#1 , Koryo pulls Tuk, casters hide from AE  wizards-melees blow the crap out of poor tuk. and he goes down right on top of Nanzatas body.<br />
<br />
Dragon3# Hraashna , need to buff some resist on him,  and one or 2 wizards/rogues need rebuffs becuase they got a little charred from dragon#2.<br />
Koryo pulls Hraash, everyone lays into him, blam blam blam.<br />
boom. Dead and a few members die from his nasty dot. All 3 dead in under 30 minutes and we have a nice dragon pile with 2 hand primals rotting away.  What is wanted on the other dragons is divied out and we all set up for ports out.<br />
<br />
That was a typical ST saturday til we figured out that ventani can be done if you work around her AE radius and time  the silence. Ventani was not a high hp dragon as were  neither of the warders. They were made more easy becuase of Dragonbane spells. <br />
So every other week we would go in clear the trash dragons and just practice for 2-3hours on Ventani. very tedious and very boring.<br />
We had a breakthrough and had actually gotten Ventani down to 50% . A few days later FoH releases its complete walkthrough to killing ventani and we said damn all this hard work and now  its all for nothing if anyone else has a paint by numbers on how to do it.<br />
So we practice EVERY night, and sched our final Ventani run for the following saturday.<br />
<br />
That weekend we all are jazzed up becuase we want that bitch dead and we know she is gonna die we even leave nanzpoopy up . People are so intent on killing her that we actually get a large turnout that day of 40+<br />
<br />
Ventani attempt #1 main tank dies early so we start over.<br />
Ventani attempt#2 wizards nuke too much or something and  Ventani hops over to the dragon pad to eat the wizards, and everyone camps<br />
Ventan attempti #3 was the shiznit. was some arguing in chat about the proper timing but we hammered it all out.<br />
Koryo pulls Ventani, leads her down ramp and its just perfect. arrows flying all over the place wizard bombs streaking down like mad.  Ventani not moving one inch from her spot. and wham bam shes dead in a hurry.<br />
Score 3 shrouds of longevity, which just happened to be all the active monks in the guild.<br />
<br />
After there was much rejoicing and much relief on our part we started asking , should we release the sleeper or not. Koryo asked the guild what we wanted. It was a unanimous HELL YES.<br />
We had been so sick of ST for months and months we all showed up because we wanted to finally kill this fecking zone and never  have to come back .<br />
This was our moment this was our time, we worked out the strat on our own and this was time bring the sucker down.<br />
<br />
Before we killed Nanzata we invited members from the 3 other guilds on the server who had ST keys to witness this one time event. <br />
<br />
Several people from the other guilds show up along with other Magi members just coming home from work who wanted to catch the big nasty do his thing<br />
<br />
So we get everyone in and kill Nanzata and free Sleeper, get owned by the uberest dragon in EQ and then laugh at all the hate tells while we are sitting dead in kael. I know its a corny event and i know it seemed like it hamstringed some guilds who were wanting to see WW dragons in a closed zone but that never entered our mind. This was about completing a section of an expansion which was begun about 7 months before.<br />
<br />
There is no decent caster loot in ST , the Scepter of Destruction is a good taunt weapon but there is a much better one off the creator in ssra, the gnome mask, get over it. bard/rogues only have like 8 bajillion illusion masks to choose from now.<br />
<br />
In retrospect if i had to do this all over again would i still want to free the sleeper? HELL YES! over and over again.<br />
<br />
Hrothgar those people did your server a favor. trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">My guild got to kill warders 1-3 several times before the Sleeper was awoken. It's a lot less fun than some people make it out to be. They are not hard at all. 25 people can easily kill the first 3 warders, sometimes with no deaths on any of the 3. They are complete wuss mobs that drop very nice weapons. Usually at least 2 or 3 1h primals per clearing of warders. Since another guild woke the Sleeper, not a single 1h primal has dropped for us in about 4 trips to ST. It's all claidhmores, axes, lances and bows. So, yes primal still drops but it's considerably more tedious to get now.<br />
<br />
Ventani was killed several times before the Sleeper was woken. My guild and a few others had many chances to be retarded and wake the Sleeper by killing a wuss warder. We chose not to, and I think it was the right decision. Who cares about a one time script that we've all seen posted on so many other servers websites? I sure don't. Neat, a big dragon spawns, kills everyone in a few zones, including corpse camping some people bound in SS. We've all seen it several times. It's no longer a huge achievement to wake the Sleeper, especially if you've already been killing Ventani for weeks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Well both sides have valid reasons to release or not to release the Sleeper.   Doing it to piss everyone off, isn't exactly cool in my book.  I see no competative reason for that.  On my server (Druzzil Ro), we had four guilds that were taking turns on killing warders (not the 4th warder).   Then the server became FFA, and then it was inevitable, the Sleeper will be awaken.   Two guilds were already trying and failing at the time.  The other guild wasn't going to.  And for my guild, we weren't sure.  I mentioned we should, just because one of the guilds that were trying, would be doing it for the sheer pleasure of pissing everyone off (that guild moved to Legends).  Anyway, the other guild beat them to it.<br />
For some reason, I didn't feel so bad or mad.   Although, for casters, it killed any reason to go to ST other than helping someone else get something (loot isn't everything, but damn, all that work getting casters keys and going into a places they won't get anything is kinda sucky). <br />
<br />
Point I'm making is, I'm sure most servers were under this situation.  My server had an excellent rotational system, that went to pot because of one guild.  When that happens, things changes drastically.   ST is primarily a melee zone, even if your server still have warders to drop masks (and the cool sounding, yet crappy dragon staff I got as a booby prize).  Luckily the chances of still getting primal is there and the primal avatar spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Ok. Time to clear up some mis-information.<br />
<br />
I was a member of Order of Redemption on Fennin Ro until I found out a few (12) of our members cleared the remaining warder (Nanz) and released the sleeper.<br />
<br />
Here's the list of events as they happened:<br />
1.) OoR guild leader knows Ventani is about to spawn so he calls a ST raid.<br />
2.) Lots of drama in /gu from a few members that would like to kill Ventani (when he pops) AND Nanz (which was the only warder up at the time).<br />
3.) I ask in /gu if we would be killing Nanz after we kill Ventani. (I didn't even want to go help kill Ventani if we had the intention of killing Nanz also)<br />
4.) Guild leader tells everyone that we WILL leave Nanz up after we kill Ventani.<br />
5.) We get to ST and sit at the entrance for about an hour and a half.<br />
6.) Ventani spawns.<br />
7.) Monk sets up coth to warder area.<br />
8.) Prep, buff, wait on straggling clerics. (another hour wait)<br />
9.) After about 2 and a half hours in ST, we pull Ventani.<br />
10.) Ventani dies.<br />
11.) Loot is awarded. (some primal, a stone and a dagger)<br />
12.) Most everyone gets TL/Ports out of the zone. (at the time, I didnt know that anyone stayed in ST)<br />
13.) I camp and go to bed.<br />
14.) Those that stayed behind in ST kill Nanz and release the sleeper.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, when I heard what happened, I felt betrayed and used. When I logged back on the next day, I deguilded from OoR. ALOT more than half (as reported here) of the members of OoR deguilded also. It was a 60-70 member guild, and there was only 14-18 after what happened in ST.<br />
