<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">can anyone tell me where this giant is located? and how many ppl it takes to kill him and the spawn time on this mob? i have been looking at the orb of the infinate void for a while but cant seem to find the guy. thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not sure where he is, but I know he is easy.  Some of my friends take him down with one group (warrior cleric shaman rogue monk druid, all very uber except the druid) almost every time he pops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Monk to pull, Enchanter to tash, shaman slow and malo. Mage would be nice to pre-debuff with. Cleric to heal, dats it I guess. May take a few tries to get Keldor single fer ya munk. And uhm, don't let em run out 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He is in the side room where the kael quest armor guys are behind tormax.<br />
<br />
Smarter NPC casters....not sure how he got toned down but he was using a 2k nuke for about a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To do a 1 group kill you'd pretty much have to have non kos people. He's behind tormax's throne with all the armor quest givers and happens to be one of the 2 tormax factioned mobs in the side room with the shaman armor quest giver which makes our life difficult when doing armor.<br />
<br />
1 group could probably do it altho it wouldn't be easy. 2 groups could definitely do it but getting back there with out at least some non kos people to avoid having to kill everything would be pretty hard unless a tormax raid had just kill the big stuff off.<br />
<br />
I've killed him numerous times while on giant faction but never tried him while kos to giant faction but when we're killing tormax there are some pretty mean mobs we clear out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Iirc, he's right next to the shaman quest giver in Kael.  If your kos to giants, take at least 2 groups, preferbly 3, near 60 as possible.  If your not kos, it's much easier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, I forgot to include that the group on my server that farms this guy is all max ally to all giant factions.  This is the only giant they kill.  They just walk in, whack him, sell the ooiv for 25k, and go back to farming west tov.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering all the other things you can warned/banned for this should be included too since it is definately an exploit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is not an exploit lol, if this is an exploit then so is mages running into ToV and CoHing people in heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Breathable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Im sure if you fight him in his room the other tormax mob will agro, but will the quest givers agro to?<br />
there on diff faction and im ally to them, but still kos to tormax, im sure i could get 1 group of 60's in there all nonkos, but is frozenshard and this guy to tough? do u fight him in his room or can u do him somewhere else were you wont get adds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do you know anyone who got Kael quest armor after they have helped kill Tormax countless times? Im sure you do but do you think thats how factions should work? I think the 3 Velious factions was a good idea but the implementation is sadly lacking. Those factions are merely a slowdown they have no real value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Verex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The word timesink mean anything to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sorry, but after doing Emporer Key quest, Vex Thall Key Quest, and helping farm Emporer/Seru Banes...  I no longer call anything in Velious a time sink. :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Damnit Jaradis.  You keep posting stuff I want to just a bit ahead of me.<br />
<br />
Velious doesn't have timesinks.  You go farm the arena if you want dragon faction.  You kill giants for maybe up to a week to get dorf faction.  You kill dorfs for xp in thurgb, and 2 days raiding WW for Gaint faction back.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you should ask guilds doing Inner Acrylia keys what a timesink is?  Or, how about going after Lord Sseru?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You don't need to spend a week killing giants for good dorf faction. A night or two spent in the frost giant castle thing (Iceshard manor or something like that) will get you tons of dorf faction.<br />
<br />
As for Kelorek guy, all ya need is a non kos monk and he can pull the guy out for you to kill. Single group doable.</div></div><hr />
