<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So often on this board we focus almost exclusively on the needs of high level shamans with an assumption that we're all 65 or close to it, I've been guilty of that myself.<br />
<br />
But I recall when I was raising my shaman up over the last 2 and a half years that I found the mid-high levels pretty frustrating, there are some big holes in the spell books for characters in the 40s and 50s.<br />
<br />
Specifically what I suggest Sony add is:<br />
<br />
Group Talisman of Altuna<br />
Group Harnessing of the Spirit<br />
Group Stamina (as in the spell called Stamina)<br />
<br />
The shaman is primarily a grouping class, at least that was my experience. Younger shamans need some solid group oriented spells, it's kind of ridiculous that shamans only really get major group oriented spells once they are in their late 50s when most of us had to group for 57 levels to get to that point.<br />
<br />
By comparison, Druids (and I have a druid as well, this isn't druid bashing) get group versions of all their Skin spells including group skin like nature. And Clerics of course get group temperance etc.<br />
<br />
Group Altuna, HoS and Stamina at level 50 or below seems only fair to help our struggling lower level brethren. It won't imbalance the game in any way, or take away from any other class, it simply will make things less of an unnecesary pain in the butt for them.  <br />
<br />
It will allow your level 50-57 or so Shaman to feel more useful and able to do the job that every other class in the raid/party assumes he can do. Most people were shocked when I told them how few group spells I got when I was that level.<br />
<br />
I haven't mentioned spells below those because I haven't yet looked into what is needed, probably some even lower level group spells would help a lot as well without making things too easy or imbalancing things.<br />
<br />
Thanks for listening. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's very fair to ask for and very long overdue.<br />
<br />
I remember how tedious it was to buff groups back then.  I was always happy to cast Tumultuous Strength just because it would get everyone in the group.<br />
<br />
Good luck! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/shrug, i felt plenty powerful in that level range, and HoS didn't even exist yet...the reason the focus is on current content (ie lvl 65 content) is because the problems are in current content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What would be the harm in giving lower versions of group spells? Group HoS would be useful and not break the game, as would group stat buffs pre-50.<br />
Sure you might have felt powerful then Perceus, and I am not denying that the lv60+ game needs the most work, but why just ignore the lower levels? By their own admition (SoE) a high percentage of characters are in the 20-40 range.<br />
Another thing that might help could be a pre-60 Avatar, maybe one at lv50, exactly the same as the original Avatar, but +50 instead of +100, with the Emerald component needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally, as a Shaman who as only recently got access to group spells, I never felt that I really needed group spells before now. Although group spells would have been useful, I would usually just use Talisman, Str and Dex (or HoS at 49 or later) on each of the melee types. Int casters would complain that Shammy hp buffs overwrote their Shielding line of spells and Sta buffs often didn't make a big enough difference to hit points to be required. In effect, the only things that group spells now allow me to do are (1) buff people faster and more mana efficiently and (2) buff the non-melee. <br />
<br />
So saying, if everyone else gets group spells, why shouldn't shaman? Although shamans get heaps of buffs, they have traditionally only buffed a single stat or value on a single target. The original vision for shamans was not to even have combination buffs, let alone group spells. If I remember correctly, Tumultuous Strength came from Vellious and HoS and Bih'Li until Luclin. <br />
<br />
I suppose I see no reason why we shouldn't get group spells earlier. After all we are a buffing class. It just isn't in the shaman style (however bad that may be). I also must add that, as someone who as recently been those levels, I never felt underpowered or useless. With Stoicism at 44, E-bolt and HoS at 49, Turgurs at 51 and an OK pet, shaman are very powerful soloers and can make exceptional contributions to groups in most content at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The first time erny ever grouped to earn experience was at level 58.  Before then, if you're not soloing, you're just slowing yourself down.  But if you enjoy grouping before then, there's no reason why there shouldn't be a group version for those spells.  Every other class gets them, we get them later on, and they're not unbalancing, but I would rather see the guys at Sony spend their time on more pressing issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There should be group versions to our lower spells. Group regen / Chloro particularly.<br />
<br />
And Fuudce,<br />
<br />
You mean like that effect that's on the Skyiron Cudgel? Wouldn't be too wierd to see it in a spell form - Beastlords' new claws give them a spell they have a level before the claws proc, heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The fact of the matter is, giving group versions of low level buffs will do nothing for the class.  We're fine from 44 to 62 or thereabouts, and at 65 if you're not into raiding (the problems with being a level 65 that doesn't raid aside...^_^).  The CURRENT content is where we're broken, and the CURRENT content is where the attention needs to be.  If they feel like spending 10 minutes to add a couple spells to the spdat, fine, if not, its not doing any harm either way.  There is no help NEEDED at these levels, that is why i'm not clamoring for upgrades to level 30s.  We're balanced there.  WE ARE BALANCED THERE.  We're balanced there? &gt;&lt; that's my point, I hope it sinks in...<br />
<br />
just thought i'd note...soe's probably full of it on the &quot;By their own admition (SoE) a high percentage of characters are in the 20-40 range.&quot; thing.  between my 2 accounts and the 4 accounts in my normal group there are 7 level 65 characters, and 3 twinks at level 50+.  The rest of the slots are filled with characters in the 20-40 range.  That's what, 16 lvl 20-40 (though one's 48, my bazaar mule/former boxed beastlord) on my accounts, none of whom are ever played aside from PLing in case I feel like retiring one of the mains, and most people whom I know well enough to know anything about their twinks are in a similar situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah, Hyena, I totally forgot about the cudgels, would be great to give shaman that spell at a decent enough level.<br />
<br />
Perceus, (i dont want this turning into an argument with you, so I wont post in reply to you again in this post) Your characters may be that high, but that is you. Not everyone have that many high levels. I know that I personally have (on my 1 account) 65shm 39pal 30ber, and a handfull of mid 20's chars. Sure I only really play the first 3, but the other characters are there. Ignoring the fact that the characters exist would be like removing speed limit signs, 'because noone ever looks at them'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally, I always thought it was a good way to learn how to manage your mana.  I appreciate the ease of group buffs later in a Shamans life, but I also appreciate trying to keep groups buffed w/o a break in the action.  IMO, it is the tedious things like this that is what the &quot;new generation&quot; of players fail to learn.  <br />

I wouldn't be against it, but isn't that part of the game pretty trivial by now with twink gear anyway /shrug<br />

On the Crucible virtually every shaman has got behind the 1 voice petition even though like me it doesnt affect them too much.<br />
Then for once 1 of the lower level shaman asks for something as earth shattering as group buffs and you say nope no problem there dont need them etc.<br />
Basically what im saying is if the problem doesnt affect you then please leave it alone and dont bother posting.<br />
If the same shaman who asked for group buffs was to say that shaman as a class is perfectly fine and we need no help you would be on here posting that it doesnt affect him so for him not to post.<br />
Yes i know every level 65 shaman has been through the 49-65 levels but for those who have it is over and done with yet the original poster is experiencing them at the moment and knows how things are whereas you dont.<br />

Classic quote from Adonnisninaste<br />

<br />
Sorry yes guess there is no untwinked players in EQ now.<br />
You should read a lot of the posts from a shaman on the EQ boards basically hes in 1 of the top 2 guilds on BB and he says apart from healing there isnt a lot of problems with Shaman in the high end game.<br />
<br />
<br />
You need to view things from everyones perspective not just yours.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And ignoring the fact that we're balanced at those levels and don't need anything is exactly what you're doing &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Also, you said yourself, your main character is level 65, and you have about 4 or 5 alternate characters (as in, not your primary character) in the 40 to 20 range.  This is exactly my point...SoE is saying the majority of the characters are in the level range where a LOT of people have 1 to 15 ALTS.  It skews the percentage.  That was my point, you gave another EXAMPLE of that point, and then you...disagreed...with....it.....<br />
<br />
Ok, I'll try it this way: We are completely unbalanced from level 1 to 51, and should have all dev time spent on balancing classes at that level, ESPECIALLY in regards to trivial issues of mild convenience.  Having said that, and accepting it as a fact within the confines of this thread, they shouldn't waste their time on spells for twinks, alts, and a the minority in that level range...actual mains...that are only a convenience, as the shaman class would have to be NERFED at that point in the game in order to balance it with the others.  <br />
<br />
How much time, per week, do you spend on your main, and how much time on all of your alts combined (aside from afk baz mule, etc...actual play time)?  My mains are both 65 250+ aa, the shaman has over 300 days /played...no other character but the baz mule has more than 3 days /played...and my accounts' average level is 34...probably around 45 for the accounts in my regular group, probably average level around 40 for my guild (all 65+ 150aa+ primary characters...) are you getting it?  That the &quot;majority is 20 to 40&quot; concept is only right by technicality?  I've got 0 characters UNDER the level of 20 on my accounts and yet my average character level is 34.  Your average character level is probably somewhere in that range as well.  &gt;&lt; I'm not saying &quot;ignore low levels&quot; READ IT.  seriously comprehension with you seems very very low &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; you don't ignore characters of any level, but not fixing what isn't broken is not ignoring them &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't think we know how SOE determines the &quot;average character level&quot;. I would hope that they use the level of the highest character on every active account in their calculations, otherwise the number would be  meaningless. And even that would be iffy since there are active accounts without high level characters that are not being actively played, e.g. rezbots, guild property, inherited accounts, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Most everyone here focus on fixing the bigger problems before attending to the luxuries of the class.  Shaman are at their most powerful stage between 34-50, what is the point of addressing a minor issue when we a being left behind in the future of the game?<br />
<br />
Do you really believe that wasting a favor with the Devs for a couple group buffs is worth being deserted from the future of EQ?<br />

I'm glad I didn't say I was against it all together...jeesh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Basically what im saying is if the problem doesnt affect you then please leave it alone and dont bother posting. <br />
<br />
Its not a problem, and dev time/attention going to a non problem potentially takes away from fixing things that ARE problems.  That is my point.  Anyone that feels underpowered as a shaman with his spells through velious from level 1 to 60 should quit the class now.  It affects me if shaman balancing is 6 lines in a patch message and one of them is group buffs for level 40s, and I don't put anything past SoE.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, some of the level 40s that are getting lazier/less skilled/less patient with every change soe makes to dumb down the game will eventually be level 65.  Some of them may raid with me.  I've had to teach enough of that generation to play their class on raids that I really don't care to do that anymore.  Level 65's acting like rebuffing a raid with group focus w/o MGB because of a couple wipes in sucession is going to cause them actual physical pain make me ill...there was a long time where you were buffing every single individual in the raid with FoSpirit.  The conveniences of higher levels (such as group buffs) used to be *earned* by leveling, and now they've made the leveling less of an accomplishment and started giving out the rewards sooner, I feel that in and of itself is bad for EQ.  <br />
<br />
How about you don't tell me what threads to post in, Wulfebane, we need views from EVERYONES perspective, as you said, not just yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Adding those spells would take 10 min and would not unbalance anything or break anything.<br />
Yes, it would only just help the younger shaman, but I don't see why they shouldn't ask for some help just because they aren't borken and 65 getting their a$$ wiped in GoD.<br />
Saying no to lower level spell to upgrade shaman class at lower level  seems to me a little selfish from the uber 65 out there.<br />
Sure it doesn't help you to get into Qvic, but it doesn't harm you either.</div></div><hr />

When I was at lvl 55 I know I was wishing for a group regen and group Altuna. Back then I was wondering why druids get all their spells in the group version and shamans do not (Bih'li was not yet invented too).<br />

As a need?  I'm going to have to disagree.<br />
<br />
At 46, with a horse, kei, alpha dog, stoicism and a jbb... the shaman is a demi-god.  It gets better at 49 with dogdog and a new dot, and again at 51 with a great slow.  There are plenty of ways to earn plat these days.<br />
<br />
Ater 51, its down hill for a long time.<br />

I would have agreed that 55-57 is a rough time for shaman, jbb starts tapering off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The people who are scared of this stealing important developer time from their precious level 65 balancing requests crack me up. How much developer time does it take to code a group HoS, like 5 minutes? 4? :)<br />
<br />
As to need versus request, that's semantics.  Yes it's just a request, though personally for me with my 65/101 shaman all the GoD requests are just requests as well, I have no problem being group desireable and am sort of amused by all the hysteria.<br />
<br />
Lets just think of the lower level shamans for once, the game doesn't revolve around level 65 for most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think the reason more group spells started to appear in the high 50s was due to the increased access to raiding. With Old World dragons, Fear and Hate, I'm sure it could have gotten tedious to buff everyone individually with buffs, so group buffs were developed once Kunark came out. And the higher the level, the greater chance of being called on to raid. Hence the greater need for group buffs.<br />
<br />
I solo some, but also duo with my wife or group. Depends on the time I have and my options available. Group buffs earlier, while nice, were not necessary. We could do without, and did. Yes, it was slightly more of a mana drain. However, getting Stoicism DRASTICALLY reduces that drain as we can Canni/Stoic to recoup our mana at a much faster pace now.<br />
<br />
I think the request for group buffs in the 40s thru mid 50s was warranted more before Stoicism came out. Now it would be more based out of convenience and less from necessity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">For some odd reason, being a Shaman means walking uphill to 65 both ways, in the snow, and you're not a &quot; real &quot; Shaman unless you trudge along with more difficulties, penalties, or handicaps than your brethren be they in the same sub-class or class in general.<br />
<br />
For some other reason - it's perfectly ok for Druids to get group spells, group spells that SHAMAN got first, and group spells of spells Shaman never get but should.<br />
<br />
But heavens to Betsy - here comes a poster with a great idea that certainly isn't unbalancing and certainly makes ** BUFFING ** that most tedious of tasks, a tad simpler, and you would think that he was asking for the next three expansions to be aimed at the level 1-10 crowd.<br />
<br />
Newsflash - some got to where we are now with NO KEI, NO horse and NO JBB.<br />
<br />
But we sure as Stuttgart can support our younger brethren in their journey as well.<br />

The irony is so thick here I could spread it on my toast.  You're almost frothing at the mouth in denying that shaman need anything before 65 and elemental access, and then you spout this gem.  <br />
<br />
Group versions of buffs should happen to all buffing classes IMO.  So far, only druids have it.  They recieved group versions of all their skin buffs 1 spell level after they recieved the buff.  They got these group spells back in Luclin.  IMO, they've had the edge in group buffing for long enough and its time to pass it around to clerics and shaman.   Adding group versions of these spells would take a few days of coding if the dev was really lazy and a few hours if the dev was on the ball.  Seems like OOW would be a good place to make this change, as Sony has stated that it will have content for all level ranges.</div></div><hr />

Perceus, umm... where do I start.  You've succeeded in hijacking the first thread I've seen in a loooong time for the under 65 crowd and turning into a &quot;we suck in high level content whine.&quot;  Go carry the torch on the 500 other threads on these boards.  No where in these posts did anyone claim shamans were underpowered at the levels mentioned.  I always wondered why we didn't have more group spells myself.  Yes, it's mostly a convenience factor, but still should be and should have been part of our spellset from the start.  Just another oversight from SOE.  And also, go do some searches, SOE mentioned that their data behind the &quot;most characters are between 20-40&quot; or whatever was not based on bazaar mules and toons you haven't touched in 2 years.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">A reasonable request imo, Gunderson.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">can be usefull, not really needed in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I did my 40 to 50 in DL without problems.<br />
The main prob I encountered was from 30 to 40 in OT, where a druid is better than us because of their DS compared to our low % slow.<br />
<br />
The only one good spell I can see is group HoS or group Altuna.<br />
Group sta isn't needed because it hasn't its importance untill 50+. So maybe a group sta at early 50 but not before, because it would just be useless.<br />
<br />
Between 40-50 only melees need sta. ( I know that everyone can use sta at any level, but it only makes a difference on the tank )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bopes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">So often on this board we focus almost exclusively on the needs of high level shamans with an assumption that we're all 65 or close to it, I've been guilty of that myself.<br />
<br />
But I recall when I was raising my shaman up over the last 2 and a half years that I found the mid-high levels pretty frustrating, there are some big holes in the spell books for characters in the 40s and 50s.<br />
<br />
Specifically what I suggest Sony add is:<br />
<br />
Group Talisman of Altuna<br />
Group Harnessing of the Spirit<br />
Group Stamina (as in the spell called Stamina)<br />
<br />
The shaman is primarily a grouping class, at least that was my experience. Younger shamans need some solid group oriented spells, it's kind of ridiculous that shamans only really get major group oriented spells once they are in their late 50s when most of us had to group for 57 levels to get to that point.<br />
<br />
By comparison, Druids (and I have a druid as well, this isn't druid bashing) get group versions of all their Skin spells including group skin like nature. And Clerics of course get group temperance etc.<br />
<br />
Group Altuna, HoS and Stamina at level 50 or below seems only fair to help our struggling lower level brethren. It won't imbalance the game in any way, or take away from any other class, it simply will make things less of an unnecesary pain in the butt for them.  <br />
<br />
It will allow your level 50-57 or so Shaman to feel more useful and able to do the job that every other class in the raid/party assumes he can do. Most people were shocked when I told them how few group spells I got when I was that level.<br />
<br />
I haven't mentioned spells below those because I haven't yet looked into what is needed, probably some even lower level group spells would help a lot as well without making things too easy or imbalancing things.<br />
<br />
Thanks for listening. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that would be awesome.  I love casting Billy and Tumulous Strength as well because they are group buffs.  We should get more as you say.  Nothing crazy, just that would help save having to target everyone, wait for casting time and cast.  Saying in group &quot;STR / Bih'Li incoming, gather&quot; is my high point when buffing in groups =)<br />
<br />
Not necessary of course, but it would be an added touch that would make THE BUFFING CLASS easier to do their job.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">There is nothing wrong with looking at 1-65 and finding out where things aren't as smooth as they could be, and ask for a bit of help.<br />
<br />
Just because someone was fine, doesn't mean there can't be room for improvement.<br />
<br />
Group buffs to me, just represent saving stupid time casting the same spell, on 6 people, every 16mins to 1 hour.     I don't care if we're a buffing class... that doesn't mean we have to cast single target spells all our life.<br />
<br />
At the high level... the mana for 1 group spell is less than 6 single targets... okay... how about then, at low levels, as a convience, just make the group version cost 6xsingle_mana_cost.    <br />
<br />
This applies to anything that's kinda wrong.    take the 55 pet for example... I found him to be quite a bit of a wimp.    Hardly any better than the 49 pet really... at least I thought so... but the 61 pet is uber in comparison.     So if someone suggests that maybe the 55 pet get a slight upgrade... to help bridge the gap between 49 pet , and 61 pet... what's wrong with that?<br />
<br />
I'm 65... and I agree with most of the 65 &quot;issues&quot; presented here, for those I've experienced personally, and just read about.   That doesn't mean anything else has to be ignored, for our class or others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">hate to agree with perseus, but i do.  you are stealing developer time from issues that are important.  yeah its important to the lv65 crowd, but guess what everyone will be there some day (unless you actually try not to).<br />
<br />
some of you say it only takes a couple of minutes to program group spells......  how long has it taken for them to fix our pet shrinking?  thats just one little variable in the code.. it doesnt require any new code, unlike new group buff spells would.  oh who cares if you can shrink your pet or not, right?  it still functions the same correct?  i agree it does, but its frustrating in small confines and it affects EVERY shaman above what 34?  (cant remember off hand first pet level and it lazy to look it up).  <br />
<br />
so you want group buffs.  you have the single version and they work.  is it frustrating?  yeah it is, but its not game breaking.  <br />
<br />
asking developers to spend time on a portion of the game that isnt broken, when we are having to pull teeth and rave like madmen to get them to work on an area of the game that IS broken, is nonsense.  you might not like that, but its true.<br />
<br />
there are always things we would like to have seen at different levels and we each have our own opinion on what those things would be.  but lets phrase things in light of the big picture.  group buffs pre-60 are 'you know what i would like to see some day?' type of thing.  not a 'need'.  you can live without group buffs and still be extremely powerful and wanted.  those at 65 cant live with what we have to work with at the end game level.  those are 'needs'.   <br />
<br />
please dont compare what shaman get to what druids get.  yeah i know its hard not to, heck i might be guilty of that myself.  druids have ALWAYS been the pet class of SOE (and Verant before then).  we get sow before they do and they go all the upgrades to it, including group versions.  we get regen spells before they do and they got the group versions first and with pop they got a MUCH better one for less mana, before shaman raised holy heck over it (and even then they simply gave us the same spell).  druids will always get the better upgrades, see the new spells in omens if you dont believe me.  learn to hate whoever at SOE loves druids so much and hate SOE for not having someone that likes shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apples and Oranges.  Fixing a bug is tedious and often difficult - if they knew what they broke it would have been fixed al long time ago.  <br />
<br />
If the applications are well designed, converting a single target buff to a group buff should be relatively trivial.<br />
<br />
I agree that shamans need decent group buffs far earlier - buffs have become the defining aspect of our class.<br />
<br />
I still have a letter from an older shaman stored somewhere convincing me not to give up when I was in my early 40s - they are tough levels for shamans.  Seems like EVERYTHING is so hard then, and there is never enough mana to do all that is asked of you.  Group buffs would have helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Aurigabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I play a 52 shaman and I find Auriga to be fairly effective in both group and solo situations in the mid levels. I do think that SoE should consider all levels when balancing the class though and not just level 65's. Group buffs would be a nice to have, particularly pre-HoS. Once HoS is available, buffing becomes much less of a chore since it's only necessary to keep 2 stat buffs up in most cases instead of 4.<br />
<br />
I would ask the people who say that mid level shaman don't need any work, how long has it been since you played those levels? Personally, I think that the shaman healing ability is a bit weak (surprise, surprise). Until 51, our best (non-HoT) heal is 300hp which was probably fine when fighting ry'gorr orcs in velious that hit for 40 a pop. Stoicism is god like for soloing and patch healing, but melee get really annoyed over the snare/slow aspect of it. :p<br />
<br />
Again, I'm not saying that the level 35-55 shaman is broken, just saying that the game may have changed substantially since some of the top end shaman went thru those levels. With all of the twink gear now available plus Virtue/Fo7/Brells, a warrior can be pushing probably 5k+ hp now by level 50, and we can heal a whopping 6% of his/her health with GH. How many hp did a buffed warrior have in Velious? Maybe 1/2 that? Mobs in Dulak or LDoN hit for over 100 a pop and tier 1 trash mobs can hit for 200ish IIRC, which is a lot more than your average xp quality velious mob.<br />
<br />
Anyway just more food for thought when evaluating the status of the shaman from level 1 up. :)<br />

I still think you guys are focusing on the wrong part of his post.  I don't think anyone disagrees that shamans are pretty good at those levels.  He wasn't asking for anything game breaking because he thought we suck.  He was asking for an improvement that would make buff casting more efficient.  That's all he asked for.  No big deal, no need for an uproar.  SOE will likely not even spend a minute on this idea, thinking that they will now drop everything to work on this suggestion is pretty ridiculous.  Still, why can't someone suggest an idea without getting flamed?<br />
<br />
I too had to live without all of this going up through the ranks, but I would have loved it and would still support seeing an improvement for the future.  Hell, it would even help me buff my lowbie alt groups, so I'd use it today.  BTW, I played 121 of levels of shaman (56 on Test and 65 on Terris) and I never had a jbb.  Saying we have all this power and therefore the buff suggestion is wrong, is just... wrong.<br />

<br />
The mini Avatar idea I disagree with though, but I just like to feel leet  :p  with my primal essence.  If at 52 we have +20 to all melee stats a +50 to all melee stats shouldn't come before 56.<br />
<br />
Before you complain about the rareness of Primal and some other spells, I must say I never would have gotten them without the ability to have them researched.  That change was extremely beneficial for the younger shaman.  Yes, it's hard to get a group to go to certain zones where peices drop, but it's cheap, doable and exp.</div></div><hr />

Why do so many high end shamans cry out for<br />
1 Group FA.<br />
2 Group Haste that is same % as our single haste.<br />
3 Group Shrink that is MGBable.<br />
<br />
Gasp is this to make buffing less of a chore ?<br />
So its ok to make buffing less boring when youre 65 but heaven forbid if you can save some time when youre only lvl 50ish.<br />
<br />
Surely asking for these is wasting Devs precious time.<br />
<br />
Do most of you high end shaman realise how different the game is for up and coming players now than it was a few years back.<br />
The whole game is now a rush.I remember having to take med breaks to wait for the cleric to med etc doesnt happen often at all now.<br />
<br />
The attitude of a lot of posters in this thread has me worried that in the future if anything does happen that breaks Shaman in the 30-65 range then the high end players arent basically going to give a **** because as someone stated we're all going to hit 65 in the end.<br />
<br />
Have all of you already given into SoE and think that ANY improvements no matter how needed/wanted are a FAVOR from the devs.<br />
This is their job this is what we pay them to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
And to the poster who said with Horse,JBB etc a shaman is a god.Wake up and smell the ****ing roses not EVERY shaman is a twink.<br />
Kind of like me saying that warriors can dual wield a boc and sod in their 50's so they didnt need any fixes to their aggro.<br />
<br />
Sorry but this thread has really pissed me off.Ive seen nothing but support for high end shaman ala one voice etc (Tugela excluded) but the very 1st time 1 of the lower end shaman ask for something as mind blowingly game breaking as a couple of group buffs he's basically told to **** as shaman arent broken and dont want to waste the devs time on his piddling little requests.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Its the same logic that gives druids (and rangers, I might add) upgrades to sow when shaman recieve none.  Yes, we got a group version that adds atk but so did druids.  They (and their hybrid) got a version with a 10% speed increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Your idea is interesting, but you state in the first line the &quot;needs&quot; of the mid level shaman.<br />
<br />
Group buffs are nice, and a convenient thing, but are by no means a need, in my opinion.  Growing up years ago as a newbie, I remember very very few group buffs, and we did just fine.  The first I encountered were the druid's group regen and chloro.<br />
<br />
Shaman got regeneration and chloroplast a rank earlier than druids.  Druids, while receiving the spells later, got group versions.  I suppose the devs thought it was an alright tradeoff, seeing as how levels were so hard to get back then... but let's not forget that group regen had half the duration of single target regen back then, and that's a SHORT duration.<br />
<br />
A couple years in, they added group versions of every druid skin buff I can think of, if I remember correctly.  Didn't affect me much, I had already leveled to the point where my few dr00d buddies were using Protection of the Glades on me when we grouped up.<br />
<br />
Today with PoP there is a LOT of raiding going on... and more emphasis on raiding than when Naggy/Vox were where it was at.  I think the reason we see more group buffs at higher levels is because of MGB, as someone on this thread already stated.<br />
<br />
The addition of group Altuna etc. would be nice, and make life easier.  Would it imbalance anything directly?  Nah.  However, people have been asking for little things like this to make life easier because &quot;it's a game&quot; for the last year, constantly.  And each time the devs comply, it moves the game farther and farther away from what it once was.<br />
<br />
Leveling up and finally getting a nice group focus spell should be a feeling of power that you earned, in my opinion.  Until then, suck it up, and cast the buff a couple times.  You'll get group buffs eventually.<br />
<br />
I long for the classic days when people accepted hardships as steps on the path to greatness.  I think the problem is now that there is no path, just what seems to most as a very short obstacle course.  Also, as most people mention, the majority of characters in that level range are twinks that will level incredibly fast.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you don't have a nifty idea, I'm just saying that I think it's another step toward making the game too slack and easy.  You might say, well making one buff groupable wouldn't make it too slack, and you're right, it wouldn't... but to me, it just seems that, well, way back when we would have never asked for things to get easier at our level, we'd simply push on toward the level where things would get easier, perhaps not as it pertained to group buffs, but in general.  Perhaps my opinion is merely a selfish desire to see that mindset restored... I dunno.<br />
<br />
My two cents, anyway.<br />
<br />
EDIT: And it's not like I assume everyone is 65 and making a single buff group targetable would take hours away from the devs, because that's not so.  I just think that at level 45-55 ish, the shaman is a very powerful class.  I think we can manage just fine at that level.  It would seem to me that nowadays, at lower levels, group buffs are more of a druid thing than a shaman thing.<br />
<br />
It's not that everyone thinks uber areas are more important, it's that at higher levels, shaman need actual balances, not just group versions of things they already have that are nice.  <br />
<br />
I will agree, however, that there's an aura around this board since GoD came out, where if you post something other than stuff about level 65 woes or spell availability (which are very important topics mind you) you're more likely for people to say &quot;we have more important things to worry about, like healing against mitigated mobs or our slow, small nukes.&quot;<br />
<br />
And while it's very, very true that those areas need looking at, it's a shame that you don't see as much variety in posts as you used to.  Not a complaint, per se, just an observation.  I'll stop digressing now hehe.<br />
<br />
And as for Group FA, that's different.  Altuna doesn't have a 6 minute duration.  Haste is just an issue of the group being the same percentage JUST LIKE all group stat buffs are now the same stat as single.  MGB shrink?  Shrink doesn't have an icon... but hey I guess you have a point there.  But I don't think it's truly fair to compare spells with a 6 and 16 minute duration to Altuna, which has a sizeable duration.  Regen/Chloroplast maybe...<br />
<br />
And as far as your apparant belief that we pay the devs to make the game easier, Wulfbane... they have to think longevity.  If they make things easy at a mid level, people will not be dying to level up for group focus as badly, and that means less money for them.  And technically, what we pay them for is to provide a service under the terms of their EULA, and nothing more, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Well yeah, but the game is over five years old.  Even casuals have leveled up to 65 by now, because they've had five years to do it.  I imagine the influx of new players is very low these days, and thereby Sony devotes their full attention to keeping what players they do have, which are mostly 65 with a lot of twinked alts... it's not very fair, but it's business.  <br />
<br />
There was an &quot;average level,&quot; which referred to the level of the average customer's main character, for awhile back in the day, which was analyzed before an expansion was created.  Around Kunark's inception, that average level was around 30.  The average level rose very slowly.  Back then, I was surprised the average level was so low.  Nowadays, years later, I'm sure the average is at 65.</div></div><hr />

I think the face of leveling up has changed since the introduction of LDoN.  LDoN's have changed the way we group.  No more adding a new member to buff every 20 min or so when someone else leaves.  The groups starts out all together, mostly buffless. All that buffing is a pain and mindless.  <br />
<br />
In regular pick-up groups, single target buffing could get you some lessons in mana manegment, but the 30 min pre-LDoN buffing is just buff up and canni-up, nothing to it, heh.<br />
<br />
Besides, most new expansions have a spell tossed in for the mid-levels, in some shape or form.  If not OoW then the next one... give lower shamans group buffs.<br />

ROTFL! Are you kidding? People DON'T want a shaman with them at that level? Are we playing the same game here? <br />
<br />
Think about it! With Stoicism (which is soloable at 44) you are a better healer than a druid with similar AA/gear and you have the mana regen ability to do it more often. You have buffs that everyone wants - HoS anyone? You also have a good slow, Togor's Insects ('http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=507&amp;source=Live'), which is 54% at level 44. Sure, you don't have a druid's DSs or nukes. A cleric can heal better. An enchanter has better CC, hastes and caster buffs. That is a good thing. I don't want to be best at everything but shamans bring a very strong range of abilities to a group at that level. If you are having difficulty finding a group at those levels, I suspect it is ignorance of others rather than the shaman class's abilities. <br />
<br />
The only time I had trouble at those levels was an LDoN in a pickup group. I was MH with no crack and the group had no CC. We kept getting multiple adds and my healing couldn't keep up with the mob's damage rate. We wiped twice before we gave up. However, I think that was more indicative of a poor group composition and pulling than the shaman class's healing ability.<br />
<br />
If you can't find a group at those levels, head on down to Gunthak/Dulak and solo. You have two hot-spot zones (now easier to reach with the Gunthak stone) that are full of single pullable mobs with nameds that drop reasonable gear. Indeed, the gem drops are so nice you may want to get a few AA while you are at it.<br />

<br />
Well I was thinking more about longevity of the survival of their business, as opposed to longevity in levels.  If they cater to a level range that is no longer as abundant, you'll most likely get 100,000 people who for some reason will actually COMPLAIN about them putting in changes for a lower level character... that it takes time away from them looking at real things... <br />
<br />
And there's also the fear that I imagine a lot of people would have that the devs would say something like &quot;Shamans are balanced, we just made all their focus and talisman spells group castable.&quot;  Or something of the sort, which is a bit extreme, but it's there, for some reason...<br />

I also think a big part of this &quot;attitude&quot; is probably the fact that low level players can bust up through levels like never before, even if they just save coin loot and buy garbage at the bazaar... that garbage was awesome stuff back when the exp zones in question were most heavily populated.  People seem to use this as a reason, or an excuse, to justify ignoring the lower levels... but that's a whole 'nother topic right there in my opinion, hehe, and I'm not sure exactly where I stand on it...<br />
<br />
Others could easily counter that levels were balanced as expansions went along, and that the game has now evolved into the majority of people being in higher areas, etc.  Also, you mentioned it as possibly an elitist attitude... the problem is, a High Level no longer almost guarantees a good player.  ANYBODY can get into 60plus with lots of free time and an average IQ, as I believe I've heard stated before here... I've run into the most COMPLETE morons even at level 65, I'd ask, &quot;How did you MAKE it to level 65?&quot; And they'd be like, well, Paludal, OT, DL, etc...<br />
<br />
Another thing, I saw someone mention Hotspots... ROFL, more like coldspots.  Five bucks says they never move the hotspots at all.  It's been what, a couple months now, since they put in the innovative &quot;Hotspots&quot; that would allegedly change once a month?  <br />

And where's my story chapter?  It can't take more than 5 or 10 minutes to churn out one of those poorly written tri-paragraph segments, if only to keep me informed :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">My next questions in this argument are.......<br />
<br />
Why do so many high end shamans cry out for<br />
1 Group FA.<br />
2 Group Haste that is same % as our single haste.<br />
3 Group Shrink that is MGBable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't want any of that crap. <br />
<br />
1. I don't think Group FA is all that exciting.<br />
2. Group haste? 60% Nice, but not really necessary. <br />
3. If you think I would waste MGB on shrink... you are crazy.<br />
<br />
As far as group buffs in the 40-50 range... Who really cares.<br />
<br />
Most people playing a Shaman at that level is being PL'd anyway. Maybe not all of them, but I would bet a good percentage of them are.<br />
<br />
I can see the PoV from both sides, and can understand why some people want group buffs earlier, but I myself think that getting group buffs that early would make you miss some valuable lessons on the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
Having to single buff a 30-50 person raid as the sole Shaman can be annoying, but I think it's good experience. As an example: you learn who needs the buffs versus who wants the buffs.<br />
<br />
Making things easier in the lower levels might be beneficial in some ways, but does more harm than good in the lower level game, and later in the higher level game.<br />
<br />
It's fairly easy to spot the Shaman who was PL'd/burned up to level 65 and the Shaman who learned the game level by level up to 65.</div></div><hr />

Fun must also be factored in.  I'd also suggest a low level IoS.<br />
<br />
No, I didn't have them, didn't NEED them, but they would have been nice to have and I won't begrude anyone else getting something nice just because I didn't have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Fun thread.<br />
<br />
I'm a 51 shaman.  I started playing EQ back in '99.  I've taken multiple breaks and keep switching servers and characters.  The highest I've kept my attention on a character is a 58 wizard (just got my epic too, dang college friends talking me into moving servers... /grumble).  So there are old farts out there still in their 50's.<br />
<br />
Let me see if I can sum up the points:<br />
<br />
Against the change:<br />
1) Developers only have so much time, and should work on stuff that isn't broken<br />
2) Developers may implement this and say shamans are fixed, thus leave the 65 crowd still broken<br />
3) I did it, so should you, if you don't... you're going to be a crappy shaman at 65.<br />
<br />
For the change:<br />
1) Single target buffing is a pain in the arse, and no sane person would want to do it.<br />
2) No, seriously, single target buffing is a REAL pain in the arse.<br />
3) See 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
/rant on<br />
<br />
I sympathize with the 'change' people, as you could guess.  Buffing sucks, sometimes I wish I could play my shaman and not have any stat buffs.  HoS really helps this though... but I don't get a group version of it...<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Ok, now that I got all that off my chest.  How about a new idea.  Instead of adding a bunch of new spells... what about an aa?  We have an aa for MGB... makes a group buffs hit all groups within a certain range.  What about an aa purchasable at 51 that has a 6 minute refresh that allows a single target beneficial spell hit your whole group for 2x or 3x the mana?  That'd also help out the 65 crowd with a group FA.  /wink.<br />
<br />
Adding a bunch of new group spells for those levels seems silly in some ways.  I don't want to track down where they drop from, or who to turn what into when at 57 and 58 we get more group buff spells I'll have to track down too.  Seems like an AA would be the way to go instead of making a crap load of new spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">It was less than 6 months ago that I was working my way from 49 to 60. I can honestly say that group buffs was probably fairly low on my list of concerns. Burst Healing was number one. Bigtime. I've posted many times on the inadequecy of healing upgrades shaman endure through those levels. If you want to help our younger brothers along then this is where your attention should be placed. Not on the convienence of group buffs that you will earn with levels anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
seriously *** did you NOT raid til after you hit 60? have you never recieved 20 tells for focus when you were to low to cast it on a raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Sheesh, how can people complain over lower levels wanting a few group buffs in their 40's and 50's.<br />
<br />
All SoE have to do is put in a group version between levels, most buffs come with a 2 spell level gap. So they get their improved buff at 39, improved buff (group version) at 44 then next single buff at 49 etc.<br />
<br />
Doesn't take half a brain to see that this is not unbalancing, and shouldn't take much coding either<br />
<br />
I'm one of the people really ticked off about current 65 issues but to say this shouldn't be done....... well some people need to remember this is a game full of people of all different levels and abilities.<br />
<br />
As much as some people would like to think only lvl 65 matters, well you need to get your head out of your ass and start thinking about other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Personally, I always thought it was a good way to learn how to manage your mana.   it is the tedious things like this that is what the &quot;new generation&quot; of players fail to learn.  <br />

It's a freakin game - not a source of life lessons.  Tedious and Fun are incompatile.  Missing tedious lessions is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Shamans have enough to do in a group and very limited mana at lower levels.  And targeting each member of the team so you can cast a too-short-lasting buff on them does not add to either their effectiveness, abilities, or FUN.  If anything, a more valuable lession would be teaching young shamans when to cast group buffs so that they get everyone and don't disrupt the team.<br />
<br />
I really like the AA idea, except 1) shamans need the group buffs in their 40s - particularly haste. and 2) most lower buffs are on about the same timer - when they start to drop, they all drop.<br />
<br />
IMO the thing that keeps EQ players in EQ are the  relationships developed through grouping (and the failure to develop these relationships explains why otherwise good games like Horizons are so much less successful) .  EQ is as successful as it is because the class dependancies encourage grouping.  Anything that encourages classes to group improve the likelyhood that players will continue to pony up the money to continue to play. Group spells do this - and getting shamans to group more in the lower levels in a good thing, both for their game skills, and for their long-term prospects of staying with the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been there, done that.  Your turn.<br />
<br />
Seriously... you learn Canni Dancing PDQ when you're scraping to Harness/Focus the last couple people.  I was 60 for a while before I got Khura's, and it was a while before I got Fo7.  You have any idea how many idiots will click off Khura's and send you a tell for Fo7 despite the fact that you're not 65 yet, and you already told the raid you'd give everybody Khura's, and put Focus of Souls on the ones who are most likely to need it?  No, Mr. Mage, that's not you!<br />
<br />
Raiding's generally a small part of shamanic life before 60, so group stat buffs at earlier levels, while nifty, aren't really needed.  I'd have preferred to see group versions of regen and haste come to us earlier, since we were casting those between 2 and 3 times as often.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, say that when you're grouped with one of the retards who can't play his class worth crap, because he missed his tedious lessons.<br />
<br />
As with everything worthwhile, there's a learning curve.</div></div><hr />

Of course there is a learning curve. and learning is one of the reasons we play the game.  But learning tedious lessions you will throw away in a few levels does not make you a better shaman.  Give lower level shamans the tools they will use at higher levels - like group spells.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, a better toolset will not make retards less retarded  - or make more players retarded.  On the other hand, you can make (and others have made) a case that too much soloing makes the higher level game very hard, because grouping skills are never developed adequately.  If group spells encourage grouping, young shamans should get better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">actually, Wulf, the reason you get so much flag is that currently the balance of shamans at the high end is the major concern for most of us. As additional issues, no matter if sensible or not, clutter up the discussion, they are not likely to receive much support.<br />
<br />
That's only one reason of course. The other is that most of us elder shamans found group buffs to be &quot;nice to have&quot; and thats all  until we began raiding. And yes, I have single buffed a 50 person NToV raid with sta and focus, an experience I do not wish to repeat. <br />
A rather simple solution is to level some, it really has become trivial if you can get into PoP and does only take a fraction of the time it used to do. I think the group buffs begin in the early 50ties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Needed? Absolutely not<br />
Desirable? Well, for sure<br />
<br />
Just because &quot;we did it tough&quot; way back when, doesn't mean that others shuold have to do it as tough as we did. And although I agree that making things easier does, broadly speaking, make for lower quality shaman at 65, who cares? It makes you look better and provides numerous opportunity to either snigger and look down your nose, or edumacate the youngsters...</div></div><hr />
