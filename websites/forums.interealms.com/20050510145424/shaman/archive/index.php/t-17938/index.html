<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Extraor Dinary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've always heard that once a class gets to 65 and brings in some AA's that race really doesn't matter anymore.  I've always taken this for a grain of salt thinking the developers were just throwing around words to make us happy.  But then I decided to make a SK and race discussion came about.  To make things simple I make a 65 DE and an Ogre SK using Magelo and put all pts into stamina upon creation.  The end results were :<br />
<br />
Ogre HP:  2494    Mana:  1040<br />
DE    HP:  2230    Mana:  1547<br />
<br />
After playing with the stamina gear for a while i got both characters to 280 and then checked hps again.<br />
<br />
Ogre HP:  3866<br />
DE HP   :  3866<br />
<br />
So am I to assume that it is really true, that once you hit 65 and have the gear to max your big stats that all races are equal, except for the race specific items like no stun for ogre and ultravision for DE.  The only difference, other than specific items they get, would be better stats starting out and easier to hit the max of those stats.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yup, pretty much sucks, but thats the way it is. <br />
<br />
If it was done correctly say an ogre should have a much higher HP with all other stats being equal, but a lower avoidance just as an example that would make race actually count for something. <br />
<br />
Race, like most stats in eq tends to mean very little after a point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At the end of the game, gear makes the character.  Plain and simple.  Your important class stats will be maxed and only the hp/mana modifiers on your gear will matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only difference that race makes for any class is the racial characteristics. Let's take your example.<br />
<br />
Dark elfs: Ultravision, small.<br />
<br />
Ogres. Infravision, HUGE, unstunnable from front.<br />
<br />
Overall which do you think would be better? I have played many different melees post 60, and my favorite of them is the ogre warrior, just because he can't be stunned while tanking. You'd be amazed at the difference it makes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree to an extent.  I think it is up to what you consider &quot;End Game&quot;  If you are talking PoTime Gear then yeah... Your warriors will have max all stats anyway.  Heh you'll have warriors with higher Int than mid level Int casters and you'll have Pimped out Int casters with more hp/ac than mid/high level Warriors.  Hell as far as the pimp sham on these boards go they have higher AC/Hp than the warriors/sk that come along on our raids.<br />
<br />
For the most part it makes very little difference as you keep getting better and better gear.  You might find that when you are dealing with a Troll in HoT gear they will trade off some AC for wis gear compaired to the equally equiped Barbie.  *shrug* I remember back in the day when PoHate armor was the best and we all looked up to those guys in full RE.  Back then stats race made a huge difference but now days, with gear being what it is, it tends to make a lot less difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm.. may want to see how much gear it takes to get to 255 sta, and then see how much extra HP the two warriors can get from the remaining slots with +HP items.  If the Ogre can reach 255 sta a lot easier, then there is a lot of room for +HP items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The difference is that the DE can be stunned, and the Ogre can't.<br />
<br />
This is a monumental difference, far more important than piddly changes in AC/HP/Mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm.. may want to see how much gear it takes to get to 255 sta, and then see how much extra HP the two warriors can get from the remaining slots with +HP items.

<br />
Doesn't matter.<br />
All your higher end +hp gear supprisingly also has the highest sta. There are a few cases where this isn't the case, str of elements come to mind. But the high high end stuff this is true...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think you'd have to show the magelo to really check it out.  Pretty sure like Xev_Grammar said you'd be able to move gear around to make the ogre better due to not needing stam on certain slots.  Looking at the unbuffed hp the SK arent in elemental gear or anything, want to show what you put them in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At the end of the game, gear makes the character.  Plain and simple.  Your important class stats will be maxed and only the hp/mana modifiers on your gear will matter.<br />
<br />
So true you never have to even buff sta.  Everyone, casters included, is max sta with gear and AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dalzhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So am I to assume that it is really true, that once you hit 65 and have the gear to max your big stats that all races are equal, except for the race specific items like no stun for ogre and ultravision for DE.

Pretty much.<br />
<br />
My main character is a level 65 dark elf shadowknight.  I made a sample magelo for a 65 ogre with the exact same gear/aa's, and they're 100% identical.  Exact same hp and mana... the only difference is the racial differences (size, stun, vision)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then the question is, what do you mean by higher end?  Vellious dragons?  PoP tier 3?  Time?  Ssra?  Vindi?<br />
<br />
I've been 65 for a very very long time and none of my gear is any good. hehe.<br />
<br />
So the original person needs to ask if he's going to be in an uber guild or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My guess is, high end nowadays is elemental planes and/or time. The velious stuff like vindi and ntov is being done by mid lvl guilds now, pre-elemental; as far as vt goes, it's not done by a lot of guilds because people don't have the patience for the timesinks when they could get good gear in the elementals with a more difficulty BUT in 1/4 the time.</div></div><hr />
