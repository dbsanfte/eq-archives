<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aragroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started to do my epic and i got a question.  When your doing the test of patience the spirit Abe gives you a arrow.  What is it for?  <br />
<br />
I haven't dont that part yet, but the guide says he gives it to you then never mentions it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mathae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good question...I was wanting to know the same thing.  I'm ready for Kirn and I still have this arrow sitting in my bank. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">arrow is useless, might be for some future quest, but there is no known use for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I destroyed the broken arrow.  If a quest comes out that uses it, it will be very easy to get another one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">a lot of epics had parts removed and/or put in.  The rogue epic would be a lot harder if every rogue had to do the dagger subquest, but the dagger also drops of Renus, so it's moot.  They probably wanted to have an outlet for a subquest along the way.  Would be nice if they would use it, like combine it with your shield of falsehood to get something useful:).</div></div><hr />
