<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am just curious to where everyone that has gone from game has permaparked the shaman.   What was your last view of the game as the 30 secs counted down to log out?  :)<br />
<br />
Myself, I took Snowfoot last night to Kelethin because that was the first city I saw (with my then gimp paladin first char) and loved it.  Still think a great city.  Alas I butchered too many elves and was KOS there.  I was a bit disappointed over their discrimination but I sucked it up and moved back to Everfrost, my birth place instead.  Finding a plateau that overlooked the newbie area I sit down, hit camp and enjoyed for one last time watching some newbs work on leveling.  Nice way to end the game for me I felt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree. It is a good way to end up things.<br />
<br />
Personally I do not consider to get a retirement yet. But if I did I would camp in Halas inside the bank right where it all started for me, for 5 years ago. Before that I will take a long run from Natimbi to Antonica without TL or TP just to see all places for a last time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most likely if/when I do?<br />
<br />
It will be some place in either Halas or EverFrost listening to the howling of the cold winter breze as I log off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kumtha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If/when I do it will be somewhere in everfrost or halas. That is where it all started for me with a barbarian rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll die at the hands of Hammertooth then camp out and let my corpse rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think that I will tour every zone again and then bind myself in Grobb (yes, its called GROBB) and repeatedly charge the Frogloks defiling the Shaman temple there until I am level 1 again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If it wasn't for the fact that a guildmate still likes to use him, I'd leave him out the front entrance to Kurns tower, overlooking the field of bone.  The only place in the game that really evokes a feeling of 'home' for my shaman when I think about it.  Although sebilis comes a close second.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I camped out in Tranq sitting on a rooftop looking at the sunset/sunrise ... I spent so much time there waiting for my group to get their stuff together that it felt appropriate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bethiana was camped out in Kod'Taz. It was one of my last goals to get access for myself while my guild focused on farming the EPs, that I felt it was appropriate. Camped out with a group of some of my best friends in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wherever it was I happened to be at the time  - I honestly didn't think I'd manage to NOT log in again.  Had no faith in my ability to put down the needle, so to speak.<br />
<br />
Having played City of Heroes - having had nothing but fun playing a game for 3 hours straight (what, no corpse runs?  no fighting over loot?  no waiting to heal/med?) .. the thought of logging into EQ again sounds like slightly more fun than scrubbing my bathtub.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was going to camp it in qeynos hills being the first place I went to when I started eq, however, I think it turned out to be the bazaar. Can't remember, wasn't really fixed when I did cancel, and so it was random when I finally decided too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if I put any thought into it i'd have logged out the first place I'd ever died, in front of the boats in Halas.  I'd logged in a few times on my brother's beta account and seen felwithe but the first time i played for an extended duration was on the first day of live where I logged in promptly ran off the platform, missed the barge drowned<br />
<br />
my most vivid memories are in and around everfrost.  more often than not I got stuck trying to zoning out of halas (that tunnel is DARK without a lantern) ZONING.-&gt;, -&gt;, forward, -&gt;,&lt;-, forward, ZONING... *** I'm back in halas.  I dont know how many times I died trying to run back to halas to sell with a backpack full of rusty gear only to get lost in the valleys, start a massive train of pups and skellys and end up dying at 3 igloos.<br />
<br />
all I ever saw was naked barbarians.  and the odd queynos monk or two running around with a lantern in the offhand because they didn't know any better.  Grouping was as easy as seeing a couple similar level guys wacking mobs and asking, &quot;you want a group?  I know a spot with an igloo and a lot of pups&quot;  my first shield was something a complete stranger gave me.  as well as about a third of first patchwork armor and my first cracked staff.  likewise, I never charged for the armor I was making... OOC &quot;bring me the skins I'll make ye the armor.&quot;  it's those first days that indelibly bonded me to barbarian warriors over other tanks heh.  it's prejudice I know, but to this day my gut reaction is to assume that a BARBARIAN character must know his **** (although you'd think experience would have dissuaded me of this fancy)<br />
<br />
in those days time seemed to go in slow motion.  I remember every time I turned the corner and realized I WAS NOT back in halas, I remember every time I had to run from a mob, wandering into everfrost plains for the first time I looked at the map that had come with the game and wondered how to make an end run around BB and get ot Queynos (I didn't think I was ready for the big dungeon)... I decided against it when a cat chased my ass all the way back to the Macguards--I'd die before I made it past the dangerous tundra (little did I imagine about zones and the poor quality of the map).  everfrost looked BIG and at the end of the night I looked at the clock and thought &quot;damn I just spent 3 hours playing that game&quot;<br />
<br />
quite a different experience from other MMPOG... most of which I'd betaed (DAOC, AO, SWG) where the entire first night was a mad rush to be the first on the server to hit 10, 15, 20...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I do decide to hang it up for good (which I have for the most part... play an SK on a different server now /em rolls his eyes), I think I'll park my butt in Blackburrow.  That was the first his first stop out of Everfrost, and where I had my most memorable times, back when it was all about the fun, and not about the xp/loot. <br />
<br />
  I'll find an un-twinked newb shaman in zone and put all my dropable equip in a trade window, destroy the ND stuff.... and camp out naked like I started.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">then bind myself in Grobb (yes, its called GROBB)<br />
<br />
YES!! Same here! Final act of defiance.<br />
<br />
When frogs first came out I made a frog shaman and used my troll shaman to escort him to Neriak where he is bound next to the DE Warrior GM. When SOE does something that pisses me off, I log on the frog and just watch a few minutes of death cycling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">if/ when i camp out i thinik i will camp in the time graveyard  forever stuck in time !!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Oogg2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm pretty sure I camped out the final time just outside of Halas (even though I didn't play a barb), I just finished getting rid of my equipment, gave my last few items including fungi tunic to some level 20 shaman who probably didn't know how good it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I plan on stripping him of all gear and parking him in the Sharktooth tavern in LoY.  Then I will probably give the account away.<br />
<br />
Nothing says &quot;bad hangover&quot; like waking up naked in a bar in Dulok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think Neriak for me, started out as a DE rogue and I have lvl'd so many toon in that town, 3rd gate ghouls, warriors, that stupid halfling in the water. great exp zone, all that neon. probably gank the warrior guards and camp on their corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'll probably camp out in the first hallway of TOV.  The one with all the pictures.  That's when I really started raiding, we spent a lot of time there.  It was lots of fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was in an LDoN adventure. My guild had been succesfully cockblocked out of four tiers of content (including Vex Thal which we had just recently gained access to) by time guilds. I joined an adventure and had an epiphany as I was zoning in: Sony doesn't give a **** about me. Sony doesn't give a **** that 75% of their servers are overcrowded, and doesn't give a **** that their machines are outdated and have ten hours of uncheduled downtime a week, and doesn't give a **** they are releasing unfinished content, and doesn't give a **** about my guild's frustration as they waste time to have crashes mid raid or content spawn in asian time zones or other guilds put level 1 ogres in doorways. <br />
<br />
Luckily the people in my adventure weren't guildies and they were actually quite infamous for being jerkoffs, so I /quit and cancelled my subscription right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I parked my DE Necro infront of the Archlich in Everfrost.The right place, because he started it all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He got me to lev him and then bind him over the hole outside Paineel. then clicked off lev and watched his character die over and over. I think he deleveled down to 45 before he got bored and /q<br />
<br />
That was a pretty permanent way to go!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Last week, I found myself in Crushbone, sitting at the top of the stairs waiting for Ambassador DaVin to spawn.<br />
<br />
4 and a half years ago, this mob haunted my dreams.  Because of him, I ground experience just so I could whack him hard.  Because of him, my enjoyment of EQ was insurmountable.  There was a time when I lived to be able to take him down solo.<br />
<br />
Many many ToO's later, I still think fondly of DaVin.  So I would go back to Crushbone, climb the stairs one last time, and wait for him to spawn.  <br />
<br />
It is only fitting that I leave Norrath with DaVin rooted in front of me, vainly trying to take me out one last time.<br />

<br />
I'll say goodbye to all of my friends i've met along the way, and hit camp for the very last time.<br />
<br />
I won't de-level, or give away my equipment...feels like i'm dishonoring my character.  Heh.  <br />

But i'll be wearing a full set of Totemic, proudly weilding my epic and a charred guardian shield...dog dog at my side, staring into the sunset</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Well, I retired once before, back when people used to crowd in Dreadlands. Climbed a spire, shouted goodbye to the world, and leaped off into the grey mass of &quot;clip plane doesn't go that far&quot;. /q'd out before I hit.<br />
<br />
Then I came back. I think this time, my official retiremt is going to resemble this...<br />
<br />
1) Go solo Yeldema until I'm from max ally to scowling. That bitch dragon cursed the Shaman class, and i'm going to take her down. And any of her friends that get in my way. Goddamned dragons.<br />
<br />
2) I will go to Shar Vahl with some of my buddies from the day I started, and kill all the guards and NPC's and merchants we can get our hands on. Why? Because the Vah Shir are big pussies and don't deserve to be any class except Paladins and monks.<br />
<br />
3) From there, we shall move on to Gukta, and repeat the process. Why? Trolls live in Grobb. Not frogs. Frogs live in Guk, where we go to kill their king AND the ghoul lord in the same day<br />
<br />
4) And, lastly, we will travel to backwater zones such as Hate's Fury, Umbral Plains, Dalnir's Crypt, Permafrost, and Erud's Crossing. here we will get drunk, fight, die a few times, duel, and make total asses of ourselves.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, I'll don the full suit of Totemic I've never had the heart to get rid of. I fill the gaps with silver jewelry and blackened iron armor. I hunt for a newbie Shaman in some zone nobody remembers exists, where he is soloing. No PL'ing, no outrageous gear. To him I will give all my other gear and all my plat, and then gate.<br />
<br />
From my bind point, I travel to Velious, enter the Plane of Growth, put a fishing pole in my hand, and admire one of the most gorgeous zones in the game before cancelling my account.<br />
<br />
Good ending for a barbarian shaman. Rampage, party, bestow Gifts and wisdom, and die in your sleep at your fishing hole.</div></div><hr />

One of my most vivid memories of starting eq was getting scared when I had to run from Rivervale to Commons (I guess the green Goblin butts in Misty stick in my mind also.. oh yeah and Mooto my first named mob).  But, I think I will let my corpse lie on the hill about halfway between Misty and Commons and then camp out in my newbie spot.</div></div><hr />
