<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all I am back playing EQ.  I just wanted to say hello to all my fellow Shaman in the game.  I quit for about 6 to 8 months to please my new girlfriend.  Now that we are together and started to get settled in with each other I have started to play and she does not care like she did when we first started to date! WOOOHOOO.  <br />
<br />
My characters name is:<br />
Zukl Frostbone<br />
&lt;Protectors of Peace&gt;<br />
55 Mystic<br />
Bristlbane Server<br />
<br />
I have some questions to ask as well.  I have been out of the game and my knowledge has become a little slow to come back.  Where are good places to farm cash with almost no gear at all, save for the few peices of no drop that I could not give away when I quit?  Any new methods of shamaning these days or is still the same debuff, slow, resist, swear, slow, lands, woohoo, dot, dot, dot, die?   :D  :D  Needs some tips on recently cheap gear that will get me going in the right direction?  <br />
<br />
I have all of the expansions and I am going to try and get into a LDoN group tonight to start getting the points for the new shaman spell.  Also, does anyone know of a link where the new shaman spells are broken down by camp, points, and levels of said spells?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the information and glad to be back playing EQ,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, the cheap gear hasn't changed a whole lot in the past 6 months, honestly.  Just look for AC, HP, yada yada yada.  You know the drill :)<br />
As for farming, Hill Giants, Ice Giants, Geonids in Crystal Caverns.  Guards in Katta are a nice way of getting a bit of plat while leveling.  Anywhere from 7 silver to 4 plat per kill, plus Validus Custodus armor and weapons for muttmutt.<br />
As far as LDON spells, check the Medicine Cabinet :)</div></div><hr />
