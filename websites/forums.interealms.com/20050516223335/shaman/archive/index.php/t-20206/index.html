<br />
&quot;Are these your 3 points of concern&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost, but not quite.<br />
<br />
I'm still wild that our Canni upgrade is flagged as an Ancient.<br />
<br />
I've been clicking Canni 4 over and over since it was first introduced part-way through Velious.  It's time for an improvement, and a version of Canni that works in larger chunks of time, hp and mana is just the ticket for me.  <br />
<br />
But I'm never going to get this spell, or at least not in the next 3 years.  I still don't have Ancient:Feral Avatar for crying out loud.  I do have Ancient:Scourge of Nife and while I was happy to loot it, the thrill of being a &quot;special&quot; shaman with a different spell that my poor unkeyed brethen don't have wasn't that moving to me.  <br />
<br />
Make that crappy dot Ancient if you have to flag one.  Make that crappy HoT Ancient even.  But don't make our canni upgrade Ancient.  <br />
<br />
The only things I would like to see:<br />
<br />
1) Healing upgrade (all healing classes but clerics need this, for the same reasons that all healing classes but clerics needed healing upgrades after Kunark was introduced);<br />
<br />
2) Canni upgrade that is not Ancient.  <br />
<br />
You can even keep the AA I squandered on Call of the Ancients, thinking that the description was accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree 100% about the canni and healing thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree also, is there a single spell in the game that has been cast MORE then canni? No way no how.<br />
<br />
At least it would give me a reason to even try to go to GoD, right now I have zero use for the expansion, it added nothing I must have (besides Canni 6) and I'll never see it...ever.<br />
<br />
Every other classes ancient spell be neat to get but wouldnt be game changing for them, this single spell would be a major reduction in the annoyance factor for shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea i have to say that this is a given for everyone on this forum so ill just chime in and say its been said before.<br />
<br />
I dont think 1 person disagrees that making out Canni ancient is a huge mistake. Its too valuable and too needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree that most feel this way.<br />
<br />
But I think this is a hugely significant issue, with major down-the-road implications for shaman.  <br />
<br />
Shaman with this Ancient spell will be like old world clerics with manastones on a Fear raid; and ones without this spell will be like clerics without the manastone.  <br />
<br />
It's a big deal, and it needs to be fixed because they get too invested in this decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Durn it, fix this.<br />
<br />
I'd rather have this than another 250 added to my heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you'd rather have ancient:canni than an improved heal, I suspect you aren't pushing too far into GoD yet.  mana regen is much less of a problem than insufficient healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd actually go so far to say that total mana pool is in many situations more important than mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brrakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am not pushing into GoD, not at all actually, I'm still not buying the expansion until something about it makes sense.  Not in a huge raid guild that is making a large push into this content yet, so I'm going to hold off till it makes more sense.  <br />
<br />
I do know that I have sores on my finger from hitting my canni hotkey.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Canni 5 seems to work wonders for me.  Ever since I got that AA, I completely stopped using Canni 4.  Even if I do someday get the Ancient: Canni, doubt I would use it often.  It's a waste of a spell slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Correct, I have not pushed far into GoD at all.  <br />
<br />
I hate the idea of this spell being an ancient.<br />
<br />
This represents a dramatic power surge for those who have it v. those who don't.  The Time's Antithesis is already pushing the boundary, but this taking it too far.  <br />
<br />
The world does not revolve around GoD trials and this spell will absolutely be used outside them far more than it is used inside them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, making our ancient spell avaliable for the average joe in BoT would be incredibly stupid.<br />
<br />
The increase in power for the lower end shaman wouldn't be acceptable and the perceived strenght of shamans would increase which would cause the higher end shaman to get even less upgrades.<br />
<br />
The Ancient canni should stay Ancient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">*** are you smoking? how would this overpower any shaman? you coould do things like maybe Talk once in awhile? or cast one extra spell with the 30 second cast time that seems to be the staple of the class?<br />
<br />
and if you dont even mem can4 you are straight up trolling, that or you are the most avoided shaman on the server, canV means I can keep up virtually indefinitly but only because it that much extra over the constant spam of can4 every spare second I get.<br />
<br />
this spell should have been in game with pop. now its in game as an ancient?<br />
great.<br />
<br />
yes I still havent picked this crappy expansion up and have no plans to do so til shaman are brought up to date. can6, bigger blast heal being the 2 things that top probably 95% of the shaman on this boards list of things that need a fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Has anyone been able to confirm an Ancient spell (for any class) has dropped? We taken GoD about as far as you can go and haven't seen anything that might even look like an Ancient spell drop yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The increase in power for the lower end shaman wouldn't be acceptable and the perceived strenght of shamans would increase which would cause the higher end shaman to get even less upgrades.<br />
<br />
Let me get this straight.<br />
<br />
This spell would be overpowering for most shaman, but not for the few who would get it.  <br />
<br />
That's some pretty weird logic there.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, Ancient spells should not be class-defining spells that effect balance.  If they do, they need to be changed.  This does, and Wulf essentially states that, but with a twisted logical spin.  I would rather this spell get completely nerfed from the game than introduced in this form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Do you have any better ideas how to balance the high end game for shamans but still keeping the lower end intact? I'd love to hear it if you do actually.<br />
<br />
Saying that you'd rather see this spell nerfed than introduced in the current form is incredibly childish; do you want to deny the shamans that actually NEED this upgrade just because you don't want to put in the effort to get it?<br />
<br />
Personally I'd rather have a GOOD nuke or heal as our ancient though, but since I know that we'd just get a minimal increase to velium strike or some other worthless spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think the spell would not be overpowering, so I think you are wrong.  I do think it's a powerful spell that primarily represents a quality of life upgrade in terms of less ineffectual clicking.  CannIV is level 58 and it's been out since part way through Velious.  An improvement should be in the cards, its time.  <br />
<br />
To the extent you are right and its &quot;overpowering&quot;, that's only reason to remove it entirely.<br />
<br />
Essentially, sounds to me like you should argue with Giac and Sciek and not me.  They assert mana regen isn't important, so take it up with them about using this spell to balance high end shaman.  Frankly, I think all 3 of you are wrong - although I do understand that in GoD trials no one is cannibalizing.  <br />
<br />
A no drop spell, similar to runes, in a GoD setting?  Not great, but tolerable.<br />
<br />
An incredibly rare ancient?  Not fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">do you want to deny the shamans that actually NEED this upgrade just because you don't want to put in the effort to get it?<br />
<br />
This kind of idea is commonly posted, but it remains the biggest lie in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">how exactly would this be overpowering? its a slight upgrade in ratio to can4 with a long refresh and a bigger chunk per cast...are you some how worried that some shaman will use can4/canV/can6 in conjunction with each other? to do what exactly? spam their group til they go ld? this spell is a slight upgrade to our mana regen and thats its bigest game altering power. the freedom to do something OTHER than chain can4 is its biggest reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This spell cant unblance lower end shaman and let me tell you why.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ask yourself how many free spell slows you have right now. Ask yourself how viable it is to swap in and out can4 for extra man in almost all situations. The only time you would do this is after a rez or maybe on a raid where you were a dedicated healer.  Where in GoD LDoN hard or Elemental/BoT exp groups are you going to put can4 ?<br />
<br />
Quiescence<br />
Tnargs<br />
Slow<br />
MAlOS<br />
FA<br />
Root<br />
HAste<br />
Replenish/Cripple/Nuke/Bane<br />
<br />
<br />
Where do you have time to can4? much less taking the time to swap it out and cast a few times. This new canni would simply let us cast canni less and make use of our other skills and ... heaven forbid.... talk to the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, i would just like to say ... I dont this new tredn with shaman not using Can4. Suddenly they can can5 and all is well. Even with can5 and Can4  c5/PoT9/SoL( whatever BST thing is ) and FT I cant still easily push myself to a point where mana is a issue very easily. Quit being lazy !</div></div><hr />
