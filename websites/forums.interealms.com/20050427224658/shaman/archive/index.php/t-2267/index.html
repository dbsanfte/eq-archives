<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been hanging out in rathe mountains soloing hill giants for money. I am still doing this atm but after im done here and get my trusty iksar bp where should I go for exp? I was thinking get a group in Dreadlands but I wanna go somewhere I can solo, any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DL is terrible ! it's the easy way out, I try not  to go down that Oasis-LOiO, FM, DL, Karnor's route ! <br />
<br />
I'm in Great Divide and Eastern Wastes at 40, good change of pace and you don't deal with all the boneheads that dwell in DL. I hear some good places on Luclin as well Dawnshroud Peaks and Tenebrous Mountains might be good. <br />
<br />
I've been hunting Drakkel Wolves, Giants in Great Divide and Walrus and Orcs in Eastern Wastes. Made some good cash as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Linuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wolves in DS are ok but the Bugs in Echo Caves (Not the secret entrance side) are fantastic hard to solo at 39 but they stay blue for ages there are still some blues for my ranger at 53 (not many) the Stonegrabbers inthere drop 2p to 9p (9p was a freak I'm sure) more fun with a tank but still not a bad place to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Linuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">to add to this I have been Soloing the Grimlings in at the Caves in Tenenbrous Mountains and cant believe just how easy they are no more then 1200hp I'm sure. 1 dot a slow pet and u and its dead in no time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone forgets the poor yeti's in DL easy to solo with pet and dots can do all eight possibly before repops and exp is great. Not to mention that the loot while not exceptional is still quite good.<br />
<br />
Then theres the geo's in CC great loot, and with a partner can rake in the money and loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Baah Ast i was going to say the Yeti caves in DL.</div></div><hr />
