<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heh, I have been around other Eq Forums (The Necromancer and Monkly-Business) For a few years now. And I know how darn annoying posts about gear, what should I buy, and other things simular can really be annoying.<br />
<br />
Normally I wouldnt even post something like this, but since we have very few people selling items that are specifically known to be shaman oriented,  I have no clue what I am to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Myself and a Realife friend are planning on starting 2 new characters on Cazic thule, A monk (Him) and a Shaman (Myself)<br />
<br />
I've mannaged to scoure 23k and am spliting half and half. <br />
<br />
I've played a monk to level 60 so I know what gear to get for the monk, but myself I do not. I am wondering what would be a pretty simple/basic choice of gear for a Shaman thats interested it getting to level 50+ with very little gear twinking. As it is untill then that I will be making any money worthwhile to upgrade.<br />
<br />
So for about 12k, what would be a great package? If you were to post on another board such as the necromancer or monkly business I would help you the same way 8) I thank you greatly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm a newbie shaman also, but here are my suggestions:<br />
<br />
armor: JB helm, vambraces, gaunts, boots (provided you can wear these)<br />
Froglok scale chestplate. 24ac + wis. nice item :)<br />
Chipped bone bracelets (I'm sure you can get better than this)<br />
Seb scale legs if you can wear them or Rygorr leggings. Or you can just camp in KC and wait for JS stuff to drop.<br />
<br />
Jewelry: Enshrouded Veil, 2x forest loops, 65HP/mana necklace, shadel bandit ring, velium fire wedding band (6ac 65HP ring)<br />
<br />
slime coated harpoon for range slot.<br />
Sarnak battle shield<br />
Chill Spine Spear for main. I'm sure there are better than this :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. At the least, it'll give you  a starting reference. You can probably go to the bazaar and get a good deal on most of these.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2881&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;What to buy with 45k&quot; (weeeee!)&lt;/a&gt; <br />
<br />
(here's a snippet I typed in the 10k thread)<br />
<br />
If you're starting out fresh with 10k, you basically want to decide on one or two nice items and filling out the rest of your spots with something serviceable. First you need to decide on your big items... and while AC, HP, and WIS are all nice, they're not your most important stat. <br />
<br />
Your most important stats are Regeneration and Mana-free damage. Think about it, the more mana you have, the more time it takes you to med it back... you are looking for a way to get your mana back faster- and that's what regen is all about. <br />
<br />
Here are my recommendations: <br />
<br />
1. Get an iksar regen BP. 5 hp/tick = 3000 hp/hour = 1500 mana/hour (if you're a cannibalizing fiend.) <br />
<br />
2. If you spend plan on spending a lot of time outdoors, get a horse. Get the cheapest horse, and turn the models OFF. Turning the models off allows you to cast SoW on yourself without it being overwritten by the horse speed effect (and you don't have to look at a horse-head all the time.) While on a horse, if you are standing still and not auto-attacking, you are medding. Even while standing. Even while casting. The ability to med while standing/casting is huge. <br />
<br />
NOTE:  This has been semi-nerfed.  Now you can only SoW yourself on a horse if you have ALL Luclin models off.<br />
<br />
3. When you hit level 35 (and if you can find a reasonably priced one) get a fungi staff. They definitely have limitations (they snare you, the effect needs to be reapplied every 5 minutes, and it doesn't stack with regen spells) - but it's mana-free Regrowth... 9000 hp/hour = 4500 mana/hour. Stacks with the iksar regen BP or fungi tunic, too. <br />
<br />
4. Your longer-term items are (of course) the JBB and fungi tunic. <br />
<br />
For now, you'll probably just want the iksar BP. For the rest of spots, here's what I recommend: <br />
<br />
Get the cheap Jaundiced Bone pieces where available (helm, gloves, arms, boots- each a few hundred pp and great AC.) <br />
<br />
Get some 6 AC/65 HP rings- a steal for the money. <br />
<br />
Get a Black Alloy Medallion - stats are pretty good, it's cheap (couple hundred PP) and it will make every spell you cast under level 45 cost 10% less mana. That's a good thing. <br />
<br />
Get an Arctic Wyvern Mask - nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask for a few hundred pp. <br />
<br />
Get a Clay Guardian Shield (Ac 25, +50 HP) - a few hundred pp, and it will last you a long time. <br />
<br />
For remaining spots, grab totemic or ry'gorr. <br />
<br />
Since you'll be tanking your way through the first few levels, a nice weapon will help you out. You'll want to keep both piercing and your blunt skills trained, and make sure to keep your defense skill maxed as you level. As a piercer, the slime covered harpoon is nice (10 dmg, 25 dly, +5 wis, +10 mana) - fast and it can go in your range spot when you're not using it. For a blunt weapon, grab a smoldering brand (9 dmg, 22 dly, procs a minor fire DD at level 1- great &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;twink&lt;/font&gt; weapon.) Both should set you back just a few hundred pp. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and good hunting!</div></div><hr />
