<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In a neverending effort to squeeze some usefulness out of the three gimpadins in my crew, we recently made the decision to remove me (L52 paladin) from MT role and make me main healer.  Our shadow priest, already irritated and burned out at having to heal to begin with, now remains in shadowform 100% of the time. I admit that I was a little worried at first given my paladin's low mana pool and inefficient heals. <br />
<br />
What I've begun doing is picking up as much druid gear (leather seems to work best for stats, not sure why) as I can and replacing my plate.  I still have a bunch of slots left to convert and I'm in the mid 3000's for mana (priest runs 5.5k mana in comparison). Fortunately it's possible to pick up all the worthwhile healing talents as a paladin while remaining dps spec'd, so that's what I'm doing.  We started testing this in Sunken Temple the last few runs and it works flawlessly.  Here's a typical fight:<br />
<br />
L52 paladin MT runs into pack of mobs, fires off AE. He's immediately getting hammered. I proc my talent (divine favor) and hit him with a mana free crit heal which I can do every 2 min (basically every fight)- that acts as a free cheal early in the fight when he's in the most danger. It is also zero aggro due to paladin hardcoded low heal aggro- I tried and tried but could not get heal aggro, ever. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I then run into melee, pick a random mob and fire off seal of wisdom and start swinging. If it's an elite I judge wisdom and put seal of wisdom back up.  So now if I'm not healing I'm proc'ing mana regen through the following, all of which stack:<br />
- judgment of wisdom (46 mana/proc)<br />
- seal of wisdom (71 mana/proc)<br />
- fist of stone weapon proc (50 mana/proc)<br />
<br />
If you've never seen this it's insanely good mana regen that I can use while benefiting from the 5 sec casting rule as my MR shield and blessing of wisdom continue to pump up my mana as well.  So long as I don't have to remain in spam heal mode I can destroy the healing capacity of our priest, strictly because I regen mana at an insane rate. How fast? Faster than drinking the best water- on some fights I was down to 1/2 mana and finished just shy of full, while healing.  I drink about 1/3 as much as the priest did when he healed.<br />
<br />
So anyways, paladins still pretty much suck but at least I've found my role: healer.  With the rest of the int gear I'm buying I should be able to hit the magical 4k mana pool mark. I'm considering respeccing to pick up the +10% mana talent, may not be a bad idea given that my dps is insignicant. <br />
<br />
Given the upcoming paladin dps nerf (again) and our shadow priest's insane dps, I'm just happy we've found a temporary solution until our dps alts catch up.</div></div><hr />

Good use of what's available to you - sort of a lemonade out of lemons think. :) <br />
<br />
As an added comment, you might look into Mail gear (vice leather) to beef up your INT without giving up quite so much AC - There's still some decent Mail gear with int.  Not sure if this is an even comparison, but my level 52 Shaman has 3800 AC (with shield) and 3900 mana.<br />
<br />
Another approach you might take that the Shamans in my guild do - carry 2 sets of armor, one INT/Spirit based and the other AC/STA/Spirit based.  hat way you can switch between healer and tank roles and have the stats to back the role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Excellent idea, Iz.  I might post this over at our guild forums.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I'm doing as we get &quot;shaman&quot; mail drops.  Unfortunately being Alliance there's virtually no shaman statted mail to be had in the AH- everyone just vendors it.  There is a ton of druid stuff though and I've noticed it seems to be the best balance between stats and availability. It also helps that I'm not competing with anyone in my crew for druid gear, which usually gets sold or dissed anyways.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I have a bag and a half full of gear that I swap out if I need to tank or heal.  Even with lots of leather I still roll with 4k+ AC and 3k+ hps so I can take a serious beating while healing if I somehow get aggro.<br />
<br />
Oh, I also left out one other huge benefit of healing as a paladin: spell interruption.  Just with talents I have a 70% chance to avoid spell interruption from damage- then when you throw on concentration aura I have another 35% chance to avoid spell interruption. I can, and do, heal while I'm being beat on by the mob(s) that I'm using to regen mana. Unlike a priest there's no need to pull the MT or offtank away from the MA in order to peel the mob off me. If there's one thing paladins do and do well it's stand there taking a beating and not die- I'm simply able to heal and completely ignore the mob beating on me while doing so.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, when people start running instances with healadins the nerf hitmen will come calling once more.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have you ever considered telling your priest to do his job?  *boggle*<br />
You have the healer in the group refusing to heal, so you have one of your plate class group members completely reequiping themselves to make up for this....<br />
Shadowform is a really good ability....if you aren't becoming a detriment to your group in so using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What goes without saying is that the Priest outdamages all three Paladins put together (Unless the simo AOE).  The Paladin can handle interrupts and aggro better.  Sure, individually they can't heal as well as a Shadow Spec priest, but who cares? He's got three in the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a technique Ranger.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Have you ever considered telling your priest to do his job?  *boggle*<br />
Everyone's &quot;job&quot; is to have fun. Our priest was burning out staring at hp bars every time we ran an instance. Then consider the fact that when he's healing we lose massive dps which we desperately need. Add to that fact that paladins, at least geared how I am, make perfectly adequate healers. Voila, everyone's happy and we can continue to progress. I actually enjoy healing as a pally as it's not nearly so brutal and tedious as a priest.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, a shadow priest in full burn mode running vamp embrace adds significant group healing, such that I only have to watch the hps of the MT.  That right there makes my job far easier than it was for him.</div></div><hr />

Then he chose the wrong class. That's what a priest is supposed to do, stare at hp bars and heal people. If that bothers him, he should look into another class choice.</div></div><hr />

It's actually more simple than that and it just proves what I've said before about the guy and his crew. They're playing poorly. If the group is so bad at managing agro that the healer has to constantly monitor their HP's, then the entire group is doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
Agro management is everyone's job. If everyone is playing like they have some sort of clue then the priest doesn't have to be glued to 4 HP bars.</div></div><hr />

So the entire shadow talent line was an oversight by Blizzard? I love how the EQ Holy Trinity mentality with rigidly enforced class roles continues to carry over into WoW. <br />
<br />
Oh no! The priest isn't healing! We're doomed! Warriors may want to deal damage instead of tank! Rogues and shaman may wind up tanking instead of just dealing damage! The sky is falling! The end is near!<br />
<br />
There is no Holy Trinity- at least not yet. Flexible adaptation &gt; rigid preconceived notions.<br />

Correct, it's the job of our party members to magically dodge AE's that damage them. Being that we play poorly and are &quot;n00bs&quot;, could you please enlighten us what talents or gear we can take to never get harmed by AE damage? Oddly enough vamp embrace is the perfect counter to AE damage while maintaining high dps, which we lack.<br />
<br />
We solved our aggro problems by changing our group roles, that is no longer an issue whatsoever. But please continue with the snide remarks when you have yet to run an instance with us. I post what works for us based on actual game experience- you are free to ignore any thread started by me since there won't be any beneficial information since you know it all.<br />

<br />
They have 4 healers and low dps and the priest not playing eq cleric is a &quot;BAD&quot; thing? <br />
<br />
Well i dont get it. PLaying and having fun is the key. If izy isnt sweating it playing the healer and not holding the group up being OOM than i fail to see how the priest is at fault if he is willing to do it and its working. <br />
<br />
 Dont forget the priest can drop out of shadow mode and heal I'd assume anytime he wants too if it comes down to that. <br />
<br />
Keep chopping away izy curious how you guys do in the next stages. I like trying different group make ups and my friends and I do all kinds of things just like this so maybe thats why I understand what your doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think he is playing poorly per say, I do think they are going out of their way to avoid the classic tank, dps, and healer trinity. The early instances can be done with just about any combo, the problem will be when things ramp up, they do not scale as well, the difficulty increases dramatically, and one priest as your main damage dealer is not going to cut it, not even close. Critters will be coming in larger packs, higher levels, hitting for easily twice what they are in Maraudon, and have mucho hps and special attacks. You need to holf aggro with a beefy tank, and have multiple people doing good solid damage, and at least one person who really can heal well.<br />
<br />
I wish it was not so, I really do. I would love to be able to tank in strath, I am good for a little off tanking, anything more and the healer is oom quick and we are screwed.<br />

Paly in leather is going to get puppy spanked very, very hard if draw aggro in higher instances, 3000 ac or not.</div></div><hr />

And thats the beauty of it.  Hows he gonna draw aggro?  Heals?  DPS? Neither one causes signifigant aggro for a paladin.</div></div><hr />

he will be non stop healing, and in a pack of 8-10 mobs, you think they are all going to ignore his heals?</div></div><hr />

Yes. It's hardcoded to prevent pallies from using heals to gain aggro. Isn't that lovely? And don't worry about it ever being changed- the instant they do that our paladin MT will get aggro lock of the gods by spamming flash heals at the start of the fight.<br />
<br />
Also, I bought a bunch of el cheapo +int mail and respecced more into the holy (healing tree), so my mana pool should be huge.  We're taking on Eranikus (sp?) in Sunken Temple tonight, we'll see how it goes. Assuming we win, we're headed directly to BRD- I can't wait!</div></div><hr />

Simply untrue. It's hardcoded that paladins generate less threat than a druid or a priest healing but your claims just aren't true. Paladin heals do gain agro, to say anything different is completely dishonest.</div></div><hr />

Let me kill 2 birds with one reply.  Paladin heals have a tiny aggro component such that, in a large pull of mobs, if the MT is healed any mobs that haven't taken damage yet will aggro to the paladin who is healing.  I used that to my advantage when PLing my rogue because I'd pull a bunch of mobs with proximity aggro then have the paladin spam heal the rogue when she got back to camp- voila, paladin has initial aggro and my rogue can pick them off at will.<br />
<br />
In groups it's easily countered by having our paladin MT fire off his AE at the start of each fight. He's our puller as well, so he grabs a bunch of mobs, runs back to camp then fires off his AE. That's the signal for everyone to engage, including me as healer. I have tried and tried to get aggro by healing to test out my limitations and the only time it worked was if he did not AE at the start, then I would get initial aggro (and then lose it as soon as his AE went off).<br />
<br />
No, paladin heal aggro may not be zero but it's close enough to not worry about.  I recommend that you not take my word for it- go find a paladin and test yourself.<br />
<br />
Mill, I'm going to post my stats wearing my +int mail/leather a sec so you can see how I'm rolling in heal mode. I'd just like to point out that my shield alone is 1.9K AC- I think I'll survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We generally have two warriors engaging the elites, 2-4 usually, and the rogues run around and kill the 3-5 non-elites, then return and assist the warriors. In it's current form, doing strath at least is extremely difficult with 5 peeps, with a warrior as main tank even, too many mobs, and even the non-elites hit very hard.<br />
<br />
I look forward to your BRD trip report :) Make sure you hug the left and fight the big fire giant dude!<br />
<br />
I still have to return to BRD to do the dark iron smelting quest, with what we have learned in strath, should be easy, I hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">a paladin in leather will take a severe pounding. I cannot stress enough the difference in tanking ability of a high ac plate wearer and a leather wearing peep. Obviously a pally would have a shield too but it still would not be good.<br />
Okay, here are my stats self buffed in my healer gear:<br />
<br />
AC: 3963<br />
Hps: 2197<br />
Mana: 4225<br />
<br />
I will be gaining +10% hps/mana from blessing of kings and another ton of hps from fortitude as well. With the +26 int potions from our alchemist priest I may actually be in reach of the 5k mana mark, esp. when my new gear gets enchanted and I pick up the +4% mana pool talents remaining out of the holy tree.<br />
<br />
Also I have 6 slots that are either raw int or int/spirit that I will be replacing with eagle (int/sta) gear as it's available, so I expect my hps to be around 2.6-2.7k unbuffed easily (working towards 3k).  I can get AC to mid 4000's if I want to lose about 300 mana (I don't). As we find better mail/plate my AC will also improve, but at 45% mitigation + 10% parry + 5% dodge + 5% block I'm not exactly worried.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, did I forget to mention I can drop aggro at any time and heal in complete immunity while shielded? And once I'm out of mana I can always toss out the instant cast, mana free cheal. At least I'm pretty sure paladins can do that...<br />
<br />
So who will be tanking the 8-10 mobs? The priest and rogue?<br />
Whoops, missed this. The paladin MT and the paladin OT will be doing the tanking. I'll prolly pick one of the mobs as well to use as my mana regen punching bag. Plus I can't let the other lads have all the fun tanking, been a MT so long that it's in my bones.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Okay, we tried Eranikus for the first time tonight.  I main healed the entire instance, priest never left shadowform.  Priest freaked out multiple times because I'd let the MT get dangerously low before my crit heal talent would go off- I'm all about mana efficiency. So much so that I only drank 3 times the entire instance- each time after rezzing someone, never due to mana usage while healing.  <br />
<br />
The improved blessing of wisdom talent breaks the judgment of wisdom mana proc so my mana regen suffered a little bit but it's so insanely high that it doesn't matter. My passive mana regen when not healing is 80/tick (46 from 150 spirit, 30 from blessing, 4 from shield).  My active mana regen from procs is easily 100 mana/tic.  I paid close attention and it wasn't uncommon for me to be 1k mana down and to get it all back within 10 secs midfight.<br />
<br />
As far as aggro, I was hitting the MT/puller with a big crit heal at the start of every big pull, right as the mobs hit camp. So long as he hit an AE first, I never, ever got aggro. I managed to pull aggro 3 times in the entire instance healing, all 3 times I shielded and went on my merry way.<br />
<br />
So our strat on Eranikus as a big single target was to have the rogue tank and 3 healers keep him up.  The first time we forgot to clear a wing and the summoned adds wiped us. The second time we were more thorough in our clearing and wrecked him with the rogue tanking.  One thing we discovered, however, is that shadow priest aggro &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rogue dps aggro.  Shadow priest bit it mid fight (as did I when he was at 12% due to shields being down) but it was never much of a challenge.<br />
<br />
We wound up with 4 blue upgrades for the crew, including a really nice +27 int mail helm that I'm now wearing.  Fully buffed I wound up at 5.1k mana, 4.1k AC, 3.1k hps.<br />
<br />
Bring on BRD, baby (when we're done farming Eranipuss of course)!</div></div><hr />

Eranikus is the instance boss, a L55 elite green dragon.  It was a really fun fight, one of the most enjoyable yet.  He has a nasty AE, hits like a semi and puts people to sleep.  Our strategy was to have the rogue engage in the middle of the room while we formed a diamond around him.  That way only the rogue ate the AE.  Also, when the rogue got slept Eranikus would head for one of us in the corners, and we'd simply shield that person so he'd run around fruitlessly until the rogue woke back up and resumed the beatdown.  The only time this failed was when I had used my shields already- he chewed through my 4K AC like it was paper, I was dead before I could heal.<br />
<br />
He drops a bunch more stuff we want, can't wait to go back now- wooot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Eranikus is such an odd fight.  You'll do him once and it's a breeze, and the next time he'll go on a sleep rampage and use it every 10 seconds and pick you off 1 by 1.  ST is a fun zone, but after a few runs it gets VERY tedious, because you have to clear the whole upstairs of trolls to unlock the high priest fella, then you have to kill him to unlock Eranikus, then you have to make sure all the dragons are dead or he'll summon them.<br />
<br />
Nice work getting around your groups lackings, should be interesting to see how you stack up in BRD.  If you can get past the dragon area in ST (the pulls of 3-4 elites &amp; a few non), that's a good starter for BRD (except every single bloody pull is that way).</div></div><hr />

Unlike the ususal 3 sec delay 2h sword plus armor etc... that always has you crying for rage and ability usage as a warrior... this staff has a delay of 2.2.<br />
<br />
I was like holy crap this looks like my pally fighting with seal fo crusader active.... and the warrior is no longer crying for rage... able to do a special nearly every single attack and doesn't have long to wait if not. Also to mention... I removed a bunch of his armor (because it looked bad... and he was putting out so much dps with that damn staff I didn't even worry to much about it). I must say I was staying in defensive stance, because i was critting so much it really didn't hurt the dps... <br />
<br />
Just wow. I am on a mission now to find a 2h sword for my pally with that low delay... I will get the 5 points in improved 2h weapon.. and .... he will be in a state of vengence 100% of the time... thats my goal.</div></div><hr />

5 man group. Me (60 thief) 2 hander 60 Paladin, Sword and board 60 paladin, Sword and board Protection 60 Warrior, and Holy specced 60 priest.<br />
<br />
We even got through the Lycanaum without TOO many problems. (Our warrior is like the biggest anti AE wuss ever (sigh) He wants one target only to hit at all times but we are bringing him around slowly.<br />
<br />
Loved killing the dark dwarf king. He has a real growth spurt problem. <br />
<br />
Iz you should be fine finishing up the instances up to BRD at least, the most important thing is useing what you have. You seem to do that well. Also one major thing might be to give the Main tank Paladin 3-4 seconds of happy time with a boss before siccing the thief on him but that is up to you. <br />

<br />
I particularly hate that fight when grouped with hunters who FD when they get aggro, so Eranikus beats on my priest.<br />
<br />
That sleep proc does more than just sleep, you can't cast on the person effected at all.  Heals won't land and they lose aggro.  <br />
<br />
It's a bit of a crap shoot how that fight will go depending on luck and if you got some decent dps, range or otherwise.  <br />
<br />
Hakkar is a really cool fight though.</div></div><hr />
