<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Boogaba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A couple of friends and I decided to try and get me an alchemy stone.  We stayed for about four hours and never seen Alchemist Valrona.  The named, lil gnome in the bucket, that is supposedly near her we had pop several times.<br />
<br />
Overall the zone was fun for the first time but overall I could see it getting annoying.  Same mobs sometimes can be slowed, sometimes cant, same with mesmerize, ect.  A mob called &quot;an atra Somnium&quot; that seemed to randomly spawn all over can be a pain when unslowable, his melee is around mid 200s, of couse if you get the slowable version he is pretty simple.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the reason I post this is to ask your experience on camping the Alchemist.  Where did she spawn for you?  How often did you see her?  Did she drop the stone most of the time?<br />
<br />
Here is a map<br />
Grieg's End Map (http://www.circleofsouls.org/maps/luclin/greigsend1.jpg) <br />
<br />
Is that the correct spawn point for her listed on teh above link?  And is she stationary/wanders?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your info,<br />
Boog<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I do not believe she spawns at the point shown on this map, if she does, she wanders.  We got my PS when we encountered her in the area labeled &quot;uncharted&quot; on the map.  She was near a big room where we fought Servitor of Luclin.  We fought her there on two different occasions, once she didn't drop the stone (.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">cerdle,  they did fix the stone so it stays around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Funny you bring this up.  A group of us were just there last night for the first time.  I'm fairly sure that she was either moving around or spawning in different points.  She de-spawns too I think, or perhaps she was just mocing out of tracking range.  At any rate, we never found her although she was on track sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Killed her two nights ago , while crawling through GE.<br />
No drop at all.So if you really want this stone youll have to be lucky or be ready to camp her for awhile.<br />
Wish I could give more info on her location but to be honest Ive no idea where we were in relation to the zone line by time we found the alchemist.All i can say for sure is the stone is not a constant drop =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ivain_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We kill the Alchemist every time we kill Servitor of Luclin pretty much and never seen the Alchemist stone drop in the 5 or 6 times. Did drop Mod rod 2 for us one time, and the mage self buff another time.</div></div><hr />
