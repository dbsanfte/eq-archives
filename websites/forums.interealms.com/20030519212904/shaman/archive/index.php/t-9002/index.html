<br />
Is it still feasable to do the Gatorsmash Maul quest and be awarded a crude stein?<br />
<br />
Some of the older walkthroughs on the Gatorsmash Maul quest suggest that a crude stein may be the quest reward, if you do not have one equipped. Some of the newer information that I see makes no mention of the crude stein, and this was my experience. I completed the quest without a stein and was awarded the Maul.<br />
<br />
Not many guard killers on Test, so I don't mind killing the DEs again if I have a reasonable chance of obtaining the stein, though I don't particularly like the faction hits...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
I admire your desire to quest for this item. :)<br />
I hope it isn't for the 5 charges of minor healing. ;)<br />
But I would highly recommend you NOT trash your faction (since that is a concern of yours) and instead BUY TWO Opal Encrusted Steins.  <br />
<br />
Each Opal Encrusted stein has 25charisma and 10mana on it, and they aren't LORE (like the Crude Stein) so you can wear two of them at once for a 50 point charisma boost.  If you have any friends who are in the upper 180's (or higher) skill level, you can ask them to make them for you.  They are typically used in the skill progression ladder for Potters, and the pricing on them is extremely low.<br />
<br />
If you use the /bazaar feature, I'd expect you could probably get each stein for ~40-50pp, possibly cheaper if there is a glut (common) on the market from a few recent skill-up sessions.<br />
<br />
That said, I have heard that they nerfed the Crude Stein quest, but I have no solid facts if this is the case or not.  Not worth trashing your faction to prove/disprove this.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
