Given the abundance of items/augs/what have you with at least Vengeance of Ice, and the fact that I loathe our cold nukes, I fail to see the point of putting something highly redundant on our boots. How about a poison nuke focus that works on both single target DD and Rains? make it something unique that has been otherwise unavailable.<br />
<br />
I mean, the SK and the Ranger boots both have Chronoburn. I'd be for putting chronoburn on our boots also, since Det Extension is very limited availability for us to since it only comes from Time BP/coir shoulders/HoH/Ambi Crown.<br />

Hell the paladin ones have Chrononostrum:<br />

<br />
I'm not trying to bitch, the stats on the boots are nice (though the AC is the same as rosrak's, but that's besides the point). I just am kind of taken aback by the prettymuch redundant focus on it.<br />
<br />
Comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, i kinda agree with you Grizlor.  I mean, I mentioned it I think last week when the links first started coming out that I really wanted to see Chronoburn on our boots.  When I first saw the Ranger ones hadit on them, I knew it was possible, but I was pretty sure that it wasn't going to be it, and finally last night it was confirmed that it was discordant ice.<br />
<br />
Really, there is nothing wrong with Discordant Ice.  Would give our VS a max nuke of 2497 with bard song.  However, there is no seperate poison nuke focus that's available to shaman.  There is a discordant poison that's a dot mana preservation, available to nec/mag/beast only, but out of those classes I can see only the necros really caring.  There is even two disease focus' now available for our disease dot.<br />
<br />
However, problem to me lies in the fact that this early on in the god loot, there are three shaman items with ice focii. Kanleku's Boots of Spirits (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68888), Darkened Coldstone (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68807) and Bulwark of Uqua (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68745).  Combine that with two items from Time (TZ bracer and Inny shield) with wrath of eci and the Bracer of Exploration from Tipt, you have six items with at least Wrath of Eci on it.  There is no items with a Poison focus, unless you get it as the packaged Druzzil route.  <br />
<br />
I really wanted to see Chronoburn on our boots.  I'm hoping that we find something soon with it on them.  Having it on our time bp is great, and I love the focus, but with the chain bps from GoD available to anyone going through the ikk raids, just about anyone and their alt that wants it can have it.  This puts you at using HoH now with chronoburn.. but what shaman in their right mind would use HoH over TA (well, i'm sure there are some, but now that i have TA.. I couldn't live without it.. it's that game changing.. just like getting canni5 and torpor).  That leaves the coirnav shoulders, and for all purposes, are now quite outdated with the available time/god shoulder items.  There are alot of items now with Eterniostern/chrononostrum on it now, and I'm hoping that soon we'll find another one in a good slot with chronoburn on it.  Detr focus extension is so great for us, especially with new god slow around (not sure, but i think that it's affected by it).  <br />
<br />
Until there is another one available, I'll continue using my time bp.  Until then, i'm going to be lobbying to change the qvic boots focus to poison or chronoburn.</div></div><hr />

     I think I remember a thread similar to this on the EQ forums in reference to the mage gear foci.  He had pointed out a few flaws on the foci for the pure-caster line, and the devs answered back with looking at them and possibly making a few changes.  It sounds like much of GoD end gear is still being worked on and foci that &quot;were slapped on&quot; so to speak may be getting changed to make more sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well, the elemental gear when it was first introduced didn't have any focus on them either, so they do have a past history of going back and changing gear.. same with someof the time items (Earring from CT is a good example of them adding a good effect.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really like the idea of poison focus effect that also effects our rains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the devs have said no to any foci on any rains.  Just think how much foci on a wizard rain could do on a AE grp.  <br />
<br />
Back to the gear issue, I've had a chance to think back to original Vex Thal gear.  Even that gear was later upgraded (many times just adding hit points though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The cold nuke focus is directly in line with what the other priests are getting. Clerics have a MR DD focus, Druids have a nuke focus as well.<br />
<br />
You could make the arguement that the gear is disproportionately better for hybrids than other classes, but the arguement is on behalf of the way priest gear has been gimped, not our class in particular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think the devs have said no to any foci on any rains.

I'm not talking about wizards, I'm talking about a focus that affects poison spells only. how does that affect wizards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, it would definitely be overpowering for wizards but if they made it just for our poison rains i don't see a problem with it. Would be a nice boost of dps  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ever wonder why druids never use their must powerful nuke? Because Ice sucks!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Qvic Armor questions on EQlive (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Live&amp;message.id=703) <br />
<br />
Nice thread on eqlive forums about the focus' on Qvic armor.  On the third page I posted about our focus on the boots.  If any of you want to add further details on it, or dispute what I posted (or back it up with better facts) then please do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have to agree with most of you.  I did a double-take when I saw that foci too.  Maybe this is their &quot;solution&quot; to adding fast DPS for us...LOL.  Anyway, for those lucky enough to get a pair, added on top of AA's...We may actually nuke as hard as the Druids of Kunark :)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what mobs Druids are fighting not to use their Cold Based nukes, but I use mine w/o hesitation.  Of course being able to debuff a mob has its advantages  :p <br />

Chronoburn affects more than DoTs.<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Spell Duration by 25% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Min Duration(24.00 sec) <br />
4:  Limit: Effect(Complete Heal (with duration) excluded) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Charm excluded) <br />
6:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
7:  Limit: Effect(Reaction Radius excluded) <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I agree that Discordant Ice on our boots is kind of a stupid focus since there are so many other items with cold nuke foci.  Chronoburn or an upgrade to that would have been better, since it's only on our tunic.  Discordant Poison would have been more disappointing though.<br />
<br />
Complain enough and maybe they'll put an upgrade to Chonoburn on our class pants (or maybe they'll give us a clicky Breath of Ultor!)</div></div><hr />
