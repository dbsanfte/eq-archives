<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sunol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering what your experiences were in slowing mobs in PoV in your 50's, currently I have a 56 shaman and we are doing quite well duoing and inviting some friends in PoJ-DR, and when I can find a decent healer taking on the High Guardians. The regular aliens/rocks in DR rarely require malise to get slowed and neither do the HG's but I mainly malise then slow to make sure the shaman does not take a pounding to quick. Just looking for a ideal time to head to PoV or other PoP zones to keep the XP flowing. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been grouping in PoV since 56 and at the time, I had trouble getting slow to stick.  I dont have any parses to back me up but I would bet that I was getting resisted about 50-60% of the time.  I would first pull with malosi and if it stuck, could usually get slow to stick afterwards.  If it didnt stick, I would follow up with a slow and hope it did :).  I would alternate the two until slow did stick and there were a couple times where I pulled agro and died miserably.<br />
<br />
Im now 59, however, and the mobs are still red to me but I have much greater success getting them to stick.  I cast malosini first which usually sticks and then cast a followup slow which sticks even easier now that the mob is malod.  At 59, I would say my resist rate is closer to 20%-30%.<br />
<br />
I would say you can do it at 56 (maybe lower?) but expect to get agro and die alot from resists.  It definately gets easier as you gain levels.<br />

pinning up a malosi or malosini up on the mob on incoming gave me better percentages of slows landed with less risk over using togors and turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In PoV, i always cast malosini (rarely resist) and then Slow, it works :)<br />
with a good tank i don't agro that nice lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've done the bulk of my exp from 56-62 in Valor. Slowing was tough until lvl 60. At level 62 I have very little problem getting slow to stick and I still don't have malo. Pre-lvl 60 I suggest looking for groups with either a chanter to tash or a mage to mala. Will make your life sooooo much easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well friend, I'm not sure how your getting better percentages.  I've parsed this several times, and the bounce ratio always comes out the same... malXXX and torgors (and turgurs for that matter) are resisted an equal amount... two things to be said for maloXXX is that the lower versions will cast a bit faster than torgors, and you'll get less agro... Bad things to be saide for malXXX, even if the faster casting nets in malXXX landing sooner than torpor would have, it usually results in landing slow later.  In PoV at level 56 I RARELY (maybe once an hour) have both turgurs and torgors bounce to where I'm up for cast number 3.  If your casting turgurs, then following with malXXX, even if it is faster casting than torgors, you still have to follow up again with turgurs... this nets you alot more unslowed mob damage on the MT.  Also, if turgurs and torgors bounced, then turgurs and malXXX would have bounced too... this is the only time the faster cast time of MalXXX works for ya, but honestly happens to rarely to warrent being a primary option.<br />
<br />
Turgurs/torgors rotation will simply get it slowed faster.<br />
<br />
Now, if you have no rezzer, or are MH, then malXXX is better simply to try and reduce agro, as dying has alot more consequences...  But as MH, you might quickly get stuck in a heal loop that simply can't cancel out the damage Your MT is taking...  Chain slowing will possibly get you agro, but you can survive a slowed mob till the MT gets it.  If it doesn't get slowed before you die, I GUARANTEE you that it wouldn't have gotten slowed before you got stuck on the loosing end of a heal cycle, and ended up with a full whipe anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, if your Hps are very sub-par you might want to take the malXXX route, as you might not be able to take a few rounds...  But when I was lightly buffed to around 3.5k hps, I managed to slow through an angry unslowed mob on more than one occasion, and often lived to tell the tale... If death isn't going to butcher the group, then getting it slowed is more important imho.  Turgurs/Torgors just does it faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I grew up there from 56 to 60 and now at 60, hell even 59 I have had no trouble slowing...<br />
<br />
My little piece of advice is to stand by the MT when you want to slow and to Malxx on incoming...  One arrow from the tank is more agro then the Malxx line and will also help the ping ponging if you pull agro with a slow...<br />
<br />
Also others might say it makes no difference but from MY PERSONAL observation I seem to be resisted less in melee range...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">malo will really help alot here. SO does having a tank that can keep agro if ya bounce a few attempts. I didn't start trying to slow mobs in pov until around 60 or 61 so can't offer any advice for the pre 60 crowd other than make sure the tanks got agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm 56 and I stand right next to the tank to make sure I am in melee range when I cast.  It's much easier to land spells when in melee range.<br />
<br />
I lead with slow and it lands about 70% of the time.  If it doesn't stick, I'll immediately follow up with Malosi.  VERY rarely (1/30?) do both of these get resisted.  After Malosi is cast, I got back to slow, whether Malosi stuck or not.  Invariably, the mob is always slowed after the third cast.<br />
<br />
56 is easily doable there, and I was even successful at 55 but it was little dicier.  A good cleric/tank combo helps then.</div></div><hr />

no doubt tier2 zones are juicy exp at the mid 50s. being in melee range has no bearing on landing slows fyi. I agree its useful though in case you get aggro to not have to pull a mob out of camp.</div></div><hr />

Dunno about the amount of agro being generated with the different levels of our maloXXX line of spells, but I have always used the best I have and have never noticed that one generates more agro than another.  2 nights ago at level 62, I found that without malo, I was still being resisted maybe 20-30% on slows in PoV even casting malo first.  I actually had more luck slowing the storm riders in the courtyard of BoT than I did in PoV at the same level.  I just think those mobs in PoV are fairly MR.<br />
<br />
I urge ALL shammies who are approaching 60 to check the bazaar constantly for malo or the spell components for it.  The components needed are:<br />
<br />
Words of Energy<br />
Words of Retention<br />
Yaeths Compendium Page 108<br />
Staff Shard of Luclin <br />
<br />
And the two rare ones are the Yaeths and I believe Retention.  Got page 108 with a group in Fungus Grove fighting the shiknar warriors and got a couple words of retention from Sol C on the kobald side.<br />
<br />
On every inc, Malo is cast before slow and the decreased resist rate is noticable.<br />

with a good tank i don't agro that nice lol<br />
<br />
Malosini and Turgurs have the same resist check (MR) and if one is rarely resisted, the other will too.  I usually dont have a problem with getting agro just with malo/turgurs but if I dont wait until 80% to cast Bane of Nife and then my Torrent of Poison (AoE rain), Im almost assured of getting agro.<br />
<br />
Which leads to a funny story...I was in PoV around level 60 and was grouped with a fantastic warrior tank who had no problem controlling agro.  The whole group noticed this and complimented this well geared twink tank at which point he replied that with all his agro procs, he can usually regain agro immediately thereafter :)  We each took our turns trying to steal agro and the only ones who were able to take it were the chaincasting mage and me.  It only took 4 spells for me: malo, turgurs, BoN, E Bolt.  Soon as that E Bolt hit, BOOM, the whole group is   kiting a snared mob that is chasing me around the camp trying to tear me a new one.  Probably took the tank about 15-20 seconds to get agro back at which point he replied, &quot;WOW!  He doesnt like shammies&quot;.  Neither does SOE :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">PoV is gravy as far as Im conscerned...(forgive all spelling errors). This is what I do when I get there..<br />
1. I try to avoid the IC..To crowded and when it goes bad, it really goes bad.<br />
2. OC is awsome..room to move and you can start casting on the mob at it hits the river.<br />
3. Actual casting on the mob pointers.<br />
     A. Have a cleric cast BoR on ya..It helps.<br />
     B. Soon as the mob exits the tunnel hit em with malosini...sometimes <br />
         twice.<br />
     C. Stand toe to toe with the tank. If the mobs agros, and he will, <br />
         dont make the tank have to chase the mob down..Quick root if <br />
         if you can and let tank get agro back..YOUR GOING TO GET HIT.<br />
     D. Then wait till about 90% (MOB HP) and cast Turgers.  You cast  <br />
         any sooner and chances are your gonna get smacked.<br />
     E. Wait till about 85% and cast cripple..take some of the oompf out <br />
         of the mob..Helps the cleric out.<br />
     F. Most importantly..DO NOT PANIC..Theres lots of room if the puller<br />
         gets two to root and park one while he cirlces the wagons.<br />
<br />
     Well, thats my two cents worth..Its how I do it on PoV..It wont work everywere you go, but for there I find its the best way to do it..The EW and WW are pretty much the same, but mobs are closer togethor..I like to have rangers do the pulling there..But its a long run to the zone if the mobs gang up so keep that in mind..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One last point..If your having trouble slowing in POV 58 and beyond, you got some serrious issues..Most notably would be upgrading your spells..As for spells hitting more often due to range..That may be a falacey...I used the ceramic sword of war, ext range IV and can malosini the mob while they are just exiting the tunnel in OC..And thats casting from way over on the other side of the hill..Dont waste your mana casting slow first..Its very rarely you will get agro from casting malosini..But slow will get you agro right away..And if your waiting to cast slow for the mob to get below 80 percent, if I were the cleric Id be chewing your ass for waiting so long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have also noticed that disease based slows are almost never resisted by Golems in PoV. If you're really bouncing stuff bad I'd suggest using a Disease slow first. Then work on getting the big slow on em. Honestly, a 40pct slow while not optimal is usually more than enough to keep your tank alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Good point...Plague of insects is a good starter...you can him em with isnideous decay first, like no casting time and then tag em with insects...then, if the mob is still doing horrendous damage...slow em Turgers style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I malosini on incoming and slow immediately aftwards regardless of malosini got resisted or not....get about 2 or 3 resists per 2 hours.</div></div><hr />
