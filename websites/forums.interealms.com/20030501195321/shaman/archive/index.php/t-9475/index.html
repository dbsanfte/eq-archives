<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nilch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My shaman is level 20. If i were to have a friend turn in the tear to Lord Rak and i loot the iksar scale after he is dead would i be able to do the quest at lvl 20 if i have max ally truespirit faction? Can anyone help me out with this question??<br />
Also...anyone have a good way of raising Truespirit Faction at lvl 20?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nilch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If i cant do the quest at lvl 20 does anyone know what level i need to be?</div></div><hr />

That's for double posting<br />
<br />
/smack #2<br />
<br />
That's for trying to use Curse of the Spirits on those poor Paludal bandits<br />
<br />
No... for some reason, no matter what, you must be lvl 51+ for final epic turn in... you can get your SoF and SoW-boots from the quest though ;D.</div></div><hr />

that for passing false info.  <br />
<br />
No one has ever determined there to be a min level limit for getting their shaman epic.  Lots of people have done it in their 30s and 40's, and while someone might not have posted it I wouldn't be suprised to see someone do it at level 1<br />
<br />
I've heard the effect cant be used until 51, but I can't personally confirm this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahh... learn sumthing new every other day =p<br />
<br />
Sorry, I had it smashed into my head that you HAD to be lvl 51 to complete epic.<br />
<br />
And about the lvl one thing... they'd ding from the xp of the quest :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I figure that the XP from getting sufficient TS faction would likely push you up to at least level 6. Perhaps higher, but you can always roll back down to 6 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>terenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Finished it last night at 46 so i know it can be done at at least that....doesnt proc though so more then likely right on the 51 for that....Ill post when I hit the lvl it procs at :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">terenna the spear is clicky, not proc. but it still wont happen until 51 I beileve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Group a level 65 with the level 1 shaman when you do turn-ins. He won't get exp and you can have epic at level 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">smartass =p <br />

You could devel back to level 1 and see if the right click works.<br />
