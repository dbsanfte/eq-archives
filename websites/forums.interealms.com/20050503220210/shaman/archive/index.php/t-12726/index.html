<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've played EQ since Feb after Beta. I've had it with guilds. It's just a game! I don't want all the drama. I just wanna play, make some friends, have a good time.<br />
<br />
For the most part, I ran away from everything....and made a shammy kitty on FV, currently lvl 22. This was fun! I've NEVER played untwinked. This was new, challenging, and actually fun. I never died before lvl 40-ish before. I've died lots with my shammy! Sure, this isn't something to brag about. I'm just saying, I'm finally playing the way this game was meant to be played. I think...  hehe  Except I have no goals for my toons, and I don't want no stinking guild!  :)<br />
<br />
Otay, that said.  I kept saying &quot;I wanna solo! I wanna solo!&quot; but now hubby has a 22 kitty beastlord on FV, too.<br />
<br />
I know where to read on these boards about soloing, and where to get lvls, and yada yada....<br />
<br />
What I'm asking is... Do you have any &quot;other&quot; bit of advice? Maybe something you've learned, but hasn't really been asked or talked about yet anywhere else. Or a memory to share to let people know what NOT to do?  :) <br />
<br />
This is my first shammy and I luv her much more than my 52 cleric. In fact, I'm considering getting rid of her gear since I don't play her any more.<br />
<br />
Otay, done rambling.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like you're pretty much where you want to be as fun is concerned, and it is a game, so have fun  :D If you are tired of guilds but want to raid, once you get higher levels start going on public raids (E'ci has tons of these, can't speak for other servers though) or, consider organzing your own public raids.<br />
<br />
As for playing, just have fun, and try to partner alot, solo with a shaman is great fun, but partnering is much better. The person you parter with becoms a better player because they begin to understand the stengths of the shaman class, and you become a better player because you learn to kill things with 2 people that takes groups of others  :cool: I like to grab a random person and group with them for a while, I have a half dozen or so people that give me tells asking to duo when I log on now  :p <br />
<br />
Final note on guilds: at 52 I doubt you have seen that many of them... if your guild is bumming you out, LEAVE, people get the idea that they owe thier guilds something. If you are not happy, go to another group where you are... the personalty of one guild can be so totally opposite from another as to change your entire perspective on the game. If you have friends in guild, /friend list works just as well as guild chat, and anyone who won't talk to you after you left your guild most likely isn't a true friend, unless you are an epic hopper or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there are fun guilds out there, mostly far and very few between, but I had the luck to be in two of them on my server.<br />
<br />
of course, this was all way back when, before kunark way back when. and the guild was more of just a big group chat and if we could we would group together and kill things. some people wanted more, but most were just in it for the social. sure there was drama, but with any group of people over 1 you are going to get some sort of drama. it is the guild leaders jobs though to stop as much of this from seeping into the guild chat and trying to solve the problems with the people included.<br />
<br />
anyway, I agree heartily that this game was not meant to be a race to get to the high level guild to do epic encounters. I did a few hate, fear, vox raids (with a friends account) and honestly, I have had more fun with one group of people back in the day doing runnyeye. <br />
<br />
sometimes it helps to just drop out of everything and sit back and just think about what part of the game gives you the most fun. some people it is doing trades, some it is seeing how much plat they can make in the bazaar, others it is a race to get to the top. the goals of the game are different for everyone.<br />
<br />
it is like one of those old choose your own adventure books. you read through a section, choose your response and never read the same story twice. one thing about those books though, there is usually only one ending that you are really happy with.<br />
<br />
EQ is much the same, you have plenty of choices starting from the character selection, and the options broaden from there.<br />
<br />
make of the game what you can, but don't try to make yourself happy by following others footsteps. do your own thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm in the same boat you are, which is pretty rare nowadays. I was in the 2nd most powerful guild on my server but left it just before PoP came out because I realized that raiding 5 times a week for 4-6 hours each night was not fun. Killing the uber mobs was a rush, but waiting for everyone to mobilize, the stupid loot squabbles that erupted between friends, and drama both within the guild and with other guilds drove me away from it. I realized how petty a lot of people can be when I was told not to associate (even XP group) with people from certain other guilds whom we'd had conflicts with in the past over things as silly as NToV or Ssra. Another reason that I left is because we were gearing up for VT at the time, and shard camping was driving me insane. If I have to look at another goranga in my life I'm going to throw my monitor out the window  :D <br />
<br />
Now I play maybe 15 hours a week, just XP'ing mainly and going on the occasional non-uber raid with friends, but I'm having way more fun than I ever did before. For sure, I've given up pretty much all chance at getting uber equipment and visiting the true end game, but it was a sacrifice that I was willing to make in order to make EQ fun again. I enjoy EQ as a game, whereas I think a lot of people take it far too seriously, which is bound to happen when some people are playing 40+ hours a week - it becomes a part of your life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can live with that then you can still have a blast with a lot less drama.<br />
<br />
Some things are simply just not going to happen without a guild, or a lot of luck.  Some goals just take a bunch of people to get the job done.  If you can give up some goals like your epic or high end no drop grear then you can have a great time in EQ.<br />
<br />
Their is nothing wrong with having gimp equipment in comparison to a 12 year old that lives in a raiding guild 40 hours a week and has all the strange d00d l33t chat down to an art.  Having fun is smart :).  Working 40 hours a week on a game that is getting so lame that it has frogs as a player race is just kind of stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have to disagree slightly: all but 2 part of the epic can be easily done solo if you faction past the hole and neh'ashir which is what I did. Getting in on public Fear raids or paying 10-20k for a tear MQ is not really that bad, and getting together 2 goups to kill Rak for the final fight is not really that hard either. For that matter, I've known a couple shamans who asked reaver raids to help out with Rak, really a gimp fight with a couple mages or a level 65 warrior MT.<br />
<br />
As for gear, that is to some extent true. However, SS gear is just fine for a shaman who is not doing Luclin / Pop tier3+ encounters, and if you're not into being in a guild, you will most likely not be doing these types of encounters. There are exceptions however... for instance on E'Ci, there are highly organized groups that, while they are not guilds, have a DKP system and raid when targets are available. The raids led by Ashorty for instance are 65+ Luclin / higher-end PoP content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My shammy is only lvl 22, but since I play on FV, I need only to learn how to make money if I want gear, because a lot of typically no drop items are NOT no drop on FV. For example, I got a Testament of Vaneer for 275p in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
My cleric is 52 on Emarr. I got tired of being behind in levels and never being good enough. I was playing a couple hours a day trying to catch up, but others those single people and students were just playing 10x more than me in a week. I finally came to my senses and left my guild because our goals didn't line up. I didn't want all the things they wanted. And I truely believed that I still had friends, and it didn't matter the guild tag above your head. I quickly learned that in all these years I could count the number of &quot;friends&quot; I made on one hand. This was disheartening. But never-the-less I am grateful for the friends I do have. I let some of these people get to me and allowed my feelings to be hurt. So, I made my shammy on FV to totally get away from Emarr. I made a shammy, so I could solo. Than hubby thought we could play EQ together, and now I don't have to worry about getting lonely.<br />
<br />
I've received multiple invites to guilds on FV. I gave them my picky list of what I expect from a guild and they all said &quot;np&quot;, which dropped my jaw. So, I had to be honest and say I'm really not looking for a guild. I don't have any goals for my toons at this point, but maybe I will someday. And I just hope you can understand that. One person said they understood, and the rest think I'm just insane. Hubby is being really supportive and will join any guild I join, and he isn't looking into any either.<br />
<br />
I like chatting and getting to know people. All the other drama that went along with guilds made me insane. I hated it in HS and I hate it worse as an adult. I'm almost 30 for crying out loud! I still run into people from HS that act like we are still in HS. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what makes this game fun. The bit of challenge? I'm actually glad I'm not twinked and have to work on my skills. And being a Vah Shir has it's ups and downs. Most of my chars are between lvl 4-10 in my first hour. But I've been doing a bunch of silly questing. And as tedious as it's been, I've been learning, too. I know my own city. I can get to and from differen places via PoK. You know, with my cleric, I just /follow  'd someone in my group, and never really learned anything all these years.<br />
<br />
I'm working on tradeskills, languages (a necessity on FV), and just learning areas (places I've been many times in the past, but didn't know my way around). I've become more independent and not so needy as past toons I've had.<br />
<br />
An epic is another &quot;item&quot; to me. I don't even know if it's something I want to achieve at this point or not. But if I do, I'd rather do most of it without being in any guild. When I get to that point, maybe I'd have enough friends that we can help take care of each other when it comes to epics.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
At this point, I have no goals for my shammy. But I do know that I want to focus on soloing more than grouping. And I know that I want to be as independent as possible. I quickly learned AC + mana items seem to be easier to find (realistically) than AC + wis. I do need to learn how to make my income in EQ. This has been my only hangup. I'm doing a bit of farming now, but the competition is getting a bit thick. But I'll figure something out. I know when I'm higher lvl there's more I can do.<br />
<br />
Am I rambling again?   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice pictures though.<br />
<br />
I only wish you were on my server though so I could train your sorry ass on the way to some uber-mob that drops phat loots.<br />
<br />
Haha $$$ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Anyway.... as fun as raiding is, its also good to NOT be in a guild.<br />
<br />
Some nights you do just want to hang out with friends or work on tradeskills/quests etc etc.<br />
But then a raid gets called and you have to drop all that (normally).<br />
Some nights I would just like to chat to friends while hammering out armor and stuff at a forge.<br />
<br />
I just wonder though what people do when they 1) get sick of exp grinding, 2) get sick of raiding and 3) get tired of tradeskills??<br />
<br />
Start a new twink? Watch bad TV all night?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keriru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">But I can't start a &quot;twink&quot; on FV.<br />
I'd have to start over on another server.</div></div><hr />
