<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilucia</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would really like to be able to alt+tab out of the game without it crashing. Sometimes I really need to look things up and it's a pain to have to camp and reload after having looked it up, or sometimes if I'm bored but want to stay in game, I'd really like to just set an AFK flag, alt+tab out, and be able to do something else without logging.<br />
<br />
Is there any special reason that VI's ever addressed explaining why they can't (or won't) set it up to do this? And if not, why haven't more people brought up the issue to them? It's kind of annoying that you either have to have a 2nd computer or have to log out if you need to find some information on a spawn or something... Anyone else agree?</div></div><hr />

i think that's what i was told.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unlike the hybrid changes that was supposed to never be changed, I believe this is one thing they will not back down on.</div></div><hr />

are we allowed to talk about EQw?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draeven</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Err, EQW is agains the EULA as far as I know.<br />
<br />
A quick &quot;hack&quot; that doesn't violate the EULA.  In your display options set &quot;Screens Same Size&quot; to off.  If you use a screen size larger than 640x480 for normal play (IE, Full screen mode,) You can alt+Tab out, then, to get back in, you select the window and hit F10 a couple times, or open your spell book to Reinit the display.<br />
<br />
At least, I'm pretty sure that works, I haven't tried it in forever and a day.</div></div><hr />

Works great</div></div><hr />

Was nice while it lasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerplikda</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">even better option is pay 200-400 for a cheapo computer to just surf on on dial up and you can look stuff up on there <br />
<br />
perfectly legal as far as UELA is concerned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So yeah.... paying 200 to 400$ plus paying for dial up is better how?<br />
<br />
EQW takes like 5min to set up if not less and isn't legaly detectable. Also if your cpu can handle it, it will also let you run multiple copies of EQ on the same machine (differnt accounts of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LottoBS</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">=P well ok , it seems we ARE allowed to talk about the nifty little program.<br />
Personally I really like EQw for the benefits it has to offer compared to the problems there might be with it,<br />
(it might take you abit to get it working properly) and as Neno said, it is not legal for verant to try and detect weather or not you are using the program (thereby not saying that they cant/dont do it, just that its illegal for them =D ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasalle Stormreaver</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should have the key-coding option of disabling the ALT-TAB combination while in game.  Its really easy to accidentally alt-tab out, causing linkdeath-- and since its not a bug, you're not getting CS-rezzed.  If Verant isn't going to back down on this, that's fine-- all I ask is that they give us the option of disabling that key combo within the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arbok of Xegony</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree with Lasalle here.   When I installed win2000 on my machine about a year ago, I kept booting myself out via the 'windows' key which happens to be right next to the CTRL key.   Which also happens to be a key i use often.<br />
<br />
Well after asking some guides(useless) about my problem, they didn't offer any useful advice.   So I just sucked it up and decided that I should just be more careful.     But one day while toying around with Task Manager, I managed to recover EQ from an accidental slip on the 'Windows' key.<br />
<br />
So in turn, if they're not going to fix it, well then I'm going to abuse it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aalavar</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if EQW is not &quot;legaly&quot; detectable, it is still against the EULA.  ShowEQ is not detectable, and is against the EULA.  It doesn't matter if it's a good program or not, or if it works, or whether or not you think it shoudn't be against the EULA, it is.<br />
<br />
A lot of the people I know have started using this, I just tell them not to even talk about it online, that is one easy way of getting caught.<br />
<br />
As far as alt-tabbing to go look something up, BAH I say!  Play the game for fun, read the text on the screen, don't let the spoilers tell you how the game is &quot;supposed&quot; to be played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, dispite the complaining that VI does, EQW is NOT against the EULA.  EQW is not a hack and does not alter the game itself or any of it's functions or calculations, and it does not capture or trojan any information.  It's simply a video utility that allows you use EQ in a window instead of full screen.  It's not any different then the newer video cards and drivers that let you have 2 or more monitors active and switch between them.  It just lets you do it with ONE monitor/videocard instead of having to invest in all the extra equipment.  The reason VI complains so much is because they are afraid some hacker is going to take the EQW engine and design something that DOES start breaking the EULA, and they won't be able to block or track it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumahim Ashenbane</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldn't find the EULA on the EQ site since they changed the layout (at work atm) but the way I see it is that EQw allows EQ to be run in a way that it is not meant or intended to be run.  You're specifically using a 3rd party program to alter that whether it directly alters EQ or not isn't relevant IMO.</div></div><hr />

A: can't make it full screen<br />
<br />
B: it crashes when i get to the first loading screen<br />
<br />
any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draeven</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, for those that are getting EQW, READ THE README FILE!  I've helped Countless people get EQW working, by fixing the SAME PROBLEM each time. =P  Sorry to sound annoyed, but it does get a bit annoying after a while.  It's a problem that is explained how to fix in the readme.<br />
<br />
Make sure EQ, desktop, etc, are all set to the same color depth.<br />
<br />
*raises hand* I do not have an extra comp just laying around =P  Much as I'd like to.<br />
<br />
And on another note, You can't go from full screen to windowed mode using EQW, Either run it with EQW and it's windowed, or don't and it's full screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arroe</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so make sure they are all the same size or whatever?  like 1024x724 or something like that?</div></div><hr />

pretty cool :)</div></div><hr />

ENough said, I'm not gonna worry about it.  And even if its not, i'm not going to worry about ti.  There are enough people with no lives in my guild who have two computers to look stuff up for me. :P  If they are not playing their second account at the same time. haha</div></div><hr />
