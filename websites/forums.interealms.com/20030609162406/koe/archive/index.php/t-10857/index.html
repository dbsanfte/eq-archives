The new info is up on the EQLive site now, just click on the Ygesha link and then look at the newly unlocked section. Image being able to quickly gather groups of people for pickup groups much faster. Very very cool!<br />

BTW, if you read the 2nd chapter of the lore, they mention an amphibious race that helps the broken skull clan (inny's favored clad) invade grobb to steal the stone of the prophesy. My big question is, what race was this? It wasn't froglock that's for sure, it A. doesn't make any sense that the valorous foglock would be helping the trolls of inny and B. if you look at the flash annimation, you get a nice face shot of one of them when the flash annimations scrolls all the way to the right. So, what race is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Plopnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry its the corporate sid of me but I see a downside to this.  Every time you go LFG Not only willl you get spammed out the butt if your lucky, but you will also have to forget going lfg to form up raids for fear ppl will see a large group amassing somewhere a nice kill is and will swarm. <br />
<br />
Sorry to be so negative but I am trained to always see the downside.  (disadvantage of going to college to calculate risk)<br />
<br />
EDIT: The scaled race I would hope will be covered in a dungeon or two?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They aren't a scaled race. Scales imply lizard or snake. They were described as a amphibious race with webbed fingers. They are also obviously very powerful wizards. I would assume they are a race of creatures that are followers of Innoruk for them to be helping the Broken Skull clan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XunilTlatoani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">IMO its all just fluff except for the guild filtering.  The Guild filtering feature will make forming raid groups in addition to creating exp groups a much easier process.  So, Plopnar, you won't be spammed, because only those in your filter list can search your LFG status.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">WEll Xunil, personally I find it VERY VERY hard to find to find groups or get into groups. A lot of times I have to organize groups with maybe 1 other keepers 1 other friend of mine and maybe a pickup or two and it takes me sometimes an hour to get that group going. Someimtes I'll get into a PoP group really fast if I'm NEEDED for slowing or if I'm just lucky. Gor the most part usually it takes me 1-2 hours to get a group and that's why I usually end up soloing or duo'ing with Tarachi so much. Yes maybe I'm doing something wrong, but this LFG tool will help players like me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Soriathus, I suggest that you visit the library in the Plane of Knowledge and read some of the free books there. The froglok gives out a book that is the same on you can read on the Sony site. There is also a Troll with a book about them that relates to their civil war. In the Plane of Justice, there is a Froglok prisoner that will tell you his story of betrayal in the war between the Guk Frogloks and the Trolls.<br />
<br />
There are giant frogs in the Plane of Storms that give faction against the Lost Kingdome of Lok. But, this may just be a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mawafu Steelfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is such BS. Both shots show the group looking for a necro and we know this never happens.</div></div><hr />
