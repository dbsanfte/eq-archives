<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TheRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The following is a guide I'm writing up for all the melee in my guild. Its still a work in progress, and I'm still working on parts 2 &amp; 3. Would like any critiques you can off though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What Every Melee Should Know<br />
What follows is going to be a guide to meleeing, both in a group and in a raid. I'll cover everything from maximizing your DPS (Damage per Second), to aggro, tactical placement, tagging, etc. This is going to be a work in progress for a while, so please post comments.<br />
<br />
<br />
DAMAGE SOAKING as a MT<br />
The primary job of main tank is to take damage for everyone else. The MT's job is to take the beating that would reduce other classes to a red smear.  There are two factors to this-- the first is you need to be able to hold a mobs attention (I'll cover Agro later) and the second is to minimize the amout that you need to be healed. The less you need to be healed, the less mana healers have to burn on you, and the longer you can last. Fewer complete heals also means less agro generated by the healers and the easier it is for you to keep a mob where you want it. (mainly bashing your skull in)<br />
<br />
There are three parts of Tanking (holding agro aside) <br />
1) Damage Avoidance<br />
2) Damage Mitigation<br />
3) Damage Soaking<br />
<br />
1) Damage Avoidance-- not getting hit. Skills like Reposte, Block, Parry, Dodge along with raw AC, Level, Saves, and some disciplines. This means that you'll be hit less often. Note that you can only use skills like Parry and reposte when a mob is in your front quarter. <br />
Another thing to consider here is the use of 1h weapons vs 2h weapons. While 2 high speed weapons are generally higher taunt then a single 1hs with a long delay, you will take less damage off of reposte from what you are tanking. This may be a concern, depending on the mob. You may knock an opponent down to 70% slow but if they're hitting you back 3 times every time you hit them 10 and you're using 18 delay weapons with 100% haste-- that works out to some outrageous damage on you.<br />
Evasive discipline, rangers Weaponshield discipline and a few others all qualify as damage avoidance.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Damage Mitigation. <br />
Once you're hit the game (based largely off your AC but also off of your stamina, and your AA abilities) deflects some of that damage. A good way to test this is sit or turn your back to a mob. You will take considerablly more damage from a blow if you're hit while sitting or from behind. <br />
Another good test of this is Monks vs. Warriors. Monks have some of the best damage avoidance in the game ( Block+High Agility means that more shots are completely deflected) however a monk will take more damage from a successful hit than a comparably equiped warrior due to the warriors damage mitigation. There isn't anything to do with this one other than AA abilites and High AC/stats. Keep your front to the mob and dont let an off tanked mob get behind you.<br />
Also level plays in here-you'll be hit for far less damage by an orc pawn even naked if you're level 55 compared to level 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
The defensive discipline also factors into  damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
High resists will also allow you to avoid/mitigate far more casting damage<br />
<br />
3) Damage Soaking<br />
What makes warriors the premire tanks however is their ability to soak damage. Raw hitpoints are the issue here. Tanks should focus on Stamina, HP and AC as their primary abilities. The more HP you have the more efficient a complete heal is. The more hits you can take before you need a complete heal, and the more leeway your clerics have in their Complete heal rotation.<br />
<br />
The few times they have to heal, the less agro they generate, and the more likely you all are to stay alive.<br />
<br />
Damage per Second--DPS<br />
<br />
The second factor in determining your chance of success on a given mob is your ability to rob an opponent of HP. In other words-- to be the living crap out of it with sharp (or blunt) objects. <br />
 Weapon Ratio Weapon ratio is simply Damage vs. Delay.  Please bear in mind that there is a big difference between the expected ratio of 1h weapons and 2h weapons.  You need to remember however that ratio isn't everything --a 9 damage weapon doesn't hit for 1-9 points of damage-- there are some complex formulae that go into figuring out the average damage of a weapon. This is the easiest thing to evaluate when looking at a weapon's value. Please make sure you are comparing apples to oranges though. 9/18 on a 1h weapon is decent. 20/40 on a 2h weapon is not-- a comperable ratio on a similar quality 2h weapon would probably be in the neighborhood of 32/40 Damage Bonus If you right-click a weapon you see a number listed as Damage Bonus. This seems to be the single most misunderstood number in the game, so let me try to straighten out the confusion.Again, we have to seperate 1h weapons from 2h weapons.1h weapons:  With 1H weapons damage bonus is has NOTHING to do with the weapon itself. The number is dependent on one thing--YOUR level. If you're a level 56 character your damage bonus is 10.  ANY 1H weapon you view will list a damage bonus of 10.  Rusty broadsword, or Swiftblade of Zek--its 10.  This damage is tacked on to your hits and basically gives you a minimum value you can hit for. You wont hit for less than 11 with a weapon if your damage bonus is 10.Please note that this ONLY applies to your primary hand. Offhand does NOT receive a damage bonus. Even weapons flagged as secondary only show this damage bonus so its important to realize what this number actually represents.2h weaponsBack about 8 months ago, Verant decided that people were not using 2H weapons enough dispite their actual value. They threw in a damage bonus in for 2h weapons with delays &gt;30. This damage bonus scales with the delay of the weapon, so a 40/50 weapon is not nearly as bad as it seems.because in addition to the level based damage bonus, you get the delay based damage bonus.  You should remember that the damage bonus viewed is dependant on the viewer. Offhand vs. Primary There are a couple of misnomers about offhand weapons I'll try to clear up.a) your offhand is completely independant of your primary hand. Your offhand gets the chance to swing as soon as the delay on the weapon is done. If you have a 20 delay off hand weapon (2.0 second delay time) every 2.0 seconds the game checks to see if you successfully dual-wield. If you do, the swing goes through.  This can be checked by putting a very slow weapon in your primary hand and fast weapon off hand.  (make sure they are of differnt types 1hb &amp; 1hs for instance so you can tell the hits apart)-- You will occasionally see more than 2 swing&amp;Hit combos from your offhand before your primary hand recycles.b) Damage bonus only applies to primary hand. If you want to do maximum damage you want that primary hand damage bonus to be used as often as possible. This means take advantage of your weapons speed and put your fastest weapon in your primary hand.  (low delay) --favor delay over ratio. This is why weapons like Defiance or Lamentation, Jace Mace, etc are so highly prized as a primary hand weapon. On the otherhand, offhand you want the most damage in the fewest strikes-- in otherwords the offhand is purely about damage ratio. Here you can ignore the delay and just go for ratio. Weapons like Long Sword of Ethreal Energy 21/29 effectivly most of the time or a Wurmslayer 25/40 make good choices for offhand due to a favorable ratio. 1H vs 2h With the advent of weapons like the Windblade (52/40?!) 2hs has become all in vogue again. These weapons hit HARD and yield some impressive damage, and even more impressive criticals. There was a time when almost 2h weapon would outdamage a good pair of 1h weapons--this is no longer the case especially for main tanks. Your main tank is going to do a lot of reposte damage-- remember that reposte is a single hit-- a reposte on a 5/14 weapon will be just that-- a strike from a 5 damage weapon-- it is completly independant of the weapons delay so you might want to make that reposte strike count--this is where 2H weapons really shine. If you can re-strike for 300 damage on a reposte even 5% of the time, this is very impressive damage. On the otherhand, with 1h weapon you have a large number of hits that will be more likely to interrupt a caster--but you'll also be higher agro.Other things to consider: 2H weapons tend to proc about twice as often as 1H weapons. If you have an effect you really want to land (Slow, tash, etc) you may be better off with a 2h weapon that procs that effect. Speed There is a finite limit to how fast a weapon will swing. No matter how much haste you have it isn't possible to get an effective delay lower than 8. Even a 11 delay weapon (Efreeti Standard) wont go much below 8 delay. Remember too that delay/10 equals time between attacks in seconds (discounting dual wield) 25 delay=2.5 seconds, 40 delay 4.0 seconds. Haste I could write a whole chapter just on haste. I'll try to go into a little detail here however:#1. There are 4 kinds of haste: Bardsong, Spell, Item, Discipline. You can have one of each of those effects but only the greatest total haste of each of those will be in effect at any given moment. Spell Haste: Requires a buff slot--can be cast from a right-click item (Eyepatch of Plunder, Dark Cloak of the Sky) or an Enchanter/Beastlord/Shaman Haste (Visions of Grandeur, Celerity, etc) These will show as a buff. Maximum haste here is about 80% with Speed of Valon I belive.Item Haste: A property of some equipment, this haste is dependant on the  effect itself. I've heard a rumor that there is an item out there with 46% haste, but not seen that yet. best I've ever heard of is 41% but these all drop off of major mobs we can't take yet. 40% haste is on par with the Rogue and Ranger epic. Note that ONLY the highest haste you have on applies. Silver Chitin Handwraps (22% haste) dont apply their haste if you're wearing a Cloak of Flames (36% haste)--you'lll only get the CoF haste.[b]Bardsong HasteBard song haste takes a buff slot just like spell haste, but fills a seperate slot. There are a very few items that grant bardsong haste (Monk Epic comes to mind) There are also some specialized abilities (Nature's Fury --ranger pop AA also uses Bardsong haste) [b]Discipline HasteThe only example I know of for this is one of the Rogue disciplines.[br]Now--in addition to these hastes there is a level based haste cap. For a level 60 that cap is 100%. For a level 65 I belive that it is 110%. There are some spells/songs/abilities that will exceed the haste cap  by as much as 15% for your level (lvl 60 haste  100+15=115% haste, or 125% haste at level 65)[br][br]It is also important to note that Haste % does NOT refer to the delay reduction-- haste precentage refers to an added number of swings per unit time. Thus with 100% haste you'd hit an extra 100% from your base. (Thus doubling your melee output) This is NOT the same as a 100% reduction in delay (which would yield a 0 second round)[br][br]There is one other specialized case of haste I didn't mention-- Quiver haste. Quivers add haste to bow damage equal to Weight reduction % divided by 3. A fleeting quiver (60% weight reduction) provides 20% haste when using  a bow and stacks with all other haste.--to be continued [b]Attack Rating That mysterious attack value is kind of hard to determine the actual value of however, it roughly works like this. This value is determined by your skill with your primary hand weapon, your offense skill, your strength and any attack buffs. (Avatar, Call of the Predator, Torrent of Hate, etc) This number affects your chance to hit a given mob, and your average damage per hit.  It will not affect your max hit, but you will hit less often with lower skill.  Strength Pretty much goes straight to your attack skill. I belive you actually will get higher max damage with higher strength (compared to adding 20 points of attack which only yields higher avg damage.   Dexterity This affects your ability to critical with a bow, as well as how often your weapons will Proc. While the proc rate is rarely particularly significant to total DPS (unless  you're talking about a 600 pt nuke or a Tash or Slow proc) the taunt factor of weapon proc may be more of an issue.  Damage Tables Fact of the game is that you do more damage as you get higher in level. Part of this is due to the way damage scales. A 14 damage weapon on two characters with identical Attack raitings will not land for the same amount depending on the class of the wielder. A rogue or Monk will generally land a harder blow than a Ranger or Warrior. A monk of 55 will not hit as hard as a monk of 60 even if they had identical gear &amp; attack raitings.   Dual Wield/Double Attack There are several considerations to this. Remember first that even with 250 Dual Wield you're only hitting with your off hand about 66% of the time. Your second attack on that off hand is more like 33% of the time. This means that damage in that offhand is not nearly as significant as damage from your primary hand.  You also need to consider the effects of  Damage shields-- you would much rather hit a mob 2 times for 120 damage each than 8 times for 30 damage each when that mob has a 30 point damage shield.  (Of course the cleric healing DS  will make the reverse true.)  Special Attacks The single largest factor in the damage output of Rogues over other classes is their backstab. This can only be done with a piercing weapon in the primary hand, so please figure that into your damage calculations. Monks do more damage with flying kick/tail rake (especially compared to the pathetic Kick skills of say a ranger (woohoo 27 damage!)  Parsing Finally you need to log several of your fights (the more the better)  (/log on) and then download a good program like EQCompanion. Run your logs through the parser-- --do some experimentation --try different weapon combos, you might be suprised at the result. [br][br]Example: I found that my Revultant Whip (5/14) was a fantastic damage dealer when soloing. My primary hand damage bonus more than made up for the otherwise minimal damage. This immediatly changes as soon as I am grouping with an Enchanter or Shaman. Throw in a haste along with 40% epic haste, and I'm hitting that 8 delay cap. I can't swing the whip any faster, so that extra haste is wasted. On the other hand, wielding a slower weapon in my primary hand (Scimitar of the Emerald Dawn 20/34) I never hit my haste cap and tend to do much more damage. (made a difference of about 9 DPS with Celerity) I also took far less damage than with Revultant whip because the repostes weren't hitting me every few seconds.<br />

It doesn't account for very high strengths and attack ratings, but you'd be suprised how close is it after you run through all the calculations and probabilities including double attack, to hit chance, max hit, etc.<br />

Looks good. Can't wait for the aggro discussion. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drunia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some notes on haste. Bard haste songs SHOULD stack, check Thott's writings at afterlifeguild, he has an a lot of math there. But only two (might be three with PoP now) bard songs stack with spell haste. Often bard songs have other components to them which is why the buff stays up even though haste isn't being applied. Note that those two songs allow you to exceed the haste cap. One is by 5% and one is by 25% (goes to check lucy) and yep,third one now, by 35%. Monk epic effect is spell haste (this is why you won't see monks with eyepatch). Monks and rogues both have haste discs that stack with all haste in the game.  Max chanter haste spell is 68% at level 65. I think guardian of the forst was the AA you were talking about for rangers that adds haste. Anyone who wants to know to get really sick of reading about haste check monkly business. Monks are haste freaks, hehe. <br />
<br />
Looks good so far though. Going to discuss AC soft-caps at all? And when to start going +hp items? Talk about differences between plate and chain classes as tanks?</div></div><hr />

Doesn't DEX play more of a role for bow use, though ? I understand it pretty much subs for STR where archery is concerned.<br />

I''ll second the idea of posting the final version here, BTW. :-)</div></div><hr />

Wondering how sure you are about this. I have never tried to parse it myself. I have however seen reports that dispute this common thought. Some people who usually are very accurate in parsing said there was no such limit. Unfortunately I can't find the threads at this time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ghostwise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh yes, another question - the manual (I've been re-reading it when I bought the Gold Edition) states under Dexterity that a high score affects &quot;time between attacks&quot;.<br />

max damage = [wpndmg+bonus]*[(skill+str)/100]<br />
<br />
I think the formula for this is actually closer to:<br />
<br />
WeaponDamage*[(STR+Skill+Level)/100]+DamageBonus<br />
<br />
I say that because the formula above would predict max damage for Earthcaller at 60 with max STR and skill as follows:<br />
<br />
(14+11)[(250+255)/100] =<br />
25(5.05) =<br />
126 and change<br />
<br />
We all know that max damage for EC at level 60 is around 91:<br />
<br />
14[(255+250+60)/100]+11 =<br />
14(5.65)+11 = 90.1<br />
<br />
EDIT: almost forgot -- I have hit for 11 with the primary hand many times with a damage bonus of 11. I believe the damage bonus is still applied even to hits that are completely mitigated (i.e., a &quot;hit&quot; for zero damage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Crimsonsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">also nitpick on the wurmy in main hand only... id love to dual wield those babies :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tyga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Originally posted by Ghostwise <br />
 states under Dexterity that a high score affects &quot;time between attacks&quot;. <br />
<br />
Been wondering about the stats myself. So I looked in the book and sure enough thats what it says. Has anyone parsed it? I have noticed that there is little if any diffrence from about 130 dex to 250. I do parse my DPS and I can't tell any diffrence. Even bow crits are not increased. Below 120 the diffrence is very noticable.<br />
<br />
This make me wonder. When my CHR is over 120 I get the best prices from vendors. Making it 200 I still get the same price. Perhaps DEX, STA, AGI and STR work in a similar fashion. Other than the added AC for AGI, HPs for STA and carring ability for STR it may not make a diffrence once the stat is over 120.<br />
<br />
Need to test the DEX effect on time between attacks though.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
Ghak!!!... sorry the guide is sweet :) Can't wait for more.</div></div><hr />
