<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For what it's worth, even though I've cancelled, along with a great many other folks here, I still think I'm entitled to have an opinion and speak about a class I put over 5 years into.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to ask about the shaman class now though.  I've already said and tried enough there, and said my good-byes to those I wanted to send 'em to.<br />
<br />
What I want to ask about is MMORPG loyalty.  Those shaman still playing EQ who haven't cancelled yet... why do you still play?  Why do you log in?<br />
<br />
Do you enjoy EQ and still have things there that you truly like and want to do, like camping quest drops, or raiding, or whatever?  Is it the actual game that you log in for?<br />
<br />
Or is it the people that you've met and gotten to know?  And how strong are the bonds that cause you to log in and play with those folks?<br />
<br />
EQ can last years based on folks logging in because of that &quot;well, I know lots of folks&quot; comfort factor alone.  But how many old-timers out there, as this game has matured, feel it's the same game and the same closeness of players as we remember?<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to make any point or champion any sides or justify anything to anyone here.  I only want to ask that question.  Why do you log in to EQ vs. any other MMORPG?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Been playing since day one of release.  I find the game fun and still challenging.  I have forged a number of relations ships and met several people, some from other countries, whom I call friends.  I like to do the quest and be with my guild when we conquer something new or attain a goal.  I still get the same feeling as I did in day one.  No comfort factor here.  Just fun factor.  I've tried several other games on the side and I couldn't find one, in my opinion, that had the ease or comfort for controls as eq.  Just my 2cents worth.<br />

<br />
Funny today though...my face is no longer numb from the slaping SoE has been putting us through...my accounts are canceled and a huge weight has been lifted off me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How ironic that you started this thread tonight Ciccero.<br />
<br />
When I got home from work at 5:30 pst, I came here to peruse news from Glo on the summit.  And landed in an implosion.  Tuesday is a raiding night for my guild, and after reading quickly what I could, I logged into Mith Marr.<br />
<br />
During the 3 hours of raiding tonight ... here are my conclusions.<br />
<br />
I am going to take charge of my EQ life.  $12.95 a month is not a lot of money for me to spend on a habit.  One movie with popcorn and a drink costs me that much. <br />
<br />
I will not be buying OoW nor any other expansions that come from the <br />
current EQ development team. It is my decision.  <br />
<br />
I will continue to hunt with my guild, in the content that is currently available.  Yes I am EP flagged, and yes I have triple-digit aa's.  I will make do with what is presently available to me ... because I find I can out-wait EQ.<br />
<br />
And during this waiting period, I will voice my frustrations on how SoE has slain Lorianna.  To the many friends I have made over the past 5 years, I will politely voice my concerns.  I will not be part of the uber raiding scenario they are presenting.  <br />
<br />
An excerpt from Brenlo ....<br />
<br />
...&quot;Be angry at the situation, be angry at me and Rytan and SOE, but don't destroy yourselves from within.&quot; <br />
<br />
Truer words were never spoken.  I won't destroy myself, and I will stay &quot;in&quot; .... I will pay $12.95 a month to be a fly in the soup until WoW is released and it is time for me to go.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been playing since Beta2.   I stayed playing because of the friends I have/had in the game.  However since most of them have quit in disgust lately I pretty much play to PL my other characters and try to get them loot.  However since SOE has made nearly all decent loot  only achievable via raiding (and multiple alts aren't allowed to loot in my guild) I'm pretty much running out of content (note: I've duo'd my way all the way through Barindu to try for loot for my alts:  more random drops please!)<br />
<br />
   I have 2 accounts and 3 level 65's, 4 level 60+'s and the rest are all 50+.   Once I finish the content I can sucessfully duo I'll probably quit.  The team of friends that I won the Ikkz trials with has pretty much quit so I don't have many options for entertainment besides being a spot healer and buff bot during raids (playing my 65 enc a bit more lately).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have played everquest for about three years now.  Around two and a half I have played my shaman and I still enjoy playing him to this day.<br />
<br />
For the most part the friends that I have all played with for years have all quit recently but I still enjoy the game and advancing with my current guild. <br />
I did quit for a while, and I found the break to do me a lot of good as far as the enjoyment of the game.  For the most part I take what is said on this board with a grain of salt as I feel that I can really do anything with my shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did just end billing and have till Aug to keep playing.<br />
<br />
I don't have guild and friends as a reason to stay since my position as a Shaman was easily taken from me by the alt of an officer in the guild.  Granted that has more to do with guild politics than game mechanics but if I was playing another class where I could have added DPS or Healing, being shunted to number 3 or 4 Shaman would not have hurt my pride so much.<br />
<br />
I think that I still play because as Lori said $12.95 ain't much to pay for entertainment.  It also keeps me out of the bars.<br />
<br />
I am just spending my time waiting on EQII or maybe another title.  Won't play WoW cuz I don't like ass-ears on Elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As much as I would like to say that I still play my shaman in hopes of a brighter tomorrow I'd be lying to both myself and anyone that reads this.<br />
<br />
The truth is that I still play my shaman once in awhile, but when I do its to take some high 50's low 60 guildmates through an adventure cause they are afraid to go without a slower and couldnt find one.  I still log Thor in to buff guildmates if they need it.  I make a great powerleveler, and so Im constantly getting asked by guilmates to help PL thier alts (speaking of which...Berzerkers need help...now.  they suck really bad)<br />
<br />
Noticing a trend here?  All my level 65 guildmates dont need me around when they go exploring in GoD.  We have gotten about 5 new 65 level Beastlords in the last 2 months, and they are constantly busy.  Sometimes I get a consolation invite if they have enough other DPS classes to compensate for my dead weight.  I dont raid with my guild anymore because raiding with a shaman is like jumping face first into a barrel of broken glass but they love me to come and do the initial buffing, so the other shaman (if there is one, we all feel inda this way) can save their MGB for later.<br />
<br />
I duo in occasion with a SK friend of mine.  I can keep him healed because hes elemental geared, and can take a tremendous beating before he needs my help.  He can also heal himself for over 1K with crit taps and does it all damn time.  These groups are becoming rarer as well, as he was marginalized as a tank in GoD too.  (On the upside, his bard swarming with my wizard PBAEing is FUN FUN FUN).<br />
<br />
Those are the reasons that I still log in Thorzion.  Habit, some strange sense of obligation to help my guild and a weak sense of 'something better might come along one day'.<br />
<br />
man, thats dperessing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Been playing EQ for 4 1/2 years, 3 of them as a shaman and recently changed servers 'cause all my buddies on my old server quit. I still find the game enjoyable. Granted, I've never been in a top tier guild so I experience certain zones a year or 2 or 3 later than those &quot;on the edge.&quot; I figure any bugs in the new stuff will be worked out by the time I get to it. I play other things as well (City of Heroes is just plain fun) but EQ will always have space on my hard drive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lorianna = grace in defeat.  Your post made me think of some noble creature being pulled down by creepy little goblins.<br />
<br />
Thorizon... same thing with the SK tank.  *grin*  <br />
<br />
I know your question was directed more toward those still playing, but since I'm on the edge of turning the account back on every day, I'll throw out my $.02<br />
<br />
There was some magic combination of factors to old EQ that just got my adrenaline pumping.  It had to do with the variety and effectiveness of my spells, when used well.  It was related to the danger in old dungeons.  And yes, much as I hate to admit it, it had to do with the penalties of dying (maybe I'm just not as invested in staying alive when corpse recovery isn't involved).  This was the video-game attraction of EQ.<br />
<br />
The IRC [chatting] appeal of EQ is still there.  I think I'm a 50% video game 50% socialization EQ player.  With the video game appeal of the game being gone, the social aspect alone just isn't quite enough.  I tried just sitting and tradeskilling and chatting to keep entertained, but it bored me silly (that and people get distracted from your conversation by having to cast spells and stuff.  *pfft*)<br />
<br />
I think what kept me playing so long, and the reason I still want to go back - really boils down to something the game no longer has to offer my shaman.  Maybe I should take some alts and play in older content that I didn't see in as much detail.<br />
<br />
It's a great question, though.  And probably something I'd be better off thinking about than the state of the shaman, which will just reduce me to fits of unseemly fury.  *laugh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have good RL friend that plays EQ.  I always make good friends in whatever MMORPG I play (I've only played biggies and for 1+ year at a time).  Except for my latest/2nd run with EQ, I've always been in and/or lead a guild.<br />
<br />
For me, none of the above can keep me in a MMORPG, or any game, if the game is not fun.  For me, playing games is all about fun.  Right now, for tons of reasons, none of which include the state of shaman (I enjoy mine), I find EQ to simply be not fun.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to trying some of the upcoming MMORPGs, like WoW, EQ2, then Vanguard and Tabula Rasa - all of those look promising.  I just wish they would release NOW because I really enjoy a good MMORPG and there aren't any around now that I want to play anymore.  The only MMORPGs I consider worth playing are EQ, AC1, and DAoC - and I've played em all enough.</div></div><hr />
