<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it was me, here's what I would do:<br />
<br />
Ditch the wis rings, replace them with 5 ac 30hp 30 mana rings.<br />
<br />
Replace the Chok spaulders with an Obulus Death Shroud (may come out ahead plat-wise by doing this).<br />
<br />
If possible, replace Jar bracer with Sentry bracer (tons of good stats on those, with solid ac too).<br />
<br />
JB gaunts.<br />
<br />
Results: AC raw gain of 23....Wis Loss of 19 (the 20 mana from the gloves is almost negated by the 15 mana on the sentry bracer, not to mention the mana from the rings themselves).<br />
<br />
If doing the above makes you take more of a wis hit than you want, replace the JB helm (click is damn near useless anyways) with a totemic helm.  This would bring it to:<br />
<br />
AC raw gain of 17, wis loss of 14.<br />
<br />
And Let's not forget the 60 extra hp's from the ring : )<br />
<br />
It's really up to you, but your ac isn't too bad.  At 42, with no shield (trying to convert back to piercing, so Im 2h blunt), Im at 804 unbuffed...so you are really close to what I think would be target ac.<br />
<br />
Also, I never realized the Jarsath legs were so good...gonna have to nab me a pair of those the next time Im out that way....<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shamolite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what i saw on your profile your atk appears to be pretty low. as mine at level 40 is over 600 with piercing skill maxed using same weapon. How is your defence skill is it maxed out, if not migh want to consider this as that will also raise your ac</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tagnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for suggestions I am going to go with the 6ac/65hp rings and start looking for a better BP.  i have JB gloves but just use to buff since i think that 20hp is better than 2 raw ac but hey hehe I am thinking i will go to maidens eye and try to get some of the stuff that drops there like the shrouded thing and hopefully a divine insperation.  Defense isnt maxed pretty close but not maxed yet.  Thanks for the help guys <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dublizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, this may seem like a stupid question to many of you, but I have to ask: Why do so many shamans dismiss wis nowadays?<br />
<br />
I understood this when there was a 200 wis cap, but that no longer exists. So, why not max out wis? I am an iksar shaman, lvl 54, and I spend most of my time in groups. I need mana to slow and buff, and I have aimed for the maximum wis and mana gear possible while still maintaining decent AC.  I have a full suit of iksar hate gear and seem to do just fine, though of course I'd love a fungi if I could afford it.<br />
<br />
I seem to be doing fine with this approach. My shaman is much, much more powerful than my lvl 54 paladin. I don't understand the ac shaman concept at all. Does it only apply to people who like to solo and have a fungi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Originally posted by Dublizard <br />

<br />
Because Kunark changed everything.<br />
<br />
The primary function of shamans 51+ is slowing and debuffing. Slow, etc. gets you aggroed and beat on, for which you need AC to take less damage. Not only does the protected HP keep you alive longer, it is also a reserve of mana using Cann. Thus, a shaman with WIS that a cleric or druid would laugh at can function very effectively, provided they are playing like shamans and not trying to be a cleric or druid.<br />
<br />
The change to the INT/WIS cap is merely icing on the cake for high-level shamans whose gear gives them a lot of AC and WIS.<br />
<br />
But, as an iksar, this does not concern you. You get get &quot;AC and WIS&quot; as a racial advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dublizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm, well it seems to me that I have plenty of HPs to withstand a few hits until the tanks get mobs off of me again. <br />
<br />
Does the extra HPs, taking cann into account, give a shaman more mana than maxed-out WIS? It seems to me that that is the heart of the issue here.<br />
<br />
Again, I do not have a fungi, so perhaps I do not see the full brilliance of the HP style. But I do cann a lot now that I have cann 3. As an Iksar I of course do have natural regen and I often cast regen and bear form, which gets my HP bar moving quite quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you dont want to solo one big Mob it doesnt really matter how much Mana you have. In a good group you shouldnt use more mana then you can get back through medding/cannidance. So it doesnt matter How much mana you have, but it matters how quick you can refill it. If you want to kick something big then i think youll play mroe like a druid so you Root/Rot, then a lot of Mana is good.<br />
<br />
Okay hope thats right :) I always go for AC/HP cause i think it doesnt really matter how much mana you have. If you can cast 5 Heals in a row it should always do it in Exp Groups. And as more Hp/Ac you have as faster you are able to canni the Mana back. And you dont jave to be afraid of getting aggro.<br />

<br />
If having hit points is good, losing fewer of them when you get hit is better. That's the basic idea of the AC argument. Since we have Cann, total mana isn't as important as mana recovery, which is greatly enhanced with HP regen (even just regular old Regrowth spell).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps it's just me and the small, ragtag groups I frequent, but it seems as though, for a caster, I get hit a lot. Between the aggro from slows/DoTs, and deliberately pulling things out of the fray to root park them (I do this every chance I get), it's not uncommon for me to lose half my hit points when fighting a few MOBs.<br />
<br />
If you always group with an Enchanter (for crowd control) and some awesome-taunting tanks, AC might not be as big a deal for you.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is that I actually notice my small mana pool more when soloing rather than when grouped. When I'm soloing, get an add, and run out of mana, that's it: all I can do is try to root and med. When grouped, there's likely someone else to heal, deal damage, root, etc., or I can just get a mana dump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dublizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks for the input. Perhaps I am better suited to solo right now than group, which is what I usually do. If so, perhaps I should go the AC route.</div></div><hr />

Wisdom is good, noone is saying wisdom is bad... BUT... wisdom for us (with the vast boon that is cannibalizing) is generally not nearly as important as it is to joe dr00d who cant get mana back anyway but sitting(which they may or may not be able to do in certain situations, we can recover mana even while standing).<br />
<br />
Me? I try to find a healthy balance of the 2, but REFUSE to wear a wisdom item that doesnt confer something decent to either my HPS or AC either. 6ac 65hps rings are wonderful.. thats more mana to cann, and more ac and hps to take hits(like when you land PoI on a spite golem and end up being the main tank on it till it dies.. fun!!) I recently switched over to my hps+ac philosophy, and am a total fanatic now(particularly with the increased aggro adding disease counters to slows seems to have done).<br />
<br />
It may be mostly cause of my roll in my group.. Im slower/haster/buffer/healer and crowd control all rolled into one heh. hps+ac rocks for CC.<br />
<br />
PS to original poster= man work on your combat skills.. that atk is sad.. dont you feel bad when you cant even melee down a greenie hehe /tease ;)</div></div><hr />
