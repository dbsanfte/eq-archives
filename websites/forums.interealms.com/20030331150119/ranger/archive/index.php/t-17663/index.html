<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Olander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where can I find a good run down on things?  The zones, this &quot;tagging thing everyone talks about, quests and the lot.<br />
<br />
Just a good overall review would be nice.<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm, good question.  I've never seen a site devoted to just this, I normally just read random threads about it and also hear about it from guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Plane of Justice trials flag you for Plane of Valor and Plane of Storms.  Normally everyone does the exe(ecution) trial because it's the easiest.  However, you need to be at least 60 to find a group normally.  You could do it at 59 possibly, but it'd greatly reduce the chances.  <br />
<br />
Most flags are done by killing boss mobs. <br />
<br />
Grummus in PoDisease flags for Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
Maze quest in PoNightmare flags for Crypt of Terris Thule<br />
<br />
AD in PoValor flags for HoH.<br />
<br />
However, there are quests that can get you flagged for each of these zones also.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Collect 4 items from named mobs in PoDisease to get flagged for CoDecay<br />
<br />
Complete some long, boring, difficult quest for HoH flag<br />
<br />
Kill a couple named giants and get a loot from each of the 3 giant factions (normal mobs) to get flagged for Bastion of Thunder.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think there was a thread that told each of the flags, so you might want to do a search for it.</div></div><hr />
