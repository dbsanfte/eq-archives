<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">JK of course but got your attention.  Since we have 10 Hot key spots , 8 for spells, 2 for whatever.  How hard would it be to change so we could mem 10 spells at a time?  I am not a programmer but with the addition of everything else they put in/fix, would this be a difficult thing?  I know I would love to Have 2 more spells at once mem'd.  Just a thought...back to your normally scheduled forums posts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cause we've had the same amount of buffs as 5 years ago.  Same with buff box slots.  Oh wait...we don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">People have been asking for more spells gems for years, it's been suggested as an AA, and other methods.  I just don't see it happening</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if it was easy to do I'm sure they'd do it sooner or later if only to get us to buy some LoY type low-lvl expansion. Maybe it's a huge pain to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have never put spells in my hotkey window. The space there is too valuable to waste a slot by duplication. I already have more clickies, hotkey abilities, and shortcut hotkeys than fits on the first page. I have a page of hotkeys dedicated only for AA abilities. I'm pretty good at the old SHIFT + 3 + ## to activate AA abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't want more gems - i want less things that I need to click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's not that they can't add more spell gems, fact is they wont.  Verant/Sony saw it as unbalancing or whatever.  This topic came up before Kunark was released, and Absor clearly said No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, Absor isn't the final word on it.<br />
<br />
Hell, they have it as an ability in the RPG, why not have it here too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would really like a working computer so i could worry about how many spellgems i have. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So getting to mem 2 more spells magically makes me able to heal well enough to serve as a main healer in elementals?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">10 gems would be nice.  I think they keep it at 8 to make spells memmed impact strategy.  For a shaman it's a pain because we have so many types of spells and so many spells period.  I don't find it as much of a hassle with my nonshaman spellcasting alts.<br />
<br />
I tend to keep a lot of spells hotkeyed even though I could cast them with alt+#, simply because that's how I started doing it as a young shaman before I needed more hotkey space and because I don't like having to hold down the alt key to cast.  I keep my AA hotkeys on a seperate page and I don't have enough clickies to worry about it.<br />
<br />
So getting to mem 2 more spells magically makes me able to heal well enough to serve as a main healer in elementals?<br />
<br />
Why should a shaman be able to be main healer in the elementals?  Should all priest be equal?  Should shaman get stronger heals and druids and clerics get shaman abilities too?  Could a druid be the main healer in elementals without a slower?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I want it so when you have to switch memmed spells that its less of a tedious task. Like having to mem a cure or a regen then having to demem it once its cast. Really annoying and tedious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They should at least create a second bank of gems for non-hit point or mana increasing buffs to save the swap time.</div></div><hr />
