<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone has tried the Seru guards and how they got along.  I trashed my faction with Katta a long time ago and regreat it now because I would love to do the quest for the Shield of Bane Warding.  Are there any quests like this I would miss out on with bad Seru faction, or any other reasons you may know of not to kill the guards here.   I checked on Allah and did not see any reason not to kill them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Although I have not hunted in Sanctus Seru myself, I have spent a lot of time there and I have several friends who have killed in SS to raise thier Katta faction and for some exp.  I spent a lot of time talking to NPC's in SS and there only seems to be a few quests there.  The only quests I have found are lower level stuff and are pretty easy, such as all the Lightcrawler Armor.  Shield of Bane Warding is a lot better than any quests that I know of in SS.  I would say start killin in SS and get yer Katta faction back up and go for the SoBW instead.  Just my 2 cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually in Seru there is a really nice earring quest. 1st part you can do solo, second you need a partner to invis you for the chest. 3rd part you need a raid force for. In the end the earring is used as the key to gain entry into Seru's chamber. Its a pretty good quest if you can finish the 3rd earring. But will take along time since the reports are a rare drop.</div></div><hr />
