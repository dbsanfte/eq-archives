Township Rebellion officers got caught selling guildbank loot on Ebay for massive amounts of cash. Glad I'm not on Stormhammer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not the first Uber Guild on a server this has happened to.<br />
<br />
How do you think some of these officers in an Uber guild can afford to sit at home, not work &amp; play EQ all day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Happens in alot of guilds, happened in at least 4 top guilds on povar/xev. its what happens when you get punks together. Of course, if I mentioned anything anti-uber guild I get hammered on this board, so, umm, It is really cool they do this I think, ya.<br />
<br />

mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there are *******s everywhere .. even leading uberguilds on stormhammer seems like</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is why I am glad our guild bank only has junk no one wants :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe your guildbank only has junk because someone is selling it on E-bay...<br />
<br />
just my 2cp =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only guild I was in that was even close to uber, prolly 3rd or 4th guild on xev at the time, I joined because people seemed realy nice and laid back.<br />
<br />
Well, sure enough, problems arose when it was found out some people were ebaying stuff they got with guild's help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some people just have no life. How much you wanna bet this is the norm rather then the exception? How else can people play EQ 20 hours a day everyday unless they are rich/trust baby? Organize a few raids a week, could probably make as much real money as some people make working. Wanna ebay, I have no problems with that, but should do the work yourself.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh, some a-hole names mentioned from a couple people's posts, I recognize from Fennin/Druzzil.   Always has been, always will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kenguror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">personally id hire a lawyer. im sure there is a paper trail a mile long supporting a case. gee i wonder what a shammies hourly wage should be?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what would be your case?  You gave nothing but in game funds (code stored on VI's server) to someone else to hold for safe keeping.  They turned around and sold it.  NOTHING illegal about that (granted they are asswholes for doing it, but...)<br />
The guild officers didn't sign a contract (not that it would matter anyway) and they weren't given anything that was really owned by a private party.  The only people that have a case (a VEEERY small case) is maybe SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kenguror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">case in point..<br />
me an say 10 buddies like comic books..we decide to pull our collections together for mutual enjoyment. we gave these to freddie  &quot;to hold for safe keeping&quot;. occasionally we work out a deal where we will sell some to buy more for our mutual satisfaction. one day we go ta freddies house only to find that there r no comics.. hes sold them. do we have a case?<br />
there r generally &quot;verbal&quot; contracts in this game. i say &quot;verbal&quot; because all is typed.<br />
all im saying is that when in game resources where converted to cool hard cash it entered the realm of real life. and in RL anything can be litigated.<br />
really i was just wondering what a shammies hourly wages should be) peace!</div></div><hr />
