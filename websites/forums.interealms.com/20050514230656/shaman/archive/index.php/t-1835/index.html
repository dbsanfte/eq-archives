<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">eh? Will it?<br />
<br />
Or do I need to be fully logged out to avoid it?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sort of, Krak.  I have heard of a number of instances where /q also caused a 1018 error.  If you get an error, your character may still read active to the server and take the faction hit even if you are offline.  If the battle is going well and you can camp out, I'd recommend that method over /q.  However, for the most part, /q will work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldnt /q to avoid a faction hit... If you take any damage while Linkdead, the game takes over your character just like an npc caster... it attacks and casts like a madman, and if by some chance your character while being controlled by the game's ai gets the killing blow, the corpse poofs.  If you dont want to take the faction hit, dont hunt there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">your safer camping out  when the mobs is getting low. better time it well though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We use /q all the time to dodge faction hits. We kill Tormax, Dain and Yelinak pretty regularly and there's always a few that don't want one of their faction hits. The worst is Tormax (we fight him at zone to Wakening so people can zone to avoid faction hit, rather than /q). After Tormax enrage is over, half the raid zones out. Poor melees get stuck with faction hit, or die cause their cleric zoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol you pull tormax all the way to WL? Hopefully the poor suckers banking know this is coming incase they are still scowling to tmax but ally to riff/zek (like me, grr /rude tormax)<br />
<br />
man thats a hell of a pull!</div></div><hr />

Only if the NPC in question is below level 55</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Killed Tormax at WL zone last night.  With the right amount of people to kill him, it's no problem to kill all the giants to him in a short amount of time.  Then the monk just says &quot;Tormax!&quot; and we all get in positions.  A minute or so later here he comes and we get busy.  It was my guild's first Tormax kill and aside from losing one MA (but not two thankfully) and a couple others to various aggro issues we pwned him.   Then again we're doing quite well at &quot;firsts&quot; having owned several NToV named first try earlier that week.  It's an exciting time to be a Rider, but it's even more satisfying to have worked up to that point rather than mercenary out to a guild already there.  <br />
<br />
I have used /quit at least ten times in the past month to avoid a faction hit.  My guild is still on CoV faction, tho we take assloads of -CoV hits.  We all kinda rotate who takes the hits and then hit Kael for whatever named are up after that.  <br />
<br />
A corpse poofing is a bug that will guarantee a GM restore, so I wouldn't worry bout it.  <br />
<br />
If you want an alternate way to avoid the faction hit it's really easy.  Spam Insidious Disease on the mob and be up close to it.  You'll die I guarantee.  Turn on attack for Enrage, that's another good way to die.  I don't prefer this method tho, cause I lose all my buffs.  /quit works much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've taken a faction hit when killing the Statue of Rallos Zek,  I went LD when Statue was at 30%, I logged back in after he was dead, but I was now KoS to all the giants (was indifferent before).  But normally this doesn't happen, but it can rarely happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes we warn the zone several times that we are pulling Tormax to WL before we do it. Anyone that dies gets a res from us anyway.<br />
<br />
That  bugger keeps spawning at about 4am though lately, so Asians have been getting him more than us lately. We've had to resort to killing 7 Dains in 3 days for our fix of Velious kings. Curse that stupid shawl quest, I'm so sick of Dains right now.</div></div><hr />
