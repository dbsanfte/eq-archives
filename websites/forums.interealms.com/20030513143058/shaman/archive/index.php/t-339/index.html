<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since CT got upgraded to a high level zone, does the Helm still require a Ogreskin Chamois? I have not yet been in CT, but how does someone level 30-40 get one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It should now drop just outside the entrance to Cazic-Thule. I saw a Lizard Page out there yesterday and killed him just for kicks, to see if he'd drop the Chamois. He didn't, but I would assume that after a killing a few of them you'll get it. I wouldn't go there solo - in old CT you could single pull a Page but, unless they wander around the island there sometimes, you're going to get a few lizards as adds.</div></div><hr />
