<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gallaena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a fungi tunic on my monk twink (lvl 41) and duo almost exclusively with a cleric or shaman played by a RL friend. I recently dusted off my 54 shaman - having a blast.<br />
<br />
I currently have a rubicite BP and a new JBB on the shaman. I have been PLing my RL friend's shaman recently with my shaman. My RL friend's shaman is 43 as of last night. We have saved up almost enough money to buy her shaman a JBB. With that in mind...<br />
<br />
Scenerio #1:<br />
Should I move my fungi to my shaman and give her shaman my rubi bp. This will allow me to be more effective soloing. By giving her the rubi, she can canni more effectively. She could play her shaman (42) or cleric (38) with my monk.<br />
<br />
Scenerio #2:<br />
Keep fungi on monk.<br />
<br />
Scenerio #3:<br />
Keep fungi on monk and buy the cheapest horse for the shaman, thus allowing her to med and fire jbb concurrently.<br />
<br />
My thought is that the fungi is wasted on the monk as she is grouped with a shaman or a cleric most of the time. With the fungi on my shaman, I would get double regrowth.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Even if the monk is always gouped with a shaman, removing the fungi would cause the shaman to have to heal more, thereby making the duoing less effective. The less the shaman has to heal in monk/shaman teams the better. More mana for buffs and slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The better question is &quot;Which char do you plan to play the most?&quot;<br />
<br />
A fungified monk is very powerful.  So is a fungified shaman.  If you plan to duo most of the time with yer lower chars, I'd put the fungi on the monk, hand the rubi bp to the shaman, and have some fun.  That way you are maximizing the regen on the GROUP.  Rubi bp is what, 5 extra regen?  That will definitely help out the shaman.  Not as much as the fungi, but it will help.  <br />

Btw, Gothlips.  Wow whatta sig.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I guess I'm just referring to the sig-nerf-happy mods on these boards.  I had to go thru about 5 or 6 different sigs that all got nerfed till I had one that fit the specs.  Which are posted somewhere on page 2397 of one of the pages linked to Sunmoon's grandmother's poodle's manicurist's web designer's promotion page.  <br />
See the size on my sig?  Thats all the taller it can be.  Can be a lot wider tho.</div></div><hr />

A 9k horse will give 3 X the mana recovery rate of a 70k fungi tunic when hunting outside.</div></div><hr />

I had heard that you can med while standing with a horse but does it allow you to med through jbb blasts? I assumed this was a bug and would be fixed(nerfed)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In a strickly monk/shaman duo for exp, meaning no much damage is taken, leave the fungi on the monk, EXPECIALLY if the shaman has a JBB.<br />
<br />
Think of this as free regrowth on the monk, so the shaman can just JBB/can and maybe throw in a dot once in a while.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heya Galla, I was wondering when you'd find your way here. :) My advice would be to have the fungi on the monk so long as you're tossing out the jbb blasts. My lil warrior is 59 and whenever I 2-box with him he wears the fungi, just because I don't want too much duty if I'm botting Lor. That plus I'm rarely running oom anyway since I know what buffs he needs... (nother rant). <br />
<br />
really depends on what you'll be doing... if you're willing, you can swap off the iksar bp to the lower shaman whenever you're playing the monk and have a very solid duo there, which would enable you to save for a horse. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Quinan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I 2-box my shaman / monk combo, fungi always goes on the monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When I two box 60 monk and myself, 59 shaman, the shaman gets the fungi.  If the monk has the fungi, he won't take any damage if the thing is slowed.  However, he kills them so fast that i don't have enough time to med for another slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It kind of depends on where you plan to hunt, how well geared the monk is, and how much you like to canni. I'm a 56 shaman who duos with a 53 monk frequently. If you are keeping the pulls coming, the fungi will ALWAYS be benefiting the monk. In outdoor zones with horse, I've found that I am FM a lot, even with slows. When I am FM the fungi would not help me a bit. A horse is a huge bonus for outdoor zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have monk and shaman that i dual box, both similar levels. I have one fungi and it has always been on the monk as its most effective that way. Duoing I find that the shaman can maintain enough mana most of the time to constant kill with the monk. Add another fungi and the shaman would do added dmg to increase the kill rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just buy a second fungi so both can wear one you cheapskate ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hi, I have a semi-ubor 60 shammie, and 1/6 ubor 52 monk.  The monk wears the fungi, but mostly because my shaman is 60.  With torpor I don't really need it anymore...<br />
<br />
I don't know much about dual boxing, but I do know fungi is hella nice on a monk.  With a slowed mob, he wont need much healing with fungi, especially if you encourage him to mend.  Then again, fungi is nice for canni damage, couldnt live without it from 55-59, but seeing as though you have rubi bp, might as well distribute the resources evenly.  Monks can't wear rubicite, so by process of elimination, I would say reserve him fungi :D I'm like smart. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Shaman gets 15 hp a tick from fungi, turns it into 8 mana a tick.  Greater healing turns that 8 mana into 16 hps for the monk.  15 hp a tick on the monk from fungi, or 16 from the shaman healing him... which would you take?  That's the worse case scenario.<br />
<br />
Best case scenario is that the shaman uses the extra mana on his other, outrageously efficient spells like slow, haste, regen, and pet.<br />
<br />
Of course someone 2 boxing will put in on the monk, 99% of the time they aren't can dancing and the regen doesn't do them any good.</div></div><hr />
