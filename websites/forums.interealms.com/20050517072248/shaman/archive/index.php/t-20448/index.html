<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Starting to seem like we just got a drive by from SoE just to shut us up. Im not seeing discussion and interaction, which is really the only way everyone will be happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this the end of healing upgrades?<br />
Is more being looked at?<br />
If it is the end, why did you chose these numbers to settle on.<br />
What is the SoE vision for the shaman?<br />
<br />
More questions which can be answered with quick replies. I just hate grey area is all :(</div></div><hr />

The blast heal upgrade is good... but not really.  It is only 250 more than our previous one and still falls short of what is really needed.  <br />
<br />
The Q upgrade is nice as well..but 300...350, still pretty much is used to regain hp's from canni V.  350 doesn't really help much more than 300 when the mobs are hitting like they are.  <br />
<br />
I haven't been very far into GoD, but I can already see that my heals really aren't going to be of much use if things go really bad.  I can help someone stay alive maybe a little longer so the cleric has time to throw them a heal, but if a robe wearer gets any agro, they are dead before I can even hit them with anything it seems.  I don't think giving us an upgrade to 1800 or so would pose any threat to clerics for the main healing spot from what I have seen in elementals/GoD...and we can already cover healing in lesser places like BoT and most older content.  I think what they don't seem to understand is that for some older stuff where mobs are hitting for 400 or something like that and are fully slowable..we already can main heal with some ease.  If they are worried we will take over healing in PoV, too late.  <br />
<br />
All giving us an 1800 heal would do is make it so we could be a real backup healer in GoD..any place an 1800 heal would make us a main healer..we already are doing main healing there.  <br />
<br />
It seems to me that we were a buck fifty short for the ticket to ride GoD and they gave us 75 cents.. Thanks, but we are still short.</div></div><hr />
