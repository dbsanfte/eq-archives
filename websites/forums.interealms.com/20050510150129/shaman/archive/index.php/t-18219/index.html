<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree with about the fourth poster -- if WoW is as immersive as FFXI, there's a chance. I don't really think anyone will be a true n00b all over again as long as basic game mechanics are available for scrutiny, but all I want is the chance to play a good game and support a company that actually gives a rat's ass about it's players. No, that's not you Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good question.<br />
<br />
As one who has played only three MMORPG's (The Realm, EQ, DAOC in that order), I'll have to admit that I was &quot;in awe&quot; of the first two. The Realm was basically a graphical chat room. But the ability to not only play and chat online but to actually watch your character improve was fun. It did and still does have some down side, but it IS possible to do about everything in The Realm.<br />
<br />
EQ however was and is clearly head and shoulders above The Realm and I remember being as equally fascinated with EQ (early on) as I was with the novelty of The Realm. To this day there are still things about EQ that have an allure. Sadly what COULD have been never was with EQ.<br />
<br />
DAOC never really held my attention the way the other two did. It was always easier to log off DAOC than it was EQ.  The actual PvE is sorta boring in DAOC and don't get me started on TS's. Mass PvP is a lag fest and 1-1 PvP is a matter of having a buff bot.<br />
<br />
I would try Horizons, but will hold off and wait for others to continue the Beta testing. <br />
<br />
As someone wiser than me once said: &quot;There is always something to do in EQ.&quot; So very true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No,  Because now you have a context to judge from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes it can. I have already done it with some lower level alts in EQ. Once WoW comes out or even EQ2 ill do it again. Its all in the mindset you allow yourself to be in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kjell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the most entertaining part of the post is the fact that all the things that they feel ruined the wonderment of EQ are all the things that they as players pushed for at the time.<br />
<br />
Humanitys goal is to discover everything there is to discover and do everything there is to do, regardless of whether is is needed or has repercussions.  <br />
<br />
Personally I believe there will be another game that inspires the original EQ feelings again, but I think it will come from an unexpected source, people keep looking to the long line of EQ evolutionarys, but they are just shiney new clones, I cant see it coming from them, it needs to be revolutionary.<br />
<br />
I also look back at my first months in EQ with fondness, but if we really wanted to go back there we wouldnt twink and PL all our alts to essentially avoid that whole stage of the game, it was frustrating and often anoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sure it can happen again.  Diablo was just as gripping for me as EQ, for some months - but its MMP side was kind of skimpy and it wore off faster.<br />
<br />
EQ has had a remarkably long run for a game, but it's NOT the only game in town.  Don't look at the big-name games to be the next evolutionary step, though, it'll be some nothing company out of nowhere that comes up with a great concept and is bought out at just the right time by a sugar daddy with lots of money and a willingness to let them run with the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe WoW is going to be another clone of EQ for the most part, not allowing one to regain their innocence, and  I dont think once someone has played a game as in depth as EQ and with so many things, that the original innocence will ever be possible to gain again.  In other words, I dont think I will ever feel the same as I did the first couple of months of EQ.  It may still be fun and different, but it will never match up to 'the innocence'.  Still, I hope Im wrong.<br />
<br />
DAoC was a great game for a while, but it got old fast, especially when there just wasnt enough content, EQ drew me back because there is so much content now and I never felt the same as when I first played EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Provided that a new MMORPG is a new experience and has innovative ideas then yes &quot;MMORPG innocence&quot; can be regained. Kinda like asking if you play one action game you cannot play another. Yes it may not be entirely novel but if it can capture an experience then it will get my attention. However if the new mmorpgs are going to be based on everquest instead of seeing the formulas based behind everquest and basing ideas on that, then they won't be very successful in terms of capturing an audience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The problem with today's MMO games is the presence of all the information about the game online that isn't available in-game.  There is so much information available about quests, items, tactics, etc. that anyone not reading outside the game looks like a n00b.  Anyone that wades through all of the information has intimate details about how the 'engine' works and how to best use the system.<br />
<br />
Way back in the day, before there was an eqatlas.com or its equivalents (due to Beta NDA), just wandering through kithicor or greater fay was an adventure in itself.  It was a big deal when 989 put in the path textures.  Every game since has had some kind of in-game map showing you exactly where you are in the world, and Sony caved.  Not that this is a horrible thing, but it takes away the &quot;OMG, where the hell am I&quot; aspect.  The beastiaries and hunting guides that help you maximize your experience and loot gathering in order to defeat the treadmill remove the &quot;what will I run into now&quot; aspect.<br />
<br />
Gone are the days where your group actually adventures into a mythical part of the world based on a rumor of treasure or foul deeds being done.  Your guild does a quick check of camped characters, sees which raid target is up, and everyone rushes to kill it.  You head to POV or BOT, throw on LFG, and grind some experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, I think it can be regained, but I'm not sure WoW will do it. A friend of mine probably put it the most succinctly after we'd tried AO or DAoC and the majority of my small guild had quit playing after a few months - 'Maybe we're all just jaded with the whole MMOG genre.' I think that is the key point, as long as you're going into a new game with the same jaded view of 'oh, this is a bit better than EQ, oh but EQ did this much better' and the whole powerleveling to be teh bestest fastest with dual boxing et al, you're never going to regain that wonder. <br />
<br />

<br />
Right now I'm playing KotOR, and IMO its probably the best, most in-depth CRPG I've played since BG2. I'm pretty immersed, the whole lose track of time thing going on, etc. However, whenever my characters level up, for everyone but my main character I'm just letting the computer select skills and feats, and I'm not really worried about what equipment they may be wearing as long as they're wearing something. The story is pretty good, but I've played so many d20 games/clones that the mechanics are mind numbingly boring to me right now - I've become jaded to the genre. Its the same with MMOGs, except replace d20 with leveling treadmill type and add in the hook of chat.<br />
<br />
The next game to recapture the 'innocence' that EQ had in spring/summer of '99 FOR ME will have to make you forget you're on a leveling treadmill. That will be different for everyone though, I'd imagine the FoH chaps would be looking for new and different high end encounter types or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I started out my on line life in the Realm.  To me, being a total novice to the gaming life, The Realm was SOOOO Cool.  I went to EQ, and was even more so in Awe of the on line world of gaming.  To a certain extent, I still am.  But it has gotten so routine, that I would love to find that Awe again.. Dragon Empires from Codemasters is looking good to me.  IF it ever comes out.  I still log onto the Realm.  My character there is the max level, and I mainly log into talk with friends still there.  The changes there since the new owner... &lt;shrugs&gt; We'll see, but it's not EQ or AC, or DaOC.  Yea, that first innocence is gone.  Maybe one day, it will come back with a new game that is so far beyond EQ, and all the other games, that all of us will be so awed by it, it's an instant hit.  Until that time, we will all continue to play what is there, what appeals to us, doing what we do best.</div></div><hr />

BattleAxe, you've summed up my feelings nicely.  I had more pride in getting my first bits of metal armor back in the day (ringmail pants and banded bracers, no one had full suits of banded back then) than buying the latest uber armor in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
If a game is going to apeal to the masses, it has to be easy and accessable.  It is very difficult (impossible IMHO) to keep the sense of wonder and excitment in a crowded world where everybody is about the same.  In a world where everybody has easy acess to uber gear, and it is not hard to lvl a character 20 lvls in a day, there is no pride in having uber gear, or working for lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Back in 99 I started my Troll Shaman. I wandered about the swamp totally in awe and totally lost. I killed Tads, Skeles, and a few snakes. I leveled slow as molases and I died...alot. I lost my body for a few hours, had another troll help me find it. We made friends and I was completely in love with the swamp and my troll brothers. I spent days and days drooling over &quot;a mace&quot; that one of the vendors had. I saved and saved and saved and finally bought that mace for 11pp. by then I had almost a full suit of tattered leather and now, with my new mace and whopping 6 levels of experience I could consider adventuring out to &quot;froggy island&quot;. I waged war on froggies and ran for my life and the barshers saved me over and over.<br />
It was so much fun. So new and wonderous because we DIDNT KNOW what was going on. Thats innocence. Not knowing and wondering and learning.<br />
Can it be found again? Sure. In a MMO? Not unless its so alien and new in concept that we arent aware of what may be to come. WOW, though I am drooling over it, is going to be VERY much the same as EQ and the like. Leveling, looting, crafting, Ebay, PA, Uber mobs, uber guilds, Glass ceiling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">EQ truly blew me away when I first logged into it in 1999. I was simply amazed. As much as I hated it, the lack of maps, the boats, the LONG runs from Freeport to Qeynos, etc all created an amazingly immersive environment. It really did feel like being in another world. <br />
<br />
Even the musical scores around the cities added to the immersiveness of the game. <br />
<br />
The oldworld, kunark and velious dungeons where amazingly detialed and obviously painstakingly handcrafted. The original dungeons were excellent. <br />
<br />
PoP and LoY ruined that. As much as I disliked Verant, you can easily tell the difference between Verant content and SOE content. I guess the &quot;vision&quot; meant something after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I don't know if it's up to a game to &quot;make me forget I'm on a leveling treadmill&quot;.  It's only there because *I* put it there.  When I started EQ, I said frequently &quot;oh, I'll never be level 50!&quot; -- I wasn't worried about getting the super amazing gear.  I didn't care about getting the most levels in the fastest time.  My goals were small and close to home.  I wanted a magic weapon so I could kill wisps because they made that annoying mosquito noise and must be destroyed.  I wanted to improve my tailoring so I could make AMAZING handmade backpacks.<br />
<br />
There are people still in the game for those small goals.  It's just... once you achieve all the small ones, you have to go somewhere from there.<br />
<br />
The important lesson of EQ for me, I think, is going to be that I don't ACTUALLY want to get the highest levels and the best gear IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME.  That's not fun.  It's like having a great book from your favorite author.  You feel the desire to sit down and read the whole thing in a 12 hour sitting, but you won't get the most enjoyment out of it that way.  Same as forcing down an entire chocolate cake.  <br />
<br />
Just my take on it, but I think that keeping myself from trying to get into the &quot;uber&quot; crap is what'll keep WoW fresh for me.  That and blizzard is just a helluva better game maker than the parties involved in EQ over its span.  Considering the time and attention that Blizzard puts into patching and rebalancing games that have been released for years... I can't IMAGINE what they're going to do for one that's raking in a monthly fee.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure I ever had that much innocence with Everquest.  The majority of the original designers came from a mud I used to play and Everquest has a very Diku-mud feel to it - to the point that the creators of Diku were at one point going to sue.  I had that innocence 10 years ago when I played my first mud.  I really think it is more of a &quot;the first multiplayer game I ever played&quot; innocence than it is &quot;Everquest innocence&quot; at least for me.   It is *very* common for people to move from mud to mud (and complain about each one and how it isn't as good as the first one they ever played, regardless of which one that first one was), chew up the content, and move on.  This is just the same behavior on a larger scale.  <br />
<br />
Personally I think that Everquest is much better now than it was in the beginning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No you won't.<br />
<br />
EQ educated players so much, any game that comes out now will be flooded with mega power gamers from the start, and conquored very quickly.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I say &quot;yes&quot; the innocence can be there repeatedly in new games, especially if they don't suck, even for those (like me) that are experienced with a lot of PC gaming and MMORPGs.  I think a lot of recent releases have either outright sucked or been mediocre at best.  If a game is decent, there's a high chance for the innocence factor.<br />
<br />
I think the only way you get that feeling of innocence is if a game is new to everybody, like when EQ first released or when DAoC first released (and there were tons of people waiting and in on the first day).  If you join a game that's been going for a while and has lots of fan site info available and is well known then I think that most of the innocence will be gone - as it's hard to avoid all the info that's available for a running game.<br />
<br />
I expect (and hope like heck they don't suck like recent releases) that WoW and EQ2 will both have a significant &quot;wow&quot; or innocence factor.  I think both are being made by quality teams with proven track records and both will be taking the good of the genre and adding to it (rather than some releases that have failed to learn from what works and have tried often stupid ideas).<br />
<br />
There will be powergames in any type of game genre - those that want to &quot;win&quot; as fast as possible.  I don't think those types of players care about the &quot;wow&quot; factor - they just want to &quot;win.&quot;  I think most of us want to gain power, but we also want to enjoy the experience as more than just an exercise in &quot;winning the game.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A tip for those who hope to recapture the 'first MMOG' experience:<br />
<br />
Stay out of the beta. Probably the single biggest thing you can do to help recapture the magic in the next release. Of course, you then have to find out if its a stinker while paying for it.<br />
<br />
Also, this whole thread draws some paralells between online gaming and drug addiction/substance abuse, mainly the 'first high', struggling to recapture that feeling, and failing to do so. Looked at from that angle, no, you can never truly recreate that first high. The 'why' of why you can't recreate isn't all that different either, with drugs your body builds a tolerance and mentally you know what to expect, with MMOGs you've built a basis of expectation (the UI should do/look like this, monsters should react like so, equipment should be thus etc.) which functions much the same. Obviously the paralells don't apply to everyone's experience, but I'd guess it does apply to quite a few, which isn't news at all. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There will still be some level of awe no matter what other new game I play.  The best moment for me in EQ was when I first saw another player at level 1.  We grouped and teamed up to kill mobs while chatting and having fun.  After playing the likes of Doom, quake, descent, counterstrike... it was a great relief to team up and work together instead of against each other. And you always looked forward to getting better.<br />
<br />
I suspect the next awe inspiring, jaw dropping MMORPG will be the first one played on the holodeck.</div></div><hr />

I disagree, cause we are not defined by our enviroment, WE define out inviroment. I am surrounded by power gamers on my server, yet i have etched out a quiet lil life that is now void of raiding and is step by step falling back to what i enjoyed about EQ.<br />
<br />
Just dont let the flow ride upon your back and you can do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I suppose it comes down to what you think you lost to begin with. For me, I lost hope that people online wouldn't sell each other out for pixels. Other than that, as far as the game is concerned, I still can be in awe. I don't need that wide-eyed, seeing things for the first time ever feeling to maintain my enjoyment level. Then again, I'm rather easily amused. That's probably why I'm not looking for WoW to save my gaming experience, I'm still enjoying what I'm doing now.</div></div><hr />
