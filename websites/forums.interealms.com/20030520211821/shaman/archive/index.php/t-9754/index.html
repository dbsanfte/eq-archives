<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok so i just got Canni 5 and headed to the bazaar to pick up some HP gear. Well i ended up buying shissar scale guants, rubi bracer, and a linked metal crown. <br />
<br />
seems unbelievable that im actually replacing my ToV Kael gear with a items that cost from 100pp to 2k. That's besides the point.<br />
<br />
So with this setup and the FT3 boots my AC has dropped around ~70pts and that really seems to bug me. considering that even in this setup im still not going to avoid low health agro from canni 5 self-buffed is there really a point to this upgrades? <br />
<br />
other then that just a regular equipment check, any decent upgrades you guys see in the &gt;10k range? (rings will be Gallantry and Emp soon)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe try to quest some PoM boots if you really think the AC is lacking.  Going to try for those myeslf if I ever find a means to get to PoM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I checked out your guild website and saw your guild is prepping for the Emp and currently taking out the AoW.  Our guilds sound fairly comparable, so check out my magelo (link is my name) for some hitpoint ideas.  I would definitely recommend my hat/shoulder items.  They are VERY easy to get, have decent hitpoints and really cool effects.  I would also look into getting a heiro cloak...price might be kinda steep (they go for around 15K on my server) but it would be a really nice upgrade for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Where do the helm and shoulders drop Gloriana? They would both be a nice upgrade for me<br />
<br />
I'm guessing factory or Plane of tactics as they sound gnomish (failed on behemoth first time last night, but doing again soon)<br />
<br />
Oh and my guild is at the point of getting ST keys, Clearing NToV, Luclin nameds like IV/DS, *nearly* killing Grummus (wipe at 0% third try) etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good guess.  Both those items drop from the Manaetic Prototypes in the PoI factory.  Not sure about numbers, we usually have a good turnout for those cos they drop nice stuff hehe, maybe 2-3 groups?  A pushover for a full raid force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zazam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have they fixed the summoning bug ? I know last time we tried one of these he started summoning players from all over the zone, was a mess.<br />
<br />
/wave Groggy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1000 ac is pretty good unbuffed, I'd like to hit 1100 someday, but not a huge deal IMO.<br />
<br />
Slime covered Rubi Coif from CT is cheap and nice helm upgrade, 16 ac 65 hp.  See if you can get a lizard bone earring from CT too, they've got 75 hp and 10 sta.<br />
<br />
Also agreed on the hiero cloak, those things kick ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Orb of the Infinite Void would add 75hps and 10ac at the cost of resists.  Its about 9k on my server.</div></div><hr />
