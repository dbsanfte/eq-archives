<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a few silly questions about mistakenly rooting yourself.<br />
<br />
* Can you be summoned by a mob while self rooted? If so are you re-rooted next to the mob?<br />
<br />
* If you root yourself by mistake, can you be GG, teleported or gate away? If so are you rooted at the destination?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes the effect remains on you unless it is dispelled or wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry ... I dont like spitting the pits on the ground, so I left them in your bowl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even if ya are rooted you can be summoned... and if you gate when you are rooted, you will really be &quot;bounded&quot; to your home point. You can nullify it but  unless the root is the top most spell ya will have to nullify most of your other good spells to reach it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my youth in Everfrost, the snow orc shaman used to cast root on you constantly.  It was extremely frightening.  Back then root overwrote sow, so even if you got free you were still moving slower than the orc.  They came out with a patch that changed root to no longer overwrite sow and the poor orc shaman just gave up casting it for some odd reason.  Shame too, because they became a lot less interesting.  <br />
<br />
I remember getting rooted by an orc, casting gate, and showing up at the ramp leading to Halas rooted in place. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The worst experiences that I've encountered have been with the &quot;trap&quot; mushroom mobs in Dawnshroud Peaks. Some spots on the gorud are trapped and if you run over it, a nasty mob will appear. One trap spawns a nasty mushroom that can Root, Snare, DOT, DD and cast a curse I think which resembles snare. There's nothing like running to meet some friends and suddenly you've been rooted and you feel a &quot;Stinging Swarm&quot; around you. It then lobs a few DD at you and then eats you alive. <br />
<br />
What's worse this mob will then walk back and take the place of one of the original 3 mushroom mobs at the camp. So new campers might find a nasty surprise awaiting them.</div></div><hr />

If you have a DD spell Memed and you're not to low on Health, you can just DD yourself, that will free you up.  Its an old PvP trick to break root.</div></div><hr />

I use to use that trick on Anarchy Online too. Didn't know it can be done on EQ. I was so slow on HP that I would have killed myself.  Hehe, use that new Burst of Flame ring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cannibalize will also break root.</div></div><hr />
