<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Once you hit lev 48, the bread and butter mobs (bats and sonic wolfs) are going to be light blue and no longer worth the effort.  It's time to move on.  <br />

Welcome to Mons Letalis!  First, no one likes this zone. That is good, because you will not have to compete for spawns.  I set up camp near the zone to The Grey (right of it, to avoid trains).  The bazaar is very close (that is good), and loot, is, well so so. You can pick up a number of the coveted High Quality, Flawless and Superior Rockhopper hides, as well as some Twilight Sea quest items, but there is little in terms of plat or item drops.  But let's concentrate on the important stuff, EXP!  EXP ROCKS (IMHO).  I need 4-5 kills per blue bub, which works out to be about only 100 Kills PER LEVEL (in 48).  With horse and JBB downtime is not too bad (the suckers hit TOO hard to have no downtime).  I think that is pretty darn decent, uncontested xp.  <br />
<br />
Now, there are a couple things worth mentioning.  First Mature Rockhoppers are mean, mean, mean.  Fights with them usually end with me at 2 bubs of mana / health.  High AC is an absolute MUST, I have ac 909, fully buffed, and still get smacked around for 125 doubles once in a while.  I have found this zone to be perfect for my playstyle and hours (I got a 15 month old, so frequent afk, or erratic emergency log offs are the norm).    Good luck and fight the good fight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for the post.  I'm 1 blue from 48 and I've been in Tenebrous Mtns for months (started on Grimlings in the Laborer Caves).  Should ding tonite, so I was wondering when the bats/wolves were going to turn lgt blue.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about heading over to Twilight Sea and seeing how easy it is to solo in the northern valley.  But Mons might be just the place to go, since it's so close to Echo Caves.</div></div><hr />
