Quote:<br />
Of course these aren't all of the ideas. You brought us a CD, 2 books, 20 printed sheets, and a manifesto. We'll need to go through all of those and our notes before we can really get a good tally of all the wonderful ideas and questions that were presented.<br />
<br />
There were quite a few other issues raised. The ones above are on a letter passed out to us at dinner. These were issues we brought up in our group discussions with the developers and Smed (there was 4? diff grps, ~9players per grp). But of course, i got some other stuff answered:<br />
<br />
-yes taunt mod boots work for warriors. It wil go to 252 just like everything else.<br />
<br />
- Probably going to be a way to see the time left on your buffs soon.<br />
<br />
-there is new armors coming to ldon, and the 1452 or whatever the cap is now will be raised.<br />
<br />
-augments will be removeable quite soon.<br />
<br />
-spell drops in god are being changed somewhat. Also quests to get some of the spells.<br />
<br />
-vp revamp coming very soon.<br />
<br />
-Much much much better CS is coming soon. Their csr tools they have available now are simply amazing. If you'd given up petitioning about problems, you should start again.<br />
<br />
There was just so much said/written down today that I'm sure i've missed a ton. I will say though that im pretty convinced this was not just a pr stunt.<br />
<br />
i tried to pk gilfalas irl too but then our dinner came and we forgot.<br />

<br />
http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=8094<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey folks,<br />
<br />
I'm sitting in the hotel in San Diego (nice digs), tapping away on my laptop via the 100mb broadband connection provided by SOE, not quite ready to head home yet.<br />
<br />
The last 48 hours have been great. SOE really rolled out the red carpet and opened it's doors and collective minds to hear us and talk with us. Something has really lit the fires under the butts of SOE executives, EQ directors and dev team staff and if they follow through with the committments made this weekend, well, EQ has a really good chance to kick some butt again and be fun to play. I'm looking forward to it.<br />
<br />
First of, who was there: yes, of the 63 attendees, it was mostly guild leaders of the big guilds across the servers - Silent Redemption, Rising Ascension, BotS, Township Rebellion, LoS, etc., etc. But several mid-range guilds were invited to (those in high-end Luclin and mid-range PoP) and then class and fan board sites (DG!, Safehouse, Berserker.com, Shaman's Crucible, Steel Warrior, Graffe's, The Runes, EQRolePlayers.com, Woody of /GU comics, the House Ogre from EQTraders, etc.).<br />
<br />
I'll get pictures and a few artwork scans up after I get home, so this'll be an ongoing report.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, we bussed to SOE headquarters for introductions, tours, demo's of EQ2 and Omens of War but most importantly, discussions with developers and customer service staff. I took a couple of copies of the druid issues document and then a abbreviated list from that with me and was pleasantly surprised to hear that many developers and directors had already seen it from just having posted it Friday (thanks guys!).<br />
<br />
The day started with introductions by John Smedley - he really is a pretty normal, cool guy. Smedley started by saying that he took full responsibility for the &quot;cluster&quot; that was the Gates of Discord release. He said that he and the EQ dev staff fully realize now that it was not tested enough. As it turns out, there's also a reason why it's so hard; SOE had planned to raise the level limits to level 70 during the April 5th anniversary, but decided not to. However, GoD content was designed for that level. It was amazing to see SOE fess up and later in the day, we all spent time talking how players and SOE can better perform beta testing.<br />
<br />
During the tours, it was super cool to see the customer service area and the GMs working on petitions (piccy's inc). Later in the afternoon, the director of CS and several Lead GMs told about the new petition system, new customer service goals and what they've got in the works which I think is really going to make a difference online. More details below. <br />
<br />
Fun facts: EverQuest customer service (just EQ - not including SWG or FF CS) receives approximately 75,000 petitions a month (I think that was a number - it was huge); 70% of customer service time is spent on researching scams - this is part of the reason why SOE polled the EQ playerbase on how we'd feel about an official SOE RL cash selling system.<br />
<br />
For the actual discussions, the broke us into 6 smaller groups and let us have at it. The discussions mostly were focused on high end raiding, testing, and customer service, but many topics were covered and I think many ideas with committment to doing or being talked about more that will effect players of every level and play style. The number segment of the EQ subscriber base is level 30-50 and they did seem genuinely concerned about those players who are casual to harder core but time-restricted. Woody (who was in my small break out group), spoke passionately about making it fun for those who log in for an hour or two again and a lot of ideas were discussed.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, the dev team met by the themselves and compiled a list, which was typed up, printed and given to us during dinner. Herewith, that document:<br />
<br />
&quot;June 5, 2004<br />
<br />
Dear Guild and Community Representatives,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for a great Summit! By all accounts it was a huge success. I can speak for the EverQuest Development Team and tell you that we're grateful for the input you provided. In fact, in trying to generate this list to give to you this evening, we realized there was so much to go over that wouldn't be able to get a complete list together in time. We're committed to not only listening to your feedback, but working with you to make EverQuest more enjoyable for years to come.<br />
<br />
So, we decided to list the Top Ten themes we would address starting Mondy, as well as the most common themes that we'll come back with more informationo n by mid-week next week.<br />
<br />
A quick discussion resulted in a list of items that we will immediately address:<br />
<br />
- Add scripting to shut off empty instances of Plane of Time<br />
[Chen note: Everyone was pretty unanimous about looking for ways to improve this. The example situation of guild A kills phases 1-4, spawning the little dudes, armies, whatever you wanna call them, and then zoning out. Guild B can not now zone into Time for their instance for 4 hours. This sort of thing is what they are committing to working on immediately).<br />
<br />
- Raid messages of the day<br />
- Improving how we handle beta and the testing process<br />
- Increase the number of debuffs allowed on the MOBs<br />
[Chen note: The dev team got told many times that 30 slots on the MOBs is not enough. Although they didn't say how many they're going to increase it to, a larger amount should help.]<br />
<br />
- Increase buffs on players through AAs<br />
[Chen note: When I spoke to the spell and AA developer, Ryan, it sounded like this was already planned and that the Guild Summit just confirmed the need for it. Again, no firm number on the increase nor AAs required to buy them, but WOOHOO!]<br />
<br />
- Note field on raid window<br />
<br />
- Improved consent &amp; drag for raid, group and guild<br />
- Improve corpse drag radius<br />
[Chen note: The functionality discussed sounded like a command you would turn on that would automatically consent all the rogues in your raid, group or guild - something like that - until you turned it off. The rogues in attendance were maniacially happy. Let's hope it goes live soon!]<br />
<br />
- Make charms not no-drop<br />
- Guild and individual rewards for guild beta testing<br />
- Work on large To Do list....I know this one is a little random<br />
<br />
Future items we will immediately begin looking at and discussions are as follows:<br />
<br />
- Plane of Time instancing and other issues<br />
- Back flaggings solutions to help with High-end guild atrophy<br />
[Chen note: Lots of time was spent talking about the frustrations many/all guilds had when GoD came out; guilds were tuned for 72 man raids to then have to downsize to 54. SOE dev staffers admit now that it was a mistake to set the number and then change it, but consensus from the attendees in my group, at least, was that the number should stay the same or increase to just 60. SOE recognized that back flagging was a major pain in the ass and committed to figuring out some ways to make it easier. I hope we see something soon.]<br />
<br />
- Improved raid and guild functionality<br />
- Auto loot all for your corpse<br />
- Improvements to Raid XP<br />
[Chen note: I hadn't even thought about this before going, several folks mentioned how much raid xp sucked and that they'd like to see it improved. I think this would be great for all raiders, from the super hard core to those time-restricted players. While SOE said that they wanted group experience to still be the best, hopefully we'll see an improvement soon for regular raid xp.]<br />
<br />
- Review the Epic 2.0 quests<br />
- No more alien NPCs ;-) (focusing more on familiar Norrathians themes)<br />
[Chen note: It was pretty funny actually during the introductions yesterday morning, Smed was introducing some of the game artists and mentioning how hard they work. One of the EQ directors heckled him from the back of the group about pirates - turns out Smed hated the pirate idea and said so, to which all of the attendees started clapping and saying &quot;aaarrr!&quot; in support of the pirates. =D]<br />
<br />
- Solo LDoN-stype instances or similiar content<br />
[Chen note: While I can understand how this might sound a little lame, the ideas floating around about it seemed pretty cool. Think &quot;missions&quot; that a solo player, even a warrior, could do - kill some stuff, collect something, deliver some stuff. Some ideas included installing NPC &quot;helpers&quot; in the dungeon that, for example, would heal the solo warrior, etc. This idea will hopefully give the players with just some limited time something fun to do while progressing their character some - without wasting tons of time sitting LFG.]<br />
<br />
- Issues with item augmenetations<br />
[Chen note: Hopefully we can see the ability to recycle augs soon. Discussions alluded to perhaps buying an expensive solvent, which would loosen the augment from your armor without damaging it. Yes plz thx!]<br />
<br />
- Possible enhancements to Guild Wars<br />
<br />
Of course these aren't all of the items. You brought us a CD, 2 books, 20 printed sheets and a manifesto. We'll need to go through all of those and our notes before we can really get a good tally of all of the wonderful ideas and questions that were presented.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your feedback and participation. We've had a great weekend and a wonderful display of things to come.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Robert Pfister<br />
Executive Producer<br />
EverQuest<br />
<br />
And the EverQuest Development Team!&quot;<br />
<br />
As far as druid specific issues, Trevize and I cornered &quot;Ryan the spell guy&quot; (when we could get him away from Gemdriver of Graffe's!) and chatted about big druid spell issues. Trev told him that a line of group heals was the most lacking and I talked about how the resistance check on E'ci's really needed fixing. We also talked about the refresh timer on SotW and I tried to impress upon him that the timer should just be reduced without removing the DS - we'll see. He said that the code for AA's was frozen atm, so nothing can be modified at the moment. Hopefully our long list of impassioned requests to reduce it will not go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
I did talk about allowing TR and KR to crit and to reduce the cast time on our fast heals and/or increase the amount healed, but I'm doubtful they'll change either. We'll keep working on them about it!<br />
<br />
From the tradeskill front (sorry guys, but y'all know I'm a nutty tradeskiller, so I had to ask), both Maddoc and Absor said they're working on more stuff, more recipes, especially for GoD and Omens will have some fun stuff (Absor doesn't give up information easily tho, that rascal =D)<br />
<br />
Okay, Customer Service: Recently, SOE introduced a new in-game petition tool last week which is already greatly improving how SOE CS handles issues. If you haven't seen it, take a look. I think the commands to opening it are /petition, keystroke P, and then some way via the menus (can't remember now what it was).<br />
<br />
Anyway, this new interface prompts the player for more detailed information about the problem and writes a much better CS &quot;ticket&quot; to be processed; a category and sub-category help direct the ticket exactly where it needs to go (for example, bugs go directly to the dev team) and fields request more specific time, zone, NPC, player name, etc. fields. The tickets are also not reset and lost when the servers go down like the old system did - and GMs will be able to resinstate items into your inventory when when you are offline as well as send you a message when you'll see when you log in.<br />
<br />
The Lead GM who spoke with our group said that while they are still working on a large backlog from the old system, they are making great progress on the backlog while keeping up on petitions. They're goal is to get the petitions down to a much more controllable level and reduce response times down to hopefully an hour or two at the outside. Once they've got the petitions under control, they want their GMs to have more fun with the players - more GM events, more happy love.<br />
<br />
They are also working on a system for guild leaders and officers to submit a few Guild Critical issues to CS that would receive top priority; e.g., a mob on your raid has warped into a wall and you need a GM there now to pop him out or your raid is hosed. Hopefully, we'll see this system in place very soon.<br />
<br />
***<br />
So, lots of stuff. I know I'm not remembering everything at the moment. I would suggest checking out Safehouse and /GU forums and other forums soon for their reviews of the event. I'll get some pictures up soon and anything I remember.<br />
<br />
It was an amazing event and I am very thankful to SOE for hosting us and listening to what we had to say, to Sobe and the rest of the staff here at the DG for allowing a silly cupcake to attend and especially to you guys, the DG community for supporting me and allowing me to represent you. Together, we can work more closely the EQ dev team and hopefully see some real and good and FUN! changes soon.<br />
<br />
If you guys have any questions or comments for me, please don't hesitate to reply here or PM me. =D<br />
<br />
<br />
I see 90% raid centric information there. Even a coming special customer service section for raids.<br />
<br />
Not in the least surprised, nothing in my plans of ending my EQ time will be changing. Finish my personal obligations to friends, then cancel billing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Guessing Glori will have the final set of shaman changes that they'll try to do *fingers crossed*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lots of improvements. I'll wait until I've seeen some of the other write-up, in particular the shaman one before I draw any major conclusions.<br />
<br />
Overall, it looks good!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You know, Saar, there's a lot there for a non-raider.<br />
<br />
Solo Ldon style content.<br />
New Ldon loot above the 1492 level.<br />
Removable augmentations.<br />
Tradeable charms.<br />
Increased number of buff slots (PoK MGBfest + SK in group will get 15 now).<br />
More tradeskill content.<br />
<br />
But if you're committed to being done with the game, then nothing would really have changed your mind, I expect.  But although a lot of the flashy stuff was about raids (PoTime *needs* to be fixed, trust us on this one), there's more there for the &quot;everyman&quot; player than usual, too.  I give it a &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fixing plane of time instancing. Hallellujia!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, c'mon Griz!  When was the last time there were any issues with Time instancing on 7th Hammer?  I mean really!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kinda strange bunch of points they chose to focus on but players being supposed to be level 70 for GoD does explain a thing or two.<br />
<br />
Wait and see what they actually do now I guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only craptastic part about it, imo, is that there aren't any real shaman specific things listed.<br />
<br />
I absolutely love the AA buff slot increase... it is my favorite item.  I am so tired of having to get people to leave a HoT slot open (Yeah, people still block it around me, with things as dumb as cobalt procs or ultravision or what not).<br />
<br />
I like the idea of solo-able missions with NPC helpers, though I know the coding would most likely be horrific.<br />
<br />
Think it's funny how Druids want a group heal and faster/more efficient heals, and the resistance check on ONE of their spells fixed.<br />
<br />
They should try rolling a shaman and PL'ing him up like crazy with their dr00d here in the GoD era, see how they like their heals and 0 resist modifier spells then!<br />
<br />
I'm soooooo soooooo glad to see a list of improvements that doesn't consist of 50 percent &quot;We will fix collision.&quot;  The recent collision issues will most likely never be fully fixed, and at this point I'm not even hoping for much improvement... as it only bugs me when it happens to raid mobs (ugh)... but what I AM tired of is the collision being the focus of the last what, 5 or 6 patches?  Seems like it overshadows other things.<br />
<br />
The whole no drop thing does not effect us players on Firiona Vie, though I imagine it would help across the other servers.<br />
<br />
And I never expected them to instance Time... no matter how badly old zones need features from newer ones sometimes, instancing being the best example to date imo, they (SoE) usually just leave it alone.  I wish they were more specific on how they are taking steps towards instancing... I don't see how you can do it halfway, it's either instanced or not... but any changes to help allow more people to tackle it is VERY needed, as more and more guilds reach it and it is a pseudo-requirement for deep Gates Content, and, presumably, some Omens Content.<br />
<br />
I am incredibly sick of the Alien theme.  Planes of Power totally rocked, as it reinforced a lot of old storyline and you got to see some of the gods you always heard about, as well as beefed up versions of old plane ones (sure you end up helping to kill the gods you worship for progression now and then, but we'll just overlook that...)<br />
<br />
Gates is just stupid, it's like a B horror movie.  They went way too far with the new storyline... they took 5 years of Norrathian lore and threw it to the crapper in exchange for a story based upon some poorly evolved characters that, while posessing of potential, lack the support of any eloquent writers (the in-game story chapters are quite blandly written).<br />
<br />
I want to hear about Norrath, not about three fellas and a wacky mage.  Granted the story was fun at first, it is overshadowing the more awesome lore of previous expansions, my favorite of which was Velious (LOVED that lore, remember the three different letters from different travelers, all based on different factions, in the manual?  Sigh.... memories :)   )<br />
<br />
Very happy about backflagging solutions... perhaps they could do some easier versions of flagging that include requiring someone with the flags already on as a helper, that would go a long way.  <br />
<br />
Also glad they examining raid exp, with most high level characters simply logging on to raid and then off when an alt is played (because *gasp*, it's sorta fun to run around at a lower level doing whatcha want in old zones!!!), the necessity to break off and AA grind is kinda crappy, and we all now how insignificant raid exp is compared to grinding &gt;:\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Theres no shaman things listed because the sources are from warrior/druid specific boards, they couldn't give a damn about shaman things :p.<br />

I didn't say that i expected it or anything, I was just responding to the original poster calling the list craptastic... as far as GENERAL listing goes, I think it's quite nice, personally :)<br />
<br />
And yes, would be great to hear some shammy feedback, but I'll take good news in any form!</div></div><hr />

-potime fixes (not true instancing yet but a step -- i was told full instancing will take a bit longer due to having to make major changes)<br />
   + so what, I'm not in PoTime, maybe it's good for you, I'll take your word<br />

-improving how soe handles beta and the testing process<br />
   + big f'ing deal<br />
-increasing the number of debuffs allowed on a mob<br />
   + sure, might be good, never ran into this problem myself<br />
-increase buffslots on players through aa<br />
   + great, so now my excuse for only doing Fo7 and Boar to save buff spots is gone; spot for heal over time is okay<br />
-note field on the raid window<br />
   + minor convenience, who cares<br />
-improved consent (/consent guild) and drag. /consent raid, guild, or group.<br />
   + minor convenience, big deal... rogue no longer gets spammed with consents, yay, i'm excited<br />
-improve corpse drag radius<br />

-make charms not no drop<br />
   + big f'ing deal again<br />

-no more alien NPC's (focussing more on familiar norrathian themes)<br />
   + I don't care<br />
-solo ldon-stle instanced or similar content<br />
   + this is only thing I can get excited about if done right, has great possibilities; I agree with previous poster that said that rewards from solo LDON's will be ridiculously expensive for the time and/or crappy<br />
-issues with item augmentations (also refers to focii/effects i believe)<br />
  + this one will also be good, as long as they also institute an LDON gear buyback<br />
-possible enhancements to /guildwar<br />
   + .... who cares<br />

Hope you all found some good things here.  If you found one thing that you think is half way decent and you consider it a success, then good for you.  Sounds to me like an incredible waste of time and money.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Welcome to EverRaid.<br />
<br />
If this does in fact become the &quot;fix,&quot; more and more raid stuff, while they only give us casuals solo LDoN, higher point items which means doing more LDoN, which I absolutely LOATHE, then I think it's time to retire.<br />
<br />
All they're doing is taking the masses out of BoT and sticking them in instanced zones where everything is always the same and there's nothing but a feeling of being on a factory assembly line.  Lord only knows we can't have masses of people in BoT, because there's really nowhere else for us to go, potentially causing lag for the raid on Agnarr.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
But, we shall wait and see.  If they make Everquest EverQUEST again, I'll stick around.  But if it does fully fall into the black pit which is EverRAID, I shall bid all my fine shaman friends farewell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Saar_Tribunal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You know, Saar, there's a lot there for a non-raider.<br />
<br />
Solo Ldon style content.<br />
New Ldon loot above the 1492 level.<br />
Removable augmentations.<br />
Tradeable charms.<br />
Increased number of buff slots (PoK MGBfest + SK in group will get 15 now).<br />
More tradeskill content.<br />
<br />
But if you're committed to being done with the game, then nothing would really have changed your mind, I expect.  But although a lot of the flashy stuff was about raids (PoTime *needs* to be fixed, trust us on this one), there's more there for the &quot;everyman&quot; player than usual, too.  I give it a &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; so far.<br />
<br />
I don’t get why raiders especially serious raiders seem to think LDoN is a panacea for the non-raider.<br />
<br />
Completely over looking the repetitiveness of it, the blandness, etc lets look at time investment.<br />
<br />
Approximately 5000 points per item (item plus augs)<br />
Approximately 100 adventures per item (51 points per adventure)<br />
Approximately 150-200 hours per item (1.5-2 hours per adventure)<br />
Multiply that by 10 items<br />
1500-2000 HOURS or LDoN time for those items<br />
Divide by 20 hours per week<br />
75-100 WEEKS<br />
Divide by 52 (weeks in a year)<br />
<br />
Final:<br />
1.5 - 2 YEARS of time for 10 pieces of gear.<br />
<br />
So they are adding higher priced items?<br />
Result: Longer to get that gear, now 3 years?<br />
<br />
So they are adding solo LDoN?<br />
Result: Less points per adventure, longer to get gear, again now 3 years?<br />
<br />
Increased buff slots? I think only raiders ever get full of usable buffs, I sure don’t.<br />
<br />
Tradable charms? very minor, I have never even seen a decent charm.<br />
<br />
Removable augs? Not all that useful to ME as it would take me like 2 months for one item with augs, how long after that would I want to change those augs around? The people I hear complaining about augs are raiders who want to move their Anger3 augs to new raid drop weapons.<br />
<br />
No I don’t see anything about improving PROGRESSION for the non-raider. Note the all caps word there. There is no where to go. LDoN for 6 months, then LDoN hards for 6 months, then GoD? I have pickup groups wipe in LDoN normals still. Most of the raiders don’t have any idea how it is for people at this level of the game. I don’t want RAID content, I want content just like I had for levels 1-65. At 65+ there is none.<br />
<br />
I'm happy for the raiders, from reading so far sounds like high-end raid guilds got everything that they wanted. I sure hope those raid guilds can support SOE on their own.<br />

So tell me, are the raiders the ones generating the lion's share of the EQ revenue?  I seriously doubt it.  Sounds like the casual players are the heart of the player base, which again is being ignored.  I knew this would happen when I saw who they were inviting to this summit.  Fine, if they want to focus on high end raiding, then they can watch their player base shrink to a few thousand while CoH and WoW get their player bases to 500k+, because they cater to casual players first, not just power players.  They've got the 80/20 rule backwards and continue to focus on the 20%, what morons.<br />
<br />
I guess no mention of fixing the quad zillion bugs currently in the game, except those that affect raiders.  What a bunch of crap.  I've already canceled my account and will not be reactivating.  2hb will still be broken, etc., etc.  Screw the Plane of Time, I'll never see it (and neither will most players, don't they realize this?).  By God, we all pay the same monthly fee.  <br />
<br />
The only items that even remotely interest me are the LDoN changes to augments (more of a fix than an enhancement, come on, an augment has to be detroyed to change it, stupid idea from the start) and the single player LDoN missions.  Once again they are copying another game, in this case CoH.  Unfortunately, where as CoH was developed with this concept in mind EQ was not.  It will take SoE months to come up with a way to allow all classes to complete solo LDoN missions and balance the challenge and reward appropriately.  I'm not holding my breath, or willing to wait that long.  <br />

SoE will never see my $12.95 again.<br />

Your post doesnt make sense. Not to flame or point out anything or be mean, but if casuals are the ones complaining, then why would the fact that tier 3 PoP and ldons are fine be worth a damn to the casuals? Tier 3 PoP is elemental correct? Most &quot;casuals&quot; wont see elemental, because it takes too much time and effect for the &quot;casuals&quot; to get flags and for the &quot;casuals&quot; to advance. I wouldn't consider myself a casual gamer, although I really wish I was. Guess you cant get time flagged by being casual though.</div></div><hr />

Each piece in reality costs 3700 points.<br />
<br />
1.5 hours for 51 points.<br />
72 adventures will pay for it.<br />
That's 110 hours to get a piece of top of the line gear from ldon.<br />
18 equipment slots needing gear averages out to 2000 hours of ldon.<br />
Keep in mind you also get xp and AAs doing this, and your charm augment will be maxed out in stats because of it.<br />
<br />
Raiding:<br />
My guild uses a database to keep track of our raiding hours and loot.<br />
Since December 5th, 2002, I've won 29 items raiding with my guild.<br />
That's 18th months worth of raiding almost to the day.<br />
I've contributed 590 hours raiding with my guild (not including travel time to wherever we are raiding).<br />
The items I've won range from mostly VT and Ssra gear at first (10+ pieces) to a few ele plane items (about 8) to a few pieces of Time gear at the end.<br />
On average it takes me about 20 hours of time to get a new piece of gear.<br />
I also receive no xp during any of that.  My AA meter goes up a bit, but my normal xp meterd drops due to dying often multiple times on a raid.<br />
<br />
For ldon, it's about 5.5 times longer to get VT and Ele plane quality gear, and as an added reward your charm augment maxes out and you get a huge number of AAs.<br />
For raiding, you get no xp for doing so, but the items on average need less time to acquire.  Also, you have to factor in such things as difficulty in figuring out how to actually kill certain raid targets, and spend hours upon hours doing so (Xegony corpse coh + kill usually takes about 4 hours for us in total.  The entire coh + Rathe council kill took us 6 full hours last time we did it with &quot;just&quot; 55 people on the raid).<br />
With ldon, you aren't locked into being there for anything longer than 2.0 including CR, *ever*.<br />
<br />
There's a balance between the 2 of them.  Raiding is faster gear, but you don't get xp.  LDON is xp, but you get gear slower.  I don't xp much due to work/sleep/social life/raiding, but I do xp here and there regardless, and getting an item out of doing what I'm already doing anywhere rocks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I've got 2 things in this thread I'd like to address...<br />
<br />
Like how often in the last month have you grouped with a tank and cleric not from your guild? People that have less than 100 AAs? A tank with less than 6000 hps unbuffed?<br />
<br />
I know I wasn't the target of this, but since I've been posting a lot recently, I figure I'll chime in with my credentials.  <br />
<br />
I frequently group outside my guild, almost daily in fact.  I don't care what the guild tag is, I group friends first, players I know to be competant and friendly second, random guildmembers and evals that I don't know well third, random people who I'll give a chance fourth, and known incompetant or obnoxious players not at all.<br />
<br />
I'm grouped with people with less than 100 AA more often than not.  The player I spend the most time with currently has 31 AA as I post this.<br />
<br />
I frequently do content with no tank other than a 63 ranger with 3600 unbuffed hp.  This includes Riwwi, Barindu, Ferubi, and Vxed.  Admittedly, we don't do Vxed without an enchanter charm pet when we have no better tank than that ranger ... but we've 4-manned Umbiki this way (last character was a cleric with something like a 3k mana pool, so it wasn't uber either).<br />
<br />
1.5 hours for 51 points.<br />
72 adventures will pay for it.<br />
That's 110 hours to get a piece of top of the line gear from ldon.<br />
18 equipment slots needing gear averages out to 2000 hours of ldon.<br />
<br />
Filling all 18 slots with LDoN point-buy gear is insane.  There are a handful of choice LDoN pieces, but much of it is chaff.  Even ignoring GoD for a moment, the Bazaar even provides upgrades to several of the LDoN point buy items.  One bracer can be a Stone Bracer of Battle Mastery.  Boots of an Aged Mystic are amazingly better than Incorporeal.  I'd take a Vampiric Coif of the Grave, as well.  Sure, its not cheap, but LDoN isn't terrible cash, either, especially Miragul.  By the time you have a couple of fully aug'ed LDoN pieces, you'll have the money to pick up one of the other items in the bazaar.  If you have a group of friends who'll do hard LDoN for loot (you don't even have to win - just have a tracker and farm, who cares about the stupid leaderboard?  you're casual, right?), then you can probably pick those 3 items up for free eventually, and get several other amazing items, like the Girdle of Bloodstained Stones, the Spectral Earring of Froglok Essence, and the FT2 cloak whose name escapes me totally at the moment.  I wouldn't think that anyone looking to gear well, with forward planning, would WANT more than about 6 fully aug'ed LDoN point buy items, at the outside.  The more GoD-ambitious plans my friends have crafted include only 2-4 pieces each.<br />
<br />
Of course, everything does need a (generally 1150 pt) aug, which takes about 35 hours to acquire.  So ... the total time to acquire 4 key peices of LDoN gear and to completely augment everything else is:<br />
<br />
(110 * 4) + (35 * [18 - 4]) = 930 hours.  <br />
<br />
Of course, I wouldn't go that far, anyway.  You don't really need to stick the 20/20 augments in *everything* they can go in.  They're good, sure, but not earth-shatteringly good.  And by the time you're halfway done with this, a group of similar equipped people ought to be able to pick up the 2 25/25 augs in Ferubi, and (depending on available classes), quite likely could get the 30/30 and 30 hp augs from the front of Tipt, too.  That's not counting any other augs you get, like the 20 hp ones in Natimbi, or the various focus augments from the sewers.<br />
<br />
LDoN *is* good ... in moderation.  Remember that there's other content too. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">-potime fixes (not true instancing yet but a step -- i was told full instancing will take a bit longer due to having to make major changes)<br />
Soooo very needed.  Full instancing ala LDON and GoD is what's really needed, but nixing the 4 hour wait for an empty Time instance to expire will be nice.  We have a guild on Brell that raids fairly late in the day (PST based), while my guild and a soon to be time flagged guild are running on EST time.  We can't raid the same day, because the moment our p1-4 raid hits phase 5, our instance won't expire for another 5 or 6 hours.  Being able to clear phase 5, but leave phase 5 and quarm for another day, and let someone else with a later time zone take over the zone for the next few hours will cause much less headache for picking days of the week you can raid time.  We only have 4 guilds on Brell that raid time, and already the days of the week are getting cramped for whose raiding what days.  Adding more guilds will just make it messier.<br />
<br />
-raid message of the day (?***)<br />
Eh.  Don't really need it.  That's what /guildmotd is for.<br />
<br />
-improving how soe handles beta and the testing process<br />
About freaking time.  God should still be in testing to this day.  Can't say enough about this, but everyone already knows how bad their testing and patch process is.  If they would just put their patches on the *test server* for a week before pushing it out the door, or hell, even a day or 2, it would fix sooooo much complaining from the player base.<br />
<br />
-increasing the number of debuffs allowed on a mob<br />
And the necros rejoice!  This was really needed.  malosinia, DR debuff, ro, mark, mark, cripple, slow, hos, tash take up a quick 9 slots.  The remaining 21 slots must be shared by the 50-70 other people on the raid.  Many raiders have weapons that proc dots or other debuffs.  A single necro can quite easily stack 4-5 dots on a mob.  Stick 4 necros on a mob, and your debuff limit is full.<br />
<br />
-increase buffslots on players through aa<br />
Wooo.  This is sorely needed.  What buffs do I have up about 90% of the time doing xp and raiding?  Clarity, fos, 9, symbol, AC, regen, sow, horse, haste, JBB right clicky, BST clarity, BSS, right clicky quarm ring.  This is before I even think about getting any types of resist or ranger buffs or damage sheilds.<br />
<br />
-note field on the raid window<br />
Don't see a need for this.<br />
<br />
-improved consent (/consent guild) and drag. /consent raid, guild, or group.<br />
-improve corpse drag radius<br />
And the rogues of the world rejoice!  This is so so needed.  You don't have to hear rogues scream after every wipe to mass consent them, and have afk people not do consents and demand their resses and take up huge amounts of time.  If I can autoconsent my guild upon a death, that would be heaven.<br />
When playing my own characters, if I have spirit of wolf up, I can't drag corpses, because they get left behind after dx9.  The corpses don't update position fast enough so I have to either drop sow or duck so I move slow enough for corpses to keep up.<br />
<br />
<br />
-make charms not no drop<br />
Nice change.  Not a really big deal since the POP charm is free at level 51 and the only one most people I know would bother to equip, but *shrug*<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;longer to-do list&quot; - again, not everything but this is what they'll be discussing immediately:<br />
<br />
-back flagging solutions<br />
Very late in being discussed, but with the continuing need for backflagging now with GoD, as well as POP, this is wonderful.  Hopefully they can do something like give a guild a free &quot;tradable&quot; flag  or something if you can just get a sizable enough portion of already flagged people into the zone.  For example, if MM is up, and you have 95% of your raid of 50+ people flagged for the zone, and already have MM flag, then you could flag the remaining 5% of the people without going through the whole raid.  Limit how often you can do this to something like once per week or once per month.  You don't need Time raiding guilds ganking MM from lower tier guilds killing him for flags and loot.<br />
<br />
-improved raid and guild functionality<br />
interesting to see what they might change<br />
<br />
-auto loot for your corpse<br />
Awesome.  About time.  About 5 years late, but better late than never.<br />
<br />
-improvements to raid xp<br />
Nice.  Not really necessary, but would be cool to see.<br />
<br />
-no more alien NPC's (focussing more on familiar norrathian themes)<br />
Yay.  **** hynid.  **** mastruqs.  **** aneuks.  **** all those wierd mobs.  Gimme dragons and kobolds and goblins and golems and giant spiders and elementals and stuff.<br />
<br />
-solo ldon-stle instanced or similar content<br />
Weeee.  I've wanted to solo an ldon adventure for so long, but the time requirements, and 3 person group requirements restrict it.  Much joy.<br />
<br />
-issues with item augmentations (also refers to focii/effects i believe)-augments will be removeable quite soon.<br />
<br />
More types of focus augments would rock.  More slots for focus augments would rock.  Being able to retrieve an augment from a slot is vastly needed.  Selling back old armor for a fraction of points spent would rock.  Much potential here.<br />
<br />
-possible enhancements to /guildwar<br />
Never been in a guildwar, but wouldn't mind it some time.<br />
<br />
- Probably going to be a way to see the time left on your buffs soon.<br />
Excellent.  About freaking time.<br />
<br />
-there is new armors coming to ldon, and the 1452 or whatever the cap is now will be raised.<br />
Neat.  Now maybe people in Elemental/VT armor will get something out of the expansion besides just boring 40hp augments.<br />
<br />
<br />
-spell drops in god are being changed somewhat. Also quests to get some of the spells.<br />
About freaking time.  I've seen about 6 spells drop so far ever, and they were all on an ikkinz raid (rune type turn in).  I've only managed to acquire my slow because someone else in my guild xping in kod'taz got it and I was in the area at the time to run over and loot.  I've been hunting in god a LOT due to BIC quest, and ever since the expansion went live, I've only known about 10 poeple to get any spells at all in the *entire expansion*.  That's lame.<br />
<br />
<br />
-vp revamp coming very soon.<br />
Interesting.  The old zone was very cool.  I wish I could get more friends to go there.<br />
<br />
-Much much much better CS is coming soon. Their csr tools they have available now are simply amazing. If you'd given up petitioning about problems, you should start again.<br />
I had someone harrassing me the other day.  He was spamming me with rude tells, spamming me with group invites, and standing in my face no matter where I faced because I didn't want to do a sewers group with him.  He started logging to other characters to chase me when I gated to PoK.  I sent in a petition (after having to ask a guide how to even send in a petition now).  It took a full 30+ hours for a GM to put an update in my ticket saying &quot;we'll look into it&quot;.  *joy*.  Thanks for the prompt service jackass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Oh, I personally think there are many many options to just going through LDON to equip all 20 equipment slots.  But just to put the time investment into perspective, I assumed all slots were filled by LDON stuff.<br />
<br />
In real practice, there's much better things to do for loot and xp and augments.  Every successful run through Tipt will net you an item off the final boss (either a bracer or ****ty charm thing), and an augment of some kind.  If you want, you can just zone in, kill the cragbeast boss for the augment, and leave to redo.  Spend an hour with a group, and someone gets a new FT2 augment, 30hp/mana augment, or 2hp regen +10 attack augment, or whatever the other one is.  Take a group to Ferubi, crawl the zone to the named that drop parts for Rondo, and farm them for augments.  Take a group into sewers, do xp in there and get item drops off the named that will pop.  You can get a 90hp fungal tunic by xping anywhere in Riwwi, as well as see the occasional named mob.  A single group can flag themselves for Kod'Taz without a raid, and obtain loot there that's Plane of Time quality, obtainable by a single xp group.<br />
<br />
LDON are good for filling in slots that you haven't seen good upgrades for.  Besides 150k cost ornate legs, or farwater legs, you won't find many good legs for a shaman, so might as well get some good LDON legs out of there.  A good bracer is easy to acquire from Tipt boss, or just buying relatively cheap ornate for the FT2, so you might want to skip the LDON armor for that slot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I have mixed feelings about LDoN legs post-GoD.  On one hand, they are very likely most people's bad slot.  Past Tae Ew, and assuming no ornate, you have ... well, yeah, okay, that WAS a short list.  Elemental crafted (Livestone, Farwater, etc.) tends to be expensive enough to be out of reach if you aren't already able to buy Ornate anyway.  Stuff like Veteran's Chain Leggings are a pretty marginal improvement.<br />
<br />
But, then again, if you're at the point where you can farm Vxed, the Seamless Spiked Leggings are a better choice.<br />
<br />
I tend to feel that the best slots for LDoN gear for shaman are the BP (Ornate is just too pricey, and although the clicky is *useful* its not in the same category as an actual focus effect), and gloves (since good gloves are just non-existant in this game, it seems).  If you can manage to find IH4 somewhere else (perhaps by putting a Rathe totem in ranged, or even in secondary if you get the Ferubi totem for ranged MP4), then arms are another good LDoN candidate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completely over looking the repetitiveness of it, the blandness, etc lets look at time investment.<br />
<br />
Approximately 5000 points per item (item plus augs)<br />
Approximately 100 adventures per item (51 points per adventure)<br />
Approximately 150-200 hours per item (1.5-2 hours per adventure)<br />
Multiply that by 10 items<br />
1500-2000 HOURS or LDoN time for those items<br />
Divide by 20 hours per week<br />
75-100 WEEKS<br />
Divide by 52 (weeks in a year)<br />
<br />
Final:<br />
1.5 - 2 YEARS of time for 10 pieces of gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Saar<br />
<br />
1.5 - 2 hours per adventure? Something is seriously wrong there. I am Bazaar geared and finish a normal LDoN in 30 to 45 minutes. It takes something seriously going wrong for it to take longer than that. A hard LDoN can take as much as the full time alotment, but its not worth it. In the time it takes to do a single 70 point adventure, I can do 2 - 51 point adventures, and make more points.<br />
<br />
At 51 points per adventure you are looking at 98 adventures (4998 points) not 100. <br />
98 * 45 minutes =  73.5 hours<br />
By your 10 items is 735 hours<br />
Dividing by 20 hours a week is 36.75 weeks<br />
Figuring a month as 4 weeks that in just over 9 months.<br />
<br />
I am using your numbers here to make the points that a) it should not take that long to get the gear, and b) there are issues in the way the groups you have been in are working together. I would suggest that you look at the group dynamics and see what could be done to improve them. <br />
B) is not intended as a flame in any way. I am not going to guess at what the problem is, but something is not clicking for your groups.<br />
<br />
As for Augs (based on Quick Purchasable Augment List  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=17949) <br />
1450 pnts - 5 augs<br />
1150 pnts - 9 augs<br />
760 pnts - 7 augs<br />
510 pnts - 3 augs<br />
340 pnts - 3 augs<br />
150, 100, and 40 pnts - 1 aug at each level.<br />
That makes the average aug price 859 points.<br />
Based on the average aug price and a piece of 1492 armor that places the completed slot at 4069 points not 5000.<br />
That is 80 adventures with points left over.<br />
End result of this is 7 and a half months to equip 10 slots.</div></div><hr />

Wow...  I see a lot of great changes and plans, but this one looks really great. I think its safe to say that SoE is feeling the heat and if thy stick to their guns, itll get toa point where we will be the only ones to blame if EQ sucks, cause they are going to be listening to us and doing what we want. This is how it should have always been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I agree, this one is the only really significant change which would benefit the casual and raid players alike.   However, don't hold your breath waiting or it.  This will be incredibly hard for SoE to implement for all classes at all levels with the appropriate level of risk/reward.  If they give melee classes NPC healers, why wouldn't they give casters NPC kei?, etc., etc.  City of Heroes can do this, and does it well, because it was designed around this concept.  Trying to bandaid EQ at this point will be next to impossible.  <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see this go live, I just don't have the faith in SoE.  This was low on their list and the amount of effort to make it work is huge.  I just don't see them making the investment with Omens a few weeks away and EQII by year end.  <br />
<br />
This summit and it's results/promises offer absolutely nothing to the casual gamer. Raiders rejoice, you will soon have the servers to yourselves.  The 30-50 crowd, as they stated, will be gone, due to neglect.<br />

I think that anyone who is doing 20 hours per week is not a casual gamer. I'm lucky if I'm able to chalk up 10 hours per week. Anyone who can put in 20 hours (say 4 nights a week at 5 hours a time) could easily join a raiding guild and progress that way.<br />
<br />
Plus you're not talking into account the time taken to get a group to set up etc. I think an hour is a fair minimum for a LDoN raid unless you are able to get a set of guildies together right away.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong I'm not out to flame I like the LDoN idea, and would love the Idea of a solo version when I know I can log on with an hours play and earn something that eventually will get me some armour/spells etc.<br />
<br />
I think Sony are out of whack with this &quot;most people fall in the 30-50 range&quot; On AB the majority of people you bump into are 60+ or if they are on an alt they have a main that's 60+ I think I've met one person in the last 3 months that was a true newbie.<br />
<br />
I have 2 accounts and only 2 other chars besides my main that are over 30. the rest are all lowbies that I use for mules/fun. I think that they should qualify the figure explaing how they come to that figure. It's no good including alts if they have not been played for 3 months etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Hey I know, lets degenerate this thread into another &quot;Raider vs Casual&quot; flame-fest, like the other 10 active threads on the subject!<br />
<br />
Honestly, the non-raider (I now REFUSE to use the term &quot;casual&quot;. If you are a truly casual player, you have TONS of content and quests and other things to see and do) didnt get much here so far. I am a &quot;casual raider&quot;, 10-15 hours a week, some on raids, some on other content, but I rarely log in more than 3 days in a row strictly for raids. I applaud the changes I see, especially the Time fixes (I am 1 kill from Time). But overall, the non-raider didnt get much in the way of improvements, with the exception of removable augs (something that HAD to happen anyway). Nothing on opening up the EPs or Sol Ro though, which is what I was hoping to see. <br />
<br />
Honestly though, I think a big problem with the attitude of the general non-raider is they seem to believe everything they read on boards like this, and therefore dismiss Gates entirely as &quot;too hard, need to be EP geared to be effective&quot; etc, instead of heading that way and checking it out for themselves. I think a lot of players would be pleaesantly suprised at the level of gear that is easily available there, and the number of places to camp for it while getting acceptable XP. <br />
<br />
/shrug. I will play &quot;wait and see&quot; and when OoW comes out, we will see what sort of zones SOE decides to stick in. Personally, I have no plans to leave EQ. I have achieved a balance of raiding and non-raiding content that keeps me entertained. I went through my &quot;totally addicted&quot; stages where the game stagnated, but now, I try to keep it simple. <br />
<br />
Raider, non-raider, casual, whatever, if you play TOO MUCH your GOING to get stagnated and discouraged, PERIOD!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">So tell me, are the raiders the ones generating the lion's share of the EQ revenue?  I seriously doubt it.  Sounds like the casual players are the heart of the player base, which again is being ignored.  I knew this would happen when I saw who they were inviting to this summit.  Fine, if they want to focus on high end raiding, then they can watch their player base shrink to a few thousand while CoH and WoW get their player bases to 500k+, because they cater to casual players first, not just power players.  They've got the 80/20 rule backwards and continue to focus on the 20%, what morons.<br />
<br />
Ignoring for the moment the question of what a casual player is, try counting noses sometime.  How many guilds are there on your server that are (1) time flagged, (2) elemental flagged?<br />
<br />
I asked the question on the SK boards, and one answer I got was &quot;30 percent raiding&quot; and that was said to be too low for some servers.<br />
<br />
300k subscribers, 50 servers, about 6k subscribers a server.  Count the number of time or elemental flagged guilds on your server, multiply by average roster size and that'll give you a guess at the percentage.<br />
<br />
Of course it ignores bot accounts, and other fun stuff.  I'm also stunned at the thought that the majority of the player base is 30-50. The majority of the created characters might be, but I don't see a lot of player base there.<br />

<br />
Rough numbers I tend to toss out are 400K accounts, 45? servers, 9K per server, 10 EP/Time guilds, 2 others &quot;raiding consistantly&quot; be in lower PoP, VT, Luclin, average 130 per Guild (people) with 1/2 of those having more than one account (say 70 additional accounts per guild) so:<br />
<br />
200 accounts per guild (a very conservative estimate, as many guilds NEVER really lose an account, someone takes over from people who retire). 12 guilds that raid (again, your server may vary. Mine is one of the more populated, and we have about 14 or 15 guilds that &quot;raid&quot; more than a couple times a week). 2400 accounts per server of &quot;people who raid&quot;. 2400/9000 = 27% raidering players, and I think thats a low-ball conservative estimate. I put the actual count around 30-35%. <br />
<br />
Still, thats 65% &quot;non-raiders&quot;. However, of that 65%, I am willing to bet that a full 45%-50% are &quot;truly casual&quot; and play 10 hours a week or less, and are FAR less fustrated becasue they havent even come near &quot;The Wall&quot;. That leaves about 15%-20% &quot;harder core non-raiders&quot;. <br />
<br />
Note, I pulled these numbers out of my a$$ and they in no way represent any true distilation of people. Just a rough guess. I think the &quot;raiders&quot; number is darn close though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Current gaming mags subscription numbers for MMORPGs show EQ at 425,000 (SoE's numbers, take with a grain of salt).  So, by your logic, if you do the math you should use 425k instead of 300k or even 400k.  That's another 25-125k &quot;non-raiding&quot; players, since you have already counted all the &quot;raiders&quot;.  <br />
<br />
No, I don't want to start another raider vs. non-raider issue.  I don't raid, but i would if I could.  My point is that, like many who have posted, even raiders, I have limited time to play EQ, and I play at odd hours (6-7am ET everyday for example).  Try getting an LDoN group at that time.<br />
<br />
Therefore, it boggles my mind that SoE would finally get a bunch of player &quot;reps&quot; together and spend 99% of the time talking about raiding issues, which only impact about 20-30% of the entire player base.  What is wrong with this picture?  If you ran any other business that way you'd be out of business in no time.  <br />
<br />
EverRaid my survive based on the 20-30% + others who have not realized that if you are not raiding, then you get no attention.  However, I honestly believe that this attitude will result in much lower subscriptions in the coming months.  <br />
<br />
EQ has real competition now, from CoH and soon from WoW, both of which have been designed from the start with casual (time-limited) players in mind.  Hell, SoE knows that is the future (only way to get and keep 1M+ subcribers), they've added similar features to EQII.  However, they won't be able to change the direction of EQ in time to save it.  They've been working for 5 years to make EQ more group and raid oriented, nerfing soloing along the way.  No way they can turn the Titanic now.  Too much effort, too late in the game, just to hang on to folks until EQII comes along.  And if you think you are ignored now, you can forget about support after EQII launches. <br />
<br />
Yes, I can do an LDoN in 60-70 minutes (no, we are not all 65 with over 200 aa's, so it may take us mere mortals a bit longer playing with folks our own level), so I can get my 24 pts (at level 58).  But add 30-45 min to get a group (even if I start one, I have to find the other 5 and wait for everyone to show up, get kei, get buffed, etc.).  Yes, you can go with less than 6, but we all know the scaling of the missions is not done well, so you are gimped with less than 6.  Do mission, then another 10-15 min to run back, sell loot and split pp.  Over 2 hours for most adventures, 90 min if I'm really lucky.<br />
<br />
Well, I know it's my problem, but I rarely have 2 hours of uninterrupted time to dedicate to one adventure.  If I LD or have to leave for any reason, I can't rejoin.  Once out of the adventure, I have to start the process all over again to get another.  Contrast this with CoH, where I can have multiple missions on my list ready to go when I log on.  I can do them solo, and most take 20 minutes.  If I have to get out early, it is still there waiting for me next time I log on.  And they actually have a story line that develops as I complete the missions and in some cases impact the next mission(s), vs. the LDoN stand alone adventures with no purpose.  <br />
<br />
I guess CoH and WoW are just better fits for my playstyle, I can accept that.  I just wish that SoE would pull their heads out of their butts and realize that they are also losing many players such as myself.  2 accounts, over 2 years played, and willing to play another 2+ years if they would only give me a little attention.<br />
<br />
P.S.  And btw, what the hell happened to spending 6 weeks fixing the current problems in the game prior to moving on to Omens.  Did they mean only raiding problems.  What about the 100's of bugs currently in game?  Try fixing some of those and you won't need as much Customer Support.  Man, are they blind or just stupid?<br />

I think you are spot on with the numbers. It's also worth noting that it's only the raiders in the top end of the content that are having problems, and they are the ones shouting the loudest. Assuming that 20% of each servers population falls into this category, sony's biggest problem is fixing it for that 20% without breaking it for the other 80%.</div></div><hr />

This puts a serious grind in front of people with no reward and they're at the mercy of the groups they're in.  If everyone wants to go to Nro and you're looking for EF adventures, you could spend hours either trying to get a group doing EF or form one yourself.<br />
<br />
I've done 58 LDoN adventures(started 6 weeks ago, I quit the game right when LDoN came out), 54 have been successful.  Because you can't remove augs and most of them are type3 anyway, I have exactly three things I can spend my points on until I hit the magical 30 adventures: RGC, Bane and the Etched Sandstone of Warmth from Tak.  I'm pretty well equipped (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1007943) with a scattering of bazaar gear, ornate, LDoN dropped gear and a single piece of gear I got from a raid so far.  None of the lower point LDoN equipment is worth purchasing.  And now they're talking about adding more expensive gear to LDoN from the summit.<br />
<br />
I wish they'd just remove the point cap so I can spend points that I have earned NOW rather than having to wait on hitting the point cost in adventures.  It worked when LDoN came out so people didn't get the highest point stuff right away and gave people something to unlock, now it's just another grind.</div></div><hr />

Spiritblood made an excellent counter to this comment.  It would be harder to notice issues at that level of play when you're wearing elemental/time gear.  A true casual player in pre-elemental gear would have a harder go of it and see issues that are comparable to those that you might experience, but in tougher LDoN or tier 3 content (I do agree that in BoT, normal LDoN and even HoH that these issues are arguably non-existant, even for true casuals) as oppossed to elementals and later GoD trials.</div></div><hr />

The raider has 1 1/2.  All content from Kunark - Luclin can be accessed with 1 group with the possible exception of 1 piece of the VT key.  LDoN and LoY were both for the non-raider.  1/2 of PoP right now you will need a raid to access and of course about 75% of GoD (everything after Ikk 1 group trials) will need a raid.  That's still 90% of the zones that can be gotten to without a raid.  The problems that exist today in EQ are mostly problems associated with raiding.  The shaman isn't having problems in BoT in groups, he's having problems in raids filling his role as defined by his class.<br />

I'm not taking a side on this one yet (only because I haven't thought it through - I think you know I don't hesitate to state my opinions here  :p ), but I find it interesting that one form of grinding is ok yet another invokes such strong critcism.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for someone to defend the insultingly bland pile of excrement that is LDoN, you have the wrong troll.  But you have always had to grind for gear in EQ, whether you ground 30 hours in the Frenzy camp for a FBSS, or ground through 30 Time raids to get a breastplate.  You didn't have to grind to download game fixes.  <br />
<br />
Game fixes should not be done with AA, period.  You did not have to grind 20 AA to remove the hybrid XP penalty.  You did not have to grind 20 AA for root to stack with snare.  Warriors did not have to grind 20 AA to get real taunting.  Hybrids did not have to grind 20 AA to have their weapon or defensive skill caps raised.  We did not have to grind 20 AA to get the DoT movement penalty removed.  Pet hold should not be an AA.  It's BS.<br />
<br />
Really, I am surprised they don't make you grind 20 AA's to download the fix for dx9 collision bugs.  Then they could say they added more free content on the website.</div></div><hr />

So, I guess it comes down to what people view as an &quot;enhancement&quot; versus a &quot;bug fix&quot;?  True, warriors didn't have to grind 20 AA's for the Incite line, but they did need 23 AA's for AE Taunt (5 for the AA and 18 to be eligible for it - total of 23 AA's needed.)  I guess I fail to see why new types of abilities shouldn't have a cost associated with them?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">From the various posts on the Summit I have seen there is ... nothing to see here.<br />
<br />
2 bones tossed out: fixing raid content problems and solo instancing of LDoNs. ***. Fixing raid content (PoT timers) should of never made it to the summit.They should of already been addressed and fixed ... months ago. Telling the player base this in &quot;now&quot; a priority ... well, speaks volumes about SOE's priorities up to this point.<br />
<br />
Solo instancing? Early 'press' releases of the LDoN expansion led players to 'believe' the instanced dungeons would be balanced, based on the group size and makeup, for parties of 3 or more. The first couple of months if you were not on top of your game in a solid 6 person group you were dead trying an LDoN normal. SOE nerfed the difficulty to 'balance' the encounters ... and stealth nerfed the drops/xp to risk/reward balance the content. As for the lure of 'instanced zones based on group size and makeup' ... never happened. Never even attempted. Now the plan is to adjust these zones so even a soloer can do them? Sounds like some programmer has been put back onto the project they couldn't get done in the expansion development.<br />
<br />
So they are adding new levels of items to LDoN. The merit system of LDoN is so flawed it is dumbed down to the point of stupidity. Tons of hours for tons of points to acquire a single item that can only be purchased if you have the points from a specific theme dungeon. LDoN was also hailed in PR as a way for casuals to acquire items close to the highest level raid gear in 'single group' encounters. Of course the time sink required to get a single piece of gear for a casual player makes 'acquiring' A item as restrictive as joining a Time guild and raiding. In short, pretty much pointless and unattainable for someone with 10 hours or less a week playtime. Example: a level 20 doing LDoN for that uber level appropriate robe will find that robe a waste of points by they time they earn enough points to purchase it ... so they have to set their sights on the next item ... just as far, point wise, away ... to only reach that point and rinse/repeat. Of course there is the top end items and some are useful/necessary. But you have to get to the end game to get it ... after you have been there awhile, mindlessly slugging away for the points. It is just damn nonsense. Where is the logic? It is clearly not based on the whole point of the expansion - cater to the casual player working to have substantial, quality gear. Not the best. Not the most powerful ... just substantial, quality gear.<br />
<br />
Did SOE think if they made items less expensive the raiding guilds would stop raiding and simply dance for joy in LDoN? Raiders are just that. Raiders. Players who want to face the biggest foe in the toughest parts of the game and beating the encounter. Part of it is for the gear, but that is the icing on the cake. It is the challenge and the pushing of character abilities on a large scale that is the impetus for raiders.<br />
<br />
So why was LDoN made as gear acquisition restrictive as upper level raiding? Was it to not upset raiders that, of course, would cry that their efforts were 'nerfed' since non-raiders can get near quality gear for less overall effort? That is my guess ... once again tailoring even alternative routes of advancement to the wims and whines of the raiding guilds - before it ever happened. Another, to me, excellent example of how far removed from the actual game at all levels of player wants and needs SOE is. And how SOE is so pathologically focused on the squeaky wheel when the whole damn car is falling apart.<br />
<br />
I found it illuminating that SOE focused on the high end raiders as the primary summit attendees. These are the visible, group targetable core of EQ. They are the screamers and yellers (and FANBOIS/GAME NAZIS) where the word of content value and game quality filters down to the masses and is believed. They are the voice of the game. So yeah, doing some hand holding to this crowd is PR. &quot;Look, we held a summit. We listened. We made a list to 'work' on.&quot; F*** if I don't see some massive mind-dupping in this.<br />
<br />
Ironically, at this point in the playerbase state of dissatisfaction, SOE still has no clue that a placebo to the top guilds is a dillusional SOE self-mind f***. The anger, frustration and game disappointment at this point is pretty much ingrained in folks who have played any character to 65. This is infectious and has begun, exponentially, to filter down to newer players. Folks are leaving - at all levels, in equal amounts - because SOE has ignored, browbeat and lied too many times. SOE shot itself in the foot ... and they wonder who has the gun?<br />
<br />
So now it is time to sell the promise of showing concern and paying attention. Frankly, as has been stated here for months - actions speak louder than words. Up to this point the lack of action has spoken volumes. We shall see how much of the end result that makes it into game is progression and a new dedication to the game ... and how much is fluff and fodder. I can't help but think of the same tactic used on us with the Nihil and better heal issues we had. Primarily the heal. We asked for a simple increase to 1800ish ... SOE graciously compromised with a 1500ish (not looking up actual amount) heal, danced around in joy and shouted from the mountain tops that &quot;they listen to player issues.&quot; Every freaking shaman here pointed out that, no ... they did not listen since the change was not enough to solve the problem we faced. What we suggested was what was needed based on (insert tons of parsed reports here) ... not a pipe-dream, or wish, or too much to ask for. What was presented was SOE's compromise value - an increase in healing power that did not even address the problem, much less fix establishing Shaman as a generic primary healer and effective, higher level content, backup healer. Yet, on SOE's whiner's list, this issue was crossed off. F***ing clueless.<br />
<br />
But now, after the summit, we have a 'new' list and 'fixes' on the way. Once the list is brought into game I am extremely curious where the actual fixes address the actual problems - and to what degree/percent. Yeah, tad bit bitter here. Bitter because EQ still has the greatest possible potential to be the best game out there - and for a long time to come. Yet, management has no clue about anything other than the bottomline profit. &quot;Duh, SOE is a business!&quot; Well, folks, in today's wonderful marketplace business has forgetten the single most obvious golden rule: if you take care of your customers, the business takes care of itself.<br />
<br />
EQ is a fan based business. You have to keep your fans. Your fans have to sing your praises to bring in new customers. That is the cycle. What SOE has to do is make the game entertaining enough to get the fans singing. Not just the raider fans; not just the casual fans; not just the everything inbetween fans. ALL THE FANS. And that is content. Variable, various content that meets the wants and needs of the user - whoever that is.<br />
<br />
Sadly, from what I read on this list, SOE doesn't have clue f***ing one they need to do this, much less the inclination to do so. Then again, I have bitten the bitter pill after 5 years of playing. I grew with this game and at first the game grew with me. For too long that has stopped being the case. The game stopped growing and developing. It just became more of the same ... with a dash of idiocy tossed in from time to time ... to time ... to time. Content is not just killing the next version of the same mob adjusted to compensate for the gear you have at the time of release. Content has so many positive directions it could take. Group adventure quests. Solo adventure quests. With the concept of flagging there, tie it into offshoot quests for raiders.<br />
<br />
Quests that do not involve killing mob X 5 thousands times to get a single drop. Tradeskill and advanced skill progression that actually results in something tangable. Give me alchemy skills that let me actually make FoS/Fo7 potions that don't cost my first born to attempt to make in a combine that has a trivial level 300 points above maximum attainable skill level. In short - stop making my efforts in the game limited by walls of restriction. Stop f***ing the playerbase with game limitations that make absolutely no sense whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Well, the onus is on SOE now. It has been much longer than they have realized. Not just for me. There are lots - a very significant portion of the real player base. SOE has to prove they are knowledgeble about the game, have goals for future direction, define classes and work towards both class balance and class individuality, develop content for EVERY type of EQ player and ... basically, get their f***ing act together. Big goals. Worth doing. An uphill climb. After all ... if you take care of your customers your business takes care of itself.</div></div><hr />

What you are proposing is not questing, it is grinding your way to the elementals and beyond. I disagree with this idea.<br />
<br />
I would much rather see some other kind of progression (although I absolutely fail to see what is wrong with pop flagging to be honest) along the lines of a scripted event in place of a grind. Have something like the POJ prisoner escape quest, where you have to single group spawn a prisoner and aid it in an escape attempt, with scripted spawns, like the hedge maze, but for 1 group.<br />
<br />
Have some kind of SolRo entry quest occuring in Tactics where you have to take a hardy group down into the pit to make your way deep into the tunnels. Fight your way to some NPC and get whisked into an LDON style tactics zone, with an objective. Have this be bloody, and I mean extremely, as in painfully, difficult but doable. End result is a SolRo key. There, single group event, plus a sense of achievement. Who woulda thunk it.<br />
<br />
Once in SolRo have the towers be blocked unless some subquest be opened. Categorically do not put a zone out there. It's not difficult to get out, although for some it's hard to get out and keep their gear...... whatever, it's easy to get a gate potion.<br />
<br />
And so on, and so forth. Utilize the LDON engine to make these quests so that the fundamentals of the zones remain intact. Give pseudo keys that prohibit the targetting of some mobs so that if you are a pseudo flagged individual you cannot attack the trigger mob for a ring event (ala dusty warder).<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />

- Omens of War has only one locked zone, the rest of it is open to all players.<br />
- While Epic 2.0s are for the uberist of the ubers, Epic 1.5s are available to the rest of us.<br />
- Some sort of instanced solo adventure is in the works.<br />
- The Omens of War task system, a small 30 minute quest system, will be available to levels 20 and above.<br />
- There will be a quest for Gates of Discord spells, though details aren't available.<br />
- Chat channels cross over between Everquest and Everquest 2.<br />
- The development team wishes they never called it Everquest 2.<br />
- Soon augments can be removed and replaced on other items.<br />
- Smedley loves pirates.<br />
- The graphic engine update we went through will help EQ stay graphically competitive with other MMOGs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Current gaming mags subscription numbers for MMORPGs show EQ at 425,000 (SoE's numbers, take with a grain of salt).  So, by your logic, if you do the math you should use 425k instead of 300k or even 400k.  That's another 25-125k &quot;non-raiding&quot; players, since you have already counted all the &quot;raiders&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Therefore, it boggles my mind that SoE would finally get a bunch of player &quot;reps&quot; together and spend 99% of the time talking about raiding issues, which only impact about 20-30% of the entire player base.  What is wrong with this picture?  If you ran any other business that way you'd be out of business in no time.<br />
I am not gonna get into this too deeply, but I think SOE knows the numbers better than we do. We are constantly polled with quickie 1-click questions like &quot;How many accounts do you own&quot; or &quot;How many lvl 65 Characters do you have&quot; or &quot;How often do you raid (more than 2 groups)&quot; and &quot;How often do you play&quot;. The answers to these types of questions tell them where to direct their marketing. People like that live for numbers. <br />
<br />
I will stick to my 25-30% raid, 45-50% casual, the rest &quot;non-raid, non-casual&quot;. To be perfectly honest, I think the % of people who are hardcore (more than 25 hours a week) and non-raiders is very very low. <br />
<br />
The TRUE casual crowd has not had to face these issues in high volume. They have access to decent gear. They have lots of things they can do. They have goals they are not churning through with such repetiviness that they get SICK of the game completly. But the &quot;harder core&quot; players, be they raiders or non-raiders, are GOING to get to that wall faster. Especially non-raiders, because they CHOOSE to avoid half of the game itself, which is Raiding. <br />
<br />
No one, raider or otherwise, should have to grind AA's for a fix to the game.<br />
<br />
Izzy I don't mean to pick on you here, but you had the most concise statement to quote for this topic.<br />
<br />
I disagree 100%. I think AAs are one of the BEST ways to balance classes. If you are advanced enough in the content of the game itself that some of the balance issues we have seen have become a MAJOR problem, then THAT is the point in the content to fix the balance, not overall. How do you do this fairly though? Spells that drop in zones not everyone has access too is one way, but I think we ALL can agree THAT sucks. Gear? Balancing around gear has never been a genius idea in any situation, really. Whats left? <br />
<br />
AA. <br />
<br />
Give the people who NEED specialized skills for the content they are working on the ability to achieve those skills, but do NOT make them completely out of reach for the &quot;average Joe&quot; like Ancient spells and gear attributes. This way, Uqua Shamans can buy some AA for, say, another -20 resist modifier on Nihil, or another 25% chance to crit nuke, or an MGBable Paragon/Spirit of the Wood spell. LDoN and BoT level shamans do not &quot;need&quot; these things, but, if they WANT them, they can go get them. I would make the requirements big though. <br />
<br />
This is similar to my idea of balancing our burst DPS by adding an AA that would add 1K damage to Spear of Torment pre-focus/crit. Make it require FoM3 and the Gates FoM, as this is an AA skill the &quot;average&quot; shaman probably doesnt invest in until VERY late in the list. However, if the &quot;average&quot; shaman wants it, its there. FoM is a big ass AA to get, though, we are talking 40+ if you start from scratch, not counting however many the AA itself costs (lets say 5, 10, 15 for +200, +300, +500). A 1700 fastish nuke would be a sweet addition to the arsenal of the Uqua+ Shamans, but not really required for the &quot;average&quot; shaman to survive.</div></div><hr />

I really don't think thats what they are talking about. For the most part they seem content with ldon and simular instanced zones being the progression path for single groups or small guilds. Personally I think PoP flagging is fine the way it is too with the changes since release (out of order flagging, 15% etc). The flagging issues they seem to be talking about are more related to back flagging for high end guilds. Why should a guild killing quarm in time have to go back and do terris thule to flag thier people for elementals? They sure as heck don't need the loot and would rather be spending thier time doing something else yet to have them flagged for the elementals people still needing it.<br />
<br />
As an elemental or time flagged guild the biggest issue in back flagging people is not killing the mobs. That part has become trivial by comparison to things your killing regularly. The problem becomes getting access to the mobs. Since the up and coming guilds are doing them for flagging and loot, ie the people who really should be doing them, they aren't just sitting up for other guilds to do at thier leasure. Short of fully instancing any flagging mob I'd like to see place holders like exsist in PoEarth. Even if the event's aren't up you can do them, kill the place holder and still get your flags even if you don't get any loot. Put Ph mobs in and make them respawn noticably faster 6-24 hours. Make em just as hard or even harder than the regular mob with no loot on em but let people kill em for flagging.<br />
<br />
I know flag sharing etc is possible but that doesn't work out well alot of the time either. It takes alot of time and effort to coordinate and since it's typically done by other guilds during your guilds prime time you loose that member from your raid. Often times that is noticably longer than if you just did the event yourself. If it isn't during your raid time it can be just as bad since often times players aren't or can't be on outside of your typical raid time. Obviously you also have little to no input on what mobs they do so if you've got person x missing mob y it may be along time before they do said mob. All in all it would be much simpler if you could just know that a mob or PH would be up and kill him with out worrying about access to the mob.</div></div><hr />

This is how it should have always been.<br />
<br />
Umm, no.  When you are in charge of something you are responsible for its success and its failure.  You can't pass the buck to someone else by saying, &quot;From now on, I will do exactly as you say.&quot; and absolve yourself from all responsibility.<br />
<br />
Also, you can't ever do what the EQ population wants.  There will always be many vocal people on both sides of nearly every issue, except maybe &quot;It was more fun before, make it more fun now.&quot;  And even at that you will have dozens of different, non-compatible ideas as to how to make it fun.<br />

The biggest division seems to be between the casuals and the raiders but also the PvPers and the Bluebies, the soloers and the groupers and on and on.</div></div><hr />

Thats a great idea you know. Hit a wall go on toss all connections aside and restart. It works for raiders too!<br />
<br />
What it is old content? And? If it is good enough for the non raiders it should be good enough for you too right?<br />
<br />
I did Luclin. I did Velious. I did all of kunark. I have been to every zone except the raid required keyed zones of Velious and Luclin. I have been to every non raid required Zone in Pop. (And even a couple raid ones too. Like BoT before it was opened and Tactics before BoT was opened as well.) I keyed every damn person in my guild with the tactics Key quest. That key quest by the way was just as tedious as backflagging. just on a smaller scale than A full on raid. <br />
<br />
I would have done GoD as well but by the time that was released my moral was at an all time low. And the damn place was just not fun when you were three hits as dead with my gear. Maybe with the revamp it isnt quite that bad but trying to go after time geared content with my gear is at best foolish and at worst obsessive. Could I do it. Yeah I could. I could put together a group of folks and run the place to a point but at the end of the day it wasnt going to be fun so why bother. GoD was ugly and uninspired. And plain old unfun. <br />
<br />
So my choices in content are what. Raiders bitch about backflagging old content. Guess what saying go to velious is backflagging old content for me and mine. We might not have farmed the hell out of Avatar of war like the ubers But we have been killed by him a couple times. And yeah maybe just maybe beating him would be kindof neat once or maybe twice but when it takes an act of god to get 20 people on at the same time and we travel there and clear through Kael (Invising up is gimp in my opinion but certainly saves time.) Only to see that the Local uberguild bots are farming him for loot to sell or something. Well Once doing that is enough for me. <br />
<br />
Non raiders deserve some content made for them. In every expansion. Just like The raiders got thier LDoN raids.. But wait those were boring and uninspired right? Guess what sparky. The rest of LDON is like that too you know. <br />
<br />
The game sucks for the non raiders at the moment. Becasue when it comes down to it there is a ceiling we cannot get past around or under or over. And that is a feeling that sucks for anyone. Just like the rathe council knobBlock was back in the day. <br />
<br />
It sucks to be blocked. Because of design descions. Raider or not. casual or not. Then be asked to pony up more cash for stuff that doesnt really have you in mind in the first place. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">1.5 - 2 hours per adventure? Something is seriously wrong there. I am Bazaar geared and finish a normal LDoN in 30 to 45 minutes. It takes something seriously going wrong for it to take longer than that. A hard LDoN can take as much as the full time alotment, but its not worth it. In the time it takes to do a single 70 point adventure, I can do 2 - 51 point adventures, and make more points.<br />
<br />
A hard gives 109 points, not 70. In addition, random nameds in those adventures drop gear that is likely pretty good for most casual players.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">I disagree 100%. I think AAs are one of the BEST ways to balance classes. If you are advanced enough in the content of the game itself that some of the balance issues we have seen have become a MAJOR problem, then THAT is the point in the content to fix the balance, not overall. How do you do this fairly though? Spells that drop in zones not everyone has access too is one way, but I think we ALL can agree THAT sucks. Gear? Balancing around gear has never been a genius idea in any situation, really. Whats left? <br />
<br />
AA. <br />
<br />
Give the people who NEED specialized skills for the content they are working on the ability to achieve those skills, but do NOT make them completely out of reach for the &quot;average Joe&quot; like Ancient spells and gear attributes. This way, Uqua Shamans can buy some AA for, say, another -20 resist modifier on Nihil, or another 25% chance to crit nuke, or an MGBable Paragon/Spirit of the Wood spell. LDoN and BoT level shamans do not &quot;need&quot; these things, but, if they WANT them, they can go get them. I would make the requirements big though. <br />
<br />
This is similar to my idea of balancing our burst DPS by adding an AA that would add 1K damage to Spear of Torment pre-focus/crit. Make it require FoM3 and the Gates FoM, as this is an AA skill the &quot;average&quot; shaman probably doesnt invest in until VERY late in the list. However, if the &quot;average&quot; shaman wants it, its there. FoM is a big ass AA to get, though, we are talking 40+ if you start from scratch, not counting however many the AA itself costs (lets say 5, 10, 15 for +200, +300, +500). A 1700 fastish nuke would be a sweet addition to the arsenal of the Uqua+ Shamans, but not really required for the &quot;average&quot; shaman to survive.<br />
<br />
I agree Blazz (with possible exceptions for horribly out of balance situations, but overall I'm beginning to think the AA route is a good one.)</div></div><hr />

Yup, that is allmost certainly the reason for the perception. The drop in apparent xp per adventure co-incided with the adjustments that made collects the most efficient method of winning quickly.

No, wrong. My standard LDoN adventures takes like 60 minutes in the dungeon killing. The time has not changed much. Sure, sometimes when you go for Assassinate mission you get lucky because you took the right way and end up near the named.<br />
But over time, over like 50 LDoNs, time to complete is still the same. And XP has gone down a lot. I am totally sure I didnt need 3 x 1 hour LDoN for 1 AA point back then.<br />

Like running into a Warrior with only Crit hits and Flurry and Punishing blade with no Defensive AA. And having him Say I am a DPS Warrior. <br />

Is he a Dps warrior yes. Is it the smartest thing to do. Under his perticular circumstances maybe. But he would be lambasted for that build if he said anything. <br />

Now I am all for Allowing people to truly customise thier charecter and to screw thing up beyond all reconigition. I mean I took 14 points of dex at charecter creation cause the original Prima guide said it helped to hit and I wanted to be a meele shaman. At level 60 Mid velious I had a 111 Wisdom. By choice. I went regen and hitpoints and back then gear of that type only had that type of stuff on it. No wisdom. But Iw as still effective with Canidance and sheer stubborness and working about 4 times harder than anyone else. <br />
<br />
The AA would have to have certain qualifiers like what you mentioned like Taking Spell casting mastery and such. And at no time should There be a best path. Or a limit upon what was able to be taken with enough time invested. Or to be honest there should be a quest that unlocks the choice. With lots of lore involved. And a way to get it raiding.

I don't know how you are collecting your information but I wouldn't trust it at all.  If you were to actually kill mobs in these zones you would see that over say a 55 mob adventure you will get noticably less (20-25% or so) experience.<br />
<br />
The coin drop rate, aug drop rate, and named spawn rate has also been significantly nerfed, to the point of nearly zero.  There are adventure themes now where mobs simply do not drop plat where it used to be common.  Named used to be very common, now they are extremely rare - the same with augments.<br />

I have no statistics to provide for evidence but I wouldn't trust ShowEQ or similar software in LDoN zones because of how the instance programming would interfere with accurate data reporting.</div></div><hr />

Yes, we do it faster now, but 50 kills is still 50 kills.  Also, used to get more coin drop/split.  I had suspected that the ML was ripping us off, so I have started doing ML and sure enough, it rarely breaks 100pp at the split.</div></div><hr />

Any chance there is a bug that is causing issues with the ldon xp and/or drops?  The reason I ask is because of the number of people here (and on other boards I visit) that have posted about &quot;definitely&quot; seeing a change over time.  I realize we don't have access to the real data and I have no idea about the technical aspects of how EQ is put together, but a bug was the one thing I was thinking could explain the difference.  (either that or the perception is truly wrong - which I think is possible...I'm just trying to rule out game issues.)<br />

Exp mods might not have changed, but did you look to see if the actualy numerical amount of experience granted for each kill has been changed?  If the mod stayed the same but the amount of exp per mob was lowered from 1000 per to 800 per your mod would still be unchanged, but overall experience gain is lessened.<br />
<br />
Ive noticed a big drop off in exp from adventures ever since the cash/aug nerf of about 6 months ago.  Maybe one of your fleet fingered programmers lowered one too many lines of code.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for posting Prathun.  I do have a question that maybe you can answer if you are still looking at this thread.  I know that (at least I think I know) if elemental flagged people are doing an instanced hard adventure the mob level increases one notch.  That leads me to think that perhaps the experience modifier in LDON might also be tied to average flagging level?  Thus, if you have an average group flagging level of elemental and for some reason you are doing an normal LDON that the group would take a big experience hit.  Am I correct about this?<br />

While I agree that people doing advntures faster may have something to do with a &quot;percieved&quot; lowering of XP, its awefully hard to deny that there is SOMETHING going on here. <br />
<br />
Group bonuses working? Mob levels correct? <br />
<br />
We all KNOW FOR FACT the loot drops have been nerfed, please do not try to tell us differently, half the mobs don't even drop coin anymore (why did THIS happen BTW? Was that 750 pp worth of stuff we split per-run REALLY that big a deal? Trolls gotta eat ya know). Named spawns are down too. No question. <br />
<br />
Something in the equation is not right. The XP is less. As some have already said, 50 mobs is 50 mobs, and when they used to give you 3/4 of an AA and now that same 50 is less than half, SOMETHING changed. <br />
<br />
And put the dang coin back in. Sheesh that was SO weak. I realize you folks want to pull pp OUT of the game, but lowering the drops on LDoN is HARDLY the way to do it, LOL.</div></div><hr />

I won't dispute this.  The original amount of cash coming from each adventure was deemed too high and we changed it.  The result now may be too little and we can look into that.  What I am disputing are the rumors that experience was reduced, or that the rate of rare spawns was reduced.  They weren't changed.<br />

I know that (at least I think I know) if elemental flagged people are doing an instanced hard adventure the mob level increases one notch.The difficulty of an adventure is based on the average level of the group and if you select normal or hard.  Flags aren't factored in.<br />

I KNOW how much xp I used to get from a normal, all 65, ldon.  It was easily 70%aaxp for a slaughter 50.  Now I get something along the lines of 40%.  Those numbers might move up and down a little whether it is slaughter 50 or 55 or whatever, but THERE IS A CHANGE. <br />

Do you think we are all stupid?  How are there so many people saying they KNOW it is different xp for the same # of kills, yet nothing has changed?  Would it be the first time that a SOE developer messed something up?  <br />

Yeah.  I can see where requesting adventures repeatedly until the one that you prefer comes up is a bit heavy-handed.  I'd like this resolved somehow, but I would want the four types balanced so they all carry approximately the same risk vs. reward first.  In today's world it would simply mean &quot;collect missions&quot; every time.<br />

I'll never do another rescue mission (voluntarily) again. I had a terrible experience where the little DE guy we were trying to rescue would not run over the &quot;trigger&quot; at the end of the adventure in order to flag us the win.<br />
<br />
We ran that little guy all over the room as the timer slowly ticked down, it was horribly frustrating and felt very unfair. We had defeated all the monsters, walked the DE all the way back to the zone in and we STILL couldn't win.<br />
<br />
On a happy note, we did manage to win in the last 5 minutes. But that was 10 stressful minutes I'd never want to do again.<br />

Would there be a chance you might have played any City of Heroes?<br />
<br />
The Mission system there is wonderful. With Monster numbers geared to how many are in groups. With clues dropping during the missions which might lead to another mission. <br />
<br />
Is there any room for new work on LDON? As in making a few of the seperate instances more story driven. Like a Slaughter where once you kill the last one. you find information about a Missing person from Orcish scribblings on a map. You take the Map to someone and they reward you with additional points to take a rescue mission. Once you rescue the person you again get a small bonus and a request for revenge against a Named monster who masterminded the kidnapping. (Assinate or more slaughter. Or something) Then as you go after him You are told that as long as he has the protectiosn of Bob the wonder goblin he is almost unkillable so you need to take away bob the wonder goblins Necklaces. (Collect) Before getting to fight the boss. <br />
<br />
Basicly making something similer to the story arcs of City of heroes. Where you have something you might be slightly attached to in the form of NPC's and story based quests. Rewards of additional AP for completion. So that people get thier cake and eat it too. <br />
<br />
The reason people complain about the LDON system is that there is little reason to go. Other than Timecard punch in. get your 51 and leave. ad nauseam. Give rewards of additional AP for the collection items rather than destroying them Give Additional AP for turning in the Named drops to a wayfarer. Make the chests actually Useful. And again turn it in if you dont need ot for AP. <br />
<br />
This adds a few reasons to go back. An Element of randomness to te Step right up and win a prize feeling of LDON. It might capture peoples imaginations again to have a NPC face to the adventures rather than a Shopping list and Checklist. of point costs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">Since apparently we have a LDoN dev's attention here I'd like to forward a couple suggestions that we've floated here but not had an opportunity to put in front of someone with any sort of influence.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  More settings than just Normal and High risk.  At the very least we'd like to see a Normal / Medium / High risk option, with points and loot scaled to the level selected.<br />
<br />
2.  Differing levels of reward for the different mission types (goes along with being able to select your mission type).  For instance, it's pretty much considered a foregone conclusion that no one will take a rescue.  They are difficult.  Especially with a group that hasn't worked together before, which is kinda what LDoN is all about right?  Anyway, no one plays rescue.  Now, what if, instead of 50 points for a Normal Rescue, the potential gain was 60 points?  What if the experience was noticeably higher?  Then you might see people taking whatever came up.  Basically, reward people in a noticeable and desireable way for taking bigger risks.<br />
<br />
3.  Greater rewards for investigating &quot;interactive objects&quot;.  This especially applies to chests that require the LDoN spells / reagents to open.  I can't tell you how frustrating it is to pop a 17pp reagent  on a chest only to find an &quot;Illusion:  Erudite&quot; potion inside.  I paid 17pp for a 1 in 6 chance to loot an Illusion potion?  Not to mention putting the whole group in the way of harm by even messing with the chest.  Consider putting LDoN spells in those chests, or LDoN armor normally purchased from the vendors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Prathun<br />
<br />
I completely agree about the risk vs. reward issue in LDoN - collect is the best, followed closesly by slaughter...and way behind is assasinate and rescue.  Please keep in mind this RvR issue also effectively means that us non-raiders are effectively doing the same thing every time we login.  If the RvR was equal (or close) for the different types of adventures, I'd gladly do assasinate and rescue missions.<br />
<br />
By the way, I think the RvR issue applies to all of EQ.  Yes, there is tons of content in EQ, but how much is actually used?  (I assume you have the real numbers...I can only make guesses)  For example, why would I go to Torment if I can go to BoT and get better xp and a chance at an ornate drop?  In general RvR is skewed in the favor of a few zones at each xp level.</div></div><hr />

Purely for clarification, the flack comes from the retards, not the more passionate members of the board. There are some here who honestly believe that threatening tactics are the way to win change. <br />

Although I agree with your sentiments and understand that you may be upset, Karshak, there is no need to reduce yourself to their level! I should have but passionate in inverted commas in my post. ;-)<br />

Considering how long it has taken to get SoE actually talking to people at places like the Crucible, the last thing I want is for them to be scared away thinking that all they get is flamed. After all, they do not have to come here.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love LDoNs. I think it gave the casual gamer both something that didn't require camping, competing with other groups or huge raid forces and the prospect of some great loot at the (albeit distant) end. The only problem I find is that, since I live in Australia, a time zone where the fewest people are online, it is often hard to get a good group together. Only a minor quibble.</div></div><hr />
