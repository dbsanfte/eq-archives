<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tolann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've had a brain blow-out.   How do you set that dang on screen timer?<br />
/timer is not a command<br />
/set timer is not a command....<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't think, but I know it exsists!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know, you have to have specific UI alterations to do them, I don't think it's built into the default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tolann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember clicking a box long ago that said never show this window again.   It was with a patch eons ago.   Haven't seen my timer since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The timer that appears when you log in can not be brought up by keystroke commands. You can set it when you begin, but cannot get rid of it and bring it back. This was done to prevent it being used as a spawn timer. You can make your own customized timer at http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp and load it into your UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On the off chance you actually want that alarm window thingy, this is what you need to do:<br />
ShowAlarmWindow=TRUE/FALSE - This toggles whether or not the Alarm UI window will pop up each time you enter the game. If you do not use this, then setting it to FALSE would stop it from popping up.<br />
<br />
On another note, look at Son'y example for autojoin:  <br />
ChannelAutoJoin=serverwide.crucible - This line denotes what channels you will autojoin upon entering the world. These can be adjusted in game by typing /autojoin channelname:password (if any).<br />
