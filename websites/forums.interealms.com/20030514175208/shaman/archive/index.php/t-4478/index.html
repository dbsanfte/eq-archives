She is my best friend IRL and we group together often.  I'm now lvl 48, JBB equiped.  Any suggestions on how I can help her catch up?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you figure out a good way, post, because i haven't been able to pl my gf's chanter at all. she dies way too quick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">PL'n a chanter is hard...<br />
<br />
One quick way is too have a monk kick the crap out of the mobs, then FD, and have the chanter nuke it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depending on the level of the mobs (vs the enchanter) using mem-blur is one way to pl an enchanter. Fight the mob down, root it and have the enchanter toss on 2 or 3 mem-blurs. Enchanter nukes it to death. Even with 3 blurs she may not get exp every time, but it should be in the 95+ percent range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cebilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">a perhaps easier method is to find mobs that are light blue/green to you and blue to the chanter (works best if they are green to you and blue to the chanter) and just smash them down while grouped - you will take less xp than if they were blue to you and the chanter will take full share of the xp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm PLing my 35ish Enchanter with my 49 cleric! I'm doing Bloodgills, at the moment. I have the Cleric root, then land two of the 500+ nukes. The BG must stay rooted the whole time. As soon as the second hits, I have the cleric cast Atone and the Ench cast Mem Blur. Then I have the Ench cast Tash. If the BG spins and looks at the Ench, I know he has aggro. If he's still looking at the cleric, I just keep mem blurring and atoning and tashing (while it's still rooted) until the Ench has aggro. Then the Ench hits it with the level 34 nuke and the level 34 dot. If root breaks at that point, I just let him swim around until it dies. <br />
<br />
I know it wouldn't work quite the same with a shammy, but it might actually be easier. If I was using a shammy, I'd just throw on one ebolt, which gets a BG down to flee mode by the time it wears off. I'd still root it and have the ench keep Mem blurring and tashing until it had aggro, though. That technique should work for any mob. BGs just happen to be weak, so I like them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Best way to PL her is just to group with her and duo up to kill,  if you kill greenies that are blue to her, the exp will fly.  at 48 you can solo OT which should start to green out to you,  and will be very nice blues to her</div></div><hr />

Are you sure that works? I could have sworn that NEITHER of you get xp when you do that. I hope it is true, though, because I'd be able to PL much faster if it were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pretty sure it works.  I'm 55 now but I've been leveling this druid in my guild from 38- now 45. getting her to 46 so she can use her lumi staff</div></div><hr />

<br />
lower level * 1.5 = highest level which can plevel them. <br />
<br />
So a level 10 could only group with up to a level 15 to get exp.. but a level 40 can group with a level 60 and get exp..<br />
<br />
Of course the level 40 only gets 52% (2% for group bonus) and half because they are grouped.. and the other 48% disappears if the mob is green to the 60 (which it most likely will be)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Last night the enchanter (lvl 40) a druid (lvl 52) and I went to OT.  Druid pulled, I smacked them down, enchanter got the experience.  We only stayed for about an hour and she got all most a full yellow.  May not be the fastest method, but it did work.  Again, thanks to all for your suggestions!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I powered my chanter to from 1 to 35 in a few days.  Key is the new rules on pets.<br />
<br />
I pull with malosini line, my pet agros, chanter tashes and resumes medding.  Wait until mob is about to death walk, then chanter stands and casts mez. This breaks agro and mob stands there. Chanter casts mind wipe. Starting around L3O I started casting mind wipe twice for safety.  Chanter then goes and stands close to mob and nukes one, mob wakes up, gets hit and my pet agros. I back up and pet finishes off.  Full exp. Less about bub of mana used.  Usually can recover that during next pull.<br />
<br />
Previously mezz would not help and the pet would finish the mob and there were lots of timing issues. Now it is so easy.  Pets dont take exp now so the key is to have manaless ways to reduce the mobs hp's.  Hence shaman pet.  Pulling with malosi allows for mind wipe to stick easier. Probably will have to change tactics about in the 40's but not much. Toss in Jbb shots probably.</div></div><hr />
