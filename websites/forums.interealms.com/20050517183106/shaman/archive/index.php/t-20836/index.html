<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pyro727</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.  I'm new to this form and to this class.  I played EQ back in '00 and have not played since.  I going to be started from the bottom up.  I'm planning on make a Shaman.  Well just thought I'd say hello.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Pyro :cool:</div></div><hr />

Now go back into EQ, strip your shaman, create a beastlord/bard/ench and have fun playing a NON-useless class, instead of your shaman.<br />
<br />
Kthxbye,<br />

<br />
Sorry Pyro, didn't mean to come off as insulting.  If you take a peak around at some of the threads on the boards today, you'll see that many, many of the shaman around here, including myself, are pretty upset about the state of our class.<br />
<br />
At the higher end game (65+...high risk LDoN/tier4/GoD) we just don't add enough to a group.<br />
<br />
I love my shaman, and we're still a damn powerful class, just not in the &quot;high end&quot; of the game, currently.<br />
<br />
My appologies for coming off so brash, just in a foul mood at the moment.<br />
<br />
Whatever class you play, especially if it's a shaman, I wish you the best of luck, and good times.<br />
<br />
Be well,<br />
-Z</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pyro727</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you.  I got a little freaked reading the posts.  I do understand your being upset about the status of the class.  I'm hoping SOE will work with the players to correct this prob.  I'll not let this stop me if making my shaman.  I'll do my best to enjoy the class.  I didn't get the play one back then so I'm looking forward rolling him up.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Pyro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You will enjoy being a shaman. <br />
<br />
I have been 65 for about 4 or 5 months and have about 56 AA and I have not experienced the problems with the class yet except on rare occasions.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that the problems are not real. I trust the old timers here that say there are problems. I am just saying it will probably be a very long time before you notice them.<br />
<br />
Take your time levelling up and enjoy the journey. Who knows what the class will be like in 6 to 12 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Welcome to the Crucible!<br />
<br />
There is a vast pool of knowledge at your fingertips here, don't be afraid to use it!  But before you ask a question, utilize the &quot;search&quot; function.  Most of the time you can turn up some good information that way.  If not, then ask away.  <br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy the shaman class, I know I have.<br />
<br />
Safe travels and good hunting,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's sort of like in Walking Tall when the guy comes back to his once peaceful hometown, and finds it a haven for scum and villany funded by Moonshine.<br />
<br />
Hehehe, good one.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about all the negativity here. Most of those bitter are the hardcore people on the cutting edge content.<br />
<br />
To see what the problems they are ranting about, you'd not only have to be 65 but likely in a power guild who's doing end game content. Until then Shamans are a fine class and still very popular in groups.<br />
<br />
There are some problems but I expect long before you reach the that level it will be fixed either by changing the content or changing shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The problem about mitigating mobs making shaman slow about the same as a beastlord or enchanters will show up before then.<br />
<br />
But that might be a long time for you, depending on the pace of your progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Shaman character is great up to the point where I am at--level 65 with 35 aa's. By the time you get your character to Level 65, Time Gear, 250 aa's, the balance will have most likely changed so the high level issues will be different. Thus, enjoy a great character through the majority of content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hi :)<br />
<br />
Don't mind us grumpy folk, you've got a long stretch of extremely cool stuff to do before you hit the crappy part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">grumpy grumpy!<br />
<br />
Why are you guys being so down?  He's got a good few months before he hits the super highend where everything sucks.  1-64 were a hell of a lot of fun, and I don't think many of you guys would say any different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont remember much of the pre 65 since i ebayed my char  :D j/k<br />
<br />
I dont see a reason for being down, there is nothing in the ebay manual saying anything about the shaman being a sub class, and i got all the manuals there is from playerauction and IGS (thanks Yantis you are the best).</div></div><hr />
