<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail fellow Shaman-<br />
<br />
I am a mid 50's shaman that is not guilded and does not raid.  I usually either solo or group with a monk of same level.  I am mostly focused on leveling to 60 - not sure about 61 plus yet - I may wait till I have more AA's.<br />
<br />
Anyway - my big question is what spells to invest in. <br />
<br />
I got a great deal on Torpor (45k) and have it banked and waiting.  I have a fungi tunic i plan to sell at 60 to get more cash for more spells.<br />
<br />
What I am wondering is - should I buy Malo - (runs 40 to 70 on my server) or wait and buy Malos - (runs about same price - but seems to be comming down - 2 copies have been avail for weeks lol).<br />
<br />
If i do not raid - and just solo exp and duo exp - (some grouping to i am sure) can i do without malo and wait to get a cheaper price on malos?  If i got Malo - would it be sufficient as a substitute for Malos at 65 if I could not afford to buy it?<br />
<br />
Also the Torpor / Quiesence question:  honestly i am tempted to keep torpor - and wait until 65 and price on Q comes down to buy  Q ( I have yet to see Q for sale yet).  BUT - Q is CLEARLY superiour to Torp (more so than Malo v. Malos) - so that factors towards only wanting Q in the spell book - and saving the cash for Torp.<br />
<br />
I think i could resell Torp for upwards of 80k - and being that it will be at least a month if not more till i hit 60 i wonder if I should.<br />
<br />
I am curious to hear your advice and thoughts on the matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will see Torpor for sale rarely, you won't see Quiescense for sale for a long time.... it's just too damn good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep torpor.  It will change the game for you at 60.  Without torpor, 60-65 will be a lot harder than with torpor.  The diffirence is impossible to explain until you experience it.  Its just that good.<br />
<br />
Get malo.  At 60 it will allow you to land slow on mobs that you will have 2-3+ resists on otherwise.  Malos is mostly useful to a raiding shaman.  The increase in performace over malo is slight, and in everyday experience hunting wont matter.  Malo at 60 will make your 60s much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've already seen more copies of malos/quiessence for sale in the last two months than I have of malo/torpor since bazaar opened.  Not to mention malos/quies have settled at about 50-60k which is about 1/2 of what the lvl 60 versions used to go for.<br />
<br />
of course that's just on Terris-Thule, your milage may very.<br />
<br />
To answer your question, I'd keep torpor, hit 60, get canni5, hit 65, buy malos</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On AB the 65 versions are going for about 150K, While the 60 versions (when they are on sale) go for 50K Malo, and 70K Torpor.<br />
<br />
I'd hold onto Torpor until you hit 60 and then see if a copy of Quiescense is available. If it is you could as you suggest sell Torpor keep the fungi, and level upto 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Malos still not for sale on my server.  Q running 100k. :(<br />
Torpor and Malo are rare to see in bazaar, but usually around 30-40k each. <br />
<br />
I expect once my guild and another guild get into the elemental planes, more 65 spells will be sold in the bazaar, making the price go down.  But that could take another month or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My opinion is that Malo is mostly a raiding spell - however I use it a lot in xp groups too, merely for the convenience of not having to worry about resists. I survived a long time at 60 without malo though.<br />
<br />
If you don't raid, and are not guilded, I'd seriously consider never levelling past 60. If you get to 65 you limit your choice of xp zones quite drastically, and with no guild to get you flagged, it sounds like a recipe for misery to me.<br />
<br />
I'm guilded but my guild has no serious interest inm high level PoP zones (and nor do I) - I'm perfectly happy staying at 60, gaining AA points and xping in &quot;old world&quot; dungeons etc.<br />
<br />
My point being that you could save your copy of torpor, get to 65 and buy Quiessence (sp?) but what will you have to do when you get there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm agreeing with Grippa.<br />
<br />
You mostly solo and duo?  Why do you want to ding past 60 and severly limit when you can get exp.?  <br />
<br />
I'd scribe the torpor and perhaps save for malo.<br />
<br />
I am also perfectly happy without dinging +60 for a good long while.  Halfway thru 59 and plan at sitting in 60 and AA'ing for months.  My guild very happy with lv. 1-60 places atm.  Still a ton of older content to explore, esp. if you are not guilded and probably have not seen most of it.  Why rush thru?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was pretty lucky and had malo/ topor waiting for me when i hit 60 .. before malo i would have to malosini 2-3 times per mob and then slow .. with malo it's just a malo a slow and done<br />
<br />
unless these mobs are highly MR .. which doesn't seem to be the case in most places<br />
<br />
I use malo all the time .. .. every mob i fight gets hit with it either to help me slow or to help me dot (malo IS a PR debuff too ya know) .. or to help my rains land (malo IS a PR debuff too .. did i mention that ? )<br />
<br />
topor is very useful ..  makes melee types all sorts of mad .. but those casters don't mind one bit and it sure helps to have it when you use cannibalisation</div></div><hr />

Ditto that on TM. The 65 spells are MUCH more common then the 60's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If they put the spell research upgrades in, and you can research Malo and Torpor, then the price on those spells will steadily fall.  Conceivably you could sell Torpor for 70k, level up, and when research goes in buy Torpor and Malo for 70k.  Thats alot to gamble on a rumor though.  I would keep torpor, sell your fungi at 60 and get Malo.  Then just enjoy having two of the best spells in game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would recommend keeping torpor as well.  Getting from 60 to 65 doesnt happen overnight, unless you are a very hard core experiencer (if thats a word).  Likely there will be AAs you would like to have so it will take even longer, all that time without torpor is certainly doable, but it sure does make life easier.  Ive been back to the game since PoP came out and am still not 65 with Q, I cant imagine going those 4+ months without torpor, its perma memmed.<br />
<br />
I also really recommend malo if you can get your hands on it at a reasonable price, resists really suck and with malo you will almost never get resists in daily xp grinds and its little/no agro if someone else (the puller) has damaged the mob.  I dont use it in every zone or on every mob, but I do in the tier2+ zones and tier1 if the mob is 57+ level.  I also keep it perma memmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Torpor is a game changer, there is no doubt.  I would recommend leveling to 62, especially if you are flagged for PoV/PoS.  Even if you aren't there are a lot of copies of level 61-62 spells in bazaar.  All of those spells have many group and solo benefits (group buffs, better pet, better 'quick heal' etc..  Once you go past 62 the spells kind of become redundant upgrades of lower spells (generally speaking).  Except of course the 65 Torpor.<br />
<br />
In summary, I'd recommend going to level 62, then 100% AA.  In PoV groups each kill is just under 2% for me.<br />
<br />
As far as Malo, I wish I had it myself, just having a spell that is guaranteed to land is sweet, no matter what the mana cost.  I don't get a huge amount of resists with Malxxx, but enough to make it annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Personally I would not sell the fungi they are a bit situanal after 60. But I still find that mine comes in handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">if your unguilded  and dont  raid and dont plan to be i sujest you  dont go any higher then 62  and stick with malo topar  both are important enough to buy/get asap <br />
<br />
63 + you are prty much locked into pop zones for exp  even tear 1 planes begin to green out at 64<br />
<br />
and with out a guild to back you you wont get access to  any  zone behond tear 3. most of tear 3 you will have to quest for,  cept for bot any one can get there joining  pick up raids on the  giant minis <br />
<br />
on the other hand if your just waiting for that guild that suites ya 65 makes a shamans life much easyer if for nothing else but slowing alone at 65 i can now slow things with out  any debuff that i had to  malo and wait out trash before . and the ability to freely topar mele is a great thing to get ya some cast time but had i to do over again i would still  get malo and topar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You will see Torpor for sale rarely, you won't see Quiescense for sale for a long time.... it's just too damn good.<br />
<br />
Our guild has nearly every level 65 spell for every member and recruit now.  We get ~25-30 Runes a week.   Every shaman (all 9 of us) in guild has full 65 spells.   You'll see them for sale often, and I'm sure other servers are that way.  You get TONS of runes in Elemental Planes, and if a guild is smart they'll turn in extra runes to Shaman spells like we are.   You just can't get a ****ty level 65 shaman spell like you can other classes (pacification, root, etc).   Atm I have multiple copies of Malos, Fo7, Ferine, and Blood for sale, and I'm sure there will be Qui's to come.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you wait to get Malos.  Torpor... depends on how fast you plan on leveling to 65... having it will help you get to 65 but it can be done without, just not as easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">bah gimme some of them! =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Malo is a lot more important these days for regular group XP grinding.  PoP mobs are much more difficult to slow than old-world mobs.  I pretty much have to use malo in XP grind groups in BoT at level 61 to avoid multiple resists on sini.  Maybe it gets better as you level.</div></div><hr />
