<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Come together, right now .... Under me...   ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
So like murtak state in the other thread. Lets get some questions together. Like the man said, its harder to ignore 30 people then 1.<br />
<br />
Ill do my best to keep a running talley of what we want to ask in this post or someone else can cause i have attention issues sometimes ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill kick it off. Remember .. NONE confrontational.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Are healing percentages going to be looked at. We as shaman feel the current percentaged for CLR/DRU/SHM has been off balance since just before PoP and with GoD they are now very obvious. What does SoE have in mind to correct this situation.<br />
<br />
2. Shaman feel that or buffs are very much useless these days. While in the past they were designed well and did a great job, they have fallen behind what they need to be to truly help the melee of today. What are your feelings on adding componets such strikethrough or shieldling, cleave or some of the other useful time gear aug's to help the shaman become desired melee buffers again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok thats my quick start. Now run with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I mean truly, what do we add at the point in the game at which you all speak of?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">DPS issues- Whether that be increasing our nukes or changing the way Dot's are applied.<br />
<br />
DoT agro- If you change the way Dot's are applied will they have the foresight to compensate for an already enormous amount of agro. On par with this would be inordinate amount of resists with the current set of Dots even after debuffing.<br />
<br />
Second the notion of altering our buffs to something other than merely stats. And please make them group buffs not single target 30 second duration with 29 second refresh, ok that's a little on the ridiculous side but ya never know what they will come up with nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My advice is to make sure all questions are prefaced properly so that the door is not left open for a half assed response.<br />
<br />
For example: If you were to ask &quot; will shaman healing be upgraded ?&quot;, you might get the answer &quot; we feel that shaman healing is adequate in most situations&quot;.<br />
That answer tells us little, but you are hard pressed to say that your question did not get an answer.<br />
If however you were to ask the question &quot; it is clear to all of us that shaman can not function effectively as a backup healer in GoD, let alone primary healer. What do you intend to do to redress this shortcoming?&quot; , then the same answer is glaringly inadequate, because you are not asking about &quot;most&quot; situations.<br />
Same principle applies to dots and buffs/debuffs. <br />
<br />
Leave no doubt as to what you are asking and leave less room to dodge the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Badasc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just want to ask a relatively simple question:<br />
<br />
What is a shaman's role in GoD encounters, and how do current shaman abilities allow him or her to perform this role?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">imo the following<br />
<br />
-&gt; aa (irrelevant how expensive) that slightly mitigate slow, even if the max level only is 5% mitigation, we would have a greater gap again and our main class defining thing would be in worst situations more than 2% away from other slowing-classes<br />
<br />
-&gt; change buffs: stat buffs are out of use now, stat raise won't help, add some of the new &quot;features&quot; to them like strikethrough etc. make us the ones again that can fill your bufflist with useful buffs again<br />
<br />
-&gt;  HoTs are our strong heals imo, or should be at least. the new spot heal is nice, even when it could heal a bit more, i would rather love to see something like a group-Q (even if its not mgb-able, who cares, i need my mgb for f7 anyway :)). I dont want to replace a cleric or a druid, but i want to be able to be able to support them healingwise.<br />
<br />
but anyway, it was said a thousand times already in this board  :eek:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As 1 of the positive shamans to GoD I have to crawl out of my cave and admit how wrong I was.<br />
I am still playing but only because I have so many friends online. <br />
<br />
About what to look at:<br />
I dont believe in a better healing and I like the buffs I have, everyone of them as they are once again useful in some places. The thing is that a shaman in raidsituations are as useful as anyone could have a bot at said zone and buff up. After that any class with slow can slow &quot;slightly&quot; and do all other things. The only &quot;edge&quot; we have are malos. Otherwise we dont have much else to do on a raid. Ofcourse you can do alot of things and give that char this and that etc. But our &quot;edge&quot; which once was slow are long gone. <br />
Either give us a way to slap on more dps or give us something else which makes us feel special again. Evey class have had their specialities and many of them have lost just that afaik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am also put off my Ryan's view that only Gates is a problem for Shaman.<br />
<br />
Not being able to stack well in low end PoP raids and above is a huge problem at least for me it was.<br />
<br />
In most low PoP raids (and above) Shaman One Malos, Shaman Two Slows and Shaman Three Re-Slows if both Shaman One and Two dies.  If the target is unslowable or mitigates most of the slow then a Buff-bot can take the place of the said Shaman.<br />
<br />
My problem is that as a third and forth Shaman, I got tired of just topping off the HP bars of my group members.  While having this bit of extra healing may make Raid Leaders feel better, it really does nothing to make the extra Shaman feel like a part of the effort.<br />
<br />
I hope that in fixing the problems in Gates, that the Shaman stacking issue will also be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>likn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hello <br />
 my question to the devs would be in a few parts.<br />
1. first can you explain the benifit of getting  advanced spirit call 5. <br />
<br />
2. second how is it a upgrade when we go from 5 aa pets down to 3.<br />
<br />
3.are there any plans to change this so its more useful again ie the 5 pets could do cc on a add till the tanks are rdy for it.<br />
<br />
yes  i was silly enough to spend all the aa on it. i conned the sc5 pets dark blue. conned the sc3 pets dark blue.i didnt do a parse  on it but i really dont see this as a useful aa atm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaffo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ouch. Old-timers dropping like flies right and left.<br />
<br />
<br />
 YES...YES they are!<br />
<br />
  I have not posted here in a while, the reason for that is simple.<br />
<br />
     Like many shaman I canceled my account. I am sure a few of you will say that a cleric should not complain about the current state of the game. Nevertheless, you will remember I was 100% behind you all when GoD was released, I knew that things where going to turn bad quickly and NO I am not clairvoyant. <br />
<br />
    The truth is that the current game has forced a 50/50 split in the classes. While I have seen complaints from druids, I do not think they are hurting, since the majority of the groups are running with druids in the trials: However, shaman where left behind in this expansion, and it is burning clerics out at a far greater rate than normal. Let's face it, clerics have a high burn out rate anyway, but allot of Old Timers like myself made it threw 5 years of raiding and hellish CR's, but GoD managed to even burn myself and several long time clerics out to the point that I dreaded log on. The Perivale &quot;straw&quot; that broke me, was when my guild set a &quot;WORK&quot; schedule for us on the website, to have groups preset to flag individuals as soon as we log on, and for the first time, they started getting pissed if a cleric did not log on. They felt that we where abandoning those who where &quot;assigned&quot; to our group for that night.<br />
<br />
     Therefore, I agree with you all, if they do not change things quickly, then the only priests will be druids. Moreover, once that happens, even the Halflings will start canceling accounts.<br />
<br />
    Good Luck to you, I hope they change things for you so that you can still enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaffo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Another thing I forgot to mention.<br />
<br />
	They need to get over the whole “Old Content” issue. It is no longer a valid argument, the minute they placed items in the game that inflated Hp/Ac to the point that a caster can tank Pop and Hard LDON they lost the ability to use that as a standard argument. If you are in doubt click on my Magelo, and it has not been upgraded in several months, and I have replaced a few Aug’s, and trinkets.  <br />
<br />
	Also, do not take buff upgrades that involve stats. Once again check my magelo, it is a good example of how worthless they have become. <br />
<br />
	Regardless, it is for your community to decide what the best for your class is. I canceled my account; therefore, I have lost the right to supply input into game balancing, but I am at work and could not resist posting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Putting my hopes on the promised pvp 'revamp'. If that doesn't bring some fun back into the game I see no point in renewing. <br />

As for fixes:<br />
- better melee buffs<br />
- fix our dps (mainly resists and an agro issue)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Agree with most of everything already stated. <br />

<br />
Actually, he's the owner of an above-average PL bot.  There are plenty of classes that can do it better.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok, here re my two thoughts:<br />
<br />
The statistic-caps currently in place ensure that our statistic buffs do nothing significant on any but the weakest players, so:<br />
<br />
1) Would it be possible to replace all dexterity buffs with &quot;increase chance to proc&quot; buffs?<br />
<br />
2) Would it be possible to replace all agility buffs with &quot;increase chance to dodge&quot; buffs/<br />
<br />
3) Would it be possible to replace all strength buffs with &quot;increase ATK&quot; buffs?<br />
<br />
Please note that when I say ALL, I mean ALL (including beastlords).  The goal is to make statistic-buffs into something useful, not to make shaman into the most powerful class in the game.<br />
<br />
My more general question would be:<br />
<br />
1) ...  actually, I don't have any other questions.  I'm pretty happy with the shaman as-is, or at least I would be if that cursed Daluda's Mending would ever drop for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zunayn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">u guys moan to much :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Come together, right now .... Under me...   ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In my personal preference of priority:<br />
<br />
1. DPS - a 1K fast nuke please. <br />
<br />
2. Buffs - Remove (or adjust) stats from FA and Fo7, add useful focus effects.<br />
<br />
3. Healing - Just a TINY bit more on that fast heal, please (like 250). The HoT seems acceptable.<br />
<br />
4. Debuffs - The new Slow (although I do not have it) doesnt seem to be cutting it according to the reports on this board. Not EVERY &quot;Fairly High End&quot; shaman has a TA and can afford to give up the spell slot to have 2 slows memmed. How about considering an upgrade to Cripple that does a BIT more than lower a mobs &quot;stats&quot;. We all know how important stats REALLY are in the overall scheme of the game. <br />
<br />
Thats it for me. 1 of the 4 is what I expect. 2 of the 4 would be outstanding. 3 or 4 of the 4 is probably NEVER gonna happen, but . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Srab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Ok I haven't really seen the true high end that most of you have, but from where I sit now (slow POP progression), this is what I would like to see.<br />
<br />
FA extend it to a 15-20 minute duration base<br />
DOTs lower the aggro drastically<br />
Change our new Canni to a normal drop spell, not that ancient crap<br />
Increase ToA to the same 60% as SLTW<br />
Maybe reduce the refresh time for the Bane line<br />
Give Fo&amp; more HP's<br />
And lastley increase the duration of our buffs, I mean why should ours last a hour and some change when Clerics and Druids last for quite a bit longer (mostly Focus line here)<br />
<br />
But like I said above, I haven't seen the high end gaming yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Woah, deja vu.<br />

<br />
I still have the same questions I had when we did this before. I can only remember two of them clearly:<br />
<br />
1) Why are you stupid?<br />
<br />
2) Is there anything that we, the players, could do to remedy your stupidity?<br />
<br />
Those are more relevant questions than ever. Seriously, so many blatant, fundamental mistakes have been made at this point that there's no hope. It's either restore the game to a previous, sane state or warp shamans into the current state. One would cost them too many paying lemmings, and the other would cause at least 4 classes to scream bloody murder.<br />
<br />
They would have to nerf the kidneys out of beastlords and make Daluda's heal for 2000 before I would even begin to think they understood the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">1) Is it intended that Shaman DoTs are 500% more resisted than Necromancer's and Druid's considering that DoTs are our primary spells to damage a mob?<br />
<br />
or in case that above sounds too harsh or a Dev might try to play the class envy card<br />
<br />
2) Are you aware of the outrageous resist rate of all Shaman DoTs that forces Shamans to use their nukes, no matter whether they are facing a short or long lasting mob?<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
3) Are you aware that a Shaman will actually do more damage to said mob generating 1/10 of the aggro doing so?<br />
<br />
4) Why is it acceptable that in terms of HPS, 1 Cleric heals ~113% better than a Shaman or about 6.4% better than 2 Shamans(!) prior to taking spell haste, damage mitigation(BoV) overall better AC/HP buffs and special abilities like DvA or even resurrection into account, when in any other, way less important areas than healing, no other class has nearly that edge over any other class of the same class type(priest, tank etc).</div></div><hr />

Why are Beastlords so much better than Shaman in almost every single category? Aren't they our &quot;hybrid&quot; class?<br />
<br />
Pallys cant heal or buff even CLOSE to Clerics.<br />
Rangers cant nuke or heal or buff even CLOSE to druids. <br />
SKs cant DOT or whateverelsenecrosdo even CLOSE to Necros.<br />
<br />
BLs are so close to &quot;even&quot;, and in some cases better, with us in our best categories that when you factor in the ADVANTAGES they are a FAR superior class. <br />

<br />
Even better question is why are ALL these hybrids almost as good as we are as in ever categorie.  It isn't just the BL.  Pally healing is almost as good as a shaman.  Ranger nukes are almost as good as a shaman.  SK dots are almost as good as a shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree on the other stuff, but actually must disagree strongly on this.  I've seen SK's bragging about their DOT's, which I at first thought kind of funny.  Till I made my own SK, got him elemental flagged and all his spells and then realized -- I was right.  I duo with him at Plane of Fire tables, in GoD, and elsewhere.   He's a great toon, but a great DOT'er?  Nah.  I can kill a POF mob in roughly the same time whether he DOTs or stays LD.<br />
<br />
He has many other virtues, of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your point? Guid + BSS is a whoppin 35 hs more than Virt (and 18 less AC). Of course, they only last half as long, and since 9 + symb is better than both of those, and since BSS is a seperate, stackable buff, let me put this whole thing another way. . . <br />
<br />
Pallys dont buff as well as Clerics</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I want.... no I need<br />
<br />
i dont really care bout our heals being that small, since the main problem is in the endgame (GoD) then all shamans there should have atleast elemental gear or higher and 230AAs, if you dont have that then the problem really souldnt be a problem since you dont belong to the zones where the problem is.<br />
<br />
Heals: <br />
Q: I love my new HoT spell its really good so i dont want any changes on that<br />
Thargs: with max healing AAs and focus i normally heal for bout 1800 and the crit heal are alot so as a backup healer, its ok the ONLY problem i see is that since im th backup healer i would like to come in with the small heal that is needed for the MT not to die while the cleric is CHing, so if the cast time just came down to 1.5 sec and if that is overpowering then set the mana cost up some. I dont have any plans on being a mainhealer thats not my job, my job is a SUPPORT role <br />
<br />
Slowing <br />
I havnt seen the GoD slow spell yet (im starting to doubt that it even exist) but i would like a much faster cast time, i hate when im doing a trail the mob is at 46PCT when the slow gets in.<br />
<br />
Buffing <br />
I really REALLY dont care a bit about stat buffing since all should be maxxed in endgame, i dont care that i have to cast 2 or more buffs just make them useful, as it is new i use one spell Fo7, i dont even remeber what the other spells are used for anymore<br />
so remove the stat buffing and add focus effects like:<br />
different kind of sheilding (maybe only PR/DR since that is what we resist buff), accuracy, Stun resist, Strikethrough and so on, dont add it all but add some of it.<br />
<br />
That is currently the main problems IM having with my gear/AAs.<br />
Other rants from people that are not in elemental or time gear, I really think they should just start to enjoy the game and not look at the problems they will get into when they get to lvl 65 and 230+ AAs, this is NOT the place for them to speak up.<br />
All they are doing is getting the focus away from what the real problems are. <br />
YOU DONT KNOW THE PROBLEMS YET AND YOU SHOULD KEEP QUIET !!!<br />
<br />
oh and the FA problem i really couldnt care less, i dont even get tells for it anymore.<br />
ok flame me if you dont like it, Ill try to explain some more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why can shaman not be allowed some leeway for thier abilitys to heal groups even to the point of being a main healer in challanging content. Even if such healing is a combonation of healing power HoT and Slows. (Taking into account the fact that it takes much much more casting time and mana to layer those three abilities to come to a whole amount of healing. Rather than just a big heal<br />

And we are still a support class, so why do you still want to be a cleric ?<br />
If you want to be a main healer then i think you should reroll as a cleric you would never need to sit LFG in pot/pok/barundi again, and you would get all the healing you liked :)</div></div><hr />

You've done Ikky trial one with a druid and yourself as healers?  Vxed/Tipt shaman start having some problems, KT group trials, shaman viability comes to a screaming halt.<br />
<br />
Progress board on my guild for these trials still has zero shaman passing any of them.  I've made an attempt at scheduling a trial one run, and pretty much the only feedback I got was an indirect recomendation to replace myself with a DPS person.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">What I want is the ability to function as my archtype. A Priest. A blinking healer.<br />

Shaman have been able to heal through a combonation of many factors. Primarily slows and heals over time supplanted with Blast heals for spikes, and If no enchanters or other classes around with the buffs that allow for fights to be over faster than if only a cleric was available. (Haste, Str and Avatar buffs + pet and damage potential.) Druids have been able to heal with better blast heals With superior Damage through nukes and Dots, and a damage sheild assisting damage as well.)<br />
<br />
Clerics were really the passive ones. Healing damage dealt, but supplying very little damage otherwise Just with thier superior HP and AC buffs, allowing thier much superior heals to become more efficent.<br />
<br />
But the clerics role is reactive. Someone gets hurt they fix it. Or they can mitagate some with stuns, and With the hammers speed up fights slighty, and or nuke.<br />
<br />
A Shamans role has been as a force enabler. You take a force of people (Primarily meeles) and improve thier abilitys so that fights are shorter and they are much more effective at thier jobs. Then what we do is act as the grease between the grindstone and the mill wheel. We make it easier to win. We also act proactivly. Before the damage is dealt we heal it. By slowing monsters and applying heals over time to blunt the effect of thier DPS.<br />
<br />
And a druids has been reactive role in healing and a proactive role in damage ability.  They heal when needed but kill the mobs faster so they dont have to heal as much.<br />
<br />
I want my proactive role back. To be able to use my abilites to make the group better. Not have people wishing they got a beastlord because the difference in slows are mitagated, but thier ability to damage is so much greater that My marginal healing is next to useless in the grinding sprint fights that EQ has become.<br />
<br />
Give me back the damn fun. <br />
