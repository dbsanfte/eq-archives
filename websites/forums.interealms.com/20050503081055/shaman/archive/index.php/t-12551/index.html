<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is moving into HoT for a few weeks, then on to NToV. What I was trying to find out, is what armor (if any) drops for shaman in HoT, and what is the NToV Shyshrine quest armor for us called.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HoT - Halls of Testing - is a bunch of factionless stuff that's KoS.  Makes sense, you're being 'tested'.  You do need to be at least dubious to do HoT, I've been told....  Dunno, haven't done it on a KoS character, so..  <br />
<br />
Anyway, NToV - North Temple of Veeshan - is all ON faction - you'll lose CoV faction for hunting here.  Its tougher than HoT, and oddly enough, all mobs are kos even if you're ally to dragons *shrug*.  This is where armor actually drops - HoT is just about getting those rare chain pieces for armor that, although much harder to get, is about the same quality as tae ew chain :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You have to be ally to CoV to quest HoT/SS quest armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HoT and NToV are mutually exclusive.  Once you start killing in NToV, you will be hated in Skyshrine in very short time, one trip should do it.  <br />
NToV has much better armor drop than HoT.  It is, however, much more difficult.  <br />
<br />
The key things to look for on a piece of armor are in order of importance:<br />
1) HPs<br />
2) nifty USEFUL focus effects<br />
3) Mana<br />
4) Resists<br />
5) AC<br />
6) Wis<br />
<br />
HoT armor has very little going on it for HPs, AC is mediocre, stats are present, but not exceptional, and token resists.<br />
<br />
NToV has mid-range HP gear, ranging from 50-100hps items, AC is good, stats can be good or bad depending on the item, and resists are decent on average.  <br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
there are still a couple items from NToV that would be upgrades for me :( <br />
And I still have a HoT quest bracer, bleh.  Needum lewts! haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HoT and NToV are completely different.<br />
<br />
HoT is for armor farming.  You have no specific goal mob here.  You and your guild sit down in a corner and pull drakes, wurms, and wyverns until the cows come home.  Killing here raises your cov factions I believe.  You need to be ally to do the armor quests.<br />
<br />
NToV is a raid area.  It is basically a big circle with named dragons spawning all around.  Some of them, like Lord Fesh, are gimps - a glorified Yeldema.  Some of them, like Lord Vyemm, Lady Nev, and the Triplets (can't remember their names) are tough bastards.<br />
<br />
You start at Aaryonar's pit and work your way either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on what mob you're after.  In your way are lots of drakes and wurms - the same mobs you find in WToV.  They will lower your faction with CoV but are not very hard.  The real challenge of clearing in NToV are the flurry drakes.  These things are mean SOBs.  It is in your best interest to wait until malo tash and occlusion have all landed, because if you get a resist and draw aggro, you are dead.  They hit for about 700 and are called &quot;flurry drakes&quot; because they FLURRY like madmen.  On the bright side, the named flurry drakes can drop a class shield - shield of thorns for druids, shield of wurms for us, etc...  Very nice shields.<br />
<br />
A lot of the loot in NToV is pretty gimp by todays standards.  Most of the dragons have both really nice loot and really crappy loot.  Sometimes we will clear the place out and get nothing except loot for alts, and sometimes we'll get enough upgrades for 20 people.  Usually it is somewhere in between.<br />
<br />
NToV is a really fun zone - probably the most fun I ever had raiding.  I really love killing dragons, and that's all you do in NToV.  Some of the fights are boring, like Lord Fesh.  Some of the fights, though, like Lady Nev, are a real rush.  Most of my guildies really hate Lady Nev, but I love the fight.  It is very long and grueling.  She has lots of HP and a nasty AE that debuffs your MR and stuns you.  Fortunately, healers can hide from it.  Your healers really have to be on their toes for you to win.  Last time we did her, I had 5 melees in my group and it was my job to keep them all healed as well as go out and reslow Lady Nev every 6 minutes.  Very intense with never a moment to relax - which is how boss fights should be.<br />
<br />
If you need any tactics or tips for the other dragons, let me know.  I remember them all pretty well.<br />
<br />
Have fun in there, it is a great place.<br />
<br />
Edit:  To answer your original question, there is NOT any NToV specific quest armor.  You will get a few pieces of Kael quest armor (Spirit Caller's) off of the trash mobs, though.  The HoT quest armor (skyshrine) is Wolf Caller's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i have one item from ntov for shamans, shield of wurms its nice little shield. look it up as im too lazy to link it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Forget NToV.  If you're just getting to HoT, you won't be ready for that for awhile.  The normal progression is HoT and Kael, some WToV and DN and finally NToV.  <br />
<br />
The key mob to NToV is a special one for Shammys.  Aary is a mob where we SHINE.  Unfortunately, with level 65 and PoP AA's, he's quite a lot easier than he used to be.  HoT gives your guild the armor they need and the discipline they need to be successful in NToV.<br />
<br />
LET THE CR'S BEGIN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yah I haven't been in NToV since either the resist change or PoP.  It has got to be a lot easier at lvl 65, this I know.  It was a total bitch to land a slow on Roy at 60.  It's gotta be much easier at 65.  I still remember a Roy fight when I burned off my mana without slowing her and ended up using my slow stick from Chardok to slow her!  Just equipped it and hoped for a lucky proc of Togor's and got one!  Woot, was a kewl moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aary used to be one of the coolest fights I've ever done, since Shammy's play such a key role in it, ESPECIALLY once I made 60 before my fellow bears, as once I landed a slow only I could reslow, until it dropped (which would peeve guildboss, if it happened).  I don't even care if someone gets in front of us in the corner, if I'm caught out and get the real AoE, I just hit RC and it's just fine (60 - 70% cure rate).<br />
<br />
BTW, I forgot a couple of areas on that progression...  HoT and Kael Arena (on CoV faction), WToV and DN (still on CoV), SS (no longer worth it), NToV (screwing CoV faction) and Dain (hope you got that shawl finished), and finally Tomax and AoW, while doing ST key mobs.  Once you farm ST enough for the needed Primals (especially MT, Ranjur and Monk ones), you can start looking towards Luclin.  I'd rank that IV, then Rhages(those RGC's are VITAL in later fights, so farm those spells), then burrower and finally starting on Emp Keyand HP, getting ready for VT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some of this has already been explained, but for completeness:<br />
<br />
You can hunt in HoT (east tov) regardless of you CoV faction. You will likely have trouble with the CoV mobs outside if someone opens the door if you are KOS. Also you will probably need a CoH to get there if you are KoS to CoV. The mobs in HoT give no faction hit either way. The only drops in HoT are quest pieces you turn in at SS for Wolf Caller's. So, to get the armor, you need to get good CoV faction.<br />
<br />
The mobs in WEST ToV are on CoV faction, so if you have good faction, you can generally run around in there with  no problem. Killing them gives bad CoV faction and good giant faction. They drop the quest pieces you turn in to Kael for Spirit Caller's. I've only hunted there briefly, but the drop rates seem much higher than in HoT. <br />
<br />
<br />
North ToV is generally KOS to everyone regardless of CoV faction. Killing there reduces CoV faction. To the best of my knowledge, it does not drop the quest armor pieces (wolf/spirit caller) - at least I've never seen any. NToV is all about big named dragons. As mentioned above, the loot of these dragons ranges from fabulous to now mediocre. There is no &quot;NToV armor&quot; as there is SS/Kael armor. There are just lots of different pieces that are generally pretty good. <br />
<br />
The difference in difficulty between HoT and NToV is rather large. Back in the day, most guilds started by raiding Kael for Thurg armor pieces and CoV faction, then moved to HoT for SS armor pieces, then switched factions and hunted in WToV for Kael armor pieces, then moved into NToV and forgot armor farming. <br />
<br />
Of course, now that you can zip up to 65 pretty fast in PoP, I would imagine even medium guilds could skip all that and put a decent dent in NToV...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did NToV last night for the first time, after spending the last 10 months farming HoT with my old guild. NToV is a COMPLETELY different animal than HoT. Some of the old salts here are bored with it im sure, but I started playing EQ with the idea of killing dragons, and NToV is it. Easily went through 10 named last night and enjoyed every fight. The drops ranged from fantastic (by my HoT standards) to craptastic, but any time you pull down one of the largest (by size) mobs in the game its still a rush. When you go, have fun, regardless of the fact that some folks have a &quot;been there done that&quot; attitude. I have so many SS to go through that I have no idea where to begin. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mithril Set from Lady M is good for shm (helm, boot, glove)<br />
then there are a few piece of onyx armor (arm some more I think) worth collecting.<br />
Also Lady N drop a nice mask; Sprinkler of the spirit is slightly better than epic but 10 more resist to all field, drop from the dragon before Lady N, i cant recall the name now, it starts with J.<br />
<br />
I think thats all u need from NToV, boot of dead dream if are into dot stuff, from one of those lords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe, Rebel started his listing with the toughest mob in NToV  :)  She AoE's Whirl Till you Hurl every 30 secs or so, and the fight lasts approx. half an hour, during which you'll get several adds.  It's a tough but FUN fight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually they really screwed up los in HOT<br />
<br />
If anyone in the raid and the mob get in los of the door all the guards enter.  Happy wipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Also, if someone drags a corpse, the guards outside the door get pissed and wipe him out, as well as anyone benefitting him, after he got on their hate list.  This is why HoT is known as 'Bard Hell'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There are a few ez one I missed, <br />
Eshan of the sky drop a good cloak, also Roy drop hand of the master - spell haste 3 is handy;<br />
Dargan drop a leggin with high AC and good hp (ancient wurm hide greave)<br />
anyway anything u can use that has lots hp (onyx gauntlet), or balanced hp/wise(cloak of the sky), are worth getting.<br />
I like resist so I get sprinkler of the spirit, but u dont have to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My guild has been done w/ HoT for about 2 months and is going into NToV next week (our week on the rotation).  Since we stopped HoT we hae been doing more Luclin mobs (no Ssra) and WToV named.  The other night about 16 of us went back to HoT to farm some drops off the named drakes for the quest items.  Because so many of us were KoS, we had to engage both wurms in the pit.  It almost seemed easy.  All on the 1st, offtank the 2nd, and had a wyvern roamer join i also.  3 mobs down, no deaths.  Couple months ago, we'd have deaths on a single wurm.  Guess levels and AA's (gear wasn't a big change) make that much of a difference.  <br />
<br />
Of course we did wipe when we left the pit and went into the halls.  Seemed every roamer decided to show up at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hot drops more than just quest armor- don't forget the quest drops from halls of testing which require tears from Dozekar to complete. Some of those results are better than a lot of north tov drops, but good luck completing any reasonable amount of them. <br />
<br />
Not knowing and pulling one of those named would be confusing to someone on their first time in there. <br />
<br />
Let alone the fact that no one mentioned Dozekar himself- maybe this person would be lucky/not lucky to go there first time with him up.</div></div><hr />
