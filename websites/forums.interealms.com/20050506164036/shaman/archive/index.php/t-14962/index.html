<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>khidot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi I did a search but could not find any answers to my question.  I have decided to start farming silks to sell in the bazzar, I was wondering if anyone could tell me where the best place to farm silk is, I'm Lvl 23,  Is there anywhere where there is an over abundance of spiders, and also are there any spiders i could kill at my lvl that would give me some EXP as well as silks.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best places for silk are EK and Upper Guk.  I've heard Feerott is good but I've never hunted there(the bouncers hate kitties) and Innothule was good but I hear the drop rate was lowered recently (can't verify myself though).<br />
<br />
Not sure if you would get any XP in Guk (maybe) but the crag spiders in EK should give you some XP if you can handle them and the carrion spiders may still be light blue(doubtful).  Been awile since I was 23.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">try lavastrom....ya thats it ....lavastorm........You cant spiders in EK thats a lie.....THEYRE MY SPIDERS I TELL YOU MINE.... <br />
actually EK has always been good on spider silk drops...verynice...verynice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hope you're not on my server...   Field of Bone for silks.   You won't get any exp anymore from the spiders there but plenty of silks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khidot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info guys I think ill give ek a try <br />
and don't worry im not on any of your servers<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Feerrott is good for spiderLING silks...every spider in the zone (regardless of size) drops them. Can still make good money on -ling silks to smiths making leather padding, but plain spider silks tend to sell a bit better, since tailors A) Have more use for them, and B) Are more desperate for skill ups.<br />
<br />
East Karana is really your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shar Vahl is not bad for LING silks, either.  Go to the PoK book and kill everything in sight.  A wave of silkworms will spawn eventually and you'll get a bunch of silk.  Keep killing, another wave spawns.  You have to kill baby rockhoppers and other spawns to get the silkworms to spawn.<br />
<br />
EK is by far the best spider silk that I've seen.  Crag spiders drop up to 6 silks and are about level 12, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, East Karana is one of the best spots for spider silks.  The only problem is the majority of players needing spider silks know it too.  So the poor spiders can be hunted to extinction.  If this happens start killing the snakes, hounds and lions to get the spiders to spawn again.  You can sell the snake eggs, wolf meat and HQ, MQ and LQ cat pelts in the bazaar too, so it&#8217;s not even a waste of time.<br />
<br />
The problem with hunting silks in Shar Vahl is that they are shade silks, which are not the same as regular spiderling silks.  You cannot use them to make leather padding from low quality wolf, cat or bear hides.  So these will not sell as well as normal spiderling silks.  However, you can use them to make leather padding from low quality rockhopper hides, as can normal spiderling silks.  So if you have a lot of rockhopper hides in the bank you can use the shade silk to make padding and sell that in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I always found EK to be the best for SpidER silks. Specifically the black and red Crags.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, you will be in competion with the 6X Mage, the 6X dr00d, and maybe even the 5X Ranger.<br />
<br />
Tracking helps a ton and they can plain out damage you.<br />
<br />
Good luck. I advise going there off-peak hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but you're better off making the padding yourself anyway, and padding made from rockhopper/shadeling silk is exactly the same as padding made from whatever/spiderling silk.<br />
<br />
Padding sells well at 35p on my server.  Sometimes you have to wait a few days but stick firm on your price and the buyers will come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hunted for silks in EK.   Last time I went there to get a batch of silks, I managed to get 120 silks in about 40 minutes.  This was about 2 weeks ago with my SK, I would send pet after anything I saw that wasn't a spider, and I would chase the spiders myself.<br />
<br />
Its funny when the sk farming silks pisses off the druids and mages farming silks, because he keeps taking all the spiders.  Helps if you sow your pet too, he will move from one target to the next faster.  Of course, I was telling him to attack targets about as fast as I could click on them.<br />
<br />
At level 23, your best bet is probably FOB or UGuk.  Just wont be able to compete with the farmers at that level in EK.</div></div><hr />
