<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Curious to hear what people think are the best belts for shamans in order.<br />
<br />
After grinding it out in PoG for untold hours, Tunare was nice enough to drop a belt for me so I am happy.  But really would be interested in other people's opinions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh forgot here is my list in order:<br />
<br />
1) Girdle of Living Thorns (I am biased)<br />
2) Belt of Dwarf Slaying<br />
3) Belt of Virulity (Who cares about +wis with stats like this)<br />
4) White Dragon Scale Sash<br />
5) Belt of Destroyer<br />
<br />
Really interested in hearing thoughts about comparision between the top 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say Tunare belt is better considering how fast mana recovery is with canny 5 and torpor, so<br />
<br />
1. Girdle of Living Thorns<br />
2. Belt of Dwarf Slaying<br />
3. Belt of Virility<br />
4. White Dragonscale Sash<br />
5. Grotesque Girdle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey chasrn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hargurce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd put the Tainted Scale Belt above the Destroyer, saves are greater than belt haste imho.<br />
<br />
Harg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">what are the stats on that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tainted Scale Belt:<br />
15ac 15sv all 80hp 80mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">wow nice.  i like those resists.  what drops this bad boy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally i'd say<br />
<br />
1) circle of smoke<br />
2) girdle of thorns<br />
3) updated shra blood cord<br />
4) dain belt<br />
5) white dragon scale</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Circle of Smoke?<br />
<br />
What is the updated ssra brood cord now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">20 ac 100hp/mana 12 wis/int 8 sta 10 str 15 svs all but 25 vs magic.<br />
10 sec click gate<br />
<br />
nice gloves too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd put Dorf Belt over Tunare belt, just cos 2 more points of regen is more important to me than 1 extra point of DS and a few more AC. I can self-buff to 1200 AC as it is, so more AC is really rather pointless at this time. However, increased regen? Yes please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No one mentioned Lcea Katta belt? Granted no haste or AOB but stat/hp/ac wise this is pretty balanced and (was) pretty easy to obtain:<br />
<br />
Girdle of Magnificence <br />
<br />
AC 25  +15 Str +15 Int +15 Wis +50 Hps +25 Mana +7 All Saves. All/All<br />
<br />
Not on same level as tunare or dain belt but easier to get and keeping/raising Tormax faction for BoDS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lcae belt isn't bad but if you look at most of the belts listed they all have at least 75hps on them. On my list the Dragon sash at 90 hps was the lowest.<br />
<br />
The Ssraeshzaen Blood Cord is now<br />
Slot: WAIST  <br />
AC: 35 STA: +20  CHA: +10  WIS: +20  INT: +20 HP: +100  MANA: +100  SV FIRE: +12  SV DISEASE: +12  SV COLD: +12  SV MAGIC: +12  SV POISON: +12<br />
<br />
Up from the truely pathetic 20hps mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just a note,<br />
<br />
Right click on girdle is +4 DS and like 25 AC or something like that.  It is instacast and stacks with pretty much anything we can cast and have cast on us.  Also the DS stacks with any and all DS we can cast or have cast on us.<br />
<br />
As for your list taraddar, that new ssra blood cord looks uber.  Why would you put circle of smoke over that belt?  I would actually wear the ssra blood cord over any of the belts once I had the girdle of living thorns to buff myself with though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">1.  lizardscale belt<br />
2.  banded belt<br />
3.  purity belt<br />
4.  rawhide belt<br />
5.  cloth cord<br />
<br />
when you people stop obsessing over ueber loot you might start having fun with the game again ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">hehe i guess you got 60th by exploring new areas/dungeons constantly instead of sitting in one camp and xping over and over :)<br />
<br />
jk. in any case always curious to hear these things as lots of new stuff going into the game.<br />
<br />
Based on these new abilities on items, any thoughts on the list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Innate Regen AOB &gt; DS Buff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Looks at his Imbuded Cabilis Scale belt and sighs.....<br />
<br />
AC 9 Wis/Str +2 Iksar only WAR SK SHM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Crashem, unless it stacks with the Bramblecoat off of my JBone BP, then it's not enough of a boost for me to pass on the regen of a dorf belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">And here I sit wearing a Flayed Turmoilskin Belt, and feel lucky.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">DS off girdle stacks with everything including DS potions and bramblecoat and dain's rings.  It does not stack with the shield of magi line but who cares since we can't cast that.<br />
<br />
So concievably, a shaman could have a self buffed manaless 18hp DS with girdle, JB Chest bramblecoat, 10th dain ring.  If you use the DS potion, it will overwrite dain ring, but give you a nice 39hp DS.<br />
<br />
4hp all shaman stackable DS and the 25 ac you get from buff is &gt; than aura of battle which is just a +2hp regen per tick and +1 attk bonus).  In addition the girdle is +stamina which = more hit points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">So Spikecoat and Bramblecoat stack...;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">actually may be wrong about that.  Need to double check something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Stamina = more hps only if your not capped at 255. <br />
Endgame you are.<br />
<br />
Damage shields are worthless. Only &quot;nice&quot; for big 1 time solo kills.<br />
You forgot to add in the Bathezoid ring for added DS too. <br />
Damage shields just get you in trouble when your pulling which I do alot for exp groups, because I like to keep the others in group killing. Hate getting summoned on pulls. <br />
<br />
Innate regen that stacks with everything else always on all the time is what I prefer. Takes no buff slots either. 2 here 2 there adds up. Easy to get 6hp regen with just belt, bracer,bp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Damage shields and insta-clicks are neat perks, but for a raiding shaman (the only ones who are even gonna see this stuff) I think it's not something you'd want to keep up. You're just asking to get yourself summoned/owned.<br />
<br />
Hp=gud, regen=gud, resists=gud. sta/ac are nice perks, but only insofar as they give you more flexibility with the rest of your gear.<br />
<br />
Haste is just plain irrelevant, since we can't really melee enough for it to matter, not even with 1:1 ratio weapons.<br />
<br />
These are all nice belts, get what you can get<br />
<br />
-Valka/Xegony</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If the 'coat' line can stack with one another, we need to get more rangers MTing mobs, since that's a good 15 extra points and another 70 AC when taken from their first 'coat' spell to their last.<br />
<br />
Of course, they don't, not for rangers and not for us.<br />
<br />
Dorf Belt, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Since returning to the game .... and having to rebuild my char...<br />
<br />
<br />
I have one an ICE BELT from Inny... I thought it was awesome hehe<br />
<br />
<br />
10 ac... 10 str agil dex wis +5 all saves...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">cough,<br />
<br />
girdle of living thorns gives more HP than BoDS cause of the +stamina (assuming you aren't maxed).  But the new ssra blood cord is looking mighty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">For shaman that can get these items, assuming maxxed sta (and with primal essence and RH why wouldn't it be maxxed?) you are looking for resists, maybe some wisdom and mana, a good effect, and of course +hp.<br />
<br />
   Obviously the belt of dwarf slaying is the best belt.   You can still wear the circle of smoke thing on your hands, so you'd want the BoDS as a belt.</div></div><hr />
