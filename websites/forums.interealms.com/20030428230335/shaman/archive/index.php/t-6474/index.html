Sooner or later, Everquest will stop entertaining you or you will get very upset at the fluctuation in game mechanics. It may be that trust issue or the evil nerf bat. Who knows? The above game appears to be an excellent one that has many possibilities!<br />
<br />
All I want is my old shaman board back. I understand whining will always be. I understand rude assaults on others will always be. But it wasn't as prevalent back in the day. People, please be nice. An attack on another person or post is ok every once and a while, but the continuous attacks degrade the community as a whole and ruins the environment that was rather pleasant before.<br />
<br />
It isn't just the whines that turn into vicious flame wars either. Some people just want a discussion with mild mannered adults or have a legit question.<br />
<br />
Ok...start your flames<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I think alot of people feel that if they don't do a fair amount of whining such as another unnamed class does at the Grove, that the shaman class won't get their fair share.  I'm not sure if that's true or not, but at least their intentions are good.  <br />
<br />
Thus far this has been one of the more intelligent EQ groups I've dealt with.  There are a ton of idiots in this realm, and thankfully this one seems to be largely idiot-free.</div></div><hr />

Take away all my spells, and I'll adapt. Even if I just become a luv kitty that follows you from zone to zone going &quot;luv me! luv me! luv me! I'm cute! I'm fuzzy! luv me!&quot;....<br />
<br />
wait....<br />
<br />
no....<br />
<br />
that's what my RL cat does. :)<br />
<br />
Well, I learn from the best.</div></div><hr />
