<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went up to murder some bunny rabbit in mischief today and was the first time I logged the fight. I parsed his damage and he busted something like 40 DPS, cimpared to Lodizal's 33 DPS. I think he also had about 32k HP. The damage shield potion I believe did something like 11k damage. I casted spells worth up to abouts hrm... metinkz 14k damage. I think da dogee chewed up the rest of the HP, not sure because I'm not too good with parsing logs harhar. Excuse--&gt; OGRE<br />
<br />
I turned hits off so the dogee damage was left out, so I *assume* he has 32k hp, dogee gud.<br />
<br />
THe fight was only 12 minutes which I thought was weird because somebody's Lodizal fight was 28 minutes?<br />
<br />
Heres the log, anyone find a mistek in my calcoolation? I got a feeling somethings wrong cause he even outdamaged the taskmaster in terms of DPS, when his max hit is 355, avg 200. It also could be my gear however, its not that great.<br />

<br />
Nm. I was thinking the Canni damage was taken into account, but i didn't see you taking too much damage from it to matter.<br />
The Taskmaster's max hit is 410, but he keeps casting queer spells, which lowers his potential DPS by quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">cool :)<br />
<br />
Its intresting to se the differences in shaman styles of play.<br />
<br />
The guy who solo'd lodi, howjan or something?, basicly only used epic dot as damage, and pet.  He was also always either Canni'n or torporing<br />
<br />
You use epic dot/mostly jbb as damage, and only cast canni 6 times.<br />
<br />
pretty intresting how different your play styles are :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I usually Canni a lot when fighting mobs but this bugger did damage too fast and I had trouble keeping myself at full health, I almost died at one point where spamming Chloroblast hardly kept up with his damage, let alone use a Canni there. <br />
<br />
I also did not find myself having trouble with mana, therefore throwing a pox into that fight. The main concern was how fast he dealth damage. Although Canni'ing in massive numbers is very efficient I tend to try and end fights as soon as possible but not run out of mana. Streaks of 300's+ and a few torpor interupts will kill me if luck doesn't like meh. <br />
<br />
What I thought was strange was Howjan's fight was 28minutes, while mine being 12 minutes. We both had pets? Damage shield. I have a feeling 12 minutes is aweful short for a mob with that much HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Every solo I do is a long fight, most are about 20-30 min.  I prefer to use free damage as opposed to dots even when they might be a viable solution for more dps.  There is really no reason why other than that's my &quot;style&quot; so to speak.  <br />
<br />
Nice kill Mooshfu, most impressive indeed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That was my point Moosh :D<br />
<br />
Howjan had a long fight as he was canni'n/torporing, and only using epic dot, you were JBB'n constantly :).<br />
<br />
Either way, both methods worked quite well apparently, too each his own.<br />
<br />
Both kills where quite impressive ;D</div></div><hr />

We both know that some gang of dr00ds would come up and swipe it on Drinal hehe. or worse yet, wizards with a pet druid to track ya down :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The reason his DPS is higher is that his attack delay is lower. Slowed this guy hits every 6secs. The other 2 were at 8sec delays.<br />
I don't see a post of your gear, but I would assume your in the 1100-1200ac category. Which I would hazard a guess most of these soloer's are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">moosh,<br />
<br />
you do know that the rabbit foot stomples drops is part of a quest to get your denizens of mischief faction back, right? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hehe yea Talamay one year ago I was on  a quest to get Ally mischief faction but found out that wasn't going to happen. Stopmles can drop throne cards which was what I was after ehhe :)<br />
<br />
I ended up finding a mistake in here too, probably the only one who bothered to but Stomples has LESS hp than Lodizal, so it seems, but not much. I think he has abotu 27kish. What I did wrong was I didn't count jbb damage as non-melee so I had an extra 5000dmg added to nothin.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oops forgot to post magelo, my gear isn't as good as Howjan's.<br />

I'm not good with computer crap so I just posted the link without a clicky thing :(<br />

By the way, its nice to have you back Talamay :)</div></div><hr />
