<p><b> Dual Wield &amp; Double Attack</b></p>

<p>Hiyas !<br />
I am pretty new to the game and have some questions concerning Dual wield.I hope somebody could help me with them.<br />
The reason for that is that I have recently bought a very, very cheap lammie (150pp!!, I couldn`t believe it myself) and I had icetooth claws 11/29 primary only and a blackened alloy longsword 10/29 prim / sec.My questions are:<br />
<br />
1)Which weapon should be in main hand?The most fast weapon or the weapon with the highest damage?<br />
<br />
2)Do main and offhand `act` independantly from each other while dual wielding or slows a slower mainhand weapon a faster offhand weapon down?(cause i was thinking about putting my claws in my main and the lammie in my offhand slot, because i love my claws<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> )<br />
3)what about double attack?Does only your main hand double attack?<br />
Every information about dual wielding and double attack would help me a lot.<br />
btw. my Dual wield skill is about 115, double attack 111<br />
<br />
thanks for your help<br />

<p>Main hand and off hand dont start acting independently of each other until later levels. If I were you I'd mainhand the Lammy and offhand the BA Longsword. The speed of the Lammy in your mainhand will outdo anything that the claws will do for damage just because of the sheer speed of it.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

They always work independantly of each other in terms of swings and delays.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>that means I could use my claws in main and lammy in off and lammy would still be as fast as in main ?at lvl 22?<br />

/agree Telloran<br />
<br />
Yup. You'll rarely connect with the offhand at your level though and even though you won't get a damage bonus to speak of until the 30's the Lam is still better in your main hand. It's 1 sec faster so even though you might hit for a bit less, you'll do it alot more often. I'd go Lam/BABS. Either way it won't be a huge difference right now, but as you level up you'll notice it more and more.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Another reason you'll want a faster weapon in your mainhand is because of the primary hand bonus.<br />
<br />
The weapon you mainhand will do a little more damage per hit sinply because it's in your good hand.  the faster the weapon, the more often that extra few points'll be applied.</p>

<p>Um no.  Main hand and off hand are always independent.  They are never linked at any level.<br />
<br />
The issue is, at low levels (i.e. up until like mid 30's) your off hand is going to swing very rarely.  So it's not really that important what you put there for damage, since it doesn't do much damage.  On the other hand, it checks for a dual-wield attempt every time the delay of the weapon fires.  So putting a faster weapon in the off hand will train the dual-wield skill faster.<br />
<br />
But don't sacrifice damage in your main hand just to put a fast weapon in your off hand.  You still need to make sure you keep a good weapon in your main hand to do the damage you need to survive (i.e. your main hand is doing most of your damage at this point).<br />
<br />
When you get to the mid/upper 30's you want to think about damage more for the off hand.  There are a ton of threads about dual-wield, and you should hit search to get some very good advice.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>A related question, how does Double Attack work?  Can it affect only the primary weapon, or the secondary one also?<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Double attack has a chance to effect either hand, however, your offhand is not as likely to have a double attack because of the level of skill in dual wield and double attack.  I forget what level it is that the chance of double attack with your secondary hand gets really decent though.  I know at 36 I'm seeing more and more offhand double attacks...<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Every time your main hand swings, it checks for a double attack on your main hand.  If the double attack roll succeeds, you swing twice.<br />
<br />
Each time your off hand might swing, it first checks for dual wield.  If the dual wield roll succeeds, you swing your off hand.  Then it checks if your off hand does a double-attack.  If your double attack roll succeeds, your off hand swings a second time.<br />
<br />
So, since double-attack on the off hand has to pass a dual-wield check first, you will double-attack with the off hand very infrequently at lower levels.<br />
<br />
Note the main hand and off hand checks are independent.  These will only happen at the same time if your weapons are identical speed.  So in essence, you can only get true "quad" hits if you are wielding weapons of the same speed.  Else your main hand and off hand will attack at different times.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>Just as an addendum to all the DW/DA info provided here, you will not DA on your off hand until DA reaches over 150.  So until you hit level 30 you will never get a second off hand hit.</p>
