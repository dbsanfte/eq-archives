<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm writing an article for SpawnWeek about class bugs.  For instance, rangers have a bug with arrows and walls, rogues have a bug with invisibility.  Is there anything about the shaman class that is a bug?  It could be a spell stacking issue they've never gotten right, but it shouldn't be a wish list sort of thing or class balance issue.  It should be a bug specific to shamans.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heres a Bug that really irritates me sometimes. <br />
Though all Guides/Gm's will say its as intended, blah blah so its not a bug, but feel free to add it.<br />
<br />
Losing all your buffs when you zone while low on Hit points. <br />
<br />
Now in general, you may be running to the zone for your life and barely make it to the zone with just under a bubble of health and when you zone, you are alive, but lose all your buffs. A Guide/GM will say, 'It's a lot better to lose all your buffs then die, so you actually benefit from that...its as intended'<br />
<br />
However, I was in the Nexus, and I was messing with Can5. I had less than a bubble of health and zoned into the bazaar. I lost all my buffs (including Virtue, KEI, Pally Aego) which I donated generously for. I was in no danger, yet I lose all the buffs.<br />
<br />
Now, I understand the concept, as I can see some peeps use a zone line to fight mobs that are high risk and would use the zone as a safe place to get away at the last second. To reduce peeps from using that, they made it that when you zone you lose all your buffs when very low on health <br />
<br />
But tt does frustrate you when you are in a non hostile zone or are in no danger from aggro and you zone only to lose all your buffs. <br />
<br />
This isnt Shaman specific, nor is it a 'True' bug...but thought I would share my disapproval for it. Maybe they can change it to like less than 1% of your health or something. Having less than 1 bubble could still mean you have over 400 hps or so. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here is what I believe is a bug.<br />
<br />
Scaled Avatar Boots stats and effect...<br />
<br />
Scaled Avatar's Boots<br />
AC 20<br />
Dex 4<br />
Wis 7<br />
Agi 4<br />
HP 40<br />
Mana 35<br />
SVF 5<br />
SVD 5<br />
SVC 5<br />
Focus Effect: Blast of Venom<br />
<br />
<br />
They are less ac then wolf callers boots, and the focus effect does nothing(and is in fact the name of our 54 poison DD and not a focus effect). Casting said poison DD while wearing boots does nothing, casting any other poison dd while wearing boots does nothing, and casting any poison spells at all does.. you guessed it.. nothing.<br />
<br />
The boots should probably have a couple more AC(at least 1 more then wolf callers.. since its supposed to be the next step up armor set wise from kael/ss stuff) and the effect is probably supposed to be MP4. <br />

Amen, they need to fix this crap.  I don't really care about the stats, but the effect is clearly supposed to be Mana Pres. 4 instead of the current effect:NOTHING.  All ornate boots have the same effect for members of the different class groups (every INT caster gets spell haste 4, every Priest [except us, who get the bugged no effect] gets mana preservation 4, every other mana-user gets flowing thought 3, and every pure melee gets vengeance 3).  Gimme my damn mana pres 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Dot aggro and poofing pets.<br />
<br />
There is entirely too much aggro on our poison dots.  If I stack 3 poison dots on a mob - it doesn't matter how much damage a wizzy does with his DD or a rogue does with backstab - it's not coming off.<br />
<br />
Pet pathing is still a major issue in many zones.  There are places where a pet won't last 30 seconds before disappearing.  This bug affects all pet classes, and can be abused by charm casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you cast Burst of Fire from a White Creamic Band you don't have to wait for your spells to refresh after casting Fury.<br />
<br />
Huh?  Never heard that one - I know it resets your spell gems so it looks like you can now cast another spell early, (just like weapon procs do) but as far as I know you can't actually cast early, you just get a message about &quot;Spell refresh time not met&quot; if you try to cast.  Am I mistaken?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Another but that's not entirely class specific is with Spirit Call. If you have an illegal target when casting it as you do when your pet says that it's not a legal target it will cast. Has it's cast animation and cast time and the refresh goes down, yet it has absolutely no effect. Most likely this holds true for mages and wizards mass pet abilities too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>talas213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">two DoT related 'bugs' are the biggest ones that come to mind.....<br />
<br />
1) DoT agro.<br />
<br />
Our DoTs generate more agro per DPS than anything else I've seen.  My guess is that all the agro generated from the DoT damage is generated at first.  That is, casting a 2k dmg / 7 tick DoT generates agro equivelent to a 2k dmg DD.  A DD has the advantage that it can be cast near the middle of the fight and still does full dmg.  The DoT has to be cast near the beginning of the fight for it to run full course.  However, casting at the beginning of the fight means you'll draw agro off the tank.<br />
<br />
2) Double resist checks on DoTs.  <br />
<br />
DoTs with an initial DD component have a double resist check (one for the DD and one for the DoT itself).  If either check fails, the spell is resisted entirely.  Thus DoTs with a DD component are inherently inferior to DoTs with no DD component due to having a higher resist rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Rain spells getting auto resists when mobs are low on hp.<br />
<br />
Torpor not taking hold on someone who has selos. Extremely irritating.<br />
<br />
Primal essence not stacking with Voice of Berzerker.<br />
<br />
Extended affliction items not consistently adding on extra duration on our poison dots. In general, affl. focus items sucking i guess, but that's more of a balance issue.<br />
<br />
Shaman sucking in pvp. Couldn't resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">That dumb flaw where slow mitigation caused hasted mobs has been fixed. Can't think of any other comprehensive class-specific bugs other than vendor buy-back prices on alchemy potions not being consistant with other trade skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Focus buff overwrites high level Cleric, Wizard, Enchanter, and who knows who else's high-level self buff. This shouldn't happen since the other classes usually don't like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Poison dots don't generate all there agro in one shot, they do continue to taunt throughout the dots duration, its pretty easily to show with a warrior and low damage output but fairly beefy mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">This is most likely not shaman specific, but thought i would mention it anyway because its a huge annoyance when it happens to you as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Casting malo on mobs that run out of range (usually due to bad pathing), resulting in you having to wait for malo to refresh. Then the mob warps onto the group and youre standing there tapping your foot. Why does a spell which never even went through have to refresh?</div></div><hr />

Actually, I don't think they can do anything about it. I petitioned about it before and the GM told me it's a bug thats been around for a long time, and there's no way to fix it***. If I remember correctly he said it has to do with hp buffs. If you are low on hp and zone with less hp than your unbuffed, EQ thinks you're dead so they take all your buffs away but you're still alive so it zones you. I'm just glad it doesnt take away exp! :)<br />
<br />
*** - I'm not sure if the GM said there's no way to fix it, or if they can't fix it or something of that sort. It was a while ago so I'm just going by what I remember. ;)</div></div><hr />

Made it all the way to PoM (after 7 attempts) with about 50000dps in tow, clicked on the &quot;nipple&quot; successfully, only to find myself naked at bind point with no death message. Arghhhhh!!!!!!</div></div><hr />
