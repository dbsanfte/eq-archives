<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blurrg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">2 main decisions:<br />
<br />
Valorium Ring of Gallantry or Glittering Ring of Judgement<br />
<br />
Valorium has more hps, both raw and through Sta, and a few resists. Glittering is 20 wis .. and half decent hps for a ring, but nothing else.<br />
<br />
Boots of Flowing Slime or Veteran Chain Legs (or some other big-ticket good AC/HP item)<br />
<br />
They both kinda fit into the same category. Should I go for AC/Sta/Hp items with some mana on them, or should I go all out with FT/Mana/Wis items? I currently have no problems keeping mana up, but am also only 51. From how I see things, the higher level the easier it is to keep mana up with things like Canni 3/4/5 and Torpor. If I'm going to spend the money on something like FT3 boots, I don't want to regret it in the long run.  If I don't get them I'll prolly buy some large AC/HP item like the Vet legs and go with racial armor on feet and most other slots. The ring fits in this too, since Valorium ring has some sweet stats, but the raw wisdom I would get from Glittering is overwhelming. Altho, once again I don't have any mana problems currently, so I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<br />
AC 10, Wis 20, Hp 50 is just too hard to beat. I recently swapped out a Valorium Ring for a Glittering Ring.<br />
<br />
At level 51, FT3 &gt; AC/Hp.<br />
<br />
Once you are 60 with Torpor and Canni5, you won't care about FT3 - since it is insignifficant compared to the mana regen you get from Canni5/Torpor.<br />
<br />
Then you would prefer boots with more AC/Hp/Stats and be willing to give up FT3.<br />
<br />
However, the road from 51 to 60 with Canni5 and Torpor is very long, and there will always be a market for FT3 boots.<br />
<br />
I would go for Glittering Ring and Slime Boots at 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which ring is better probably depends on your other gear a fair bit. 20 wisdom is alot of wisdom on any peice especially on a ring. It is a bit less hps and no sta compaired to a Valorium Ring of Gallantry. On the other hand that 20 wisdom may allow you to swap around some other gear for more hps/sta/ac gear than the current gear you wear there and still keep your wis at the level you want it.<br />
<br />
Personally I wouldn't wear either of them since I've already got better but if I where looking at one I'd choose the Valorium Ring of Gallantry since my wisdom is fine from other gear.</div></div><hr />
