<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been running around, south karana lately and i have noticed that certain parts of my gear have been lacking greatly, and i need to upgrade them, but i need money to do that, where is a good area for a 24 to start to gather money? experience isn't nessacary, just as long as its a good spot.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 24, if you don't mind taking a faction hit ... go kill treants in SK.  I spent quite a while there and made some quick cash.  After that, I headed to Paw and gathered as many FS weapons as I could to sell off, then headed to Rathe Mtns and slaughtered that gypsy (whatever her name is).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The first decent money making spot I ever came across in EQ was the treant camp in south karana.  Not only do the treants drop a lot of plat and gold, but they drop staves that can be sold for about 10pp apiece, plus a lot of random junk like spell research components.<br />
<br />
The camp is extremely easy if you have 3-4 casters and you just chain nuke every time a treant appears, but I doubt you could solo it at your level.  So if you can get a group together, I'd recommend that spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Treants<br />
<br />
you will not have a better source of cash until you can kill HG's<br />
<br />
and they are good exp at 20 to 28, as well.  (at 30 if ya can get the camp solo, it is great exp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mammoths in everfrost if ya can't find a group can be decent cash/exp.   Their tusks sell for 9-10pp with cha buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The raging highland kobolds in Stonebrunt are a good source of cash (about 150-200pp an hour if you clear 1 of the two camps).  I doubt at 24 you could do that but you should be able to pull from the camp easily.  They drop FS oriental weapons (nice for a change) and a couple of types of armor.  Easy to net 5pp or more per kill.  <br />
<br />
Stonebrunt is on the butt end of the world and you should have no trouble getting the camp.<br />
<br />
Only real trouble you should have here is the wandering gorillas and pandas, both are aggressive and dangerous at 24.  Easy to avoid if you see them coming but sometimes they will sneak up on you anyway.<br />
<br />
There are merchants in kitty city that should be indifferent to sell the heavier loot to,  and usually have some gems which will lighten the load of coin so you can hunt longer before you have to find a bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, thought u were higher, was gonna suggest enforcer camp in POJ for all the gems and spells that drop.  But at that level i'd say go to Guk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you've put in the time to get good Paineel faction and have a key Paineel guards are almost impossible to beat at 24. The real problem is to find them open anymore. Now that it's a known cash camp it's prety well permacamped anymore. Each guard drops a sword and shield that go for about 10 plat a guard, you take no faction hits, and they go down prety easy and you can sell the loot to a vendor right there and then bank the plat.  Before the spot became known I had no problem pulling in 140 plat an hour or so down there in my mid 20's for as long as I could stand doing it. Some of the guards even gave good exp at that level. Do NOT mess with the ones in the newbie yard though. For aggro purposes they were made lvl 1 mobs by con, but they are really the lvl 40 super-guards, prety well totaly magic resistant, dual for 200+......<br />
Mamoths will be prety hard to chew at 24 unless you are super twinked though, I'd wait till the later 20's to play with them, but once you can handle them they are prety good cash and exp, I did them all the way through lvl 30 when 30 was still a mini-he11 level. And made enough off them to buy all the gems for the Totemic armor quests. I have to agree about Treants, really good cash if you don't care about the faction. You might have trouble taking the camp solo though at 24. Good luck and good huntin'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At your level, you should be able to handle Crag Spiders in EK.  You will get a ton of Spider Silks which are hot items in the bazaar...can sell them for up to 100pp per stack.  XP is good too.  Just keep that Endure Magic buff up and Cure Poison spell handy and go to town :)...<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
