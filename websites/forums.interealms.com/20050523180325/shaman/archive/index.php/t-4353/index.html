I have heard of an elixer quest in neriak/erudin, that costs 1k per run and only takes like 10-15 to get ally, but I think my troll self would be quite kos in erudin.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really dont want to camp envy's and woe's :(.<br />

Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;potion&quot; quest your talking about is part of the Shadow Knight epic - and it's not Neriak/Erudin - it's Neriak / Paineel - so a Troll should have no problem raising faction to play in Paineel - may take some greenie slaughtering to do it - but it IS doable.<br />
<br />
**EDIT**<br />
<br />
Here's the quest steps for the SK potion portion:<br />
<br />
Buy Cough Elixer from Smaka in Neriak Foreign Quarter - at 1kpp a shot. Then head to Paineel and turn it in to Duriek Bloodpool - and that will get you the faction hit - bind in Paineel - and have a handy dandy porter to get you back to Neriak to rinse and repeat multiple times till your maxxed out on faction.<br />
<br />
**END EDIT**<br />
<br />
Or - you can go the Woe, Envy, Marr's Promise - probably at less of a cost - and do that turn in 10 times or so - it probably wouldn't even take THAT many turn in's to get to Max True Spirit faction.</div></div><hr />

My shaman is not a bot, its an alt to solo with, well frankly because I love soloing and shaman are stellar soloers.  This is coming from a necromancer main.  Right now let me say that I am VASTLY IMPRESSED with the soloability of the shaman.  The way its going now, the shaman will probably become my main when he hits 60 because I love him so much.<br />
<br />
Other piercers arent really an option.  I don't want to take an item away from a main who needs it.  The first and foremost reason I want my epic isnt to have uber gear on my shaman.  I want my epic to solo with, and I dont think there is some unwritten ethical rule in Everquest that says that someone isnt allowed to have 2 characters with epics, I'm sorry if I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
I didnt heavily twink my shaman with a fungi tunic, fungi staff, and manastone.  I didnt powerlevel him.  I don't see what you think I've done wrong, and why shouldnt an alt character be allowed to have an epic as long as I work for it?</div></div><hr />

Actually, forget the porter.<br />
<br />
Bind at the Firepots in Tim. Deep.<br />
<br />
Click to port to Neriak.<br />
Buy Cough Elixer from Smaka in Neriak Foreign Quarter.<br />
Gate to Firepots.<br />
Click to port to Erudin.<br />
Run over to Paineel and turn in.<br />
Gate to Firepots, etc.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine did the woe/envy part over and over. He did the quest normally until he got the SoW boots, did the woe/envy deal exactley 7 times and was maxed.<br />
<br />
Woe/Envy can be done same as above with the Firepots, except:<br />
<br />
Bind at Firepots.<br />
Click port to Oggok.<br />
Run to next zone, Rathe, kill mobs for Woe and Envy.<br />
Gate to Firepots.<br />
Click port to Halas.<br />
Run through, Everfrost, Crushbone, into West Karana.<br />
Turn in to Wandering Spirit.<br />
Gate to Firepots.<br />
<br />
The woe/envy mobs spawn every 2 hours I think, and as we were hunting he would just gate and do the above procedure whenever he wanted. He also would do it when he logged on each night and it would only take him like 20 minutes. He told me he did it 7 times after he got his boots to max faction.<br />
<br />
I was pretty tempted to do this myself after seeing how easy it was but I am trying to stick with the actual quest...hence he is an alt and has his epic, and I don't.<br />
<br />
Don't, for even one second, let ANYONE tell you how to enjoy YOUR game. I haven't lost any respect for my friend for doing his epic this way, it's his character and his $12.95.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It would probably be better to do the gem turn-in from the Rathe Mountains spirit to the Freeport barbarian over and over rather than wait on the long respawn for Woe &amp; Envy and then spending a ton of time finding that damn spirit or dumping a ton of cash on the SK method.  No idea of the relative size of the hits though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Uggok:  My alternative is to buy Woe, Envy and Marr's Promise from the bazaar.  Basically, let other people farm it.  :)<br />
<br />
I just search for them when I log in and before I log out.  Had pretty good luck- get a complete set once every few days.  No muss, no fuss.  Kind of a hassle running to the Wandering Spirit in WK, but it is for the epic. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i agree with doing the beginning of the epic over and over, but instead of the guy in RM camp pegleg in BB easier kill and easier access from firepots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">To everyone who says &quot;why shouldn't we be able to cheat on the epic,&quot; I'd answer that you shouldn't because its an exploit, and like all exploits taking advantage of it gives you an unfair advantage over other players who have the integrity to not take advantage of exploits.  Of course, I'm sure someone would respond &quot;well its not really an exploit, if it was VI would fix it.&quot;  Obviously, I think VI should fix it, but like I said the issue isn't what VI does or doesn't do, the issue is about having respect for your fellow shaman, specifically for the ones that did all the hard work to EARN their epics.<br />
<br />
As for  Pikkelz, I just don't buy that its impossible for you to do the epic properly.  You could always leave your guild for one that would help your alt, or you could join a new guild with your shaman, or you could gather all your friends together for a Hole raid, or you can organize and lead on on http://www.everquestraids.com or by recruiting people from your server's message board (if your server doesn't use that website), or if you aren't willing to do any of that, then you could play and enjoy the game without your epic.<br />
<br />
One final note, you are also a dork for posting this in the main forum :-P  The proper place for this thread is in the quests forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Pikkelz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Loramin, <br />
<br />
My question isnt really about the epic quest itself, its about truespirit faction.  If there was a faction forum I would have posted it there.  I didnt want to post it in the &quot;Quests and Special Items&quot; forum because it has nothing to do with special items and really doesnt have much to do with the quests.  If you think im a dork for posting it here then I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
Leaving my guild on either character is out of the question, leading a hole raid is out of the question as in my guild raids have to go through officers, and I will not be able to set up an epic raid for an alt.  Which is why I asked the question.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you to those who actually answered my question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Pikkelz: Different people have different opinions on the Epic...and thats fine. <br />
<br />
 I don't see what you think I've done wrong,<br />
You haven't done anything wrong (yet :) ).  And everyone seems to have their own opinion of what 'wrong' is.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to argue the ethics of cheating on your epic, we have had several excellent threads about it over the past month or so.  Many people have made many good points on both sides.<br />
<br />
 and why shouldnt an alt character be allowed to have an epic as long as I work for it?<br />
I worded that poorly.  There isn't anything wrong with having multiple chars with epics.  I was under the impression from your first posts that your shaman was going to be a rarely played char ala a cleric rez bot or a druid port bot - obviously this is not the case.  My apologies.<br />
<br />
However, I personally don't think *any* epic quest should be soloable.  If all you ever do with a character is solo, there shoudn't be a way for them to obtain their epic, whether they are a Shaman, a Beastlord, or a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Epic quests should be 'epic'.  It should require support of your guildmates/random strangers you paid off/friends.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, I'll stop trolling your thread now.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Pikkelz: sorry about the dork comment, that was supposed to be taken in a joking tone (thus the :-P ).  However, the whole point of gaining the faction is so that you can do the epic, and therefore I think it does belong in the quests section.  Moreover, if you had gone to post there, you would have found that many other people have already asked your question before, and that the answer is there already, which seems to sort of support my opinion that this thread belongs there.  But exactly where a thread belongs is a subjective thing *shrug*<br />
<br />
As for doing the epic properly, you kinda missed my final two points, but I think its my fault for not explaining them more clearly:<br />
<br />
1)  Lead a raid with your FRIENDS, not your guild.  Since it wouldn't be a guild raid, you wouldn't need to go through your guild officers.<br />
<br />
2)  Lead a raid through http://www.everquestraids.com .  Created by the infamous Rordin Firewalker, this site allows anyone to organize raids and find people who are interested in participating in them.  Since several other classes have epic parts in the hole, finding other interested people shouldn't be difficult (I see plenty of Hole raids listed for my server).  Again since this wouldn't be an official guild raid, you wouldn't need to deal with your guild's system.<br />
<br />
2b)  Not all servers utilize the site I mentioned, but even if yours doesn't it still prolly has a server message board somewhere, and you should be able to do the same thing, if in a somewhat less convenient fashion, via that message board.<br />
<br />
Finally, I do apologize for the trolling aspect of my post, but I honestly think that  having people take advantage of this cheat option available for our epic demeans the accomplishment of those who truly did earn their epics.  Plus, I wanted to demonstrate, both to you and to other's who might follow your logic when trying to justify their cheating, that their are options availble, even for the unguilded or low-tier guilded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The Hole part of the shaman epic is doable by one good group as long as the average level is pretty high - it's not a raid situation unless you're talking a bunch of 50-54 types, in which case you'd want a few groups because you'll be aggroing everything in the city on your way through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The hole 'raid' can be done with a single group.... take a well rounded xp group.... all the way down to kirn :)  That's how I had to do mine as my guild wasn't interested in wasting epic raid time on such a simple task.  Instead of just redoing the faction over and over, I decided to get creative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Pikkelz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">1) All my friends are in my guild :/.<br />
<br />
2) I am an avid pickup raider(NOT leader) sometimes and I have never even heard of everquestraids.com<br />
<br />
2b) We do have a pretty tight knit community so that is a good idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
However I know the alternatives, and I've went through all the options.  I'm just asking what the best way to raise truespirit is, thats my only question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bonegnawa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Pikkelz,<br />
<br />
I don't know about the actual faction hit on this, but there is a really simple way that I found last night just fooling around.  In Timorous Deep there is a bandit camp on the Fallen Iksar island.  At this bandit camp a Bandit Leader spawns that when you kill will spawn a lesser spirit.  You can just get the tiny gem from him over and over and keep turning it in to Bondl (sp?) in NFP.  Just bind next to Bondl and run back to TD.  Pretty simple really.<br />
<br />
Only slow part of this is having to kill the bandits 2 or 3 times and running back to oasis to wait on the raft, but it's very simple.  Good luck and hope this info helps a little.<br />

what i did was do the epic steps up to 'The city of mist reports'. all easy to solo/duo. then I went back and did black dire once or twice more, and the envy+woe like four times, and I was ally. got a tear from a friend's CT raid as they left the iksar broodling up. rak is easy with a tank+cleric. good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? 'Cause I honestly couldn't get my guild together for anything, and all my friends moved to Stormhammer or something. Anyway, I mostly did the gem turn-ins to Bondl and Ooglyn, 'cause finding the Wandering Spirit was a pain (And you have no idea how many times I found someone kiting it, only to complain about a named mob having no loot...)<br />
<br />
If that's an exploit, then so is killing orcs until you can bank in North Freeport :)</div></div><hr />

Do no enchanters in your guild need Kindle?  Kirn is RIGHT next to him.  No bards/warriors need red scales?  No rangers need um, that ranger epic guy?  There's also epic drops for paladins and SKs in the Hole.  No one working on the Strength of the Elements quest?<br />
<br />
Not to mention the Hole is a great place to farm iron oxides for any guild master potters who are selling solstice idols for plat.<br />

I wouldn't worry about the negative comments too much.  The fact is you are paying for the game so play it the way that you like.  Powergamers look down on roleplayers.  Roleplayers look down on powergamers.  ETC ETC.  Don't worry about it.  We all get our enjoyment different ways.<br />
<br />
The fact is most shamans have read the epic quest walk through which pretty much negates the spirit of questing.  I did the shaman quest the &quot;right&quot; way, but I don't look down on those who do it using faction trick.  It may be kind of an exploit.  Hell, verant could fix this or make quests non walkthroughable (ie dynamic).  Do what works for you and what you enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">cheat if u want to, i still pissed at verant for giving shamasn no decent offense spells or tradeable chain armour in luclin.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">For those that say The Hole part is imposible to do ...<br />
<br />
I've done it with one group, no enchanter.<br />
<br />
56 Paladin, 55 Druid, 57 Cleric, 60 Rogue, 59 Mage, 58 Shaman.<br />
<br />
It took us a while. Adds were a pain, but if you and everyone else know what they are doing, this will be nothing more than a painfully boring trip through a very beautifully designed and under utilized zone. <br />
<br />
I am convinced that when both my Paladin and Shaman are 60 I can duo my way to the undead tower for a new Slay Undead 3 Playground. And hell, satisfaction guaranteed or 90% of your exp back ...<br />
<br />
As for not giving alts/twinks an Epic. If it's a character you actually play and enjoy, why not? It's an accomplishment. I agree with shortcuts/exploits being pointless and deriving from what an epic means. If you do the epic right you get the necessary faction anyway. My Shaman will have her epic, but not before she's 50/55. It will help immensely when we're grinding away in Howling Stones/The Grey/KC Basement/The Hole's Undead Tower for EXP/AAXP. The Shaman Epic is a very good one, and very efficient for solo/groups. Besides, you all know how addicting the Shaman class is, chances are that alt may become a main ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Another way to gain faction with Truespirit is to deliver the gem to Freeport over and over.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>tacomodo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Can I just ask what you guys are talking about?<br />
What are you trying to skip?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Due to an unfortunate hole in the shaman epic quest, it's possible to build faction and skip basically the entire quest (the so-called &quot;difficult&quot; parts like Neh and Kirn in the Hole) and get a tear from Fear (or get an epic shaman to chain one) kill Rak, loot scale, turn it in for epic spear.<br />
<br />
The hole exists because after you turn in Neh's diary to the spirit, he gives you nothing to prompt the next part of the quest.  It's a break in the chain of events, since the next step is spawning the iksar broodling and simply killing it to loot the tear.  If a shaman got a gem from the spirit as a result of turning in Neh's diary which had to be handed to the iksar broodling in order to obtain the tear, it would be much more difficult to circumvent the quest via cheapie faction tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>tacomodo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Hmm... This seems strange.<br />
<br />
Let me see if I get this.<br />
<br />
So you give the gem to Bondl in Freeport a bunch of times until you con Ally to the spirit.<br />
<br />
Then you get tear from fear - give it to Lord Rak'Ashiir - kill Lord Rak'Ashiir - loot iksar scale and give it to spirit sentinel wolf in EJ and you get spear?<br />
<br />
You dont have to do anything else?<br />
<br />
If I'm wrong correct me.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't Verant fix this if this was the case? I just find it highly unlikely that this would work. Has anyone done it?<br />

<br />
You really do not even need to get the tear yourself, it can be MQ.<br />
<br />
Shaman epic was &quot;fixed&quot; a long while back if memory serves correctly in that too much faction was given out for the early parts of the epic quest. VI already scaled it back.<br />
<br />
There was also a fix to the ending of the quest to prevent shamans from just walking up to the last spirit with max faction and saying &quot;What Spear of Fate?&quot; and getting the epic.<br />

<br />
Or you can do it the easy way with a lvl 1 hafling rog and group him with a CoH mage.<br />
<br />
Run the rog to the tower and go to  the safe area and CoH everyone there.<br />

At least I think you can do it that way.</div></div><hr />
