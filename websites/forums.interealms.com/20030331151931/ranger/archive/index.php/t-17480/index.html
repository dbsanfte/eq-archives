<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've got decent gear, looking for a few quests worth doing.<br />
<br />
Yael's kind of out, since he's permacamped so no SoE, and I really hate the hole anyways. Can't do the bene bracer because I'm max kos to CoV. <br />
<br />
What's worth upgrading that I can pick away at in my spare time when LFG?<br />
<br />
Gear's in sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say the Chardok quests.<br />
<br />
The eventual result of the quest is this:<br />
<br />
Spirit Wracked Cord (Lore, No Drop) <br />
Wrist, Arms, Shoulders <br />
AC12, Sta5, Hp100, SvCold+10, SvMagic+5 <br />
Effect: Aura of Battle <br />
All/All Weight 0.5<br />
<br />
Complete walkthrough here:  http://how.to/chardok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Been plugging away at this - kindly  now. ^_^<br />
<br />
A good tactic I've been using is duo with a 65 bard. Bard pulls a giant train, AE's, I heal the bard a couple times, get faction hits for all of 'em when they die. <br />
<br />
Loot's not that bad there either. In 3 hours after vendoring all the useful crap, I end up with 3-500pp on me.<br />
<br />
Thx for the tip. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nerple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you aren't KoS to the Coldain, there is the 8th shawl.  Would say the Ring too, but looks like you have some nice rings as it is.  The shawl is one that I have been chipping away at lately when bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got Chardok ring 1 tonight at warmly. :)<br />
<br />
Should hopefully get ring 2 soon, then work on the Sinew and whatnot for the &quot;real&quot; reward of this quest. <br />
<br />
I have the 8th coldain ring, just need to get the time and group for #9.<br />
<br />
You can never have enough nifty nodrop stuff. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Into tradeskills? Crazy as a freekin loon? Got plat comin out of your ears? Have no job, no life and have a index finger as strong as an Ox?<br />
<br />
8th Shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok just checked your magelo profile. You need new bracers.<br />
<br />
Sell your gloves to a Necro and get something better there.<br />
<br />
Keep the boots ya got for resist gearand get something with more HP. The Light Rubicite ones from CT are nice.<br />
Same goes for your shoulders. Nice resist gear but you would do well with more HP.<br />
<br />
Oh and ya got a ST key... Your guild not doin ST? Primal&gt;Earthcaller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As far as the bracers - I'm working on spirit wracked cords, and I'll never take off the IFS (sentimental value maybe, busted my ass on that quest at 48 or so).<br />
<br />
Gloves / Boots: Just waiting for KT to drop some mithril ones :)<br />
<br />
And I have primal - velium claidmore is in my magelo. Bow didn't drop last time, and the 1hs's all went to monks. I use skybreaker &gt; earthcaller most of the time. Though a 1hb/s primal would be damn nice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asylumdweller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Got the second chardok ring today. :)<br />
<br />
ANy other suggestions on some quests?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rashgaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually i got a suggestion.  The Qeynos badge quest.  Only the 5th part requires a trade skill, you need 2 special foods (the third is a no fail so im not counting it)<br />
<br />
Stats on the final one are:<br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
AC: +6 Str: +6 Agi: +6 Wis: +6 Int: +6 HP: +40 Mana: +40  <br />
Weight: 0.1 <br />
Classes: All Classes  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
Inventory Slot: Neck <br />
<br />
Now no saves,2 less agi, 1 less ac, and 5 less hp/mana then your current, but it has 6 wis and 6 str.  I would definatly take if over your current one but whether it is worth the time to you i dont know.  You could probably solo everything but barducks.</div></div><hr />
