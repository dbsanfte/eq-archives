<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harlis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya :)<br />
Been partering with a beastlord alot lately, and we've done alot of dulak, but now at 55, its REALLY slowing down. Any ideas where we can still partner up without having to look for more members? Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amarusia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My husband is 56 beasty and I 56 shammy, which we group constantly, as you can imagine.  Although we still return to Dulak for the occasional farming party or the different captains to spawn on the ships, we have gone to a couple of other zones of late.<br />
<br />
We have spent a great amount of time in Maiden's Eye.  With two pets, shammy slow, etc...we have had great success and fairly good experience, with loot that is not too shabby. We have also gone into Veksar off LOIO and done very well by pulling the bloodgill warriors off the entrance and golems and sentries that spawn a little further inside the zone. <br />
<br />
The only warning on the bloodgill shamans are that they can and DO gate after about 20% or so health.  Your pets will follow them and they can and sometimes do bring reinforcement adds with them, so beware.  We got the bloodgill warlord to spawn and he dropped a decent pair of gloves that were ac6, wis5, agi4, mana25 that is equippable by all races and classes.  Not uber, but not too bad either.<br />
<br />
Good luck and safe travels.<br />
