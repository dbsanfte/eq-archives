<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hardback</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What lvl do you think shaman should put the majority of thier exp into AA exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I voted for 65 but that really depends.<br />
<br />
If you a shaman in a higher end raiding guild like myself then the decreased resist rate and the mutual overwriting of debuffs is very nice also. It also means your more likely to be able to access higher lvl spells.<br />
<br />
If your in a smaller guild then stopping at 62 or even 60 might be a good idea. Your odds of getting a 63+ spell are less and you have more options for where to get exp. Especially since you won't nessicarilly have access to the higher tier planes.<br />
<br />
Also it depends on your aa status. It you were already 60 when pop came out and had some aa already especially cann v then it's probably better to do some more lvling. If you just got 60 and have no aa I would strongly recommend putting most or all exp into AA until you get Cann v before continuing on any lvling.<br />
<br />
There is no simple right answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hardback</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes I was just trying to get a general Idea from the vast pot of knowledge here<br />
<br />
I guess I based it on myself and other shaman I know that have just recently dinged 60 and do not have can 5.<br />
<br />
I am 60 and pushing full throttle for the AA at the moment and am on #15.83 hopefully I will be able to get can 5 soon<br />
<br />
Thanks peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personall I aim to get Canni V first, and also to try to get 61 and 62 spells. Once I have Canni V and the True Spirit spell, I'll save up a few AA for spirit call and virulent paralysis, ding 61 to get them, and then go up to 62 before reviewing the situation.<br />
<br />
I am in a small guild, nobody else is over level 60 and most are between 46 and 58. If I went much above 60, I wouldn't get any xp grouping with my guild, and chances of me getting level 63+ spells are slim seeing as I've not got flagged for Tier 2 yet.<br />
<br />
If I was in a large raiding guild with Tier 2+ access I'd go for 65 and then AA, on the basis that AA at 65 will flow like water. I don't normally find my mana a big issue on raids, and hence Canni V is less important than in group situations (IMHO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had to debate this myself...<br />
<br />
I hit 60 the day before pop release... with all of 1 aa point.<br />
<br />
Now at level 62 I can comfortably hold my own in PoP zones.  After discussing with my guild I decided to hold off on leveling further and farm some serious aa points.  There are alt abilities that we need to have -we only have one shaman with MGB now.  I would like to level to 65, but MGB will benefit my guild.  Canni 5 will allow me to recover from a MGB without slowing down a raid significantly.  Radiant cure will help keep us fighting at max efficiency.  etc.<br />
<br />
Idealy I would like to hit 63 for the shot at better spells, and then do my aa.  This will also open up some aditional aa skills to me.  I am however holding at 62 and farming aa points at a rate of 2-3 per evening (giants in storm are great experience) until I have the skills needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is a question, I only have 2 points now and 64% through 60. The only shaman in guild with malo does not play much anymore and I am second highest shaman (other is 61) in guild who makes more raids than the higher shaman. I get a lot of resists in places like ToV and the like. I also am more a casual gamer as I play about 3-4 times a week for anoub 3-4 hours at a time (usually 2-3 of those nights is raiding). Should I go ahead for levels to cut down on resists or go to can V. I was also thinking about dumping my few aa points into spirit call as I solo a lot in the morning before work and though it might help me. I am not PoV/PoS flagged yet so the mega exp there is out of reach right now. So, what to do... turn off exp or AA.?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hardback</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Due to resist gotten from being lower lvl I would go 90% into normal exp and 10 into AA<br />
<br />
And also post on your guild web site and get them to get you flagged cause once your 61 alot of stuff becomes green or light blue causeing you to get very little exp once you ding 61.</div></div><hr />
