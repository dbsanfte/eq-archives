<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You wanted another post, we'll you have it.   Instead of working top-down to get upgraded, it's probably better to start from the bottom up.  <br />
<br />
Post what you think are the most glaring, underutilized shaman strengths.<br />
<br />
I'll start with:<br />
<br />
1) Our mana regeneration.  It's the best in the game, we need something worthwhile to utilize our extra mana.<br />
<br />
2) Our damage potential with DoTs.  We have amazing dps with DoTs and I'm upset we can't use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can 4 is sadly outdated, it's 3 expansions old. It NEEDS to be updated. Clicking the spell every time it refreshes for 1% mana is pathetic. Not to mention, I can only click the spell gem when I'm:<br />
<br />
1) Not casting any other spells<br />
2) Not moving</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, now give possible fixes or changes.<br />
<br />
And our mana regen isn't best in the game anymore.  Passive is neck and neck to better, particularly with Foci.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, my suggestion (and possibly the easiest to implement) is just to up the hitpoints taken and mana returned.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to think of what my hitpoints/mana were back when I got Can 4 at level 58 in the Velious era. I was still wearing jarsath pants...I must have been BARELY 2K hitpoints, BUFFED. Can 4 can hardly touch my hitpoint or mana bar anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1) Our mana regeneration.  It's the best in the game, we need something worthwhile to utilize our extra mana.<br />
<br />
This is hardly a strength. In Kunark it may have been true that we regened mana significantly faster than any other class, but whatever advantage we had has been whittled away by improved mana regen spells, focus effects, and other innovations that have significantly narrowed the gap. And that narrow gap is completely negated by the fact that our spells are the most mana inefficient of any other casting class.<br />
<br />
2) Our damage potential with DoTs.  We have amazing dps with DoTs and I'm upset we can't use them.<br />
<br />
This is not a strength either. This &quot;amazing dps&quot; cannot be used in most normal encounters for a number of reasons.  Sony purposely instituted a design change with recent expansions to stress fast action in most group and raid encounters.  The dps you speak of is amazing only on paper. When it comes to 99% of what shamans are doing these days, these spells are next to useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly...not all shaman are running around with 5k base hps and a mana pool so larget that 80 mana is only 1% to you.  Those that are probably don't even need canni that much since you probably also have....everything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, my suggestion (and possibly the easiest to implement) is just to up the hitpoints taken and mana returned.<br />

<br />
With regen buffs, chorus of marr and spell shield from items, canni4 almost costs nothing.  You're still regaining 100m/tick though.  You don't notice it because your mana pool is larger now.  Don't focus on percentages, because spells you cast will also take less mana off your bar than with a lesser mana pool.<br />
<br />
I would be upset if they followed their standard of doubling the casting time, the mana returned and the damage taken though. They won't do that though, there's a reason why they've kept canni under 3 seconds (because of spell haste). They're going to just give Chaotic Pain which will be an upgrade, but still has the &quot;flaw&quot; of canni (active regeneration).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Of course I need Canni. It's a shaman's only form of mana regen, I mash the button pretty much every time it refreshes when I'm not doing something else (heck, even standing at the bank).<br />
<br />
The spell is outdated. Mudflation has considerably changed the available gear choices, GoD will only continue this trend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With regen buffs, chorus of marr and spell shield from items, canni4 almost costs nothing. You're still regaining 100m/tick though.<br />
<br />
I don't like to be dependent on buffs from others. I won't turn down a KEI before an adventure, but I do plenty with only my own mana regen - can.  No KEI, no 9, no bard song, no horse, no spell shield, just my own class mana regen.<br />
<br />
It could use an update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Exactly...not all shaman are running around with 5k base hps and a mana pool so larget that 80 mana is only 1% to you.  Those that are probably don't even need canni that much since you probably also have....everything?<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly that is only part of the picture.  We're at the end of an expansion (LDoN). An expansion which has let non-raid guilds and &quot;casual&quot; players have access to gear which brings them closer to what people in endgame guilds have.<br />
<br />
What people on the message board are fighting for right now is an upgrade which we will need for the NEXT expansion.   Character hit points and mana will only go up with the next expansion as people play more and more gear filters down.  In other words, the &quot;average&quot; shaman is going to get closer to what is high end now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Exactly...not all shaman are running around with 5k base hps and a mana pool so larget that 80 mana is only 1% to you.

<br />
<br />
In many ways an improved cannibalize would benefit people with poor gear even more than people with high stats and focus items.<br />
<br />
A high end shaman casts the same slow spell as you do.  A high end shaman will have focus effects that make it last longer and cost less to cast.  You do not, it will cost you more mana and a larger percentage of your mana pool.   A high end shaman will have more FT which will allow them to regain mana at a better rate.   A high end shaman will have focus items to improve dots and DDs, making them more efficient, you will not.  A high end shaman has healing focus and AAs to improve the efficiency of their heals, you do not.  So you use more mana to do less!  It seems to me that people with lower end gear would be just as interested in a mana regen update, perhaps more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am also wetting my pants with glee over the 19 extra hp this spell takes which in turn gives me 8 more mana. YIPEE!!!<br />
<br />
Oh and...<br />
<br />
1) Our mana regeneration. It's the best in the game, we need something worthwhile to utilize our extra mana.<br />
<br />
Go look up the necromancer class.  We are hardly number 1 in this department (not anymore), and we seriously lose all contention over this with their upgraded lich in GoD (unless its been removed recently).</div></div><hr />

<br />
They may be instituting &quot;new changes&quot;, but there are still 2 expansions out there whose content isn't used up (Luclin and PoP).  In PoP, there are generally 2 functions a shaman handles other than debuffing the target: 1) curing bad AEs 2) dps<br />
<br />
Luclin is even more narrow, it's more the debuff then dps deal.<br />
<br />
Chain casting RGC, DA or Blood of Nadox on some mobs is completely necessary, but shouldn't rob us of our ability to contribute to damage.  DoTs are passive damage and if we could use them more in general, it would strengthen an underutilized function. <br />
<br />
Don't give us DoTs if we aren't supposed to use them anywhere other than soloing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps this is why you think that our mana regen is so great.  The detrimental side of our form of mana regeneration becomes clearly, painfully, apparent when you are doing a lot of healing, at least to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
agreed<br />
i generally dont do much dps on raids (depends on the encounter tho..)<br />
mostly a lot of healing, shrug..and it does chew through mana</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm sure this will make clerics and the necros who pump them very happy.   Enchanters are supposed to get mana pumping abilities too, at least it was a rumor. <br />
<br />
Necromancers with Seduction of Saryrn regenerate 50m/tick passively.  We have the ability to regenerate approximately 113m/tick (82mana/(2.5s + 2.25s)), but it's active.  There has to be a trade-off.  If their new lich spell is more than half as efficient as new canni per tick, then I will say we're getting screwed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shamans weren't meant to be a primary healer since around Luclin's release (from their development, it's painfully obvious) and probably before.  Doing more than spot healing with Tnarg's or Kragg's is like filling a pool with a sytrofoam cup, even with healing foci and AA.  All quick-cast healing spells are terribly inefficient by design.  With SCM3, a healing focus and mana preservation, healing becomes slightly more tolerable.  You're just trying to fill a role you're not really suited for.  <br />
<br />
However, if you pair healing with slowing (even with mitigation), we still have the best ability to mitigate damage taken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh but wait, canni4 is a 3 second recast so...<br />
<br />
82 per cast * ( 6 / 5.5 )= 89 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
We actively generate only 39 mana per tick more than a necro passively does.  They also get to cast OTHER stuff, namely DoTs and DDs and lifetaps and all sorts of fun goodies AND! they can run and jump around.  They can also do some damage to a MOB while they regen their hp back through their HoT DoT.<br />
<br />
(this is neglecting any mention of cannibalize AA since I'm too lazy to think about it right now)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My bad, alla has 2.25 recast (which I had thought was low, Lucy says 3).<br />
<br />
Cannibalization is equivalent to 1200 mana every 180 seconds or 40m/tick.  If you include that into the mix, we're back at around 110m/tick.  89+40 - time it takes to Cannibalize instead of Canni4.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say anything about being primary healer in my post.  I didn't say anything about the inefficiency of quick cast healing spells either.<br />
<br />
I am talking about MANA REGEN.  Our form of mana regen is ill suited to accomodate one of the primary roles we have as a PRIEST CLASS.  One of our primary roles is as a healer.  It has been one of our many roles for years now.<br />

I could argue that you trying to be DPS is a role that we are even less suited for than being a healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Btw here is a quote from one of your own posts:<br />
<br />
To fix the shamans class, do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Give us aggro management. I don't care how (AA, spells, a discipline).<br />
2. Cut the casting time of Tnarg's Mending in half or give us a faster casting moderate heal spell.<br />
3. Give us something that makes our pets worthwhile on raids.<br />
<br />

This should answer all your questions.  I believe it came out shortly before PoP was released (I think PoP was released in Oct/Nov 2002).  And I don't think any priest class got upgraded significantly more than another.  Slow mitigation was introduced, so we took a hit, but druids and clerics remained about the same.  Read thoroughly, please. Thank you<br />

Those are before I sat down to think about what was really wrong.  Though they're not too far off from what I still suggest.  Making our pets useful is stupid.  That's broken beyond repair.  Unless we get a new pet and all the goodies (Protection of Calliav and pet foci) to go with it, it's a lost cause.<br />
<br />
Another instant healing option would be good, but unlikely.  Group Quiescence that's TGBable (and MGBable) would be something useful.  However, I'd rather have fixes to old problems than getting a bunch of new things, like pet junk.</div></div><hr />

I've read and commented on these in the past, the distant past.  They were flawed when they were posted and they are still flawed.  In fact, if you had been around you would know that I was one of the people who tried to get Thott to fix the many errors in the very graphs you linked.  He made some significant changes to his so-called study because of my (and other crucible posters) specific comments.  At any rate, those graphs were much closer to being relevant to anything in 2002, before POP came out.  It's now 2004 and we are several expansions POST-POP (LOY, LDON, now talking about GOD).  Cleric and Druid mana regeneration was UPGRADED IN POP, shaman was not.  If you take comfort or some kind of feeling that things are okay by looking at outdated graphs on Thott's website, that's fine.  I prefer to discuss current and future issues, specifically that our method of mana regen needs some upgrades.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />

This must have been posted while I was posting (I watch TV and such, so I post slowly sometimes).<br />
<br />
jzak, you linked Thott.  Sniff glue much?  Go find the thread where these graphs were first discussed, it was one of the longest I've seen on the crucible (ignoring mill and friend's retarded Grey political threads).<br />
<br />
I guess these graphs work for you though?  You've found that your damage capabilities fall in line well with this, with the over 8 spell slots, the holes in time where you cast canni and a damage spell at once, and mobs that either hit for 0 every time, or can't melee when you get agro from stacking dots.<br />
<br />
 :rolleyes: <br />

I think you're a shoe-in for that award, because you obviously haven't been reading anything I've posted and simply reply with ad-hominem remarks.

And not a heal upgrade, since you don't seem dissatisfied with the sorry state of our healing power:<br />
Shamans weren't meant to be a primary healer since around Luclin's release (from their development, it's painfully obvious) and probably before. Doing more than spot healing with Tnarg's or Kragg's is like filling a pool with a sytrofoam cup, even with healing foci and AA...You're just trying to fill a role you're not really suited for.<br />
<br />
In fact, all you want is this(and the FoS upgrade):<br />
1. They took 1 second off Tnarg's casting time<br />
2. Fixed overwriting other slows<br />
<br />
This is just silly.  Taking 1 second off tnarg's won't fix anything, it'll still be healing for a ridiculously low amount.  Speeding tnarg's by one second won't affect the fact that we're the weakest at everything we do, except slowing.  The situation shamans are in is terrible.<br />
<br />
I won't even address your &quot;overwriting other slows&quot; point, as it's gibberish.  Here's a quarter, go buy a clue.<br />
<br />
If you can't see that shamans need new spells with an expansion, and that our current spells are negatively out of balance with other classes spells from the past expansions, you obviously don't play the same game (or aren't as familiar with your class and other classes) that the rest of us do.  Or you're stupid.  One of the two.  Your choice.</div></div><hr />

Basically superior mana regen channeled through inferior spells ends up a wash. Superior mana regen is strongest when background mana regen is low (say soloing) and superior spells are better when background mana regen is high.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoE generally doesn't give sweeping upgrades to single classes.  They do paradigm upgrades.  The upgraded all priests at the same time last time, new heal, next verions of HP buffs, etc.  They are in the middle of changes for the melee classes.  Whether it results in an upgrade remains to be seen.  If you get any healing upgrades, druids and clerics will get an [better] analogue to those and we'll be right back where we started.<br />

I don't want to keep repeating myself, you're like talking to a wall.  Losing a second on Tnarg's cast time is more likely than getting a boost over druids and clerics.  I live in a land called reality, would you like to visit?<br />

I won't even address your &quot;overwriting other slows&quot; point, as it's gibberish.  Here's a quarter, go buy a clue.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main point was to get them to add a message that will tell me whether or not a mob is slowed with an equal or lesser slow, so you don't have to bother wasting mana (since some think we don't have enough!) slowing something that's already slowed.  Of course people will choose to flame over discussion, because we're entertained by the lowest common denominator.  Why do you think American Idol is in its third (or fourth) season?  The show and its premise is played out, people like seeing others suffer.  That's called schadenfreude.  <br />

You've provided wonderful entertainment for me.  You obviously are a pisspoor shaman who's only interested in shiny, new toys.

There are so few visionaries among you.  The shaman class will continue its decline, all because the majority is looking for a better instant heal and more HP on shaman buffs.  Playing the devil's advocate to the standard, knee-jerk upgrade requests and finding the basis of our class's flaws and mending them will more likely result in a true improvemant than new spells and stupid AA ever would.<br />
<br />
Well, be happy then, because a substandard, new heal and worthless stat/hp buffs is what you're all going to get, though in lock-step with what the other priests get.  And then we will regurgitate this argument again, like for every expansion that has come along.<br />

I'm obviously not talking about this expansion.  We know what spells and AA we're getting and there's really nothing we can do to alter it, since it comes out in about a month or so.  It could also be that if we did get a new heal, they could have hidden it in like they're apt to do.<br />
<br />
You apparently know nothing about the software development cycle.  They're in testing mode now, and it's unlikely they're going add anything else.  No matter how loudly we cry to them, changes are pretty much through.  They're tweaking what's there and that's that.<br />
<br />
These threads have done no good and will continue to do no good.  If we don't get an improved heal in this expansion it's mostly likely because this debate repeated itself before on here (can't blame me for that fiasco though, I didn't participate in previous class balancing bull****) and no clear consensus was drawn as to what we needed.  That was all you guys, so give yourselves at pat on the back, wise shaman players.<br />

This made me laugh.  I love group shrink, I use it all the time.  Oh wait, I don't, because it's not a TGB. Talisman of Alacrity was hardly worth drooling over.  The only thing decent about it is the duration (with extensions).  <br />
<br />
<br />
The fact is, we know nothing of what spells they're ultimately going to give us.  That new Quiescence they hid away in the database again could be a group Quiescence for all you know.  They could change it from single target to group at the last minute.  You people are bitching over nothing.  If you aren't happy with the shaman class, start a druid or cleric if you like healing and start a wizard or mage if you like doing damage.  I personally love the class despite the crapola thrown at us.<br />
<br />
If they wanted us to know everything they were going to give us, they would tell us outright.  Maybe the devs are American Idol fans as well.  Remember, schadenfreude.  You enjoy it, they enjoy it, we all enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS. You never replied to the Tnarg's suggestion you had to make it a worse heal for 90+% of the Shamans.<br />
<br />
Do you have empirical evidence that 90% of shamans have Speed of Mithaniel or better?  There are probably 50 (being very generous) shamans on any server that have the *ability to obtain the effect* out of 200+.  That means probably less than 50 actually have SoM or better.  <br />
<br />
And LOL at the idea of considering the SoM LDoN augment as a viable source for shamans getting the effect.  Fewer guilds than you think are raiding ldon at any level, because the loot straight-up sucks.  The melees in my guild hope another Shield of Pain III augment will drop.  If a guild is raiding ldon, there's a pretty good chance it's because they've cleared Time, are bored and want a challenge.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
<br />
Empirical Evidence<br />

There are 1082 shamans on my server (level 1-65)<br />
There are 216 shamans of appropriate level for Tnarg's Mending (62-65)<br />
Of those 216, I know of 25 who are in raiding guilds capable of killing the mobs that drop items with Speed of Mithaniel or better.  Throw in 15 more for uncertainty.<br />
Of those 40 let's assume 90% (a big stretch) of them have SoM or better.  That's 36 shamans out of 216.<br />

Talisman of Alacrity was hardly worth drooling over.  The only thing decent about it is the duration (with extensions).<br />
<br />
And the fact it was a group haste with a decent duration and replaced a completely worthless spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact is, we know nothing of what spells they're ultimately going to give us.  That new Quiescence they hid away in the database again could be a group Quiescence for all you know.  They could change it from single target to group at the last minute.  You people are bitching over nothing.<br />
<br />
No, we are bitching over spells/AA being added to our class which have nothing to do with our role or cause it to slide closer to not being worth using.  To say we know nothing is of what is coming is naive, we see the plans for aa/spells on Lucy.  Some will be changed, more may even be added, but not unless we give feedback on what we want for our class(what you call bitching over nothing).<br />
<br />
If you aren't happy with the shaman class, start a druid or cleric if you like healing and start a wizard or mage if you like doing damage.  I personally love the class despite the crapola thrown at us.<br />
<br />
So instead I should just be a Focus and slow bitch?  I say nay nay.  By the above quote you relegate us to the bot status you claim to want to avoid since our heals won't be worth it and our damage will be iffy at best.<br />

Ever tried to get people to leave a free space in their groups for a shaman to join and shrink them?  If you did, I bet you sent tells to the 2 groups leader who did and one of them was AFK.  I shrink my group and that's it, if they request it.  I always grow myself again anyway so I can better target mobs to debuff them.  If people want a shrink, they buy an Anizok's device.  Shrink isn't the wonder-spell you make it out to be.<br />
At this point there is no reason for Shrink, Grow and Tiny Terror to not work for people in the same raid as you.  Planar Projections and raid mobs (mostly RZ) can tell if you're in the same raid, why can't they put that check on a spell?<br />
<br />

I know of several guilds who have a scripted CH chain they use on raid encounters.  While shamans can be boxed buff bots, playing one well requires a little finesse.  I hope we never reach the same healing power as clerics, because we'll end up in a scripted CH chain.  What we do on most raids is far more entertaining than many other classes.  Try being a monk: wait for mob to be placed, /autoattack on, AFK to watch porn for 3-5 minutes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Besides, can you just summarize your suggestions again?<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Fix DoT aggro (not with an AA, legitimately fix the how the damage is calculated) or make Plague of Daluda have a Reduce Hate by XXX each tick.<br />
2. MGB/TGB Quiescence (though I'm debating if it would be better as a mana-free AA) if they give us another heal, because we'll be disappointed with any instant heal they'll give us<br />
3. If they insist on giving us pet AAs, give us better pets<br />
4. Group FA (or reduce FA's recast, it's not like this spell is anything more than 140 ATK)<br />
5. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't give us an extra buff for endurance regeneration.  Add that crap to FoS/Fo7 if you must.<br />
6. Augment FoS/Fo7 (or FA at worst) with a-la Ceno's suggestions; add melee attributes to it like those found on PoTime items.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's something for the heal freaks:<br />
<br />
Since SoE is apparently reluctant to give us another instant heal spell.  How about an AA that's similar to a paladin's Act of Valor.  Allow us to transfer a percentage (between 30%-50%) of our life to someone else and cap it at something reasonable (or don't cap it because it could scale up in power as the shaman gets more hit points), and make it critable with a decent cast/recast time (similar to a mana-based spell).  Call it Spirit Mending or some crap like that, it goes with shaman spirit connection mumbo jumbo.  It appears to solve the problem of our lesser healing powers, but it involves some danger to us (heal aggro and loss of hit points don't go well together) and isn't a mana-based spell.  We can't chain cast it, because we'll kill ourselves. I can't see anything horribly exploitable with it, but it's 4am and I'm tired.  If someone else heals you after you use it, the other person still spent mana on healing, so I can't see any free-heals-by-proxy on this one.  Also, it gives us another way to freak out clerics in our groups.  They've gotten too accustomed to Canni5.<br />
<br />
SoE can just reuse the code for Act of Valor and modify it (much like they did for Talisman of Alacrity - stripped down version of an enchanter group haste spell).<br />
<br />
That's the best my state of sleep-deprived delirium can produce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Ever tried to get people to leave a free space in their groups for a shaman to join and shrink them?

<br />
As the co-GL of my guild and until the past couple months ONLY shaman with group shrink yes I have and I've dealth with them the 2 instances they were afk.<br />
<br />
I shrink my group and that's it, if they request it.  I always grow myself again anyway so I can better target mobs to debuff them.  If people want a shrink, they buy an Anizok's device.  Shrink isn't the wonder-spell you make it out to be.<br />
<br />
I didn't make it out to be anything.  You made an assumption.  What I posted was there because you said you don't cast group shrink because of no TGB, which you now say you just shrink your group.  Which is it?<br />
<br />
At this point there is no reason for Shrink, Grow and Tiny Terror to not work for people in the same raid as you.  Planar Projections and raid mobs (mostly RZ) can tell if you're in the same raid, why can't they put that check on a spell?<br />
<br />
Actually, there's no reason for it to be non TGB, they can always make a toggle for shrinkable in player ini files.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some players still ask me for SLTW anyway.<br />
<br />
And don't need it unless they have no haste item in most cases.<br />

They have altered abilities/spells before, both prior to and after launch and we will see them because they at least give time to test in beta.<br />

*cough* WE AREN'T ASKING FOR HEALING POWER ON PAR WITH CLERICS, JUST NOT TO BE SO LEFT BEHIND THAT A HYBRID CAN HEAL BETTER THAN WE CAN.<br />

What we do on most raids is far more entertaining than many other classes.  Try being a monk: wait for mob to be placed, /autoattack on, AFK to watch porn for 3-5 minutes.<br />
<br />
And then when the mob moves with the inevitable push, or if you are cornered like with Vindi and I don't see you doing anything like kicking or disciplines you get chewed out and if enough times possibly booted.<br />

And LOL at the idea of considering the SoM LDoN augment as a viable source for shamans getting the effect.  Fewer guilds than you think are raiding ldon at any level, because the loot straight-up sucks.  The melees in my guild hope another Shield of Pain III augment will drop.

I've done it before, I don't want to do it again.  You make an enchanter sit with you debuffing and memblurring mobs for 2+ hours.  They don't like you too much after that.  I no longer have the data, just the means, variances and p-values (if I have those even).  If I recall, the p-value ended up being 0.02something, which while not horribly damning like a p-value of 0.005something would be, it was still strong enough to reject my null hypothesis.<br />
<br />
Most people wouldn't understand a legit hypothesis test anyway.  And it would be easy for you to say &quot;That's a lie and bull****, you can't tell with 30 data points.  You can prove anything with statistics! You're stupid!!&quot; when the value comes out that would cause rejection the null hypothesis of there being no difference between slowing an unslowed mob and slowing a previously slowed one.<br />
<br />
I set up the test for you.  If you're dying to laugh at me, then perform the tests and post the data for everyone.  <br />
<br />
I've seen the results.  I'm convinced. I really don't care where you stand.  I still want a message that tells me if a mob is already slowed or not.  Are you denying that's useful?</div></div><hr />

Anger clouds your judgment.  WBA would turn Tnarg's into a 3.04s cast.  2.8 is still better than Tnarg's with WBA.  I said that 16% of the shamans on my server (or any) MIGHT have Speed of Mithaniel or better and they would be the only ones affected if Tnarg's would drop to 2.8 inherently.<br />
<br />
Okay, you got me, I'll cave.  We can make it 2.66s casting time.  That's like WBA + BoR.<br />

- Why you need enchanter? You have Togor or Tigir. And ... why do you need mobs to test it? Just cast it on yourself. Sounds like someone who's talking out of his arse without data to back it up. Not to mention your retarded test could be done in 20 min, alone, casting on yourself and curing if needed.<br />

<br />
Most people wouldn't understand a legit hypothesis test anyway.  <br />
- Must be hard to understand: If a mob is slowed, any subsequent slow will land much harder due to increased resists from first slow. One simple sentence must be very hard to understand indeed. Sounds like another excuse, but at least you should use something beleivable like: My dog ate my data, or I lost it, or my grandma threw it in the garbage ... <br />
<br />
And it would be easy for you to say &quot;That's a lie and bull****, you can't tell with 30 data points.<br />
- I had 8 resists on a slow on a mob this morning in a normal adventure, so I can say that every mob in easy LDoN adventures needs at least 8 casts of slow to be slowed right? Why you think people do melee parses that last for hours? Dumbass.<br />

Thank you for proving my point of people misunderstanding.  I'm talking about a statistical procedure which shows one process is not equivalent to another.  Process sampling.  It requires MATH.  I know math is hard for most people to understand, but bear with me.<br />
<br />
When a drug is in testing for the FDA's approval as a substitute for another (mostly a generic for a brand-name), they need data to show in vivo (Latin for &quot;living&quot;) bioequivalence (sorry, big word).  This means the drugs are equivalent and can be substituted for one another at equivalent dosages (with regard to absorption rate).  The null hypothesis for these tests is: Drug A and Drug B are bioequivalent.  The final outcome is to either REJECT your null hypothesis or NOT REJECT your null hypothesis.  You can never prove the null hypothesis is true.  They hope their data will result in values that WILL NOT reject the null hypothesis (which is contrary to most hypothesis testing).<br />
<br />
Now in these tests they give the original drug that they want the substitute for to the control set and the substitute drug to the test set of subjects.  After all these tests are done they simply don't say &quot;Well, only 10% of the test set showed adverse effects, so they must be the same!&quot;  They take note of what happens: did the test set experience nausea, delusions, chills, fever, etc.  They gather all this data, calculate statistical values (power of the sample size, means, variances, p-values) and they take those values and apply a test (Wald test, chi-squared, Likelihood Ratio, etc) or usually several tests.<br />
<br />
Now, if you kindly look back in the other thread, I DID give you a test on how to do this.  Checking whether previously slowed mobs resist Turgur's more would be testing a process and thus would require process sampling.  Below is the most general null hypothesis I can think of.<br />
<br />
Null hypothesis: The resist rate for Turgur's on unslowed mobs is the exact same as on already slowed mobs.<br />
<br />
You can alter this null hypothesis to include only beastlord slows, only enchanter slows, Togor's Insects, with or without MR debuffs.  Whatever you want, you can throw in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;One simple sentence must be very hard to understand indeed.&quot;  Apparently it is for you.  I said I rejected that null hypothesis and you scoffed at me.  I obviously can't supply you with a sentence you will believe or understand.  If I gave you the data, could you perform the calculations and statistical test *correctly*?  I highly doubt it.</div></div><hr />

You said: Ever noticed a mob becomes horribly resistant to Turgur's once any slow has already landed on him?<br />
<br />
Then it was pointed out how ridiculous that sounds. Then you spewed this garbage: I have empirical evidence that this is true for mobs at or above your level.<br />

Stop using Chewbacca defense and rambling about null theory and statistical garbage wich has nothing to do with your empirical evidence that you supposedly have. Show us the empirical evidence or S-TFU.<br />

Too bad it is.  Go ask any statistics professor what a sufficient sample size for process sampling testing a single variable at 5% tolerance.  Also make sure to tell him the process is innocuous (non-fatal).  He'll say &quot;somewhere around 30.&quot;   Since you've shown you have no knowledge of statistics at all, your comments pretty much hold no water.</div></div><hr />

- When you are actually done with game content that involves Lord Crush give us a call. When you actually get to Rathe, LDoN raids (time level), Coirnav, Quarm, Spider isle, Bertoxxulous in time and your clerics don't suck (ours own thank you), you might realize that DI is useful (even for a shaman), then again you are too dumb to understand anything. Every single Quarm run I have DI on my back. Every single Rathe run I have DI. Of course SoE could have put 20 DEX on that item, but instead they put a stat that actually matters for some situations and has some limited uses instead of garbage (DEX). Of course you knew that right? Dumbf-uck.<br />

Too bad we're in Phase 5 of Time already. I've done every encounter in the game so far without DI, EVER.  I've been crucial parts of all those raids: kite team on Coirnav and pull team on Rathe.  I've NEVER needed DI.  Enchanters get DI on Coirnav.  TMs get DI on Rathe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your guild's strats require DI on auxiliary classes, but ours don't.  I can share with you in PM if you want, you know, to improve on yours, since they lack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">/gasp Cast Qui like everyone else does!  That's 200 mana if you're gimp and have no SCM3 or mana pres item.  So, 1000m every 180 seconds which equates to 33m/tick.  You might have to cast Qui again if you don't have SCRM too.  But I pity the shaman without SCRM.  It's still over 100m/tick combined.<br />
<br />
You forgot to begin your post with 'Sorry that i was too lazy to look the spell up and got my numbers wrong'. Cannibalize does not and will probably never give 1.200 mana.<br />
<br />
But hey, one cannot expect from such a knowledgable shaman to admit an error... <br />
<br />
Try to grasp this:<br />
- your numbers were wrong (that wouldn't be too bad, if it wasn't combined with such a terrible 'know it all' attitude)<br />
- no shaman is spending half his time or more on canning (some of us actually like to heal or nuke once in a while).<br />
<br />
Your numbers are theoretical BS, far away from any real game situation. Maybe Thott is interested in making a new graph about mana regen and could use some help? Make sure to ask him.</div></div><hr />

My English is so horribly broken.  It must be in the bottom 5% of people on this board.  I can speak German (and Spanish), but schadenfreude (and it's spelled &quot;mis&quot;fortune), is a legitimate word that can describe motifs of literary works among other things.  If I used &quot;non-sequitur&quot;, you would have called me a 3rd century Roman and said they were inbred and stupid.  If I used &quot;quixotic&quot; (which describes some of the posters' ideas on this board), you'd have called me a lazy Spaniard.  Maybe I should take some English lessons from bonestomper to bring it up the level of this board.<br />

I did not ignore corrections, I corrected myself.  I adjusted my figures for mana regeneration when my mistakes were pointed out, however, it did little to knock down my initial argument on the subject.<br />
<br />
Amortized Cannibalization results in 31.8m/tick (maximally, including unadjusted mana cost for casting Quiescence and MC3 required)<br />
Canni4 results in 82m/(2.5s + 3s) = 89.4m/tick<br />
<br />
OPTIMALLY (key word) we regenerate 120.2m/tick.  Obviously that doesn't work in reality.  A necro's OPTIMAL (key word again) renegeration is 53m/tick (assuming they have MC3 also).  They still need to lifetap to regain their lost hitpoints, so they waste mana there. Touch of Mujaki is 450 mana (without preservation), so that takes up 9 ticks of SoS (54 seconds of regen gone in an instant). 3 clicks of Canni4 regains what we lose in casting Quiescence.  In the optimal situation, our mana regneration is ~2.25 times better than a necros.  We pay for that modifier with active regeneration.  If you want to include other buffs into the equation, necros can't use enchanter regen buffs when using SoS.<br />
<br />
You can also look at a standard necro's spell line-up and a shaman's to compare how much mana each class actually uses over a given period of time.</div></div><hr />

if you're going to use numbers with a necromancer using mujaki, then do it with a shaman using tnargs instead of quiescence.<br />
<br />
in the interest of generating mana a necromancer would use  saryn's kiss (lifetap dot), not mujaki, same deal with shamans and quiescence..<br />

SK is 550 mana heals 2000hp over 10 ticks, Mujaki is 450 mana and heals 850hp instantly.  I concede that SK is better, however, the mana cost is still 2.75 times more than Quiescence, so they still aren't ahead on the mana regen.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Even though SK and Mujaki are lures, there are still mobs who can resist MR-based lures (very, very few, but it's still noteworthy).  Quiescence would never have that problem.</div></div><hr />
