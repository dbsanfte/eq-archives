I just got finished reading this:<br />

I recently had my first try at doing this at a razorfiend group in pov. It wasn't a choice on my part- there wasn't any healers around on the server looking for a pickup group in tier2 at the time. It took some practice, some mob kiting and experimentation until I could get in the groove and keep it up with non stop pulls. The below setup I would consider a bare minimum for pulling this off at my current level (59).<br />
<br />
war, sk, necro, bst, wiz, and me at the shore of the lake just west from the ZI from PoT (called outer on our server).<br />
<br />
I had FT1, c3, kitty crack(s3), and bear form. Having a SK/PAL pulling with a KEI and keeping aggro seemed like a must have. He got off snare on about half of the pulls, I'd have the fiend malosini'd on the incoming, and slow immediately regardless. The rest of the fight was non-stop canni4 and kraggs. I tried it without kei for several pulls and wasn't able to keep up. Burning 1k5 mana per mob + buffs was challenging.<br />
<br />
Are there any better strategic ways to do this? The above strategy was what I could figur' by myself after some trial and error (no canni5 or tnargs).<br />
<br />
Thanks-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taiyed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The amount of mana you have left over usually depends on the group.  You can try having the mobs rooted or snared until you land slow, and then let the tank(s) have at it.  This will save a lot of mana/headaches and deaths.  Tried something new just yesterday while cleric was AFK;  had a bard pulling, and he kept 'em mezzed until they were slowed.  Having them slowed before any tanking happens is the key to everyone living and having plenty of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would go with the advice in the other thread - stay in Tier 1 planes until you hit 60 (if not 62 for Tnargs).<br />
<br />
The razor fiends are all at least lvl 62, so you're gonna have tons of resists.  If the rest of the grp is also around your lvl, they are going to have the same problems, plus low HPs on your tank.  I've seen a lvl 61 cleric go OOM on just 2 pulls when a 58 Paladin was tanking...nothing wrong with the cleric, the tank just couldn't last long enough for HoTs and Complete Heals.<br />
<br />
So the best strategy to '4-role' in Tier 2 is go get some levels.<br />
<br />
Specific to outer:  When I have grp'd at Outer with a necro it's usually easiest to aggro-kite the mobs around in the area.  pets + melees just run along behind it while necro keeps the fiend focus'd on it.  Other classes can be the rabbit (you could try it some time) but necro's are the best by far.<br />
<br />
General advice:  If you are doing all four roles (haste, buff, slow, heals) you will be spending the majority of your mana on heals (by far).  Find ways to reduce the amount of healing required.  Aggro kiting, root/rotting with other casters, pet-tanking, etc.</div></div><hr />

Well in my oppion thats not 4 rolling, its being a shaman. All of that is normally our job at any givein time. And quite regulaly is. About the only thing thats really going to help you atm is LV's. LVs mean better spells more mana hp ect. Past that you would need to look at your gear. Get a pony if you dont have one that will help your mana regen greatly. Ft, regen ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Basically, I see your problem arising from being underpowered for the zone. Valor wasn't really designed for sub-60 people, in my opinion. Yeah, you can do it, but I wouldn't expect to be able to perform optimally there. Before the flag change, it was almost unheard of to see any characters under 60 there, and it was tough to get a group unless you were at least 62-ish.<br />
<br />
You'll see a huge increase in power over the next few levels. As a comparison, a 65 monk and 65 shaman can handle all of the Inner Cave and most of the Outer Cave with no problem, even in subpar gear.</div></div><hr />

LOL I was thinking exactly the same thing.<br />
<br />
Buffing, no-brainer.  Give out the minimum buffs you can, try to avoid downtime due to buffing, but you gotta do a certain amount of it.<br />
<br />
Haste is not an issue any more thanks to Tali of Alacrity.  Longer duration and group-based, woot.<br />
<br />
Slow, well, that's just what we do.  No need to go into those techniques here.  <br />
<br />
Healing is one of the tougher ones until you get Quiescence.  Takes some careful mana management and constant cannibalization.  If you're the sole healer/slower, YOU call the med breaks if necessary.<br />
<br />
The riskiest time in the group is when the mob is not slowed yet, but you're the main healer.  Make sure the pallys and even rangers are aware of this and maybe they can cover for you while you get slow to stick.  Use Regrowth, it really is worth it.  And always heal with Stoicism/Torpor/Quiescence when possible - Sto and Tor can only be used on non-melee during combat, but if it looks like the mob is going to be dead soon, hold off on that last heal and Torpor after it's dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It gets better and easier as you age.  I used to try and over extend myself when I was younger trying desperately not to torpor melees.  Now with Tnarg's and Q with SCRM, QB2 (and spell haste item) and cann5, it's all doable.  Prior to 60, it was a challenge.  Dropping a Q on an MA/puller just before the mob arrives in camp, malo(s) the mob (if TIER2 or greater), slow, Tnarg's (AHG1, good chance I'll crit the heal).  If the MA is in good shape after the slow, it's all good.  Sometimes I still get multiple resists after Malo goes in, thats when it gets dicey.  SKs are great MAs when properly AAed as they can heal themselves and build aggro with taps and crit often.  In LDoN (normal) I get so bored I nuke and DoT.  My biggest limitation is the 8 spell slot limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you can't do it all, them them so. I almost always insist on a second healer of some sort, just because I don't have time to heal and keep my mana up. This may change in a few more AAs when I get Cann5, but there's nothing wrong with *not* being able to do it all, as long as you tell the group that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you're grouped with a Paladin, have him stun the mob before it reaches the group.  It will buy you an extra few seconds to debuff, and also build up some aggro on the paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wait till 60, get malo first.  BIG difference, you can slow on first try almost always after malo'ing.  I was healer the other night in razor camp with a beastlord for tank, plenty of mana left over for the slows.  Chanter insisted on the job, so he did it.  Of course, whenever he got aggro, he ran the darn thing around the group in circles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've only gotten a few helpful small suggestions from people that have actually done what I was asking about initally. Thank you for reminding me that we get more powerful as we progress in levels and AAs, I had forgotten :P.   I was asking for strategies on other ways to do it all at once without c5 and extra levels. <br />
<br />
I don't consider myself too low for tier2. I can do full damage from my dots and nukes and have no trouble slowing most mobs in the zone (havent tried the castle).<br />
<br />
Am I really that gimp because I can't malo or c5 in tier2? Or am I dealing with spite from people because I didn't have to pass a trial before I could zone into pos/v? (yes I do understand that tier2 was desinged for people who could pass the trials)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In answer to your question, I believe no.  Few reasons, which people mentioned, but its not a strategy concept, its that your not equipped with the right tools (spells, level, aa, gear).  Just do your job, slow/debuff/buff and be a secondary healer.  Then when you get some level/aa you can be the main healer, but until then, just stick to the basics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the most fun (playing my Chanter) in a Razerfiend outer group made up as follows: Ranger, Mage, Wizard, Mage, Chanter.<br />
<br />
Ranger pulls with snare and the rest is history. Sic the pets on the Razorfiend, dot at will, etc, etc. <br />
<br />
If you are like (Litgruv I think) and had REALLY sub par gear but are kicking ass - then it doesn't matter what other folks think or do.</div></div><hr />

that I can understand. point taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Your thinking that its just a case of sour grapes from long time players, its not.  At 60, you gain the tools you need to do these things, they simply arent there at 59.  Malo and torpor are invaluable in this situation.  You can have torpor on the tank to mitigate the first shock of combat.  Malo will make slow stick almost every time, no bouncing aggro.  <br />
Consider this, malosini on incoming, and it fails.  You can malosini again, hoping it sticks, or slow.  If malosini sticks, the slow will sticks, if it doesn't it can be a little iffy.  It is entirely realistic to bounce 2 or 3 spells off one of these without the unresistable debuff.  By the time you finally have the beast slowed, the tank is nearly dead and your 10 sec casting ch is simply useless.  Torpor would have covered in this situation.  It simply IS best to limit yourself a bit in this case, causing wipes because you're constantly over-extended is not a good way to be invited back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taiyed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/agree about Malo<br />
<br />
I just yesterday had enough plat to buy Malo (am level 62 now), and sticking it on a mob in PoV before slowing makes a huge difference.  I'd Malo on INC before the mob go to the camp, then I'd slow.  Only a few times did slow get resisted, and I rarely bounced aggro.  Malo is very low aggro and the only time I got aggro is when I was standing right in the path of the mob. :p<br />
<br />
Malo makes a huge difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">bumped mainly for the archives, but got a chance to do it again in the same spot in pov, this time at level 61 with malo and torpor. The difference was huge. Was able to keep buffs up, heal and slow without too much difficulty. torpor the tank on the incoming, malo then slow, and kraggs the rest of the way. no external mana regen either. thanks guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I agree with above posters, this is nothing new for a shaman. This is not 4 roles, this is one role, that of a shaman.<br />
<br />
You were underpowered for the zone, however tactics would/could have made this is a killer group if you had Fear Kited them.<br />
<br />
Maybe you guys didnt have the levels though, you dont say what level the SK and Necro are.</div></div><hr />
