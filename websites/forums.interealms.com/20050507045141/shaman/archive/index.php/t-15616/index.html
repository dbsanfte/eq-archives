<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was shocked to read this post on the Mage Compedium:<br />
<br />
Most mages that have Kedge blade favor Kedge blade for 2 reasons: <br />
<br />
1. Looks. Hey, it looks damn cool to weild two fish! <br />
2. The proc. Mages are limited to FR and MR nukes, and having the pet use CR procs adds slight versatility. <br />
<br />
And like said, the only real difference between the three is the resist check. <br />
<br />
However, remember that animal pets (BL pets, shaman pets, druid pets) should only equip the fists, since they have very low 1hs skill and very high H2H skill. Equipping the blades on those pets has a proven effect of lowering pet DPS.  <br />
<br />
What? <br />
<br />
Giving any weapon other than a H2H weapon lowers the animals DPS??? Lower than without any weapons at all?<br />
<br />
Can this be right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Been discussed several times on the board. General agrement is that it doesn't make any difference what type of weapon they use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well this is a situational arguement, it would depend on what the pet is. In our case its a warrior, os this limitation doesnt apply, now in the case of the necro monk pet, i think it could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have heard otherwise.  Our pets, beastlord pets, I think necro pets, and some varieties of mage pets are warriors.  Being warriors, they have high skills with bashing, slashing, and piercing weapons, but not with h2h weapons.  Thus, giving our pet just one weapon alone increases its DPS substantially because it has a much higher atk rating.  I don't have any parses of my own to back this up, but I remember seeing it discussed on these boards and the beastlord boards, and the general concensus was that h2h = bad and anything else is much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crystalflake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Felt that having a 53 beastie, I could interject a lil info here.<br />
<br />
It appears to be pretty commonly understood , that at least for beastlord pets, their weapon skills mimic that of beastlords themselves. (there are parses to support this, I'll try to dig em up later)<br />
<br />
 Basically, what this means for Warders is that their h2h skill caps higher than their pierce/slash/blunt, etc. This means that a warder using a Fist, vs say, a Kedge blade, will have a higher skill in wielding that weapon than it would the blade. This equates out to more frequent hits and for higher damage, which of course, means higher dps than when weilding non h2h weapons.<br />
<br />
 My conjecture with Shaman/Necro/Mage pets, is that they are all based as warriors, since none of their parent classes are a melee class, so..their weapon skills shouldn't matter, as they would all be capped at the same as wars get...and while I'm not positive what those caps actually are without looking them up , I believe they are a lot more equal than the discrepancy between say, a beastlord and warder's caps in their h2h skill vs their other ones. <br />
<br />
This is what I've been lead to understand both from rabidly reading this, as well as the beastlord boards, and my own experiences in game, having a high level shaman, high level mage, and a midrange beast, and experiencing the differences in pet weapons firsthand. <br />
<br />
Of course, it's possible it's all a pipe dream, and your mileage may vary =)<br />
<br />
EDIT*  This is one of the least confusing threads on it that I could find..the actual vote is &quot;we suspect our pets have a higher h2h, but dammit, we haven't PROVED it yet&quot; ..it's just a general consensus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman pets don't DW w/o weapons, so going from 1 attack to 2 attacks isn't possibly going to lower your dps.  Perhaps the fists up the dps more than the others, who knows.  I'll leave that up to the mages to figure out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Your conjecture is wrong. Mage and Necro pets vary in classes from monk to rogue to warrior...to wizzie even(their 60+ fire pet casts ice comet, among other spells).<br />
<br />
Yes, our pets are warrior based - not that it reflects their weapon choices. They wield just about anything...I'm especially fond of giving mine sbd's for example..a pet that snares is very nice ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
/nod...sorry, my bad...I should have been more specific in saying that the normal pets were warrior based, not then newer &quot;class specific&quot; models...I mainly played my mage back in the day before all that stuff, so it wasn't in the forefront of my mind at the time. * I remember having to walk 20 miles in a blizzard to Rathe Mountains, and when necros carried fine steel daggers for their pets* *rattles her walker at ya*<br />
<br />
And ya, my dogdog uses bloody anything...and so will my scaleymutt on my BL, but there is a definate trend of him connecting more frequently when wielding fists according to my parses, while I've not seen that at all with shaman pets, and warrior based mage/necro pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok Decided to do some quick testing today since I was bored to get actual numbers. So I went out and actually parsed several fights from our trusty sidekick fido. All parses where around 5 minutes long on the exact same npc and with SLTW as the only buff. Did a base test with no weapons give but it was only 2 minutes long.<br />
<br />
With out furthur delay on to the numbers.<br />
<br />
Initial 2 minute base test. No weapons just SLTW<br />
Pet did 18 dps<br />
<br />
5 minute test with single hand to hand weapon and SLTW<br />
Pet did 18 dps<br />
<br />
5 minute test with single piercing weapon and SLTW<br />
Pet did 21 dps<br />
<br />
5 minute test with single slashing weapon and SLTW<br />
pet did 20 dps<br />
<br />
5 minute test with dual hand to hand weapons and SLTW<br />
pet did 30 dps<br />
<br />
5 minute test with dual peicing weapons and SLTW<br />
pet did 31 dps<br />
<br />
5 minute test with dual slashing weapons and SLTW<br />
pet did 29 dps<br />
<br />
5 minute test with single off hand only weapon (chill dagger) and SLTW<br />
Pet did 33 dps<br />
<br />
<br />
Given that these tests are a bit on the short side I do expect some variances. Looking at the 1hded tests you might take it to indicated that the piercing/slashing helped out but I beleive that was just random variance. I also have a 2 minute log for the hand to hand where it did 20 dps.<br />
<br />
Looking at the 2hded tests it's pretty clear that the weapon type doesn't make a difference. It's also clear that a single off hand weapon like the chill dagger can be as effective as 2 normal weapons.<br />
<br />
So there you have it give fido what ever frigging weapon you want it doesn't seem to matter and a single off hand only weapon will get him dual wielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks, Taraddar, nice work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I parsed DPS with 55 pet while fighting toilers in ME.  Using cripple and slow on each mob, and a set of 4 mage items (weapons, belt and haste mask), that pet averaged about 27-28 dps, regardless of what type of mage weapons were used.<br />
<br />
Only difference was that when a H2H weapon was equipped, the hit message was 'dogdog bites for xx' instead of 'slashes for xx'.  This remained true throughout the 400-odd toilers that I killed.<br />
<br />
So, I don't think it matters.</div></div><hr />
