*rant hat on*<br />
<br />
Well if that happends it is time to hang my spear in my closet and throw my spell book in the open fire. <br />
<br />
Planes of Power made the Shamans pretty useless with stats on items that go over the base caps our buffs reach, and now they nerf our spells. *** is this? The reason I do not play much lately is that we lost our exp groups. If I exp I do that with good RL friends. You go around and see an enchanter, beastlord doing as good as a shaman would. So even as slowers we lost of what we had unique once when Verant was developing this game before SOE took over. <br />
<br />
I invested 3 and half years of my life in a game and a class I once loved. Then the SOE come up with ingenious ideas to nerf us just because some kind kids of a some other kind of class X (warriors) whine for their frigging needs. <br />
<br />
With that said it's time to post a long complain on the dev forums just cause I hear nothing  from Shamans in there. They remove a pretty useful buff after focus, to give us a new version of Zerg, bards, chanters, paladins, clerics, beastlords and you name it going to have. <br />
<br />
Our DPS suck. We have the worse DPS in the game. I can't imagine 1 class out there who do not have a faster DPS than us. A friend Necro of mine could take down 2 BOT giants and on way to 3rd one while a Shaman was still fighting with his first one and the mana bar was almost empty. And yeah necro didn't had KEI but Shaman did. <br />
<br />
Shaman as priest regarding heals are also more close to hybrid classes for instanse a Paladin. Our heals cost way too much mana and we heal worse then druids. <br />
<br />
Shaman spells have not been upgraded but gained new ones. The series of spells we got upgraded when POP came was a heal over time, debuff, disease spells (as if there where a good DPS class). Uhm of course our buffs not to forget these. But our utility spells are the same. Invisibility spell since level 14 which is the worse invis the game has. <br />
<br />
Alchemy. If you need to throw your money into a black hole, Alchemy would be a good choice! Make potions at no profit and go bankrupt! Sell potions with profit and no one buys them! <br />
<br />
We are classed as pet class too. Ok if we consider the druids which make everyone laugh when they summon their teddy bears who die after one kick in the butt, our Shammy pets are something similar to:<br />
<br />
Lonoboby bites a nerfed mob X for 30 points of damage<br />
Lonoboby bites a nerfed mob X but misses!<br />
Lonoboby kicks a nerfed mob X but misses!<br />
Lonoboby bites a nerfed mob X for 29 points of damage<br />
Lonoboby kicks a nerfed mob X but misses!<br />
Lonoboby bites a nerfed mob X but misses!<br />
Lonoboby bites a nerfed mob X for 50 points of damage<br />
Lonoboby kicks a nerfed mob X but misses!<br />
<br />
common guys... is this a joke? I make more damage myself with my epic spear.<br />

<br />
This is not true.  At one time with Ebolt and Plague, shaman were formidable damage dealers.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't care if we get this buff or not.  As long as we can heal and slow, we'll get groups fine.  <br />
<br />
Shaman are balanced, imho.  Some other classes may not be, but we are.</div></div><hr />

I never have to wait for more than 10 minutes on any given day to get a pickup group. Our slows are the best in the game. We're a good utility class that any group feels is almost essential to have.<br />
<br />
Of course I'm only level 54, so my views may be skewed a bit, but I don't think so.</div></div><hr />

What did I miss?<br />
<br />
If you are talking about the &quot;stamina bar&quot; it is not the same thing that you are thinking about, even though they are related.  The &quot;stamina bar&quot; has no effect on anything in game at the moment, unless you are trying to jump or your agility is under 75.<br />
<br />
Edit:  My bad, just saw this post http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=18249</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just because you get groups(obviosly because the mindset of people changes very slowly), doesn't mean we are balanced.<br />
<br />
When people think about Shamans they think, &quot;hey they got the best slow&quot;, not realizing how many other aspects they are not taking into account. Slow Mitigation is still a mystery to many people, but you can be sure that sooner or later people will realize Shamans have lost most of their power and then it's too late.<br />
<br />
Shamans need a significant upgrade.<br />
<br />
You are *balanced* in relation to other classes, never in relation to NPCs. <br />
Most Shamans just play their Shaman and think the world is fine(and I'm not talking about the pre 65 game). <br />
Check the various class boards and you will see how other classes, who have less problems than us currently, unite to get some unbelieveable upgrades with the next expansion, while we are sitting here on our hands watching us getting gimped more and more.<br />
<br />
Good job, guys.</div></div><hr />

Boar/Talisman of Boar are not being affected by the proposed Endurance bar.  We can still buff the stamina statistic, and get the hp boost from doing so.  <br />
<br />
If you are referring to Vigor and Acumen as the second best buffs after Focus, you play a different game than I do.</div></div><hr />

Please GOD give this new endurance buff to another class. Clerics for example. Clerics don't buff enough imho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No lol.  Everyone that has been with our guild for longer than a couple months is max sta.  We average 4-7 shaman on raids, and I'm our most senior shaman as well as being one of 2 raidleaders, so yes one perk of that is Hell No To Stamina.  You're goddamn right I hate buffing on raids when there's a million other things to do - as a shaman even.<br />
<br />
Buffing during raids is part and parcel of being a shaman. <br />
<br />
Perhaps.  I'd offer that when you have multiple copies of the same class on a raid people often gravitate towards different &quot;specilizations&quot;.  I'm primarily a debuff shaman.  Meaning I always have max debuffs loaded, I'm constantly doing 360 out of freaking habit left over from playing with Gylen (Japanese for &quot;Man who trains eight flurry drakes at once), and I'm usually the first person throwing ae slow at our stonestanced monk and peeling 4 out of the X trash mobs he's just brought.  Other shamans buff more than I do - usually newer shamans who don't have the gear to offtank yet.  I don't keep stamina loaded and it's pretty rare that I don't actually have a ****-ton of aggro on a mob i.e. can't/won't sit down to mem it.<br />
<br />
As far as group desireability?  If this buff goes to another class I'm not exactly shaking in my boots as to whether it's going to affect me getting an xp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am not a buffbot, I am a shaman.<br />
<br />
I think you are overreacting a great deal.  I know you aren't, but you sound like the shaman twink of a melee class, thinking that a shamans primary use is for buffing (we're &quot;useless&quot; because people have max stats not???).  HINT: Stat buffs have been pretty much useless since the day that EQ was released, they are there only so people can stroke their e-penis to the big green numbers.<br />
<br />
I am not a buffbot, I am a shaman.<br />
<br />
However, since you seem psyched to be a buffbot, consider that buffbots will be even more valuable after the patch, because the END figure will supposedly be based on all stats, including agility which many people do not have maxed out.<br />
<br />
I am not a buffbot, I am a shaman.<br />
<br />
Kylt is dead on.  A BOT can trivially buff a raid.  If a BOT can do it trivially, it should be unbearably boring for any human being in posession of their mental faculties to do for an extended period.  Tedium isn't fun.  Buffing is something we do, it's something a lot of classes do.  Because it is a necessary evil; a precondition to getting to the fun part of the game.  I want more fun and less tedium.<br />
<br />
I am not a buffbot, I am a shaman.<br />
<br />
You want to bitch about shamans, go ahead.  Personally, I think we could use a few tweaks in the nuke department.  I also think that our current level of tedium should be reduced by convenience-based alterations to the shrink and avatar lines.<br />
<br />
But &quot;OMG I BEEN NERFED BECAUSE THEY WON'T ADD 37 MORE LINES OF BUFFS FOR ME TO CAST&quot; is pretty much a nonstarter for me.  Why?<br />
<br />
Because I am not a buffbot.<br />
I am a shaman.</div></div><hr />

The main problem with buffing is swapping all the gdamn spells in and out. In raid situations I have at MOST two slots to keep buffs in. I always have cann4/turgors/tnargs/malos/Q loaded and malo loaded as well on multiple mob pulls. I try and keep focus and stamina loaded but if we are in a raid where we need to cure I may have nadox or GRC loaded or BOTH which leaves ZERO slots for buffs. So then if someone needs a buff I gotta demem a spell and hope they don't freaking pull while I am trying to pull the buff out of my ass and then remem the spell I just dememmed. On any given raid someone might need focus/stamina/sow(believe it or not sometimes its needed)/tribunal/acumen(usually refuse to buff this)/avatar(usually have no room for this)/God knows what else. Agility? Forget it. Some new endurance buff thingy? Forget that jack. If I had one request in EQ that I could ask and never ask again above all others, it's give me a new spell bar with buffs only and let me keep 8 buffs memmed at all times. It ain't the mana, it's the pain in the ass of dememming/memming/dememming/rememming that drives me insane. And no spell sets is not the answer, there are way too many different combos of buffs people may need. I am so down with just buffing Focus, I would live for that. And now agility may become meaningful and possibly ANOTHER buff we may need/get? Just kill me now.</div></div><hr />

The zing line has always be 100% useless.  Sony simply decided that they didn't think melees should demand a zing class (let's not forget that paladins would have a self-zing at that point) in order to have what essentially translates to nonstop mana.<br />
<br />
Anybody looking at the removal of zing from the game in preparation for the melee improvements as a NERF -- PLEASE PLEASE look up some of the old EQ history on necromancers.  Hell, there are probably some current rants.<br />
<br />
Do you want to be reduced to doing nothing but twitching melees?  Seriously.  If that sounds like fun to you, I'm surprised you didn't roll up a necromancer.  Who out there enjoys the rolling series of &quot;FA down, haste down&quot; (thank all that's good in the world, Focus outlasts a dungeon).  Now you want to throw &quot;zing plz&quot; back into the mix?</div></div><hr />

Let me bring you some news. WE ARE NOT BALANCED.<br />
<br />
Our heals sux<br />
Our nukes sux<br />
Our Buffs are next to useless (except Fos/Fo7 and even the hp gains there is not that big)<br />
our Dots are to slow or to much agro<br />
In places where a 5% better slow would be usefull slow is nerfed in other places slow is in general less usefull then a good DS (Hi LDoN)<br />
Our melee is as beyong bad<br />
Our pet looks cute but his bite hardly hurts<br />
<br />
And every spell we have costs a lot more mana then comparable spells other classes have (even classes with superior mana regeneration)<br />
<br />
But feel free to flame me nowand whine after the next expansion hits the shelfs and we get yet another line of buffs that give 5 points of dex more, get another disease based slow you never will use and get true south, true west and true east while every other class gets usefull toys.</div></div><hr />

I dunno about Shaman not being a DPS class. I grouped with a dude in FG, specifically bug caverns, and he was a Dot dropping machine. Now granted he had KEI (I was on my Enchanter), but he said something like 800 DPS. (Ebolt + Epic + Bane + Pox + a load of other DOTS.) Heck, he wasn't even using dog-dog.<br />
<br />
(IIRC he did have a truckload of AA's, like 164 or something)</div></div><hr />

I guess if you time the DPS calc when all dots are active, perhaps. Thats not sustained, nor a realistic measure of dps. Take it over the course of a fight to get dps, not the one tic where all dots are active and you just nuked, and the 3rd wave of a rain hit.<br />

There's no way he was doing 800 DPS with DoTs. 800 per tick, sure... at the peak of the DoT cycle. It takes a while to stack all of those spells on the mob, though, so his average damage was no doubt even lower.<br />

Light above, all this whining ... <br />
<br />
I'd love to see shaman get a version of an endurance buff. I've said before, our spellbook is the rightful place for it. Of course, bards and beastlords will more than likely get versions for sure, but that doesn't bother me all that much. Buffing isn't my favorite thing to do, but as the senior shaman in my guild (and a raid leader) it's a necessary evil, and if I have to spend a few moments casting spells (/em prays for MGB capability soon) and eating before we begin our raid to keep my Brothers and the guild's little ones safe, then yep. I'll hush and do it.<br />
<br />
That said ... /agree Hyena.<br />

<br />
Well said, Hyena. Well said. I'll raise a mug of ale to that. <br />
<br />
I'd love a puppy heal spell ... perhaps nothing like (and forgive me if I butcher the name) the Beastlord's Sorsha spell (2100 hp, I believe?), but just a little something to help the poor fuzzy friend out. I'd LOVE a puppy-toy summon spell ... and WOOH a proc buff. Nice. Someone said a couple threads ago that our curse line would become a shaman's strong point (or perhaps they said that was the way the shaman would go in the future, away from regular DD-component DoT's), and I have to say I agree. I believe LDON gave us three (Curse, Anathema and Bane, if I'm not mistaken) and Curse and Anathema are GREAT.

I've got to say ... I enjoy playing a shaman thoroughly. We can do just about anything in any given situation, and while there are roles we can fill better than others ... it's nice to know we're so versatile. I don't honestly know of another class I'd enjoy playing so much.</div></div><hr />

However, it's HORRIBLY bad form to start our bitching in the context of melee balance.  So we lose STA regen from Acumen?  Big flipping deal.  If your STA was over 100 all it affected was waiting to jump again and if your STA isn't over 100, just die because I don't care about you anyway.<br />

But why remove the Stamina effects from those spells? Some classes gain some value to their group through the use of those spells. <br />
<br />
A: Since we are removing Stamina, there won't be any value to spells that affect Stamina. <br />
<br />
There will be additional spells added that modify Endurance. Right now these will be buffs that increase your total pool. We are not planning on adding any that would regenerate the pool. These spells will be tuned to balance the ability to aid in the return of Endurance. Just exchanging the Stamina effects with Endurance effects wouldn't allow us any control over the balance of the new system and its interaction with spells. It hasn't been decided which classes will get those spells yet, but obviously we'll be taking into consideration the effects of the changes to the existing spells might have on caster desirability. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thats from the sony site.  They are still working out all the bugs.  It will take a while to get it all retuned and working well.  The way i see it now is your in your /disc till your sta runs out.  Or till you cancel it.  Im guessing, any form of sta regen could keep warriors in defence stance 24/7.  Im sure a few classes will get a buff to increase the size of the endurance pool, ie adding a extra min to a disc or something.  Even a new buff for bigger endurance pool seems bad, with only 15 buff slots i doubt many will use it.<br />

We as a class are about the worsed community there is. we NEVER unite to take action.<br />
<br />
There is always a number of fools around who claim they have no problem and that we are fine.<br />
<br />
Let me bring you some news. WE ARE NOT BALANCED.<br />
<br />
Our heals sux<br />
Our nukes sux<br />
Our Buffs are next to useless (except Fos/Fo7 and even the hp gains there is not that big)<br />
our Dots are to slow or to much agro<br />
In places where a 5% better slow would be usefull slow is nerfed in other places slow is in general less usefull then a good DS (Hi LDoN)<br />
Our melee is as beyong bad<br />
Our pet looks cute but his bite hardly hurts<br />
<br />
And every spell we have costs a lot more mana then comparable spells other classes have (even classes with superior mana regeneration)<br />
<br />
But feel free to flame me nowand whine after the next expansion hits the shelfs and we get yet another line of buffs that give 5 points of dex more, get another disease based slow you never will use and get true south, true west and true east while every other class gets usefull toys.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think your the only one who got my point so far.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to forget that shamans actually is a group class, both in the PvP and the PvE servers. I have not met many Shamans specialize in Conjuration. We are not Necros, there fore our DoTs are going to cost more, fizzle more and so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
And to those who are tired of buffing. Well seriously people it might be pain in the arse to mem, de-mem and so on during raids, but if your guild lack of Shammies then recruit more. In my guild we got 5 shammies always during raids there fore we aint have to mem. de-mem and so on. Every one of us just have to be responcible of one kind of debuff and one buff, it goes faster, and we aint die during the raids, plus you have fun doing some heals, and DPS instead of buffing and debuffing only, plus you got less chances to die, if you sit down after a slow when you're about to mem a buff :)</div></div><hr />

About the shaman are gimp thing:<br />
<br />
1)  Everyone wants us in groups.<br />
2)  There's several good reasons for this (meaning they don't just want us because we're pretty).<br />
3)  We can solo pretty well all the way from 1 to 65.  A good chunk of classes can't effectively solo AT ALL.<br />
4)  We can tank (IN TEH FACE!!111) solo in places like PoV/PoS/BoT.  Find me another dedicated caster class that can do that.  Hybrids have trouble pulling that off.<br />
5)  We have the power to take almost any concievable combination of people, or no other people at all, and make it work.<br />

<br />
Hmmm.<br />
I personally think that the biggest problem with EQ at the moment is LDoN.<br />
Despite what a lot of posters on here say Shamans are not suited to LDoN.<br />
<br />
Our class defining spell (Normal lvl adventures not hard) is pretty much redundant as in yes its nice if the mobs slowed but if its not it doesnt make a great difference.<br />
<br />
Yes we can back up heal,root cc etc but droods can do this better than us (You dont realise how much it hurts me to say that).Yes I realise that if mob breaks drood root and is not slowed it can cause a lot more damage but with Paci being such an overpowered spell how many major adds do you run into in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Our DPS is pretty abysmal.Yes dotting gives lovely DPS but how many people use them in LDoN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bear in mind all the above points are aimed at LDoN not the rest of EQ as in PoP etc we still rock in a group.<br />
<br />
Alchemy. Alchemy pricing has been screwed by one set of people and one set of people only and that set of people are SHAMAN.<br />
<br />
Bit of a thread hijack coming up :)<br />
<br />
Vast majority of posts on here say well we can regen manna so quickly that we need to be punished with crap heals,high manna cost,high resists etc.My answer to this is why ?<br />
<br />
Why should droods get better heals than us as till Kraggs we'Ve shared<br />
the same healing abilities.I know they did it to make them more group desireable but in doing that they didnt make them suffer any penalties in their lower levels.<br />
<br />
Although i love dogdog he is a joke if you had a lvl 58 in your group that was as bad as dogdog you wouldn't group with him again.<br />
Drood pet is more of a joke but they get Charm to make up for this.<br />
Why the **** should we get the best debuffs in the game but still pay the penalty that our dots are more likely to be resisted than any other classes after malxx has landed.<br />
<br />
Our manna regen rules the roost but we pay a big penalty for it.<br />
We were at 1 time king of soloers.Can anyone on here honestly say we are now ?.<br />
Yes we can solo from 1 to 65 but a few other classes can and can do it a lot quicker than us.<br />
<br />
Over the 4 years ive been playing EQ ive seen the Shaman class slowly eroded and everyone seems to be afraid to stand up for the class incase they nerf slow (IE mitigation but thats another thread entirely).<br />
<br />
Absor never posts on this board probably because hes sitting there snickering behind his hands thinking &quot;I cant believe what we've done to Shaman over time and gotten away with&quot;.<br />
Its about time we as a class stood up for ourselves and got what we deserve from Sony.<br />
<br />
Droods are whiners but look what its got them,same with nearly every other class in the game.<br />
I couldnt give a toss that warrior aggro is broke let the warriors worry about that.<br />
<br />
Oh and as to the new expansion i wonder what delights we're going to be served up.<br />
Group FA ? Heaven forbid we get that it may give us another useful spell.<br />
Group Strength,Agi,Dex etc ? Yes probably and it will probably be a 65 spell that is pretty ****ing useless when we get it.<br />
AC Buff that stacks with Virtue ? Pah Clerics are the king of AC buffs although I cannot fathom out why they should be.HP is their forte.<br />
<br />
Please dont anyone Time equipped come on here posting oh but with my FT15 9k hp 8k manna etc im not underpowered.Despite what you and Sony think you are not the only people who play EQ.<br />
The normal everyday Shaman is pretty much being left behind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Fortunado</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I am finding that the Shaman class is fading in importance compared to other classes.  In a Raid situation I am still needed before the Raid starts for pre-buffing and to rebuff after rezzes.  In a non-raid situation there is no reason to include a Shaman in any group.<br />
<br />
A Beastlord can slow 65% compared to our 75% (a minor difference) and then wreak enormous DPS compared to the pitiful damage we can produce.  Our pet is useless unless he is fully buffed and equipped (a real mana sink).  If our pet IS fully buffed then he is upgraded to almost useless.<br />
<br />
An Enchanter can slow almost as well as us but can also Mez mobs, Haste better (and longer) than us, and provide the mana regen that all casters crave.<br />
<br />
A Bard can slow to 50% (much less desirable than our 75%) but can Mez mobs, Haste the group, Heal the group, Mana Regen the group, etcetera.<br />
<br />
Some time ago, I spent hours buffing people for the PoJ Trials so they could get flagged but no one wanted to take a Shaman into the Trials because our DPS is so awful.  Finally some well-equipped, high-AA people that were already flagged (and could have won the Trial with 5 people) took pity and let me tag along so I could get flagged.<br />
<br />
In a non-raid situation a Shaman is fourth choice for the slot we can fill.  Unless we want to see ourselves drift into the backwaters of EQ we need to rally and request significant improvements or at least some protection from other classes intruding on our specialties (Slowing and Buffing).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Right Kylt, only thing we're good now, if we do not buff, is Slowing. Don't bother me with your silly debuff talk, chanters have Cripple line spell as well, magicians can debuff resists too and rest of the casters, almost ALL of them, have negative resist checks on their spells anyway, so the &quot;big and mean&quot; shaman debuffs aren't frankly needed at all. And not for long probably either. Heck, there are already classes whos slow is so close to us, that it doesn't matter in everyday games whether they take the shaman or not. They rather take BST - sure, 10% less slow, but at the same time BST comes packing a punch and spells, which are by FAR more useful then whatever our little spellbooks can conjure up, maybe bar the Focus (which isn't such a big deal anyway).<br />
<br />
Soon shamans will be needed only on raids, for the slow, otherwise their usefulness will be as it was and still is with the warrior - sure you can slow (warrior can hit mobs too), but while rest slow tad less, they offer so much more to the groups in every way (warrior can tank too and ad better perhaps, but rest get aggro faster, tank almost as good and offer tenfold as much utility to the group). Shaman community is a crappy one, most stand on their own and call those, who have some ideas or concerns, as whiners. And at the same time they're totally oblivious to the fact that our little &quot;shaman uberness&quot; boat is drifting away from the docks and we have no oars to set it back on course. At some point, soon, shamans will be like warriors were and are now, useful to the extent in some certain situations ONLY.<br />
<br />
You don't offer soon any utility to the groups. Buffs become moot point with all the stats on the items, together with the really useful buffs some other classes already provide (cleric/bst/chanter). Our big bad mana regen is self only. Our damaging spells suck due to slow damage, high aggro and slow cast/recast times and hefty mana cost. Out pet is plain joke and only a manasink, what we cannot recover anyway. Melee we can't and the tanking tank - forget it. 97% of shaman community wont EVER see the places and get the gear, which allows them to do it, with the DPS of the mobs nowadays. Probably big part of shamans wont even every get their &quot;high end&quot; spells. And so we here argue between each other, while the rest of the &quot;world&quot; drifts away.</div></div><hr />

That right there says it all.  FYI Bane is 70 DPS all by itself, add in 30+ DPS from pet and you can very easily do 100+ DPS on pretty much every mob your group kills.  Toss in a nuke/rain to make up the difference for those first few seconds when you were slowing. ;)  Minimal mana drain, leaves you plenty of time to patch heal, root adds, pull next mob, whatever...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">You are *balanced* in relation to other classes, never in relation to NPCs. <br />
Most Shamans just play their Shaman and think the world is fine(and I'm not talking about the pre 65 game). <br />
Check the various class boards and you will see how other classes, who have less problems than us currently, unite to get some unbelieveable upgrades with the next expansion, while we are sitting here on our hands watching us getting gimped more and more.<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the things I've always liked about the Crucible is that there isn't nearly as much whining as most of the other boards. ... so 'the other classes are whining, we need to or get left out' isn't an arguement that's gonna appeal to me.  Given SOEs track record, it might not be a bad idea though/ Since paladins are asking for shaman quality heals, is it time to ask for Driud caliber ones? :D <br />
<br />
There's annoyances to playing a shaman; FA, puppy weapons, DoT agro, the urge to strangle whatever idiot at SOE thought it would've been overpowering to give us a group haste that was as good as our single target version... <br />
<br />
Overall though, I think, priests are currently pretty well balanced. Sure it bugs me that my nukes and heals (except for Quiessence) suck in comparison to the other two but I'm sure it bugs them just as much when we end a 10 minute fight and I'm almost FoM. <br />
<br />
I do think there's a developing problem in that the other classes are getting passive mana regeneration that's closing the gap too much but I don't see it as a huge deal yet. I say that from a non-raiding perspective so the people I group with don't have FT15 or all their high end focus items either. But come on people, the sky certainly isn't falling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I agree with a prior poster about how LDoN has really decreased the desirability of the Shaman.  Most mobs don't live long enough to make slow necessary during a typical adventure.  That same factor also reduces our DOTs to a waste of time, since even short-duration spells like Bane of Nife won't run to full effect.  If we don't pull, we don't really accomplish much of anything in an adventure, and without any sort of mez/pacify/lull ability, we're not the best pullers in the world either.  <br />
<br />
And remember, not all Shaman are level 65.  I'm stuck at 59, so my healing is pretty limited.  No group in their right mind would pick up a pre-62 Shaman as a healer if they could get a druid or cleric, or maybe even a paladin. <br />
<br />
I'm becoming more and more convinced that the Shaman class needs something in the upcoming expansion / melee changes to increase their utility / power.  It's pretty hard to argue that other classes have been given more and more with each expansion since Kunark, while Shaman have really been left alone.  No major nerfs that I can think of (thankfully) but not really much new.  With so many other classes possessing many of our class-defining abilities like debuffs and slows, I agree we need to lobby for something to increase Shaman desirability.  Maybe the upcoming melee changes will be that - too soon to tell on that issue.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps a line of cold-based DOTs that are extremely short-duration, so full effect is easier to achieve on short-lived mobs.  24-second cold-based DOTs with negative resist checks and maybe a built-in slow component, so a single spell would both slow the mob somewhat (maybe 30-50%) and do some significant damage similar to our disease and poison-based DOTs over a much shorter time.  Useful for a mob you know won't live for over 60 seconds once combat begins.<br />
<br />
Just a thought - I haven't spent much time trying to think of a solution, but I'm becoming more and more aware of the problem, as gear makes stat buffs less and less important and slow becomes more ubiquitous.<br />

That'd be pretty darn nice.  If that's too much to ask for though, I'd even be happy with a lower mana, faster casting slow that's maybe 50-60%, lasts for a minute, and has a negative resist check...  Would be ideal for LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Don't bother me with your silly debuff talk, chanters have Cripple line spell as well, magicians can debuff resists too and rest of the casters, almost ALL of them, have negative resist checks on their spells anyway, so the &quot;big and mean&quot; shaman debuffs aren't frankly needed at all. And not for long probably either. Heck, there are already classes whos slow is so close to us, that it doesn't matter in everyday games whether they take the shaman or not. They rather take BST - sure, 10% less slow, but at the same time BST comes packing a punch and spells, which are by FAR more useful then whatever our little spellbooks can conjure up, maybe bar the Focus (which isn't such a big deal anyway).<br />
<br />
Ok so what you're saying is:<br />
<br />
It takes 3 classes to do what one class (shaman) can do in the debuff department?<br />

Ok!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">The idea that we need to have improved dps due to the advent of LDoN is something that requires consideration.<br />
<br />
One of the ideas in EQ has always been to allow players to chose from a wide range of character classes.  Theres no point having this if all classes are pretty much identical.  One of the features of the shaman class has always been that it gimps mobs - so the group needs lower dps to win - rather than adding dps to the group.  I want to keep it that way: lets not all becomes shades of the same caster class doing x dps, just with differently named spells.  But as LDoN currently stands its adding dps to the group - to beat the timer - that matters.  The solution to this one is to remove the 90 minutes timer from LDoN (as pointed out before LDoN even went live).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">This is a little too melodramatic. We do need some tweaking, you won't get an argument there. But, as for mana cost. Come on already. We get Canni V. It's pretty impressive. What's with the moaning that we can't tank, look at most of the melee classes.... monks, rangers, bst.... they can't tank any better than us. <br />
<br />
This is half the problem.<br />
We get Canni V because we NEED it its not a bonus.<br />
Canni V helps make up for high manna costs,resists etc but it doesnt even the playing field.<br />
Necros get damn good Manna regen.Their penalty is also HP loss but then they get lifetaps which not only heal them but also contribute to DPS.<br />
A lot of classes get passive manna regen abilities.Do they pay a penalty for this ? No.<br />
We get the best manna regen there is but the gap between ours and the 2nd best is not so wide as it once was.<br />
Yes we should pay a penalty for Canni but we pay a penalty on damn near everything we do.Higher resists,manna useage,aggro,dps etc.<br />
<br />
Admittedly Rangers,Monks cant tank any  better than us but while theyre tanking the mob thats broken root etc theyre contributing a bit more DPS than us.<br />
No I dont want to be a meleeing shaman hate meleeing always have if i wanted to melee i would have rolled a melee.<br />
<br />
Sony are content to leave Shaman behind regarding upgrades etc because a lot of Shaman seem content to be left behind.<br />

&lt; fatherly advice and list of hunting spots&gt;.<br />
<br />
Nice post of places to hunt - you might want to copy it over to the hunting forums where it would be useful.  However, none of these places drop Runes - they drop PP (or items).  Your advice requires the other involved party (ie the seller of runes/spells) to come play.<br />
<br />
Ive spent a lot of time in BoT, Veksar, Droga, IA etc.  And yes, they drop nice bazaar items.<br />
<br />
I've got a bit over 130K (chump change to you, I'm sure...but thats a lot of grimling contraptions/Kylong gaunts)  sitting in the bank atm, just waiting for the spells to come available in the bazaar.  I have been saving every single PP I get since I finished my Spectrals a month ago.  I've contacted a couple of the higher end guilds on Luclin about buying Rune MQs, I've hung out in the /auction channel for the past week, I've been checking the bazaar 3x daily since mid November.  No luck.<br />
<br />
I have seen ONE Fo7 for sale, at 65k which a buddy shaman purchased. 2 copies of Malos for 25k each.  Other than that - nothing.  NOTHING. I know of 3 other 65 shaman that have 1, maybe 2 of their 65 spells and thats it.  They are in the same boat as me.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is only a 'phase' where the bazaar is empty for a cpl (or 4) weeks, and the spells will be floating around for 10 - 20k again someday.  I doubt it, though.<br />
<br />
If you have some other insight on how to get the spells let me know...Right now my choices seem to be:  <br />
A) get in a guild that raids mid-to-high PoP content <br />
or <br />
B) sit around and continue to be lacking my 65 spells - which means I'm doing something incredibly wrong.<br />
<br />
Now, Snapdragn, if you find the threat hilarious because you are unable to get your spells I find you hilarious.<br />
Glad I could make you laugh...It makes your day better.  It wasn't this thread that made me laugh, just your blanket assertion about my playing skills.  I reckon you hit a nerve.<br />
<br />
The rest of the thread (whining about how we don't whine enough) is interesting.  :)</div></div><hr />

Those who say we are balanced or &quot;we kick ass&quot; are the clueless monkeys, who build the majority of this community and they are as responsible for the downfall of the Shaman class, as those. who *do* have a clue and don't post for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, I lead raids, mostly plane of time atm.  I don't have alot of experience in LDON because we push numbers of 80+ a night and we haven't got time down to the point where its a single day affair yet (or 2 day even).  So my viewpoints are biased towards Plane of Time and PoP as raid content.<br />
<br />
Shamans aren't unbalanced, I'm sorry.  Let's look at raid desireability.  In Plane of Time for example, there a multitude of encounters where the number of shamans online makes me either a) nervous or b) confident.  The often-downplayed ability to group cure is HUGE for some of these encounters including the end boss.  The number of shamans online can make or break these raids.<br />
<br />
Our versatility is our strength.  We are the primary debuffers in any raid situation.  Why?  Because we have the best slow, but also because out of all debuffers we are the strongest defensively.  Enchanters get runes, beastlords get defensive skills - that's great, but I have 1850 AC and the ability to self-heal (and no, beastlord chloroblast doesn't count) if other healers are sleeping. We can also AE debuff, which I'm starting to think is a skill that some shamans haven't figured out.  Tigir's is a *HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGELY* useful spell - to potentially slow 4 mobs at once vs 1?  Hell with slow mitigation it means that they dont even have to be reslowed! <br />
<br />
Look at our situation vs that of enchanters at the moment, on a raid level (in time).  Grats Mr. level 65 enchanter with 500 AA points, you are now a level 55 wizard and buffbot.  CC?  Oh we forgot about CC when making this expansion, sorry!  No need to mez, just use your weak-ass nuke and c5/speed me thanks.  If you want, you can rune the MT if it makes you feel better.<br />
<br />
# of enchanters on a time raid means nothing.  You need 1.  We get 5 and with druids/wizards/shamans sitting in Time A waiting for a raid invite the extra chanters are just taking up space.<br />
<br />
Healing ability on raids did get a massive upgrade with PoP.  We went from Chloroblast 428 base heal to Tnargs 1300 base heal.  That's more than tripled for the math disinclined.  Tack on AA abilities which, obviously, provide more benefit the higher the base - I crit Tnargs for 3400.  Pre-pop I had a 10-second (read:useless) heal that did less than 2k, and my best fast heal crit for 1000 points of healing goodness.  And the torpor upgrade?  Do you remember slowing melees with your dot heal?  Quiessence alone was a *massive* upgrade to our abilities as a healer (albeit one perhaps that was overdue).<br />
<br />
Now, druids also got a big healing upgrade.  Alas, druids have become mini-clerics.  It's now what they do.  Perhaps not everyone uses them this way, but druids on our raids are *primarily* healers, *secondarily* nukers - obviously they debuff.  On certain encounters some druids are used for CC, but only if rangers aren't available.<br />
<br />
Getting a big upgrade in one department is a double-edged sword.  If you become overly strong in one area, then that becomes your niche.  Druid healing upgrades turned them into primarily off-healers.  That is their *best* use.  Sure, this will vary depending on your roster composition - our wizard turnout is between 8 and 15 per raid, so we're not exactly hurting in the DPS department and don't have to overly tweak to maximize druid DPS.<br />
<br />
DPS!  We do not have the DPS of a wizard.  But then again wizards can't heal, cure, or debuff.  Why should we be able to compete in the DPS department?  Because we were kings of DPS in the days of ebolt and plague?  Don't forget that in those days we also weren't nearly as versatile as we currently are in other departments.  Our biggest heal was superior heal - no comment needed there.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, given that we have the highest survivability *as a class* out of all the debuffers, and that from there we can go the path of healing, DPS, or a support role ala curing - it's unreasonable to think that we should excel at all of them.  We have choices.  We can choose to mitigate damage, or we can choose to deal damage.  Specilized DPS classes do not have that choice.  Wizard bandage rot on the MT wont go over well.<br />
<br />
Group desirability?  No idea what they hell you guys are talking about.  I personally have *zero* problem getting a group in LDON.  We bring slow, speed, +140 atk, +544 hps, root, solid fast heals, 110 DPS in curse-based dots alone, and added DPS in the form of dog and nuking with whatever time we have left over.  Not only that, we also bring a fairly solid offtanker to a group situation.  We carry with us a very very large safety net for any xp group, and we bring so much in the form of one class that it's possible to min/max the other 5 slots in the group for DPS.  Sure, you can take a beastlord as your slower - but now you've lost the depth of a shaman and have to maybe fudge some other slots in your group to make up for the lack of offheals, CC, maybe now you need speed, etc.<br />
<br />
Yes, we can be substituted, absolutely.  A good bard could replace us in a group, a good chanter, etc, etc.  But what class can't be replaced?  Pals/SKs can replace Warriors or vice versa - druids/shamans can replace clerics or vice versa - bards can replace chanters or vv - etc etc.  Every single class in this game can be replaced in an LDON group.  Why should we be any different?<br />
<br />
We haven't gotten any upgrades is the biggest crock of ****.<br />
<br />
a) Our biggest heal went from a 1k crit to a 3400 crit - 428 base to 1300 base.<br />
b) DPS wise we received a number of fast-casting dots. Bane, Anathema, Odium, and Curse.  That you haven't bought all of them yet doesn't mean they're not out there and aren't an upgrade.<br />
c) Group Cure ala blood of nadox.  Completely underrated and overlooked spell.  We're the best curers in the game, hands down, and that ability is necessary in a raid environment.<br />
d) Our dot healing ability was upgraded to remove the slow/snare component.  If you don't think this was a big upgrade, then use torpor instead of quiessence in your next group.  *Remember* the difference.<br />
e) Canni 5, which apparently sucks according to some posters on this thread.  If other classes were handed FT35 that doesn't require any downtime to use, we would be absolutely screaming bloody murder at how unbalancing it is.  But with us it's just &quot;barely acceptable and doesn't make up for our high mana costs.&quot;  High mana costs doing what exactly?  Chaining 12 dots?  You're having mana problems?  In raids while other classes are yelling OOM OOM OOM OMG I'm looking at my 80 percent full manabar thinking &quot;lol&quot;. <br />
<br />
So do we need upgrades?  Shrug.  I do ok.  I could see them giving us an anti-aggro upgrade, or an upgrade to our pet.  But the upgrades that we receive in different areas, rather than the massive upgrades that other classes receive in one area, is what keeps us versatile.<br />
<br />
And I like being versatile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Oh! A good upgrade would be a small PBAE spell.  Small.

Shaman are pretty well balanced.  At one time we were quite likely overly powerful but that's come down a lot recently, perhaps too far (which is the whole point of debate)   One of the factors that makes it so hard to judge is that we do have a wide range of abilities.  As someone else posted, 'that's the price you pay for lack of specialization'  That's also something that makes balancing more complex than simply saying we need to nuke more on par with druids, or heal better, or whatever.<br />
<br />
You have to look at the WHOLE package and then compare it to both other classes (Again, as a whole) as well as compare it to the NPCs.  Balance is not independant of the mobs you fight.  You could balance all the classes by giving everyone an asston of power such that they can solo kerafym, each as well as the other... That might balance them relative to each other, but it sure as hell isn't balanced in relation to the game overall.<br />
<br />
The initial tone of these posts often sets the tone of the responses.  i.e. If a post starts off with someone ranting about how shaman have been SOOooo nerfed and then asking for overpowered adjustments, you are of course going to get responses against that.<br />
<br />
If/when someone wants to start an honest and objective discussion of how we stack up as a class and offer reasonable suggestions to address perceived deficiencies, then perhaps we can get somewhere.  I still kinda doubt it though.  That damned versatility of the shaman class makes it so that some of us play very differently than others, and thus while you may think healing upgrades are the key to fixing us up, Joe may think we need more DPS, and I may think we need more meaningful buffs, and Tom may think we need better mana regen/mana efficiency, and so on.<br />
<br />
None of us necessarily are asking for unreasonable changes by themselves, but asking for them all would be overpowering.  Thus the debate/argument begins again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Oh we forgot about CC when making this expansion, sorry!  No need to mez, just use your weak-ass nuke and c5/speed me thanks.  If you want, you can rune the MT if it makes you feel better.<br />
<br />
- Are you sure you are in a Time level guild? Or are you sure you actually thought about what you wrote? This expansion is enchanter's wet dream.<br />
<br />
Let's see:<br />
(1) Rathe. Without a solid enchanter crew, you won't see Time, period.<br />
(2) Coirnav (same as above)<br />
(3) Xegony (same as above)<br />
(4) Phase 1-2 time, you can't do it without a solid enchanter crew.<br />
(5) Terris/Saryrn (time), you might be able to pull it off without enchanters but they are pretty much a efficieny increaser. I mean why worry about killing an add while boss is alive with mana taps instead of killing boss and worring about adds later. Yes I know, some adds are unmezzable.<br />
(6) Vallon Zek (time) you need to snare the crap out of adds, to make sure you get adds under control fast: tash + snare.<br />
(7) Innoruuk (time) you need a crapload of chanters to tash aggro adds away from healers and allow CC crew to park them.<br />
(8) Quarm: mez those annoying adds. No bards don't have time for that because of much more important duties.<br />
<br />
Saying that SOE forgot about CC in PoP is beyond retarded, PoP is the CC expansion. Almost every chokepoint (Rathe/Coirnav) encounter or hard encounter (Innoruuk time) is based around having enchanters around because CC is not needed, but REQUIRED. And a lot of enchanters. Not to mention the everyday Phase 1 clearings, phase 2, Vallon Zek, hell even Rallos Zek the Warlord. And if you fight in Plane of Fire (aka LewtStore 2.0), them charmed Jopals are DPS monsters.<br />
<br />
But sure, SOE forgot about CC in PoP ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">(1) Rathe. Without a solid enchanter crew, you won't see Time, period.<br />

<br />
(4) Phase 1-2 time, you can't do it without a solid enchanter crew.<br />
<br />
Ya.  This is the only area of time where you really need more than 1.  Point taken.<br />
<br />
(5) Terris/Saryrn (time), you might be able to pull it off without enchanters but they are pretty much a efficieny increaser. I mean why worry about killing an add while boss is alive with mana taps instead of killing boss and worring about adds later. Yes I know, some adds are unmezzable.<br />
<br />
How many chanters does this take?<br />
<br />
(6) Vallon Zek (time) you need to snare the crap out of adds, to make sure you get adds under control fast: tash + snare.<br />
<br />
How many?<br />
<br />
(7) Innoruuk (time) you need a crapload of chanters to tash aggro adds away from healers and allow CC crew to park them.<br />
<br />
To be or not to be that is the question?<br />
<br />
(8) Quarm: mez those annoying adds. No bards don't have time for that because of much more important duties.<br />
<br />
And lastly - how many chanters does this take considering every AE the adds die?<br />
<br />
<br />
My point was that when we have more than 72 people show up to our raids (which are usually in Time), and I have to figure out how we're getting our last rotation cleric in and who has to leave, chanters immediately come to mind - past tier 1/2, you dont *need* more than one.  Extras are just fluff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">I was talking about farming Plane of Time.  You farm Xegony and Coirnav?<br />
- Now let's get not into technicalities but you said: and PoP as raid content. Elemental Gods ARE part of PoP raid content and not to mention many Time guilds still farm them. Especially the ones who didn't get first to time on their server. We still kill Coirnav/Xegony on every single occasion we raiding outside time and they are up. Earring, ring, chain BP, wraps, wand, hammer, shoulders are still great loot for time guilds.<br />
<br />
 Extras are just fluff.<br />
- When Innoruuk or VZ adds spawn and they need to be locked down ASAPt, I am sure the extra is not just &quot;fluff&quot;. Not to mention if sh!t hits the fan you need rebuffs both haste and C5 and the same time keep an eye on adds. Oh and when you clear boss yardtrash in phase 5, you can either go the AE way thus saving some time or go the long painful way and waste time. Plenty of reasons to bring more than one chanter to time. The more chanter a guild has that has just made it to time, the easier they progress.</div></div><hr />

We are in this state because people believe we are ok, Slow mitigation was a big slap in the face, our PoP spell-line was a big slap in the face, even focus effects do not take us into account (no focus effect for rain spells, no pure PR DD effect, Dot effects later added (thank our necro friends for that btw), etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">And are there any classes that pass your same qualifiers?<br />
<br />
Is there any class *needed* for a group?<br />
<br />
We can't solo very well? 34 minute AA points aren't good?<br />
<br />
If you're going to say that shamans aren't needed to raid, I'm going to venture that neither are clerics b/c you can use druids to heal and use necros/paladins to rez.  But that isn't optimal.  Extreme? Yes, so is raiding without shamans.<br />
<br />
If you're talking about stackability I believe that SoE partially addressed this in PoTime - alot of the encounters simply rely on our group curing ability, and the more shamans the merrier - our DPS isn't optimal but yes I would say we are a requirement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Well We could argue about how our guilds handle time but we do not cure so much in time. Maybe we use different strats but well.<br />
<br />
And not many classes fail all 3 criteria<br />
<br />
I suggest to look outside the box, beyond your guild group, past your Equipment.<br />
Sure You and I can tank in a normall LDoN mission, but so can any player who is guilded in a time level guild.<br />
Sure we bring some stuff that is handy to the table for a group but I see a lot of shamans sit LFG for hours when i check on my server.<br />
And they are not bad players, they have decent equipment but groups just do not pick a shaman when a better option is around.<br />
<br />
And that is what this is all about, why pick a shaman when a chanter will slow and add a lot of DPS (charmed pet).<br />
Why pick a shaman when a BST will slow and add a lot of dps?<br />
Why pick a shaman when a druid heals better and adds more dps?<br />
<br />
Players just get a fo7 somewhere and go out to fill a group as efficient as they can (friend groups are special cases here).<br />
Our buffs are no longer a key issue to pick us (stat buffs are redundant as most if not all players have the key stats maxed), our slow is not that much better then the other classes have, our DPS is to low and we do not have much other tools for groups.<br />
<br />
And I know that the only way to get something done in EQ is by screaming like a little girl. SoE only helps the whiners, sad but true.</div></div><hr />

Not for us shaman, as much as for necros and druids.<br />
<br />
Necromancer is intended to be the 2nd best DPS caster in the game. Their utility is half of that of a magician. And yet, thanks to massive crit and foci abilities, Nukes are far, far superior to all DoTs. On top of which, they accumulate massive aggro.<br />
<br />
There needs to be some major enhancement to DoTs.<br />

ill finish my points when i get back in a few hours but that is jsut a little of what i think about our class...<br />
<br />
im back with more opinions...<br />
<br />
with all that said here is a few ways we could get better<br />
1. imporve our heals, give us one mroe heal that casts faster and heals for at least 2k hp seems simple enough to me...<br />
2. make it so dots give less agro, we get enough with slow already we dont want more(same for necros anyone that keeps 3dots stacked on a mob is going to get agro no way around it that i have found unless u have one dam good tank)<br />
3. would b nice to have a better dog dog but thats not happening <br />
4. having rapid bear last 30min or so would make our dps a lot better with the right wep imo<br />
5. our nukes suck thats simple enough although were not a nuking class, at least make them faster or something<br />
6. make malos cast faster and a much shorter re use time and ill b happy:) or give us more spell slots so i can keep malo and malos up at the same time, a good idea would b giving a player the ability to keep spells of the same spell lin up some how withought taking up an extra spell slot(dont know how this would work but sounds good while im writing it =p)<br />
7. our class is just redundant, i hate having all the same spells, most other classes at least got a new type of spell or a huge increase.. what did we get? an avatar spell that gives 40 more to all stats and atk? whoopty friggin do. Q is our only good upgrade, sure all of our upgrades are nice but not we u compare it to somethign like the BL now slowing ability, or mages charm ability.<br />
<br />
to tell u the truth i still love being a shaman, i love being so mobile in groups.  i love being the one that can pull a group out of a jam by being able to heal after cleric dies, park adds, tank ones when mt goes down, b able to cast while most other ppl are oom, and the list goes on<br />
yes we are a balanced class there is no arguing that, but the problem we have is that we are so balance that we are not improving enough to keep up with other casters. while we are over in one corner with all the abilities of all the casters they are over in the other laughing at our ***** a** nukes, our sh**y heals, and close to 0 dps... <br />
<br />
what i am trying to say is we are a balanced class but the ones that specialize in all the abilities we have are getting way to superior to us, and the one ability that we specialize in(slowing), too many ppl are catching up to us in, BL the most.<br />
<br />
we all need to think about our current situation and see if we can talk to verrant and tell them our problems and help them think up ideas, wish they would take the time to read some of our forums and see what we need, there are a lot of great ideas on here but most of them will never be added to the game because the creators dont take the tiem to look around for ideas, and we arent helping ourselves:/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">We are not a class that can solo very well. <br />
<br />
Things I can do well as a shaman (solo).<br />
<br />
1. I can go to VP and solo endlessly with no downtime nor even come close to death.<br />
<br />
2. I can solo Kunark dragons.<br />
<br />
3. I can break Plane of Fear solo.<br />
<br />
4. I can solo mobs in Plane of Fire at the table in castle #2. (though this bores me and I prefer not to.)<br />
<br />
5. I can break any camp in CT and farm loot. (the sorrowsong boot pool is tricky to break)<br />
<br />
6. I can farm AA's in under an hour in many different places. I can also collect loot while doing this that has earned me over 1 million PP this year alone. <br />
<br />
7. I can be the crowd control in Hard ldon adventures (no mezzer) and win. (I only do hard adventures)<br />
<br />
8. I can kite 10 members of enemy guilds for 20 minutes while waiting for others in my guild to come assist me.<br />
<br />
9. I can pretty much go to any dungeon or zone I feel like and work my way to named mobs and kill them all by myself. Hates Fury, HS, Griegs End, The Deep, Droga, AC, Ssra and anyplace else I decide to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure I would like improvements just like a lot of other people would. I'm still waiting for shaman to get snare. I just hate listening to people say how useless we are when I don't feel that way at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">not that I agree with the statement about shamans not soloing well, but any halfway decent solo class with gear and aa's like you have can do most of the things on your list in their sleep lol.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt say we suck when you look at the handful of other classes that can do that.<br />
<br />
We are the #1 self sufficent class in the game. We have more useful abilities to fit our needs and the needs of others then any other class in the game. Im sorry but you can call me a jerk all day, but if you hate you shaman so much, delete it or reroll something else or put a spin on it and take a look ate what you HAVE and not what you dont. <br />
<br />
I get groups fine.<br />
<br />
With my Mana regen and puppy i can make some nice DPS. It just requires a lil more work then clicking a nuke button like a zombie.<br />
<br />
I can solo things most classes cant and a few things no classes but a shaman can.<br />
<br />
I have the best charisma buff in the game, what else do you want?<br />
<br />
Seriously, try to look at your good points and accept and deal with yoru faults. Shaman are pretty F'n awesome if you really think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Looking at what *you* have, isn't enough.<br />

Just take the current EQ economy as an example. Yesterday you had 50 k pp in your bank and you were a happy and rich guy. <br />
Today somebody found a &quot;sploit&quot; and everyone, except you, suddenly made 200 k over night, which made sellers adjust their prices for the sudden cash flow coming into the economy. <br />
Now your 50 k pp aren't gonna buy you much anymore.<br />
<br />
That's what has been happening to the Shaman class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Im not quite sure of your point Giac. But if its We were a good class and now we arent cause we havent been upgraded much, then i would have to say that you might wanna consider we have been pretty good for a long time now and there just isnt a NEED for it. Yea we have lil things that need tweaking, every class does, im not arguing that we are the perfect class that all classes need to be modeled after.... well maybe we are ;)  ... but this poster and thread is more about i want i want i want. We cant do it all. We are how we should be, master of none but a slice of it all. <br />
<br />
We are so strong right now but when someone sees a mage solo something in BoT with a pet, suddenly the alarms go off. They dont see the other end of it, like that mage cant pull that trick off anyplace else. If you sit down and look at all sides of the issue, not just our side, you see we are not bad off. We have a solid class that is needed on raids and groups and can solo pretty effectively.<br />
<br />
The most important point of my thread is this. Nothing is going to change our blance. SoE feels we are pretty close to perfect in their eyes minus a few tweaks. This is why our concerns are never answered and this is why things will not change. So you have 2 choices, you can shut your mouth and leave the bitching and whining and negitivity behind and focus on the positive things you can do and just enjoy the class or you can Re-roll a new toon or buy one, or do whatever it is going to take to make you happy and just move on.<br />
<br />
Oh, there is a 3rd option, which is to bitch and scream at a brick wall, to push your shoulder against a mountain that is unmoveable. Doesnt sound fun does it?<br />
<br />
Strength is the power to take on any battle.<br />
<br />
Wisdom is knowing when to turn your attention to somethign else.<br />

- Yes I remember that: Alchemy is working fine. - Abashi the Moron. Classes are not that ouf balance. - Absor the Retad. Strange, they did fix alchemy not to mention huge balance changes are incoming for pure melee. Oh they also fixed DoTs (sorta) by adding damage focuses and so on. This happens because, as you put it, people bitch and whine. Ah, the golden rule of The Crucible: Someone with a different opinion is labeled automatically as a &quot;whiner&quot;. Oh and the opinion of many people is that SOE has no clue about their game (&quot;Working as intended' is a registered trademark of SOE), or else warriors/monks wouldn't be in this sad pathetic  state today. Not to mention, there is also a common opinion shared by many that SOE doesn't play shamans. Now feel free to label these people as &quot;whiners&quot; as well.<br />
<br />
So you have 2 choices, you can shut your mouth and leave the bitching and whining and negitivity behind and focus on the positive things you can do and just enjoy the class <br />
- Wow. This is retarded. You know, you can thank the people who expressed their frustration and opinions (keyword alert: opinions) about the broken parts in the game in the past or:<br />
- You wouldn't be casting any spells on a boss mob.<br />
- Knights would be extinct.<br />
- Getting XP would be nerfed into the ground.<br />
- Your level 64 would have lasted 10 times as much as old school 59.<br />
- Oh, fancy class based XP penalties!<br />
- Your healing would be beyond pathetic.<br />
- Torpor would suck the mana out your target.<br />
- Slowing would generate 10 times more aggro.<br />
- Your DoTs will even suck more than today.<br />
- Your rabid bear would be in a far more pathetic state than today.<br />
- Alchemy would still be &quot;Working as intended&quot;<br />
- BoS and BoU would have DD components on impact.<br />
- Group buffs? What group buffs? <br />
- Focus effects? What focus effects?<br />
- Hell ... Caster loot? What caster loot?<br />
- Resists for pet? What the ... ?<br />
- Your entire contribution to a raid would be a healer for modroding clerics ... oh wait, Torpor has to be changed for that.<br />
- People will be cockblocking your sorry arse from elementals, hell you wouldn't be able to kill much in PoP unless you were in the top guild of the server.<br />
<br />
And I could go on for ages listing the changes that made this game far better and that were brought to light in part thanks to people who you label as whiners and bitchers.<br />
<br />
or you can Re-roll a new toon or buy one, or do whatever it is going to take to make you happy and just move on.<br />
- Oh the classic STF-U and play another class statement. Hey, it might shock you, but I do like playing a shaman a lot. However I am not blind like many people about certain key tweaks this class needs.<br />
<br />
Oh, there is a 3rd option, which is to bitch and scream at a brick wall, to push your shoulder against a mountain that is unmoveable. Doesnt sound fun does it?<br />

<br />
Before you label people who have different opinions (keyword alert: different opinions) &quot;whiners&quot; and &quot;bitch&quot;, learn a bit of EQ history and see what these &quot;whiners&quot; have fought for in the past.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">First off let me point out that you reply to alot of my quotes with masked frustration from other people. A example would be my comment on re-rolling. While you take that as a &quot;**** if you dont like it&quot; demand, it was meant as a option, not a demand. Different opinions is what its all about, but please dont group me into a category. Read what i say. Its all good though cause its obvious its been coming for a while and ill let it slide so you can vent.<br />
<br />
There is a HUGE and vast difference from bringing a topic to discussion and shouting from the mountain tops that shaman or soooo horrible. I can only reply to everything above in a simple way.<br />
<br />
If shaman are so ****ed up, why is it that i play mine nad im completely happy? Why am i soloing things no other classes can? I hear that shaman are not suited to LDoN and our DPS sucks, but i MAKE it work and use my rains and DoTs and ALL my tools. <br />
<br />
Playing a shaman is hard work if you wanna do these things. With a wizzy you just click a button and your DPS is done, but with me i am canabalizing and chain nuking for very respectable damage when you check the mana usage/regen. What i see is a shift in change from people working with what they have and doing it, to looking at what other people have and wanting it. <br />
<br />
People say our nukes are sub par, they say our DoTs are sub par and our healing is sub par, but what i think they dont realize is was are a sub par class. A shaman is the jack of all trades and master of none. It has been this way since i played the game and the only thing i have seen change is people getting to 65 and wanting to have it all. One shaman likes to nuke so he thinks our nukes are crap. Another likes to be a cleric only so he thinks our heals are crap. My shaman is everything. He is the healer, he is the nuker, he is the crowd control. I am this and more at ALL times. So from my perspective it is a even balance cause im not trying to do 1 single job incredibly, but i am trying to do all the jobs i can the best i can.<br />
<br />
There was a comment that shaman are not suited fro LDoN, but when i play LDoN, i am crowd control, i am healer, i am slower, i am usualy haster, i am the buffer and off tanker. I do all these things together and still im not finding that im lacking.  How am i able to fill so many roles if my class is so bad ?<br />
<br />
So to sum up, your absolutly right, talking and debating and finding ways to improve us and our class is absolutly needed and im greatful people here do it, cause i do it myself, but my point im trying to get across here is that if you truly believe that we are so sub par, take a look at me, a shaman that is not &quot;just content&quot; but a shaman that knows the high end game that is getting by just fine and ask yourself how i can possibly do it.<br />
<br />
I think it was said very well on the last page. What we have here is a versitlity issue. we can do so much that you find 1 person plays a shaman different then another and desires different things. I dont think there is a way to agree on something to get the things you want. Not saying it cant be done, not by all means, but it sure seems very difficult and will require more togetherness then any other class to get anything at all, because we are all so different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for ldon ez mode... yeah shamans can be real handy against trivial opponents. Wherever mobs are so weak that even the 4th or 5th best class at something is sufficient, shamans own, for what that's worth. You forgot to add we can play main tank there too. Of course the fact that our main rival for group slots, the enchanter, is godlike in ldon is a separate issue...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Yes, chanters are great for LDoN, but, they can't do it by themselves.  I've never seen a chanter heal anyone.  Or cast 25hp/tick regen.  Or cure poison and disease based spells.  Or tank/off-tank.  Or area slow multiple mobs.  Or use a disease based slow on a high magic resistant mob.<br />
<br />
Since they can't charm kill in most LDoN areas their DPS is minimal.  And, if they get a mezz or slow bounced and pull aggro, they do not last very long when getting beat on.  So, yeah, they are a great team member and LDoN suits their abilities. I'm glad to have one on my side.  But it certainly does not prevent me from adding plenty of benefit to the group with slow, heal, cripple, debuff, dots, rains, dd's, dog, root, buffs, haste, regen, etc.  Thank you.<br />

Btw, Giac, I've played a chanter, and I'm much happier as a Shammy, but that's just me.  Oh, and LDoN is only a small part of EQ, let's try to keep the conversation on the whole game.<br />

There is so much that we have lost, we get SoW as first class, yet our upgrade is pathetic and late.<br />
We get no improved invis.<br />
We have the ultimate melee buff (avatar) only to see that the BST one is superior.<br />
Every spell we have costs more mana then it should, and why..............because we can get RSI from canning.<br />

Sure I can do fine in LDON but so can every int caster. they tank just as well, they pull just as well and half of them heal just as well because you do not need healing with a little regen on to group.</div></div><hr />

You raid heavily I assume. I just made the elementals a couple of days ago so have no insight as to my role on raids up there. But, pre-elemental I can say that I agree with many of your points. There is usually a lot to do on a raid, and I don't care if I am the only shaman or the 4th shaman, I am still busy. Buffing is just an aspect of a raid though. Rezzes occur regularly and those folks will need buffs. Not everyone is maxed out on stats. 8 spellslots is generally not enough. Maybe when I have reached your levels of play I will start to get bored with the idea but right now if someone needs something and I can fit it in they get it. It might not be immediately, it might not happen at all, but I don't tell them &quot;here is a focus, now ****&quot;, or &quot;I deleted stamina from my spellbook&quot;. <br />
<br />
Plus, raiding is not the whole game. There are other things such as ldon, grinding, etc. where the style is different. In those situations I will buff because I should.<br />
<br />
Take a breather, I think you are getting a little aggressive about performing part of the role you should be performing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">I think it is true.  SHaman spells are jacked up.  Beasts do get better buffs for single grouping.  You don't need malos so their slow is nearly as good.  They can take hits better due to stonestance.  They typically do more damage.<br />
<br />
Rangers get spells that give as much attack as avatar does (or nearly) yet it is group and lasts a long time.  The small increase in dps that avatar gives anymore is not so great that it should be a 5min buff.  (ok it is actually longer especially with AA and focus.)  What other class has been constantly plagued by group buffs which are less powerful than their single target versions.  haven't we argued this point before.  Group haste needs to be SLTW level.<br />
<br />
Shaman are due an upgrade to slow.  There are very few mobs left where suddenly being able to slow them would make them much more easy than they ALREADY are.  ANy new boss mob is either easy to slow and mitigates slow or is immune.  Give shaman a slow with a negative adjust already.  And make it be a complete replacement for turgurs.  ie same cast time and slow % and duration if not better.  It can cost more though.<br />
<br />
Q is nice, but shaman should be able to heal groups better.  Group Q would be great and/or a Heal over time that heals 500 or a tic is needed.  <br />
<br />
They have long nerfed shaman healing abilities due to having such a great slow.  But this isn't nearly as much of an issue as it was back in kunark.  Very few classes could slow as well or as effectively as a shaman, and an enchanter was often limited in what htey could do due to the costs of mez.  Mez cost has come down and mana regen has gone up.  With slow mitigation, 75% slow isn't nearly as important as it used to be either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Link please!<br />
<br />
So you don't know why Enchanters are god like in LDoN, yet you think that your opinion on balance is the right one?<br />
<br />
Enlighten me please then.<br />
<br />
I know what enchanters bring to the table. I just dont see anything that makes them &quot;Godlike&quot; in a LDoN adventure. Godlike means surpassing all else and in a category where they can not be touched. I have to disagree with that. Group make up and player ability effects that so drasticly that you cant pin it all on 1 class and say they are the end all be all to a group. Its just too one dimensional. <br />
<br />
As far as SoE saying jack of all trades... How long you been playing EQ? Cause i remember reading this as the exact description as to what a shaman was according to them. At the time it was verant, but i dont see much proof of SoE wanting to change that, infact i see only reinforcement of that mentality through the actions they have taken. <br />
<br />
<br />
I tell you what though, i have no desire to get into a battle with you over it, i just dont care enough cause i know i cant change your mind. You got your opinion i got mine. I feel mine is right and you go right on thinking your right.<br />
<br />
Ill head off and do many of the things people claim we cant do, just like i have always been doing since the first day i registered at this forum. Only difference from that day and this day is i know what to expect from SoE and i know where to pick my battles. This one isnt worth it.<br />
<br />
Haha.. whatever.  *YOU* are not suited to LDON.  *I* am.  If you can't pull, ghetto mez, and drag a marginal group through an adventure in 30 minutes then it is YOU that is the problem, not the shaman class.<br />
<br />
That about sums up my view as well. Albiet a lil more blunt then i would chose, but certainly agree. I have hotkeys for offtanking, ghetto mezzing, pulling and assist that are always up, simply cause i use them that often.<br />

<br />
Not for us shaman, as much as for necros and druids.<br />
<br />
Necromancer is intended to be the 2nd best DPS caster in the game. Their utility is half of that of a magician. And yet, thanks to massive crit and foci abilities, Nukes are far, far superior to all DoTs. On top of which, they accumulate massive aggro.<br />
<br />
Necros can easily and more successfully outdamage a mage and they bring a LOT more to a group (unless CoH is a requirement). Their DoTs are massively better than shaman dots, and once they get neuro and some critical hit AAs they can nuke very effectively. Mindwrack, manapumps, group heals, an insane pet, DC, and the ability to chain cast almost indefinitely with no agro, what is not to like about necros?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>LISIMBA_SHAKIR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">Basically Im ok with what we do. When Im on a raid I do mainly rezz detail. I re-buff the dead peeps :P So I only need a few single target buffs memmed and enjoy the show. Now that being said we usually have 6 to 8 shamman sometimes on a raid.<br />
<br />
As far as any new buffs or spells I would like to see the Shaman go back to its mystical side more. What I mean by that is maybe we could get a spell that would allow us to turn into a big arse bear that can actually mellee ( and not broke down Rabid bear AA :P) at the cost of not being able to cast certain spells or something to balance it or give us a form of a big Ol bird or cheetah that can move at Selo speed ( I mean come on we damn near slowest class around now hehe) Shaman in literary works were always depicted as a master of transforming into animals I think this line of new spells would add some mopre fun into the class and not &quot;unbalance&quot; our class where everyone would be crying bloody murder. <br />
<br />
I myself am in a guild that is 1 fight away from PoFire and enjoy the stuff were are able to do now. I have np at all getting groups for LDoN advs or anything else. Soloing is a PITA to me cuz its very ineffecent compared to other classes and I like to relax in a group and gop afk when i want to and not kill the group ( ie likes grouping with Beasts and clerics :P)<br />

Its a GAME lets hope SoE puts some of the FUN back in the game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">I would NEVER pick a shaman over a chanter for a hard ldon adventure. The shaman isnt going to be healing... debuff, cc, and dps. Who does that better? Enchanter hands down. If we got anything but a sorry ass heal (for when mobs are pounding ya for 900 a hit) our crappy healing capabilities might be enough to get us groups. As it stands... no thanks. 25 hp a tick regen! wow, thats what, reducing dps by 4? On mobs with, what, 400dps? UBAR! Mob dps has jumped bya  factor of 5 (at LEAST) since kunark... why has our regen only gained 10? Hell, our slowing ability has gone DOWN in that time too (thx mitigation). 50/100 a tick would hardly be unbalanced for elemental planes. Dont want just ANYONE having it? Make it a quest spell or something.<br />
<br />
Killing it faster with a charmed pet results in less damage taken, and less healing needed than our healing and dps output could.<br />
<br />
We need a 50% slow that CANT be mitigated, group quiesence, group avatar, and a decent blast heal. This 1300 base heal crap is for sucks. <br />
<br />
If rabid bear was group, it might be worth buying. Now its an aa sink for the bored, or a toy for pvp. Wheee!</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree Flabbo<br />
<br />
We're the only healer class that doesn't have a group heal of some form (either via spell or AA).  Even some hybrids (Paladin and Beastlord - note, a shaman hybrid, at least on paper) get group heals.  *** is with that?  And would a group Avatar with a real duration be that game-breaking?<br />
<br />
Curses (like cast time slow etc... if they can do casting haste, they can do casting slow, kthx) would be a nice addition to set us apart without being game breaking.<br />
<br />
Minor tweaks, we are the first class to get SoW, yet Druids and even rangers get more SoW upgrades than we do.  Why don't we get Spirit of Eagle / FoE, or an equivalent? We call every other animal spirit in the game, just not eagles. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Shaman are OK but could use some tweaks IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hum Flabbo, I always get hard groups over Enchanters that you rave so well about. We are good at cc and healing imho. I never have to cast malos before casting slow on a mob during a hard adventure along with only getting maybe 1 resist per 10 mobs. Hell the named are very easily slowed. Once slowed these guys are cake. CC, is very easy, slow mobs for aggro root it(right click) dot it and sit, where as with a chanter you can't dot it while it sits there.<br />
<br />
I guess you need to pick better Shaman that know how to play their role. :confused:</div></div><hr />

- Ever seen a competent enchanter in action? 500+ DPS (unbuffed) pets are nice, no wait, they are very nice. Necros can do it to though but much more limited so in a way a competent enchanter can bring a metric crapload of DPS to an adventure.  Keep in mind that a time geared rogue with insane gear has about 50% of that DPS fully buffed, if not less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">Then what are the class issues Giac.  You've mentioned slow mitigation as being apparently game-breaking for shamans.  What else?<br />
- IMO, you don't need to look that far. Slow and cannibalize are the spells that limit shaman spell efficiency, DPS and healing. You can slow 75%, so our healing has to be scaled down or druids/clerics will complain (with reason). You can slow meaning you can't have high DPS because then you will become a solo monster. Soloing = bad for SOE. That's why SOE is pushing everyone and his dog to groups. Slow also means no other CC spells/abilities for shamans because slow itself was a good CC tool (before mitigation). <br />
<br />
A lot of class balancing regarding shamans were centered on slow, most importantly healing. Unfortunately with slow mitigation AND other class slows coming close to that, we never got compensated for it. Not to mention cannibalize line wasn't upgraded in 2.5 expansions (PoP, LoY, LDoN). Basically SOE said: you got 75% slow as a priest, your healing will be X, your DPS Y. <br />
<br />
So by &quot;nerfing&quot; slow and having another class with shamanistic abilities have a slow that comes very close in power, SOE unbalanced the class because a lot of shaman abilities are balanced by looking at slow first. Not to mention the other slow classes can bring some very interesting abilities and/or much more DPS to a group, but that's for another post/thread.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean that slow mitigation is the only issue with the shaman class. There are few more that has been pointed out over and over. However slow mitigation is a big issue.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents, feel free to flame me.</div></div><hr />

This isn't something i wish for, because it's useful, it's is NEEDED.<br />
<br />
I didn't touch the healing issues, because i think the Shaman lost that cause in favor of the Druids. We are too fat behind at this point to expect a balance on that end.<br />
So Sony has to focus on our primary abilities to retain *balance*.</div></div><hr />
