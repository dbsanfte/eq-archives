 Are you LFGuild? Then take the opportunity of the servermerge (or a normal servertransfer) to join us.<br />
<br />
We are looking for skilled and friendly players, who still have fun to play EQ and who miss or want to try real raids.<br />
Your server is too low populated? Ya got the chance to take a costless servertransfer? (or even it would be a normal <br />
one you might consider it.) Then check out Midwinter on Kane Bayle.<br />
<br />
Be welcome, if you can raid 3-5 days per week from 19:00-23:30 CET (GMT+1) and if you are level 66+.<br />
<br />
Soooo if you would like to join one of the strongest european raiding guilds on Kane Bayle check out our <br />
website by clicking the image. The average level of our full members is 70 and we are raiding 4-5 days a week. <br />
<br />
To give you an idea what we are raiding, you can see our progression and some funny pictures by <br />
clicking on the following link (a flash plug-in is needed).<br />
<br />
For futher information use our forum or tells (with ;tell kane.name) or DoN-mail (with SOE.EQ.KANE.name)<br />
Talk to Tangerine (guild leader) or to one of our officers (Excre, Ompy).<br />

Guess you could say she dropped the Hammer on it :)<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you hadn't pointed to it and said &quot;Can;t touch this&quot;</div></div><hr />
