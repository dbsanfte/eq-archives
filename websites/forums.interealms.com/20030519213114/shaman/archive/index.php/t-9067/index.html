<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kardyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can Maiden's Eye be done at 53 solo? What if I stick near the DSP zoneline?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I tried at around 51 I could solo one of those goranga gatherers. But even with C3 my mana would be drained very quickly. The first one I ended low on mana, and about 50% hp. Second one I couldn't finish because I ran OOM and it kept resisting so I had to zone it. :/<br />
<br />
BTW, in case you didn't know this already, they have lots of hp. Last time I was there it took even a group to beat them down at a decent pace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if ur gonna do ME at 53 dont stick at the zone line and kill tribals too much hp on those, instead kill umbrous toilers, lower hp all blue at ur level</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maidens eye has been working very well for me, and I have been killing goranga (sp?) guys for a few days now, my ac is high, and I always have kei...<br />
<br />
Can kill with no downtime (horse, jbb)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">straif you should try out toilers, when u zone in from DSP run straight out along the side of that big grey stone building, at the end corner go left, follow the wall until ur a little behind a lake with a house on stilts above it theres a safepull spot there just along the first side, deeper in the corner and other side have roamers...toilers seem to be about the same exp per kill as the gorangas but they have less hp and less dmging hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried them for a bit but most the time I get run over by a wizard or druid quading them.  I literally have 0 downtime killing the gorangas, most times I dont even use mana to kill them.  With kei, horse, jbb and dogdog it is a breeze.  And I kinda like &quot;in teh face!&quot; fighting.  <br />
<br />
On a side not I can even kill the yellow or red ones (hunters?) takes a few minutes and I have to heal a few times but it is hella fun!</div></div><hr />
