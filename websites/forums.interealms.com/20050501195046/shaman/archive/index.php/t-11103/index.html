<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiktak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well, they stretched their target date to its max, but here it is<br />
http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_creatures.jsp<br />
small question, Ogres / trolls / humans / everyone? getting new models again to destroy my computer???<br />
<br />
  oh well, there was a line in there <br />
<br />
&quot;Their shamans have gleaned powerful knowledge from the luggalds and have combined that knowledge with their own ancient traditions. &quot;<br />
<br />
  just interesting, obviously nothing major will happen, but oh well just nice to have the only class mentioned there....<br />
<br />
  Also, it talks a lot about sea combat, something that &quot;will never be implemented due to the complicated nature&quot;  then again, its just the opposite of a horse....cant summon on land only in water.<br />
<br />
  If anyone has any other comments about whats being said feel free to leave em here, or just tell me to shut up and ignore my post =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Head</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The line about the Shaman having learned new skills was next to a pic of what looked like a Zombie Troll it said something about those who died for the clan can still be useful members this was alround the new shaman stuff maybe im just getting my hopes up but there might be something there maybe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">70% naked Half elf + eyepatch = hot</div></div><hr />

70% naked Half elf + eyepatch = hot <br />
<br />
Get out more lol :D<br />
<br />
only kidding ;)<br />
<br />
After some of the woman ive dated im starting to think about lusting after fakes 1's! :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The models don't look like anything more complex that what we have already...and they all look like pirates which would fit into the new zones only....so no extra stress on your computer.<br />
<br />
Does sound like they are pointing out some new alchemy things though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The pics and the captions made it sound like the Broken Skull Clan was not a clan of trolls, but more a clan of pirates.  Which kinda makes sense, except for the story line between the Broken Skull and the Ykesha Clan.  At least this is what I think I read.  Can't find the first 4 chapters to re-read to confirm.<br />
<br />
I was a bit disappointed when I saw the &quot;new creatures&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Ditto!<br />
<br />
LoY = &quot;Lameness of Ykesha&quot; IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whee! Another expansion where evils likely have only one place to bind, sell, and quest, and every friggin exp/loot zone is on that faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Troll zombies? Trolls get to be necros maybe? Or maybe a troll shammy AA ability? Hmmmm....when's the next ship out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oaks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">voodoo and zombies go hand in hand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Definately be nice if that line means they might have actually read a couple threads on wants curses/somethin new :)<br />
<br />
<br />
  And rather than new &quot;creatures&quot; it looks like just new armor graphics, be nice if some are made player useable, especially tatoos (well, barb always had em, but could only change them on face) and maybe even have a weapon to replace your hand like that troll captain :P<br />
<br />
<br />
   Ok, the second isn't likely, but it would be funny to see some monk running around with blades and clubs for hands and still using H2H :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I thought it was kind of lame, but I'm curious to see if they are just giving us tastes and not giving it all away on their &quot;releases&quot;<br />
<br />
Like zones for example, I thought there was supposed to be like 20 or so :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">new models = some tatoos ?<br />
<br />
ooh 'woads' of new models there.<br />
<br />
sorry :D</div></div><hr />
