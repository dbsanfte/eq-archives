<br />
<br />
If this isn't the best trio you can think of, please advise. We are trying to stay away from the Holy Trinity, and still have a solid group that can take a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Straight up fighting you're gonna run into some difficulties. Bards don't 'tank' as well as others, although they are obviously very versatile.<br />
<br />
Shaman as your slower and healer is fine. Necro as your DPS guy is fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do some normal LDoNs with me (shm), Mage and Bard.  We really do well.  I think your group is solid and actually has a benefit that mine doesn't.  Eventually, the necro will get their 93% rez and they can also FD; so, in case of a really bad situation, you have an &quot;out&quot;.  The mage has the better pet, but against mobs that are fully slowable, my dog does just fine.  And, bards are great pullers so have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">By the way that trio looks, I take it you guys kite most of the time ?<br />
<br />
You do have a few different ways of killing mobs, which is nice (Bard / kite .. necro snare / kite .... root / DoT).<br />
And since all 3 classes can gain mana fast, you shouldnt have much down time.<br />
<br />
There would be only be 2 things that would stop you.<br />
1) Mob is immune to changes in running speed<br />
2) Mob summons</div></div><hr />

We havent started playing yet actually, but after discussing it for a while we came up with that trio.<br />
<br />
<br />
I realize the summoning part is going to be the kicker... but worse case scenario, the shaman can tank a slowed mob that summons?<br />
<br />
I dont think we will be able to straight up tank much normally, and that might get annoying, but this is why I am asking what we should do :). Idea is max sustained DPS (counting downtime), and if we ever came up against mobs that summoned that we HAD to kill, we should be able to drop a healer and tank in the spots.<br />
<br />
<br />
We will be going from levels 1-? with these guys, so for the first while it shouldnt be a super big deal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and for tanking, I was thinking maybe a charmed mob from the Bard for those situations... so yeah kiting quite a bit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depends on how you define best.  I myself would lean SK/SHM as a base duo (and not just because that's what I bot), then add a DPS class. Top end druids are nice and can bridge heals in mid 40s when SK/SHM would be weak if you are levelling from scratch.  I'd consider mage for the fun toys or wizard for nasty DPS as well.<br />
<br />
I'd done SK/SHM/DRU (SK and SHM bazaar 65s and a time geared 65 DRU) and it's a pretty effective trio.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't played a bard, so take this with a grain of salt . . .<br />
<br />
The mage pets, especially the air and earth pets, are pretty darn good tanks.  &quot;Good&quot;, as in taking a beating fairly well and holding agro at the same time.  They won't crank out huge DPS, but it's not bad, either.  I play a mage quite a bit, and I'm fairly impressed with their pets as tanks.  With a slowed mob, almost anything can tank, but the mage pets do a good job while throwing in some decent dps as well.  With a good agro pet, like the 61 air pet, you can use your DOTs more often, and the mage can nuke often enough to throw in some serious DPS.  <br />
<br />
A mage/shaman combo, with a necro thrown in, would be a REALLY nice dps team.  You're a little lacking in some areas, but virtually any trio is.  Don't underestimate the tanking power of a mage pet - they really can hold up pretty well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A mage's biggest weakness is mob control.  Mage pets help suppliment that quite a bit, but shaman and necro can easily make up in that arena, and the Earth Pet later on is IMO a more preferable tank than a bard.  Especially considering that the group's tank can be &quot;chain cast&quot; if need be and doesn't need rezzing, and the necro or even SHM pets can tank well enough on a slowed mob for the mage to get a new pet out there.<br />
<br />
Also, all 3 of you can bind and maybe gate if things go bad while your pets / swarm pets / WtD pet runs interferance.<br />
<br />
Mages contribute some very solid DPS on their own, and they have great utility for pet weapons on the side as well... plus CoH, etc.<br />
<br />
You wanna go somewhere tough?<br />
<br />
Mage dies.<br />
Necro FD drags to the spot, rezzes mage.<br />
CoH Shaman and you're there.<br />
<br />
All die in a bad spot, Summon corpses and rez and carry on.  Slow mobs, 3 pets for tanking/interferance/heals/dots galore/nuke dps/sow/regen/mana/coh/etc., even mezzing in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Stun is about the only biggie I can think of, I dunno if necro or mage can stun.<br />
<br />
If you don't want the holy trinity, I think necro/mage/shaman makes a fine experiencing trio anyday of the week***, and can probably tackle some impressive mobs later on with the right tactics.<br />
<br />
<br />
*** necro/necro/necro also makes a fine experiencing trio any day of the week as well ... and quite possibly faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kunann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would actually go with Bard + Necro + Beastlord. More DPS and beastlord pet can tank very well. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It sounds like you have a very solid group there. Sure the bard can't tank as well as others, but you have a shammy slowing. You have good crowd controll, and bard and necro can be used as pullers. Bard would be great for croud controll. I would like to see a group like that kite too, don't forget at later levels when fear doesn't work you can blind the mob and it will run away, but all PC's have to stay out of melee range as they will turn and attack you(not pets as long as a pc has agro)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd go with mage or BL over shaman...<br />
<br />
once you get requiem of time for your bard slowing is trivial.  your bard can easily debuff and slow even multiple mobs (even on pulls).  of course there will be a gap from the mid 40s-60s where you wont have good slow and those are the levels where bard kiting/charm/swarm kiting are most powerfull so that's no problem.<br />
<br />
the main issue with going necro/bard/BL or necro/bl/mage is tanking and healing.  bards cannot tank well at any level, and even with AAs and time+ gear they're plate wearers who cant tank as well as chain or leather tanks... esp with necro healing.  you're going to be very effective in many situations with that trio but very ineffectual in others<br />
<br />
probably the most solid, if not the most flexible group would be SK/cleric/bard... a bit low on dps but with rez/FD/buffs/utility/snare there's not much you couldn't do with very little risk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'd vote for Shaman, Necro, Mage also. Would be a very powerfull combo all the way from 1-65. The free focus items and pet toys from the mage would help quite a bit and save a ton of plat on the way up. I can't tell you how nice it would have been to have someone who could just summon a few daggers for the dog on demand instead of having to wory if ya had enough rusty's on hand. Lol, at the lower levels just equip all the pets with stun whips from Paw /grin. Another combo that seems it would be a real powerhouse would be Shaman, Necro, Necro. Can't think of many situations that combo couldn't handle as well as a whole group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The trio you propose is a good one, and if you pick up friends along the way that will make the group just that much better.  <br />
<br />
I regularly do groupings with a necro and a bard.  We've handled the 4-way camp in Bastion of Thunder and taken down Praetorian Myral of Grieg's End with just the three of us.  It does require kiting, lots of DoTs, and sometimes the bard has to be our tank, but it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Just the shaman and necro are an amazing duo already.  Necromancers are also excellent kiters if you find a situation that requires it (usually for efficiency if that matters to you).<br />
<br />
In that case any class for the 3rd slot will work.  I'd actually stay away from a tank class if you want to avoid a trinity type setup and stay with the bard or, as many suggest, throw in a second pet class.  A mage, beastlord or even another necro will work fine.<br />
<br />
It was mentioned that bards can slow and while this is true, remember that it's only for 3 ticks (18 seconds) and forces the bard to sacrifice other areas of utility.  Also in this trio he won't be doing much tanking later on without very good gear which means he'll be twisting dots mostly or leading the kite.  I like the idea of a bard though.  Incomparable utility and decent DPS ability = a very powerful and versatile class.<br />
<br />
I also have no idea where the rumor begin that necro pets are horrid tanks.  I wouldn't call them awesome tanks and they're certaintly not mage level, but mine tanks anything that hits for up to mid 500's (slowed 70% or more) just fine, even if it's just me (as the necro) doing the healing.  With Turgur's, Q and Tnarg's most mobs up to Tier3 are a joke for the 65 nec pet to tank with nothing other than the LDoN focus.  The only exception to this is the rogue class pets (53 and 63rd level).<br />
<br />
Another bonus to having a shm and nec is the ability to combine Malos/Malosinia and Words of Terris (high level undead charm) to rake in some very nice exp and farm nearly anything you want in places like Veksar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tragik, <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on necro pets.  I'll be honest - I hadn't really looked at necro pets as tanks.  It sounds like they do just fine.  I have one question - how well do they hold agro?  I know necros can buff their pets, similar to beastlords, but I don't know any specifics on how it works.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">shaman-necro is an obscenely nice duo.  Necros also charm like a *ahem* charm with a shaman around and some decent strategy in a couple zones.  Extremely hard-hitting summoners are your biggest weakness (with good gear sometimes it is better to have the necro take the hits on the summons, since they can tap as well as get healed).  A lot of classes can make that an even better trio.  Paladin might work best, bringing real tanking and substantial heals to the mix.  Little light on DPS, but you have the necro for that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Khulgore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Shadow Knight, Beast Lord, Cleric<br />
<br />
Shadow Knight brings:<br />
Tanking<br />
Crowd Control (by only bringing one to the camp)<br />
Snare<br />
Corpse Recovery<br />
Invis to Undead<br />
<br />
Beast Lord brings:<br />
Slow<br />
Damage<br />
HP Buffs<br />
Haste<br />
Mana Regen<br />
Invis<br />
SoW<br />
<br />
Cleric brings:<br />
Heal<br />
HP Buffs<br />
Res<br />
Caster interrupt (stun line)<br />
Invis to Undead<br />
<br />
The only thing you are double up on is Invis to Undead.  What you are<br />
lacking is Resist Debuff (for easier landing of slow), backup healer (chloroblast really doesn't cut it when mobs hit for more than it heals at the levels the BL would be using it), and ports.<br />
<br />
This is the best three man group I can think of.  Personally I find it to be superior to the &quot;holy trinity&quot; in versatility.  The main downside to this three man group is that a lot of the utility of the beast lord does not come until later levels (mana regen and haste most notably).<br />
<br />
Now if by holy trinity you mean &quot;any tank&quot; &quot;any slower&quot; &quot;any healer&quot; then obviosuly this group doesn't meet your requirements.  But caster pets, as good a tanks as they may be, will not take you very far.  Since PoP, the game has been more and more tuned such that groups require a true tank, a true slower, and a true healer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">bottom line: in any group of 3, you're going to be ok as long as you have a slower, a healer, some kind of tanking ability, DPS, and some form of crowd control. it's very easy to do that with 3 people, and you'll find a lot of different things that will work.</div></div><hr />
