<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fandain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">could u please post an estimate of what these spells should go for, dont want to know low/high prices, but averages:<br />
<br />
regrowth of dah khuma<br />
ancient avatar<br />
ancient scrouge of nife<br />
<br />
Fandain Wolfcaller</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">5k for regrowth<br />
<br />
dont even consider the other spells as viable. 99% positive they are no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ancient spells don't drop right now.<br />
<br />
Also 99% sure when they do finnaly put them in for drops... they will be no-drop items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Paid 1k for Regrowth of dah kura last week.<br />
<br />
I always have the spell memmed.  Costs me one blue bubble to cast and lasts about 30 minutes.  Awesome spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1k for regrowth (paid 1k for form of the great bear and 500pp for cann4 at the same time as well, was like Christmas early!!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's basically free, because you can just go get it yourself with a single group.  It's not a rare drop at all.  When you enter Ssra, head straight in through the middle door.  Go all the way down to the first T-intersection.  To your right is a room with 3 snakes.  One of these is the ph for the Magistrate, who's a good source of spells.  To the left is another group of 3, and the locked door leading to the assassin area.  Pull these two rooms and any other casters you find in the area.  The casters are the ones who drop spells.<br />
<br />
Nothing between the zone-in and this intersection sees invis (except the guard in the far right of the first room, but he won't see you anyway).  So, cr is pretty simple as well.</div></div><hr />
