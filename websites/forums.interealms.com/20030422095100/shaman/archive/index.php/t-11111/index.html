<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shanelle Heartogold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've heard rumors that the skill cap that applies to alchemists who are level 60 and below may not apply above.  Have searched the forum here but not seen anything on it.  If it's possible for me to hit 200 skill (which is apparently the hard cap) at level 61, I'd dearly love to know about it... but I don't feel like wasting tons of plat if it's not do-able.  Anybody have any hard facts about this, or is it just rumor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The cap at 56 is 160.  At 57 it is 165 and 58 is 170.... At 60 it is 180 or 200.  Not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just get up to 64 and you'll definately be able to hit the hardcap of 200</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At 60 cap is 180.  61 is 185.  At least, I've not been able to go beyond those points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Skill cap = (Level-24) * 5<br />
<br />
Theoretically a level 65 shaman should be able to get their alchemy skill up to 205, but I believe there is a hard cap at 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never heard that rumor. Someone's making stuff up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That rumor exists because of something a person from SOE/VI said at a fanfaire late last year.<br />
<br />
They said that the cap comes off at 65. The currently available evidence is that they didn't have clue 1 as to what they were talking about when they said that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Problem is why get skill up to 200 or even over it? =(<br />
186 here making hawk eye potion and it DOES NOT stack with ranger self buff..<br />
breeze and resist potion? yea right if it last as long as c3 (or at least as c4) and I wasnt born with a silver spoon in my hand, 50 to 100pp a shot? gate to nexus and buy a c3 is cheaper</div></div><hr />
