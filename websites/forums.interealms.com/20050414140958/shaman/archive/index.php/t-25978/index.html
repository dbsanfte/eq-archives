<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I signed up for a Station account when I got EQ2.  My free month is now over and the Station access has kicked in.  While it has only been a few months since I was last in EQLive and I'm sure I can figure out what I've missed, it's been quite a while for a few of the other games.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on where to start on what has changed in SW:G since about six months after release?  How about Planetside (that one didn't even last its free month)?  Is there any point to even thinking about any of the expansions for these games?  Are Cosmic Rift, Tanarus or Infantry Online worth checking out?</div></div><hr />

If you play more than 1 game, then the All Access is worth it. I got tired of SWG really fast because there was no challenge after getting my character to Master Teras Kasi Artist/Master Ranger with over 1 million credits in the bank. However, with the Jump to Lightspeed expansion, it makes SWG the game I thought it should have been at release. <br />
<br />
The space combat is separate from your regular skills and doesn't cost skill points, just space combat experience. If you ever played X-Wing, Tie-Fighter, or X-Wing vs. Tie-Fighter and enjoyed it, you will probably like JTL. I have just been doing the missions and killing NPC pirates to get my space combat experience and haven't jumped into PVP yet. Even without PVP, it is really fun.<br />
<br />
Planetside has had a total revamp, but I haven't played it since the beta (but have some friends that do). Since you can get the basic game for $10, I was thinking of trying it since I've got the All Access Pass.<br />
<br />
EQ2 has had a lot of changes, but I still can't get into it the way I can get into EQ.<br />
<br />
Have never played Tanarus or Infantry online...but EQ1 and SWG makes the Pass worth it, since it's $21.95 and I still have access to EQ2 if they really do make it worth playing.</div></div><hr />
