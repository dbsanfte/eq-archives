<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My last group was 2 palys 2 rogues a bard and me as shaman. <br />
<br />
First things first. Palys RULE!  shaman if you going to be slower and healer for a ldon group bring at least one paly. <br />
<br />
That being said our DPS was insane we flew though 2 missions only takeing 30 mins each. <br />
<br />
In LDON dps is key so just grab a paly a bard ranger maybe for track and some more melees and go to town. <br />
<br />
After thought .. necros are prety good to have also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sticky, what dungeon did you do?  I imagine MM would be good for a pally due to the amount of undead flagged mobs.  They would be less effective against the orcs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">been finding out thats its all about dps and good CC. Its pretty tight to root park stuff in the dungeons and most people arent smart enought to work with a root parking CC method. I'm still looking for the dream dps group. Will try the aboe suggestion, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes was MM. but the palys are mainly for helping heal. <br />
<br />
Once you slow everything you can heal no problem but if stuff gets sticky you want palys there to back you up.<br />
<br />
but with that dps im sure we could do any dungoen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Any Ldon group with a shaman in it is a dream group.<br />
<br />
We can do it all.<br />
<br />
Root park adds - just slow and drag em away from group, root em<br />
<br />
Assist ma and slow<br />
<br />
Back up heal<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did a MM 4 man group with 65 Shaman, 65 Necro, 65 Wizard, 65 Warrior.  Finished in an hour at normal setting.  I lost Virtue ten min into adventure and Tank lost his shortly after.  Q and Cann 5 ruled the day.<br />
<br />
Was quite fun IMO.<br />
<br />
Granted, not optimal, but it tells me that LDoN doesnt have to be all DPS to get your points.  This rush rush rush attitude which is now the norm for groups in LDoN is getting old real fast.  Give me BoT over some dork who cant be happy with finishing the adventure as a win but rather wants to see some speed record set.  No thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do you get more points for a 4 person group compared to a 6?  Just wondering if the points are set per adventure, or per person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Best groups I have had so far were...<br />
<br />
Me (64 shm), three SU3 Pallys, Druid, Ranger in Mistmoore, wow was that a blast :)<br />
<br />
65 Warrior with 300aa, me, 2 65 Rogues, Druid, Wizard. This group just rocked.<br />
<br />
In my experience, the optimal heal/slow partnerhips are Shaman/Druid, Enchanter/Cleric. Cleric and shaman only seems to work to full advantage with undead heavy dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cebilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The most fun group I have been in was me, 3 65 SKs, 65 Cleric, 65 Wiz in Tak - we tore through the dungeon. Because of their mana drain spell I was FM all the time even with slowing, nuking, buffing etc, I was meleeing most of the time too - it was a damn good group ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman is really not ideal for most LDoN groups, at least on normal difficulty, since beating the dungeons is all about DPS. Bard or beastlord slow is plenty sufficient and bards provide CC and good DPS, while beastlords are great DPS and two strong tankmezzers. Ideal group would probably be something like bard, tank (definitely paladin with SU3 for undead dungeons), druid, 3 heavy damage dealers (rogue, magician, ranger, beastlord, wizard). The only way I can usually justify my place in an LDoN group is by acting as puller, since I'm lower DPS than anyone else.<br />
<br />
And the reason why people want to finish quickly is not to set some record, but so that they can go do another adventure. It makes sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dream group?  2 65 clerics, 3 65 pallys and an SK in MM.  Dream group with me in it, 3 pallys, 2 sk + me.<br />
<br />
Just finished a slaughter one there with a SU3 pally, SU2 pally, cleric, ranger, wizzy, me.<br />
<br />
Cleric was LD for half the mission and we still finished with like half an hour to spare, no ubers in the bunch.  Pallys are sick, I saw the SU3 pally get several hits in excess of 4k. /bog</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The best thing you can do for your group as a shaman is pull with slow ;)    You're going to get adds anyway, its best to have at least one mob slowed on incoming and root park/slow the rest.   I have been keeping mobs in camp the entire time doing this and have had zero complaints.   Just make sure you throw in some nukes for a bit of added dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Anyone who knows how to root park<br />
<br />
can mezz<br />
<br />
for all practical purposes it's the same thing imo<br />
Problem is most people I group with have no idea how to do it.<br />
<br />
BL's can slow yes but they can't heal when things get out of whack.<br />
Bards same thing, can't give you hp fast when you need it.<br />
<br />
Group:<br />
<br />
1. Pally - for pacify, to pull and tank/group heals if needed and LOH!<br />
2. Shaman - to slow/root park/dot/back up heals/buffs<br />
3. Cleric - heals <br />
<br />
4. Necro - dps, twitching, pet, mez, root wow they do it all<br />
<br />
Honestly in a perfect group I would take 4 necros a shaman and a pally.<br />
<br />
But for the sake of discussion going with 6 different classes.<br />
<br />
2 last spots any additional dps over pally and necro<br />
<br />
Preferred<br />
<br />
5. Beastlord - pet can offtank<br />
6. Wizard<br />
<br />
Yup pretty ideal imo. <br />
<br />
<br />
Biggest problem I have found is that MOST people do not get adequate mana regen buffs for the adventure and they simply cannot keep up with the time limits imposed.<br />
<br />
We as a group don't have the time to wait for someone to sit and med.<br />
<br />
I ALWAYS get KEI for 14 mana, POTC or 9 for 6/8 mana and Kitty Crack for 9 mana = 31 mana per tick. It almost lasts as long as the instance does.<br />
<br />
But like I said most of the time were about ready to go or were half way into the dungeon and the cleric or the druid or some other caster will go oops my kei just ran out.<br />
<br />
BOGGLE<br />
<br />
Man regen slows the group down, I don't get why people aren't buffed and ready to go, it's almost like an afterthought, to me mana regen is like my armour - its on.<br />
<br />
Having said that.<br />
<br />
In practise I'll group with anyone who has shown that they can play their class well.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure you get the same pts regardless of grp size.  I think the points are based on the average grp lvl and the difficulty level chosen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I can't imagine any dream group that doesn't include a paladin, necro and AE slower. And I'm not restricting it to undead-only. <br />
<br />
Paladin: Snap aggro, pacify, wave heals, heals, tank, brells, stun (gate/ch mobs)<br />
Necro: twitch, root, snare, pet DPS, dot DPS, lifetaps, VERY GOOD TARGET HEALS, group atk tap, group hp tap, group mana tap, mez undead, slow undead<br />
AE slower1 - Bard: best puller, overhaste, atk songs, crack/regen, AE slow<br />
AE slower2 - Shaman: heal, root, haste, regen, buff, cann, best AE slow<br />
<br />
Don't even bother arguing that a necro is an amazing healer in LDoN. If you argue, then you haven't grouped with an amazing one. Zevfeers/bonds with slowed mobs that last &lt;1min = sufficient heal. Esp with regen buff or bardsong. I remember once when one person went LD, and the druid died. Was only 4ppl: bard, necro, monk, sk. We continued clearing 20 mobs till druid came back, looted, mezzed etc. And I wasn't single pulling either: 3 at once was np with only necro healing, was 0 downtime.<br />
<br />
Also, unbeleivably, a monk is better than a rogue in LDoN. FD Puller, Offtank ability and mend &gt; slight more DPS and pathetic chest rewards. Also mobs get walled half the time, so it's chaotic stab as often as backstab.<br />
<br />
Enchanters (why mez?), Clerics + warriors fare the worst in LDoN IMO.</div></div><hr />

Since when are pallys known for their dps?<br />
Yes I enjoy having them in the dungeon groups but not for their damage, they are uber agro holders for the other dps dealers.<br />
<br />
  Best group so far, Monk, Ranger, Paladin, Beastlord, enchanter and Cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ment to that should be your group. No cleric take a paly. <br />
<br />
Well thats what I like to take anyway.  Paly is good healer and has some dps vs cleric with low dps. Think you misunderstood me ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hi there,<br />
<br />
Well, with 226aa's and counting I prefer one of two types of groups.  The aa's help to keep things going (and ft12).<br />
<br />
Easy group is a good pulling enchanter, me (shaman), tank (whatever), and 3 dps.<br />
<br />
Just a little more risky but a touch faster is me (shaman), tank (whatever) and 4dps including at least one who can offtank.<br />
<br />
Just keep Q on whoever needs, quick heals every once in a while, slow everything and nuke nuke nuke.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine that there is a faster type of group and I do it with pickup groups or guild groups (whatever).  The only hard thing in pickup groups is to convince peeps not to be chicken and to do the complete zerg.<br />
<br />
We usually do dungeons in about 41-43 min. and this is not usually with elemental equipment.  And it doesnt matter what tank you have despite what the whining warriors would lead you to believe - in fact after 50 dungeons done I would even say that ae taunt might put warriors on top (except in undead dungeons where pally dps is pretty hard to beat).<br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />
<br />
Purdypog<br />
<br />
PS: Other groups are fine (with cleric/druid) but just not as fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">This is just my opinion, but people have been saying this is the expansion that makes a chanter a necessity again.  Personally I would much rather ditch an enchanter for a competent shaman.  The simple reason is mezzing mobs slows you down big time, with a shaman slow tanking there is 0 downtime or dps lost due to the tank having to get aggro before breaking mez, then the mob ping-ponging between peeps if he didnt get enough.  Sure I'm biased towards shaman, but hell, they rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Stickygoo Onjooshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I like to look at each group member and see some dps .. chanters got none. clerics have low dps. But i love seeing them melee =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've found myself in all types of groups.  In a guild group with a guild tank,  I don't even need to slow anything.  Even in a partial guild group, I hardly ever malos (it's just a mana drain when mobs die quickly... and in all 5 dungeons mobs slow 80+% of the time on first cast).  <br />
<br />
I agree with the poster who said shamen are the ideal pullers in LDoN.  Pull with slow and root/queue mobs.  Or drag onto 1st target (if close and still reasonable health) and tears.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;dream group&quot; goes, my answer would be, anything with charm.  Did Tak with a mage-charmed elemental thingie and finished mission in 22 minutes.  Normally, you pay an xp penalty for charm, so it has a downside.  In LDoN, there is NO down side to charm; it simply helps you finish missions much faster.<br />
<br />
Outside that, pally-pally (both with su3)-wiz-wiz-rog-me in Mistmoore.  Talk about dps.<br />
<br />

<br />
*stifled giggle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Really the only other class I really wanna have in the group is a bard.  Bard and shm can take care of pretty much anything that needs to be done.  Add some filler and we're ready to roll.  As much as I play with them....I still hate bards....h8....-HATE-!<br />
<br />
The quickest group we were in had 2shm bard sk rog mag, all 65 the bard is a little light on gear and AA (one of our buddy's twinks) but everyone else was in ele gear with solid aa's.<br />
<br />
We had no more than started a collection (28 skulls or some crap) when we get a broadcast: server bouncing in 15.  We pushed hard, both shm pulling however many, nothing get's mez'd unless it's a healer and everyone just went to work.  They gave us 20min and we had no more than got the victory message and she bounced.  That was a blast, we finished the mission in 25min.<br />
<br />
Some of the funnest groups I've been in have had 2shm in them.  Usually both of us pull 3-4 and do whatever with them.  The bards/enc don't try to mez unless it's a healer.  We dot the hell outta them and just keep the chaos rolling.  Mobs all over the place, and melee moving to whatever mobs.  Everyone is busy, everyone is working at close to their potential/ability and we're knockin out missions quickly.<br />
<br />
I do kinda like this expansion.  There are several things about it that piss me off but the &quot;fun&quot; factor seems to be there.  Outside of our raids my play time has been severly curtailed due to real life issues.  With this we can log in, knock out a mission in under 45min and feel like we've accomplished something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Just to battle one point of misinformation:<br />
<br />
Root parking is very good, but it's not mez'ing. Shamans can do wonderful Crowd Control on melee mobs, but they can't do everything. The one gaping hole they have is dealing with casters, especially in trying to CC casters. <br />
<br />
I know most all of you know this, but yet there are statements in this thread like &quot;shamans can do anything&quot; and that root parking is as good as mez. As the player of both a shaman and a bard, it's not. I CC well as a shaman, but I do it much better as a bard. <br />
<br />
Some small piece of my bardic soul does cry, however, every time my shaman slows something for 6 minutes or roots it for three. ;)<br />
<br />
As a side question: do shamans have ANY spells that interrupt casting? Maybe one of the newer nukes does (although I doubt it). I'd love something that has a noticeable chance to interrupt heals or gates with my shaman, but I don't think we have it (I'm not even a race with slam). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The only guaranteed interrupt we get is - as a large race - Slam.<br />
Unfortunately you are not, so there is another possibility.<br />
<br />
I noticed that any of our Poison Dot Line has a chance of interrupting spells. I did some testing in OS and in PvP back then and saw that I managed to interrupt about 50 % of the gaters with a low lvl Poison dot.<br />
Why doesn't it work always? My bet is although it isnt a stunlike interruption, it has to do with a pushback effect.<br />
<br />
Try it out.<br />

<br />
My most amazing group to date has been me, mage, necro, chanter, wizard, SK.  In Miragul's of course.  *grin*  Aggro lock was instant.  Damage was ridiculous.  Q was sufficient for healing on all but 2 or 3 pulls (and for the pulling chanter, of course).  I was insanely busy the entire time, and needed a shot at the end, but it was a whole lotta fun.<br />
<br />
Having a cleric OR chanter OR bard is fine, but there's no reason we would ever need more than one of those in our groups.  I'm very much enjoying the seat-of-your-pants-ness of this expansion in diverse group makeup...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Chanters top nuke: 1100, Our top nuke: 925.  Neither of us can claim to be big dps producers.<br />
<br />
I would say, Pally, Rogue, Chanter (or shaman), Cleric, and 2 of either: Mage or Necro.  I only include the rogue if you want to open chests and scout for loot dropers.  Otherwise throw in a 3rd pet class.  Enchanter can slow, but won't need to with that group, his biggest role is mana regen and haste for the dps machines. The best dps groups I have been in have always had high level/aa mages or necros, their pets do more dps than many melee plus they nuke and dot etc.  SU3 pallies must be sick in Mistmoore though.<br />
<br />
I prefer non-chanter groups myself, there is too much redundancy when you have both shaman and enchanter.  Mez is nice for big overpulls, but I think those are the most fun part of LDoN.</div></div><hr />
