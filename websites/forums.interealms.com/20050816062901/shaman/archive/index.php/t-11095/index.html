<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hmmm....... got the message that the Account Key is active??<br />
<br />
Grrrrrr am so irritated! How can my Account Key be active when I cancelled this account 10 months ago!?<br />
<br />
I just hope it's some computer admin error and they forgot to tag it as inactive, as there was no debit to SOE in my credit card statements.<br />
<br />
Already sent 2 emails to SOE and hope to get clarification soon.<br />
<br />
Just want to know if anyone else experienced a similar situation and what was the solution if any.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Were you trying to start a new account with your previously used CD key? If so, why didn't you just update the old account and use it? If you sold the old account though, you sold the CD key with it. You'll need to buy a new CD key + expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
No I have not and will never sell any accounts I have. I just cancel them and either let them die or maybe one day reactivate them, like this one.<br />
<br />
How do you reactivate the old account? I tried typing in my old station name and password but it said the account was not activated and asked if I want to reactivate it. I did exactly the same thing with the other account I reactivated and had no problems.<br />
<br />
Hit the now button and brought me to the New Account window. I filled up the info requested for and thats where I came to this problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can't make a new account with an existing cd key.  You have to log in with your old account info and re-enable it.  If that doesn't work, then you'll need to contact SOE to find out why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes I figured out as much after the first post but how do I log in with my old account info?<br />
<br />
I didn't see any buttons indicating such. Maybe when I get back home I will try again.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Had the same problem with one of my old accounts I had setup for my brother MONTHS ago. You'll have to remember the accounts login name and password since the CD Key is already activated/associated with that account info. Once you do that it will tell you &quot;You are not currently subscribed to EverQuest. Would you like to subscribe now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just log in using the accounts login name and password. That's all. The system will walk you through the rest (resubscribing).<br />
<br />
If you don't remember the password, but the email on the account is still active, there is an &quot;I forgot my password&quot; on the Station's website. I used it to retrieve my old password.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well I finally got it reactivated.<br />
<br />
Seems I was by passing the &quot;choose a payment plan&quot; part cause I thought the EQ logo at the top left hand corner of the page was the usual SOE marketing spam lol<br />
<br />
Why couldn't they have made it fool proof? Dun they know there are many &quot;fools&quot; like me out there? :D<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help guys :)<br />
