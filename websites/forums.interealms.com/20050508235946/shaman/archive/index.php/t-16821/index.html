<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, before I start off I just wanna say this is a great site for shaman and your all alot of help.<br />
<br />
Now my question is my ranger is lvl 55 now, but will be 57 soon so i can greater heal and PL my shammy a little bit.  I was wondering what is some good equip to use up until 51 when i can get tae ew chain.  Ive never played a shammy before so really have no clue except to look for stuff with wisdom.  Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

Now I'll give you this one, considering it won't let you search for AC or HP :)<br />
AC AND HP &gt; WIS.<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Primarily, go to the bazaar and buy the highest AC stuff for him that you can afford. You can get some pretty good stuff for low prices on most servers nowadays. HP is secondary to AC for the pre-50 levels, and wisdom well below those two. You want efficiency, which means taking less damage. <br />
<br />
Something else that'll really help is a regeneration bp. Even an iksar ceremonial bp (5 hp / tick regen) will help a ton. If you have or can beg/borrow/steal a fungi, it'll help HUGELY, assuming your shaman isn't vah'shir and thus can wear it. <br />
<br />
A cheap horse or lizard would also help a lot, as your shaman can regain mana while getting hit (as long as you don't have autoattack on). You'll want to melee enough to raise one combat skill at least, but you'll have the ranger DS's to help with damage. Once you reach 34 and the shaman has a pet, you can likely do very well with the shaman sitting on a horse for mana regen, casting occasionally, and doing most of the damage with DS and pet. <br />
<br />
At L 45 the best thing you can have is a JBB. A JBB and a horse combined will you you level very fast, even solo, and even faster with the ranger to heal to let you canni faster. Come to think of it, if you could beg/borrow/buy/steal a JBB for a little while when he hits 45, just with the ranger snaring stuff for him, he could level superfast into the low 50's.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the lower levels, a good weapon will really help. The Rune Etched Icewurm Fang is just about ideal (12 dam 19 delay, I think?) for beating mobs to death through those first 20 or 30 levels. Or you can look for a good 2h'r of some kind, that may be cheaper. <br />

<br />
One more question....Whats a JBB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jaundice Bone Bracer = clicky 266 point DD Ice based reasonable cast, unlimited and combined with a Snare puller prolly the single greatest item you can use to PL past 52 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yzyh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Iksar breastplate + any fast delay 2hb.<br />
<br />
Iksar bereastplate with his 5HP regenaration a tick is just a good power lvl armor for every class that can use it but a shaman find it more usefull due to the fact we got canibiliz. I used my till lvl 50.<br />
<br />
2hb just bcuz they do more dmg then 1hander hehe and if your getting pl you will probably meleeing a bit.</div></div><hr />
