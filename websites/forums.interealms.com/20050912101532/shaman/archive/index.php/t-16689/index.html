<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First a recap on pulling the first 3:<br />
<br />
Necessities: full spell book, fire-resists over 125, and skills. If you don’t have skills you will  learn some here.<br />
<br />
Remember that the level 46-47 named element (a Lava Etched Doombringer) is a corpse spawn, so learn how to be full mana/HPs at the end of every fight. If he spawns use your fastest casting root to root him. After you’ve got a malosi on him he is cake and is nugget of exp!<br />
<br />
Pull order is the scorned element closest to you, then the abhorrent, and then the last scorned.<br />
<br />
My cast strategy: There is more than one way to fight the elementals, but my favorite is to pull with malosi, and use immobilize and time the cast just right so they will be rooted right in front of you by the zone. You do this by standing on the right side next to the right wall (facing the elementals from the gunthak zone into nadox). The elementals all path to the other side when you pull them. After rooted, slow, cripple and send in pet. For the scorned elements, hit them with plague at 80 percent and ebolt at 60 percent. You won’t have any aggro issues if you do dots this way (or even if you stick both dots at 80 percent with alpha dog). For the abhorrent elements pull/slow and cripple the same way, just use one ebolt on them when they are around 70 percent. The abhorrents resist more FYi (my experience) than corned elements.<br />
<br />
Now the elementals in the lava:<br />
<br />
Run along the right wall of nadox, when you get to the lava part look up and to your right, hugging the wall and you will &quot;float run&quot; across the lava to where you can run up on the wall. When you are on the wall of the lava tunnel take some time practicing running at an angle so you can run close to the lava and stay parallel to it. Use F8 to target the elementals in the lava. Sometimes you have to be close to the lava and have to look around at the lava to get them targeted. From there you have to dive to the bottom of the lava river and cast whatever spell you want to pull (I use malo cause I can normally outrun them back to the gunthak zone and root them before they hit me).<br />
<br />
FYI: Normally, after targeting and diving to the bottom you will have to swim down the river a bit until you can cast on the elemental.<br />
<br />
After you master F8 targeting, running on the walls of the lava river, &quot;float running&quot;, diving and pulling here is the strategy to pull the 5 elementals in the lava.<br />
<br />
Running along the wall on the right hadn side of the lava from the gunthak zone in to nadox....<br />
<br />
1. abhorrent element- You can target him a little ways down from where you can first run up on the side of the wall. After it is targeted, backup a bit, dive and pull.<br />
<br />
2. scorned element- You can target him from under the bridge. After it is targeted, backup, dive and pull.<br />
<br />
3. scorned element- You target it a little ways down after the bridge. After it is targeted, dive and swim up to the big rock in the lava and pull. For some reason you can target this one early, even though it is a ways down the river.<br />
<br />
4. abhorrent element- swim across the lava to the *other side* approximately where you killed the last scorned element. He is tougher to target so you will have to be close to the lava on the wall and be looking around to get him targeted. After it is targeted, backup, dive and pull.<br />
<br />
5. scorned element- he is near the end of the tunnel of the lava and can be targeted from either wall of the lava tunnel. After targeted, backup, dive and pull.<br />
<br />
I've been doing them since level 44 and they are definately one of the sweetest spots in the game at our level. Exp is good to level 54 as they start to go LB at 55. I really like knowing that we are the _only_ class that can pull all 8 before respawn. The elements do too much damage for any other class to camp all of them.<br />
<br />
I refuse to go to HHK.<br />
<br />
enjoy my fellow shamans,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only modification I would make here is to ensure that you do not kill mobs too close to the zone line. This is especially important for anyone trying this camp in their 40's still.<br />
<br />
The reason for this is that the named, as mentioned, is a corpse spawn. If you kill mobs too close to the zone in and the named spawns, that becomes his spawn point, NOT the spawn point of the original mob. If you are forced to zone out for any reason (or accidentally zone), when you zone back in the named will be right there at his spawn point waiting for you. You will be on your own trying to keep him at bay while you get your pet up to finish him off.<br />
<br />
I leveled here from 44-51 and learned this lesson on my first named spawn. After that I killed all mobs on the stones a little way beyond where the lava starts. If I was forced to zone on a named spawn I could then safely zone back in and get dog-dog up without aggro from the named.</div></div><hr />

too true. I soloed him first when I was level 46 and he was even to me, and was a close fight, but before that he was to tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nikkei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It seems that the doombringer only spawns from the abhorrent element, i´ve been killing them since lvl52 and  out of 10 times the doombringer allways spawned from an abhorrent.<br />
<br />
The lava engraved choker has been dropped all these 10 times and the 2 boots has dropped from the abhorrent one.<br />
<br />
Anyone in here has gotten the earring from the doombringer?<br />
And btw  doombringers lvl is 49-50 accordin to ilias beastiary :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Scorned is the one that usually spawned the doombringer for me, got quite a surprise when it spawned from abhorrent one day, didn't think it could, &amp; let myself go LOM :D. I've had about 3 or 4 pairs of boots, about 6 chokers, one firestricken stud. I'd say I spent the eqivalent of 2 full levels in the low 50's camping them.</div></div><hr />
