Ok so i bought PoP! and its cool! real cool! beeing able to travel from kelethin to erudin in no time! 3 zones away! cool! but then again... i remember when i started my first ranger back in 1999... a friend of mine who started a human paladin wanted to join me in crushbone... he died about 5 times trying to get from freeport to kelethin at lvl one... how times have changed... sad... <br />
<br />
well but thats not the point in my post (as you can see in the subject ;) ) this post is about playable races... i was in the great library for some site seeing... ok i saw some pretty odd stuff... kobold shamans? faun shamans? froglok wizards? well is that some &quot;look into the future of everquest&quot; thing? i mean:<br />
<br />
Everquest: The Legacy of Ykesha<br />
- Playale Froglok Wizards... check<br />
<br />
Everquest: The Dungeons of Norrath(?)<br />
- Playable Kobold Shamans... ?<br />
<br />
Everquest: Random_expansion_03<br />
- Playable Faun Shamans... ?<br />
<br />
i mean WT*? will we end up with playable orcs?<br />
<br />
im pretty concerned...<br />
<br />
what do ya'all think?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, it adds some diversity to the game(and extends its lifespan) but i guess, Frogloks are one of the more common mob type's(and they are somewhat humanoid) so the logical assumption would be they come from a common place (Frogton, Norrath) and hence they have the ability to become a fully blown playable race. I dont think we'll see Fauns or Kobold's anytime soon tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Giant race, i mean the size of hill/kale giants would be fun :)<br />
Defin need shrinking on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aluaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, I think I read that orcs will be a new playable race in EQ2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raytheon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want to play a moss snake. <br />
<br />
The Monster button on PVP servers was &gt; all :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Narreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd really enjoy a Gnoll illusion or playable Gnoll race. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I could see orcs being a playable race. They are everywhere. Would be great to start an Orc in crushbone and go kill low level wood elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>baelang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another vote for gnoll/drolvarg (easy to get illusion mask or playable race for ranger class)<br />
<br />
'ow bout dem dawgs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wish there was a high-lvl Orc'ish encounter so bad!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shadow men . . . <br />
<br />
Imagine seeing a shadow man ranger, wielding both epics; all you'd see would be the epics lol.  That'd be a great sight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Epiphany EQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Frogloks have always been my favorite mob.  Do a search on any enchanter board and you'll see that enchanters have been begging for illusion: froglok since they opened the doors to Guk.  It makes a lot of sense to add them as a playable race.<br />
<br />
Just because they don't appeal to you doesn't mean they are bad.  I don't much care for the way Ogres look now.  Diversity is great.  Lots of people will enjoy being frogs.<br />
<br />
My only gripe is that now that frogs are a playable race from level 1, it doesn't make sense to have Illusion: Froglok be a level 65 spell.  That's a bit silly.</div></div><hr />
