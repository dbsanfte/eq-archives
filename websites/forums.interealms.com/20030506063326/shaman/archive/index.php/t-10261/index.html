<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 54 iksar shammy, Farann (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=258245), w/o epic and duo with a 53 (atm) iksar warrior, Chagen (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=426123) . We are on Tallon Zek, in a one team dark guild atm, so many spots really aren't viable/worth it. We have moved out of CoM and are looking for some place new. I often solo with the Shammy in Neriak3q which yeilds excellent xp (did at 53 anyway, just dinged), but now he is lagging behind a little. We have tried solb bat area, ME toilers, cdok ent (groups), and maybe a couple more spots. I am under the impression that PoP really won't make a good spot due to the pvp aspect lowering xp. Would the Hole ent be good?<br />

Well, any advice would be great. The more suggestions the better, since many will undoubtedly turn out to be impractical due to server dynamics. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could try Neriak Commons guards near Foreign Quarter zone.<br />
<br />
There is a spawn of 11 (near priest of discord) that is suitable for your levels and if you are really careful you can single pull most of them (they only aid each other if they can see you). I used a monk for this but you should be able to handle 2 fairly easily. Note: they are highly immune to magic, root wont work and Turgurs is largely a waste of time. They dont have that many HP though so just bash them. EB works reasonably well as does Ice Strike.<br />
<br />
Just watch out for Draggon N'Retta...he is much harder. The zone is close if you run into problems. The guards are rich and drop about 15pp of gear on average.</div></div><hr />
