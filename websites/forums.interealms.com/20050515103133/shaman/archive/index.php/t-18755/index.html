Do you seriously ever run out of mana with cann4 and cann5?<br />
<br />
I know the only times i run low on mana is when i'm trying to root rot 2 Plane of Fire mobs at once</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not to be a smart ass, but what is the point of a better canni spell if never run out of mana now?   Except extremely rare cases I can't recall ever running out of mana on a raid or group.   Sure, I'll take it if we get it.  But there are things I'd much rather get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't know what you do on raids after malos/slow, but I do a lot more than just a nuke or two.  It's not so much a matter of running out of mana as it is getting carpal tunnel syndrome.  I am constantly clicking canni 4 in between just about everything so that I have enough mana to do what I want to do.  Right now I only have mana preservation 4, SCM, and 4676 mana, so maybe it's just my gear /shrug.<br />
<br />
In most cases mana isn't that much of a problem, but it does become a problem when we are low on clerics and druids and the shaman are relegated to non stop spot healing, or in those freak occurrences where your slows bounce non stop on trash mobs.  It may also have to do with my guilds raiding habits and attendance.  Most of our guild is elemental flagged, yet we have been spending as much time as we can in VT, thanks to us never having had a chance for it since early summer (Euro domminance), and VT has a lot of trash to debuff and slow continually (on top of spot healing).  Most pop fights are relatively short in comparison and either we win before I run low on mana or we wipe.  <br />
<br />
But I ask again, would an upgrade to canni 4 be such a problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Might want to consider that you never run out of mana cause you have naturaly balanced your mana useage. Its not a question of you never running out of mana, its a fact that you unconsciously know when to stop using it.<br />
<br />
There can be no argument made against the fact that we regen mana well. But i for one would feel better about my bad heals and high mana costing buffs and lower DPS if i coulds regen mana just a tad better.<br />
<br />
I can live with a DPS and healing upgrade coming through a slight boost to our mana regen, meaning, to raise my DPS i can cast more nukes or the same for healing. <br />
<br />
Simple answer to a lingering issue for many.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW click off your c5 and maybe lose some of your FT gear before you talk about never running low on mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right...just like every shaman in the game who is in EPs with similar standard gear?...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reason that most shamans never go oom is because most shamans know how to regulate their mana usage in order to keep it at a more or less constant level.  Every shaman debuffs.  Once you've debuffed the mob, what do you do?  Sit there?  If I'm exping I start dotting and nuking, and on raids I heal.<br />
<br />
I refuse to believe that any shaman can chain cast tnarg's mending and not go oom.  It might take a few minutes, but you will go oom.  Ditto for exp groups.  No one can chain cast spear of torment from start to finish of an ldon adventure, even with raid mana buffs and canni5.  I cannot do it, and I have FT15, preservation of xegony, a 6200pt mana pool, and 366 AA - this puts me way above average.  You simply have to pause, otherwise you are spending mana faster than you can ever possibly regenerate it.  Basically, it goes something like this:<br />
<br />
Cast Malos<br />
Cast Turgurs<br />
Cast Bane<br />
canni4<br />
canni4<br />
Cast Velium Strike<br />
Cast Velium Strike<br />
canni5<br />
Cast Quiescence<br />
Cast Velium Strike<br />
*mob is dead and puller is pulling*<br />
canni4<br />
canni4<br />
*mob arrives*<br />
Cast Malos<br />
Cast Turgurs<br />
Cast Bane<br />
canni4<br />
canni4<br />
Cast Velium Strike<br />
canni4<br />
Cast Velium Strike<br />
canni4<br />
*mob is dead, puller is pulling*<br />
<br />
so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
A lot of people say they do not use canni4.  I think this is just a poor decision.  There is no way anyone has the mana pool and regen to be chain casting at all times, so you have to have time where a normal class would sit down and med.  What do you do as a shaman?  Sit down and med?  You should be casting canni4.  If we had a more powerful cannibalize spell, we'd get more mana back during our pause time, thus we would have to pause less, and would be able to nuke/heal more.<br />
<br />
That being said, I do believe we could use a new canni (4.5?).  However, something like 450hp for 225 mana would be EXTREMELY overpowering.  I think something like 230p for 120 mana would be more reasonable and balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How about an improved canni spell with a longer refresh time...So we could greatly reduce the number of casts of canni, but keep our overall mana regen to a reasonable upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A lot of people complain about casters who overnuke, overheal, etc and run out of mana.  A shaman is in a position where you almost MUST learn how to regulate mana.  I know I dont run out of mana all that often(no cann5 yet), nor do those shaman I know.  Its not because of overpowered mana regen, its because we restrict ourselves in order to preserve mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally I'd like to see a canni 6 AA, something like 3k hp for 1.5k mana OR hastend canni V, something like 2min refresh.</div></div><hr />

In a hard adventure last night with me as slower, I was chain casting the pathetic Tnarg's in between Cleric CH's on every mob. I never got below 50% mana. But seeing how Tnargs didn't even fill one bar on the SK tank's health, I'd have to say we're more in need of a better heal to balance with that slow mitigation BS. We're priests, not mana string grabbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">3k hp canni would be pushing it a bit imo, sure it'd be fine for the leets with 6-7k unbuffed hp, but what about the rest of us?  I think the canni5 AA is great and has a fine reuse time, hp/mana ratio and amount - but I'd love to see a regular spell upgrade to canni4.  Admittedly this is in large part due to playstyle - I 2box on the same computer and so my mana regen suffers from lack of cannying while I get aggro, position mobs, etc.. with my SK in the other window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If they did add a new canni spell, then I would suggest something along the lines of 225 hp for 125 mana.  Thats about a 50% increase over Canni IV at the same ratio.  So it doesn't improve the ratio of mana/hp, but it does speed it up the same way Canni IV did over Canni III.<br />
<br />
As much as I'd love a 3k hp canni, I don't think it would be the best thing to have since there would be many shaman that couldn't use it without killing themselves.   Reducing the reuse on Canni V would be better imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd actually like to see a 4 k Canni. A 4 k Canni would be close to the 1924 of 2 1/2 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes yes more canni...Canni 6 spell would make life so nice. Getting to feel like I am using canni 1 all over agian back in the day. None stop clicking and all. Seems to me that when they upgraded the canni line it was to help us eliminate the constent clicky (canni dance)??? Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">on a raid, if I TRY to use up my mana, I will out agro the tank and wind up getting summoned and dieing.<br />
<br />
I naturally preserve mana for two reasons:<br />
<br />
1) To have the pool I need to draw from in an &quot;ah Sh!t!!&quot; situation...<br />
<br />
2) To stay out of agro.<br />
<br />
I can take agro from a raid buffed MT using Hate weapons with just Bane, Blood of Saryrn, and nukes.  Add anything to that mix and I'd be dead in the first 45 seconds.  Even as it is, I have to pause between casts to ensure I don't get agro 2-3 minutes in to the battle with a big raid MOB.<br />
<br />
However, I HAVE noticed that my VT staff increases the agro on my DOTs inproportionately to the increase in damage... however, I still love the damn thing.  *hugs his staff*  This could be the reason for my having to hold back some on casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Exactly. Its our role that forces us to learn mana conservasion. You cant play a shaman and go OOM especialy pre-60. You healing and casting those damn hastes every 15 min, you buffing and debuffing and slowing and sowing. These are all jobs that the groups wants going the whole time and if you run out of mana and go &quot; 1 sec i have to med&quot; your going to be a annoyance to your group cause they are having to pause for someone who is not the cleric.<br />
<br />
Pausing sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ghobster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">well i run out of mana pretty quick when i am main healer, i have to slow (given the chance to resist the damn spell by mobs), maybe multiple mobs pulled?, i slow the first mob then heal the tank with a heal that takes at least two or three to make it seem like you're healing, then you try to slow the second mob (resisted? try again cuz you know when you slow it you wont waste as much mana trying to heal the mt), canni, canni, then they askk you to rebuff them fully, yeah i run out of mana. what is your guys' secret to this 'mana conservation' thing?</div></div><hr />

This is why I don't dot trash mobs, and never ever use poison dots anymore.  I do more dps (higher casting cost in mana though) chaining rains with FOM3, and if not raining, just using SoT or VS.  One of the shamans in my guild said they have no problem stacking poison dots...I refuse to believe it for a raid scenerio.  Time and again I've seen another guild shaman summoned and killed due to stacking 2+ poison.  Only dots that are reliable are Ultor and Pox for bosses and for xp groups Bane (magic).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I know what my primary role as a shaman is and as we all know that role is rapidly blurring with other classes.  I try to make the most with I have, so I don't just debuff, slow and nuke once.  That is the reason I have mana issues.  I don't like having to pause all the time just to conserve mana.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Worlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My thoughts (some may say it was ripped from another thread, but i was thinking about this before i saw that particular thread)<br />
<br />
Cannibalize Master (Class only AA- 5/5/5 cost, Passive)<br />
<br />
This ability increases the amount of mana gained through the use of Cannibalize spells and Alternate abilities by 5, 10, and 20%.<br />
<br />
Would not add another spell to make it overpowered, but would address the issue of a little more mana from canni'ing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple enough - don't group with people, that don't care about their main healers mana usage or leave as soon as possible  :) .<br />
<br />
If you feel, you do everything right, ask politely for a slower pace or a different tactic (maybe a backup healer can assist a bit?) - once. When ignored 'forget' to rebuff. When still ignored leave.<br />
<br />
Edit to the original question: Sure i would love a updated canni, but at the same time i feel, we are going in circles here. We get better mana regeneration, next time our spell lines are nerfed or 'rebalanced', then better mana regen again? Guess what would be SoEs next action?  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Maybe it's time to slow down that madness and look at the efficiency of our core spells like slowing/debuffing, healing and perhaps a bit DPS.</div></div><hr />

Efficiency being the key word here and the entire reason we need an upgrade to canni somehow.  Our spells are overpriced aka inefficient due to having canni, forcing non stop canni just to stay afloat (unless of course you &quot;manage&quot; your mana by simply not casting anything).  If the ratios were more in line with the other priest casters that would be great.  I'm not looking for a more damaging nuke, larger heal, or shortened cast times, just a slightly lowered cost or raised mana regen.  We would not be taking anything away from the other classes and it wouldn't be overbalancing at all.</div></div><hr />
