<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ATM it's just me, a 53 Shaman and my friend a 45 Ranger.  From all the posts here I have a pretty good idea on how to take him on.  My question is The Advisor.  He has about 4 friends in the room with him &amp; quite a few in adjoining rooms.  Once I tag him we're going to have 5 mobs on us.  Some that cast.  Will we live through this?  Would it be better for me to solo The Advisor so I can gate out once he is down.  Can I take him down by myself?  If one gets away &amp; opens the door, 5 mobs have turned into 10, 15 or 20.  A lot of excellent posts on how to take The Black Dire down with minimal help, but it seems to me killing the Advisor without a full group is the biggest hitch.  <br />

Second time had to kill the advisor but we had a full group of 37,45,45,46,46,50 so I can't advise you on your situation. Doesn't hurt to drop by and just take a look.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also never spoke to the Black Dire...just had someone that was high enough to single pull after we killed the advisor.<br />
<br />
Had one group inside for advisor...and second for waiting for  the dire...30 minutes after he spawns he despawns I heard.<br />
