<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got my friend addicted to EQ and powerleveled his rogue to lvl 26 in Paludal then 27 to 40 in Mines of Nurga since my shaman wants chardok faction.  Stuff is still dark blue in Nurga but getting boring and wondering about better exp spots.  Would be tempted by Temple of Droga if mobs are higher lvl, but from what I have read getting out of Droga seems impossible without TP.  Still not ally to chardok after 13 lvls mostly because shaman was max kos to start.  Otherwise I'm familiar with Echo and will try the zone near Deep, the geonids in CC, and Sol B (sounds like the best exp).  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I tried Droga.  Exp wasnt any better and mobs were much tougher.  This zone seems strictly for farming.  Takes a long loop to go from zone in to zone out, at least an hour or two.  Cant camp out and come back in due to mobs every ten feet.  Mines of Nurga are the place to be for exp and faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">easier route in out of droga is to use the nurga zone in/out  ie the bottomn end of droga as opposed to enty exit at the top;  the ramp up to the normal exit has some pretty tuff mobs on it.<br />
<br />
Dorga is good exp if u are 40+ and partner some melee whos 60 and farming  faction drops.</div></div><hr />
