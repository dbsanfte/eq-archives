<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dargathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Firstly some background Info,<br />
<br />
Velium Hounds when they die either spawn  a Velium hound, or a  Glacier Mastadon<br />
Glacier Mastadons either spawn a Mastadon or a Bronti<br />
Bronti's either spawn a Bronti or a Crag Wyrm/Drake<br />
Crag's spawn 1/4 Hounds. Drakes spawn an Ice Burrower.<br />
<br />
Each mob can spawn a copy of it's self up to 4 times. <br />
<br />
As a ranger you have two essential tools to make your life easy. Snare and Panic Animal.<br />
<br />
Faction<br />
<br />
There are two factions that play a part in Western Wastes. Claws of Veeshan, and Ring of Scale. try to ensure you are at least dubious to both when in Greater Wolf Form (or wolf form) CoV can be fixed by killing in Kael, GD and EW, RoS can be fixed by killing in Mistmore. RoS isnt as important as only a few of the dragons are on this faction. CoV is vital or you will be getting adds all over the place.<br />
<br />
This guide has been written with COV in mind. it is possible to hunt the CoV mobs for great XP but thats for another guide ;o)<br />
<br />
Buffs.<br />
<br />
Given that this is not a level specific guide I'm not going to mention specific buffs. I would adives you buff yourself with ATK and regen in mind, also ensure you use GWF for the speed, and keep levitate memed. I generally hunt in WW for 3 or 4 days before going anywhere, and use 5 or 6 stacks of bat wings.<br />
<br />
Targets. <br />
<br />
The first mobs on your list should be the Velium Hounds, and Rogue Dire wolves. The reason being these mobs will agro on you from a fair distance. they are KOS to everyone, and a pain in the neck when they add. So scour the zone in a Z patten picking up any wolves you find.<br />
<br />
Technique.<br />
<br />
Firstly always travel Camoed and levitated. This avoids any nasty bumps on the head, and helps you avoid any unwanted friends.<br />
<br />
With the Dogies, get to about max snare range, and pull with snare. now 90% of the time this is also inside their agro range, if snare doesent stick dont panic, hit Attack and try the snare again.<br />
<br />
Once the Mutt is snared back up to max Panic range. then hit panic animal. once the animal is paniced then go chop it into tiny little pieces.<br />
<br />
Now sometimes you will see pack's of up to 4 Mutt's. this is because when a cragwyrm is killed it can spawn up to 4 wolves. splitting them is easy. Dont bother with Harmony, the max range of harmony is inside agro range of the dogies. <br />
<br />
For this get to max bow range, and shoot the closest one to you. Remember stay camoed untill you fire your shot. now usually you will get one Doggie. however sometimes you will get all 4. if this happens dont panic. hit snare straight away, the idea here is to make distance ASAP. assuming no failures thats one mob taken care of, run like hell for a while till you have distance on the remaining 3 dogies, select a new target and hit snare. Rince and repeat untill all 4 mobs are snared. this should give you distance between each mob.<br />
<br />
Now we want to get all 4 dead, and not have to zone. If you have survived the pack this long then you can do it.<br />
<br />
There are two approaches to this.<br />
<br />
Approach 1 (the one i use) Fear each mob, chop one to death. it's complex, hard to remember which one is which fear but it's ddoable.<br />
<br />
Approach 2. Run like hell in a fixed direction (say north) camp out. when you come back the 4 doggies will be standing where ever they were when you camped out. Snare has a habbit of stopping them from wandering off. Repull and snare etc one target, and bob's yer uncle.<br />
<br />
After all the Hound's are dead and looted, then begin to work on the Other animals. I prefer to get the Mastodons first as they give the greater XP return. then go for the Bronti's.<br />
<br />
Approach 3 If you have Endless Quiver, then you can bow kite all 4. pack them up as if you were quad kiting them, and simply launch arrows into the pack, your damage will be distributed amongst all 4 mobs..<br />
<br />
Once one begins to run, simply circle and finish that mob off, maintaining ground on the other 4.<br />
<br />
The risk here is ensnare running out, but hey, there is no fun without risk. (my best so far is 7 doggies using this trick took em a little over an hour with EQ and AM1)<br />
<br />
Note Iceshackle can be snare/bow kited even after the resist changes, Stronghorn and Tantor have yet to fall to my bow.<br />
<br />
Make sure you either have EQ, or lots of arrows before attempting this ;o)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sorronn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice info.<br />
<br />
But I spent a good 10 minutes trying to fear Icehackle and after it became apparent that it was not going to happen at all, I gave up and zoned after ensnare fell and I had to recast ensnare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dargathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Updated the info on Icehackle - Checked myself and it appears he's no longer panicable ;o(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Werin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi Dargathi<br />
<br />
Great job on the post btw , i have a few questions, is there a spot that you can safely  snare/fear to without  getting too<br />
many adds?<br />
<br />
Maybe i should say alittle about myself,  that right now i am lvl 60 ranger with Endless Quiver &amp;  am2 , cov faction is kindly (too many tov raids).<br />
<br />
Also you mentioned that when there is 4 dogs, you just shot  in the middle of the pack , or at one dog, and the arrow will hit all 4?<br />
<br />
Also how much exp do u get per kill roughly, right now i solo in acheva , but that can be slow, with the snare /fear routine sounds like that would be ALOT quicker!<br />
<br />
Also is there any faction loss to cov or ros, just curious!<br />
<br />
thx bro!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Norwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At 54 I spent 2 nights working WW (Forage on please for those Dragon Eggs) and it was work for the experience returns At 55 I returned and while it was much eayser (thanks Chloro, level, CoF) it was also not quite the Exp. As compared pairing up or grouping now. However I do see at 56+ it would be a good Exp Solo area simmilar to the SD at 48-52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanthie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A useful tool when hunting in these types of zones is the Pegusus cloak that drops off Quillimane in SK. -- not too bad of a camp -- on the order of stormfeather in IC, and has infinite charges of levitaion.  Wonderful until us rangers get ourselves SoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aaramis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tantor is unsnareable, but you can outrun him with sow... just keep it memmed for refreshing.<br />
Gives about 5% of an AA for the kill, and his tusk.<br />
Took me about 20min.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried Iceshackle yet...maybe this week ;)<br />
<br />
Ice Burrowers don't summon either ... a fun bow kite.  Gives about 3% of an AA per kill, and chance at silks (tailors will love ya)<br />
<br />
The hounds are still decent xp fear kiting, if you can find any up.<br />
They're farmed pretty heavily now.<br />
<br />
The mastodons and brontos... well, let's just say it's not that challenging fear kiting them when you can pretty much straight melee them down, hahaha.<br />
<br />
All in all, been soloing in WW for a LONG time (was first ranger on my server that I know of)...and I must say, it's a LOT more interesting and exciting soloing there KoS than when I was ally ;)<br />
