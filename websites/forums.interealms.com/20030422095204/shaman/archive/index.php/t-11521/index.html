<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would highly recomend that you not trade your jbb for an iksar child tear MQ.  Its really not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bah JBB is not needed<br />
All of us Iksar go our whole careers without one and Iksars rule!!!mwahahahahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually iksars don't rule, they stink.  /em holds his nose.  Phew! =þ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>chikasaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol. iksars rule majorly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, do try to hang onto your JBB.<br />
Damage-wise a JBB is better than Epic.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I would contact some 65 Shaman in the various uber-guilds (or almost-uber) on your server and try to find out how many &quot;have a spare tear sitting in the bank&quot;.<br />
<br />
You might find quite a few have them &quot;just sitting around&quot; for new twinks/server transfers/etc.<br />
I know my guild does or did til a server-transfer guy botched his epic TWICE... grrr!!<br />
<br />
Quite possibly they may let you have it for free or maybe just a few kpp.<br />
<br />
p.s. Barbarian &gt; all, though doing backflips when casting would own $$</div></div><hr />
