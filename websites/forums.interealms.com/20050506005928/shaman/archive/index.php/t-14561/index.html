<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If shamans were as desperately broken as the warrior class, I would hope there would be a thread (or ten) on every class site pointing out the obvious to Sony.  I'm even going to COMPLETELY ignore the fact that if you get a paladin, that means they're bringing Brell's, which means I can canni5 without any fear whatsoever, which is just going to HUGELY bias my decision on this score.  ;)<br />
<br />
Sticking to one shaman's perspective (lvl 64 casual bear), it's this:<br />
<br />
A warrior with Very Nice Gear can usually keep aggro well enough that I can throw on a dot, possibly a rain.<br />
<br />
Any joe-average paladin or SK can keep aggro enough that I honestly can't pull the mobs off him if I try.  This about doubles my damage output per mob these days, since with ANY form of outside mana regen in the group (or god forbid a chanter AND bard), I can't spend my mana fast enough.<br />
<br />
This means that, in my experience, if I have a warrior tanking, I spend a whole LOT of time with full mana, with nothing better to do with it than haste the cleric, since doing any more damage to the mob will result in my tanking.  This can be fun, but ultimately REALLY pisses off the warrior.  Which I can understand.  Poor guy's class is broken...<br />
<br />
With a knight, the mobs go down about twice as fast.  I'm double or triple dotting, the casters are chain nuking at 90% or 80% mana until the end.  Everyone is throwing out damage like there's no tomorrow.  Because they can.<br />
<br />
I know some VERY good warriors.  And they simply can't compete.  Top end gear helps, but they honestly don't have the tools available to their class.  I don't care how much DPS a warrior can output vs. a knight.  That's not why I look for a tank.  I don't really honestly much care how many HPs or AC they have - when was the last time your cleric ran out of mana in PoV?  It's simply taunt, and nothing else - which knights do better, but which is THE ONLY THING that warriors are supposed to have going for them.  (it's possible things are different farther on in the game - in elemental planes and such, but on my server, the majority of the population just isn't there).<br />
<br />
I'd feel bad about saying this out loud but the warriors are saying the EXACT same thing.  The parses and particulars of the debate are all over steelwarrior.com.  I just figured I'd get a feel for shamans' preference here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13986<br />
<br />
this might save you some time<br />
<br />
I still hold my opinion that warriors are not as broken as one would think, i belive the knights and the warrior are situational tankers and designed around that concept so that each can fufill a role.<br />
<br />
In the past a SK or a Pally really had alot of trouble getting a group, i mean who wants a pally over a rogue or a wizard or another DPS class if you have a warrior tanking right? Generaly you would sit around waiting for the warrior occasionaly &quot;settling&quot; to let the SK/Pally tank since it bear sitting around.<br />
<br />
Now the Knights are the kings of the EXP tanks, they have fast/high aggro spells that they brong to the table now which makes them a extremly viable solution for a EXP MT and even to some like most shaman, a prefered solution.<br />
<br />
Now the warrior lacks spells and relies on abilities and weaponry to boost their ability, its a different method to handle the same situation. Now i feel warriors are not broken cause of the exremtly easy to get weapony to get that is available for them. The hammer from the PoI dragon and the red epic or even a swiftblade of zek or something with low delay will bring sufficient aggro for them to be a excellant MA. they will still need to build aggro, but i feel the warrior has moved out of being king of the EXP tanks for a reason. Warriors are without a doubt, hands down the ONLY solution for a raid encounter, the defensive AA and other AA tips the scales so far in their favor that 99% of the time a guild would have to be foolish or just silly ( cause encounter easy ) to let a SK or Pally tank. Any serious encounter, any challanging situation is going to go to the warrior. This would be very unfair to the SK/Pally if the current balance was not in place cause again th SK and Pally would be kicked to the curb. Right now a balance exsists between the knights in the warriors each has a role to fufill and they seem to be built around those roles and perform their &quot; specialty&quot; well. Frankly i think its greedy of warriors to wanna be boosted up so they can resume their role a king tank in EXP groups, your putting 2 classes out of a job and making their lives harder and less fun. I think warriors need to appreciate the abilites available to them and realize just how good of a raid tank they are.<br />
<br />
my 2 cents anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">(it's possible things are different farther on in the game - in elemental planes and such, but on my server, the majority of the population just isn't there).<br />
<br />
Nah nothing different. wariors are broken from mid lvls till 65 and have been for a long time. Cmon verant get crackin !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gah, my bad, should've seen that in searching (though I'm interested to see if the percentage changes between that poll and this).  Knights have access to the same AA (and better) as well as equal armor (which also provides wis/int and mana).<br />
<br />
&quot;exremtly easy to get weapony&quot;... &quot;hammer from the PoI dragon and the red epic&quot; -- these are good weapons for aggro, but I may have missed where the warrior epic was easy to come by, or the PoI dragon became a wuss.  *grin*<br />
<br />
There used to be balancing factors to make warriors suck less.  Those aren't in place any more.  No more exp penalty for knights, no more superior warrior-only gear.  When Sony took over from VI, they forgot to clue them in about what was keeping the warrior class alive.<br />
<br />
(edit)<br />
*cough* And I don't believe it's &quot;selfish&quot; for warriors to expect to not be a detriment to XP groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">An uber warrior with an assload of AA is better than his knight counterparts, but for the most part, I usually prefer knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There used to be balancing factors to make warriors suck less.  Those aren't in place any more.  No more exp penalty for knights, no more superior warrior-only gear<br />
<br />
And that is the problem right there. The balance used to be threefold. Knights had utility spells to round them out but in exchange they had to deal with having lesser tanking abilities and they couldn't dual wield and often used a shield so they had lesser damage output, they also had the xp penalty as well. The &quot;vision&quot; may not have been 20/20 but it at least had a certain logic behind it <br />
<br />
Today, the knight classes have easy access to 1 handers with ratios comparable to 2 hander  ratios that let them both use a shield AND do as much damage as a dual wielding warrior. There's so many pally/sk specific 2 hand weapons with ratios as good as any warrior or even Monk weapon that you can no longer really say they do less damage than any other class... Cause they do. Then you add in pets/stuns/drain lifes/heals.... Warriors can't compete. <br />
<br />
The Xp penalty has been removed, the thinking being that at high levels All classes are equivalent... HAH ! <br />
<br />
As for Tanking ability, you get maybe a 200 hp difference at high levels between warr and knight classes, Knights had their dodge and other similar tanking abilities raised a while back... The difference with warriors gets even slimmer. And Taunt is a joke compared to the knight's aggro spells. <br />
<br />
The only thing that makes a warrior more desireable than a knight on raids is the defensive disc and I'd bet good money a lot of warriors would be happy to sacrifice it for some better thought out class defining abilities. There's no doubt in my mind that warriors need help right now. <br />
<br />
ps: And on a side note, I'd say Monks aren't far behind in needing a fix. Their role as puller took a serious hit when VI fixed the Lull line of spells. They've pretty much become a basic damage class but they're competing with Mages, rogues and rangers for group slots. Not to mention itemisation (particularly weapons) for the middle class monk has serious gaps in it compared to other classes.<br />

Didn't have too much of a problem with agro, except when I would dot the adds that I had rooted while the monks were finishing off the first one.<br />
<br />
I don't advise monk tanking without a cleric or druid in the group though.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jadii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not gonna vote for either, as I generally hunt in guild groups... and I can and have gotten agro from war/pal/monk trio :P  Brells is nice, but not something i need in exp groups.. but as i'm spoiled, i'll take it :)  I don't mind healing either *shrugs* we all do what we want to in the long run, and endeavor to be the best we can be... all we can ask of others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've never really have a preference.  I'll take whatever I can get.  I usually group with friends only.  Sometimes we have an sk, sometimes warrior tanking for us.  Either works fine.  The sk can taunt better, (should say MUCH better).  Warrior has around 1000 more hps or so.  Either do a good job.  Pros and cons.<br />
<br />
I do hope Sony looks at warrior's taunt though.  It could really use some work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Being a great raid tank is fine for the 5% of warriors that end up as MT for a RAID guild. Most of the rest of the warrior population finds themselves performing a job that a Knight can do just as well , offtanking on raids.<br />
<br />
In xp groups, which represents a significant amount of the game for lots of people, warriors are now without doubt the red headed step child class of EQ.<br />
<br />
Yep, I'm a retired warrior, now casually playing a shaman.<br />
<br />
Ssti hits the nail on the head with every point, I totally agree with all his points.<br />
<br />
All classes have benefitted from mudflation, but warriors have benefitted the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The biggest problem for warriors is the first 10 seconds or so of every mob.<br />
<br />
Doing something like giving taunt a minor EB element that only lands once per mob would do wonders to help this without overpowering warriors imho.  Just enough to give warriors a little headstart on the hate table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How about warriors getting a 'Grip' ability, which resets as often as Harm Touch (60 - 75 minutes or so I think).

<br />
you have *NO* idea whatsoever what you are talking about, do you?<br />
<br />
The reason warriors use duel wield is for *aggro* . Not because it boosts their dps by a ****load. Knights, dont use shield/1hander combo because it SUCKS for dps unless you are in the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Making a warrior's taunt *better* will TRIVIALISE a LOT of mobs. There will be *NO* reason at all to use knights again. Sorry, been there, didnt like it. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like SK/Pally (and even a smart BL/ranger) over a war in my xp pop groups.  Sure wariors have more hp, but they must use use 2 fast 1handers to keep aggro. <br />
In PoP this alone makes em take a LOT more dmg due to ripostes, where a pally/sk doesn't even have to swing to keep aggro hence take less riposte dmg.<br />
That plus the later slowing and almost no dotting/nuking make the war a worse MT for xp groups.<br />
I did HoH/BoT with a BL as main tank with me as slower and Main healer and didn't have a prob. to keep him alive.  Let his warder my pet and a rogue or two do dmg, and let him tank with a 2hander or don't let him swing at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not sure what version of EQ you're playing Gutrippar, but 2H weapons are preferred these days to 2x 1H weapons in just about every way. A nice PoP 2H weapon will out-taunt, out-damage, and let the Warrior take less damage in ripostes from a mob. Any Warrior worth a sh*t would be sporting a BoW over any 1H combination in the game, especially on a raid-level mob. <br />
<br />
As people said earlier (too lazy to quote anyone directly) the place Warriors are having issues are within the first few rounds while they're building aggro, whereas a Knight would just drop an aggro spell on a mob and have it stick to them instantly and permanently. I'll take a Knight over a Warrior in an exp group any day, if it was just a choice of class versus class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They have problem in the first round only if they have great weapon ,if not the suck all the fight.I have even see a necromancer PET out taunt a war (with aggro proc 1h weapon ! ) .

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">love having a pally in my group that knows what they are doing. they can take aggro immediately while i cast anything i want and not take aggro :)</div></div><hr />

I was in PoN with a SK, after about 4 hours, with me slowing/malosing on incoming, maybe cripple or dot right after, I got agro twice. I even had a little joke and told him he was slacking cause I got agro from a SK lol. Switch to when sk leaves, in comes warrior. I couldn't even malosi on incoming without getting the agro, even if I waited I was still drawing it. Mob bouncing around like crazy, very annoying, give me a SK anyday for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really a fair point, high end mage/necro pets can put out an amazing amount of taunt over time, remember that week straight after pet hate got revamped?  A groups mage pet was almost guaranteed to be the tank without fail.<br />
<br />
And yeah, a warrior with rubbish weapons will likely have trouble holding agro, but then again a knight with rubbish armor will have problems taking hits.  A 4.5k knight tanking in pov is a hairy thing indeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If shamans were as desperately broken as the warrior class<br />
<br />
The warrior class is not near as broke as you think.  Now if a warrior at level 60, spent as much plat on weapons as many shaman spend on spells, there would be no complaints really.  At lower levels, yes, warriors have problems holding aggro.  But that just goes to support that someone at level 50 shouldn't be XPing off mobs that hit for 400+.<br />
<br />
Warrior epic is easy to get, and it goes back to spending plat on missing pieces, just like other classes spend on spells.  If you expect to get all pieces as drops, then you will be like most classes that do the same for spells.  You will be level 65, and bitching about missing spells/gimp weapons/poor gear.   Only been on 3 Xana kills, and haven't seen the taunting weapon for warriors drop yet.<br />
<br />
If a warrior wielding a frostbringer/snowchipper expect to generate enough aggro, they are greatly mistaken.  It just doesn't happen.  But that can be related to a shaman in higher levels, just trying to get by with malosini, since they just can't seem to get malo to drop for them.<br />
<br />
The shaman can relate alot to warriors.  Both classes do great jobs with the right equipment/spells.  Sometimes you have to do something extra to get what you need to do your job.  So it really comes down to the issue of being a gimp warrior with poor equipment, that does nothing but bitch and moan about taunt being broke.  Or being a Shaman (or insert any other class here) that doesn't have malo/torpor and does nothing but bitch about spell drop rates, and how they can't do their job.<br />
<br />
Yes, warriors struggle at lower levels.  But with right equipment, they really shine at higher levels.  We even did the exe trial with a level 60 warrior, who was weilding epic (pally had to leave, with one trial left to do).  And guess what?  The warrior did just fine.<br />
<br />
Are warriors broke?  Nope.<br />
<br />
Are casters dependent on spells?  Yes.<br />
<br />
Are warriors dependent on equipment?  Yes.<br />
<br />
Not much more to say on the issue, except if they increase taunt, it overbalance the warrior at later levels when they have proper equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">*chuckle*<br />
<br />
Actually, I leveled to 60 side-by-side with a warrior, my RL mate.  We shared everything, and I can say with absolute certainty that he had, at 60, the same plat value in gear as I had in spells and gear.  While my shaman was a fine specimen of her kind (even in this garbage mishmash of Thurg quest armor and similar gear), the warrior - in, how did you put it?  &quot;as much plat on weapons as many shaman spend on spells&quot; (actually I'd given him a few Kpp for a new weapon shortly before he put his warrior aside) consistently was losing aggro to knights FIVE LEVELS LOWER.  Not to mention, he couldn't defend ME (which he rightly assumed was his job to do!) because it really was a crap shoot as to whether after a resisted slow or two (not to mention the odd heal), he would be able to gain aggro.<br />
<br />
My favorite quote, however, is this one:<br />
&quot;Making a warrior's taunt *better* will TRIVIALISE a LOT of mobs. There will be *NO* reason at all to use knights again.&quot;<br />
<br />
So what you're saying, is that if warriors have taunt on par with knights, the game will be trivialised?  Do enlighten us about how aggro-lock from a knight is so much LESS trivializing than giving it to warriors?  I'll agree that the aggro abilities on knights now are such that there's very little challenge to aggro management in XP groups anymore... but that's a different topic altogether.<br />
<br />
I suppose, in a roundabout way, it's better to sacrifice one class (warriors) so that two classes (knights) may prosper.  But let's at least not lie to the warriors as we do it and say &quot;you're fine, really, but I'll never group with you&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The point here is not whether warriors should get more taunt, or if knights should be nerfed -- I've asked none of these things.<br />
<br />
It's a very simple question - do warriors have ANY desirability whatsoever in exp groups based on their class merits?<br />
<br />
(have to take out of the equation for the moment guild and friend warriors)<br />
<br />
Comparing this to the question posted earlier, it seems as if either the gap is growing, or maybe more people are becoming aware of how useless this class is becoming.  Well, at least it's more likely (in theory) that Sony will notice and change this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I said Warrior because my wife is a warrior and I'd rather have her than some other pally/sk.  It ticks me off that pallys/sks can hold aggro better than she can, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The only reason I will take a warrior is because they are a guildmate. They flat out suck for aggro, and without massive aa's are completely inferior to knights. Of course, by the time a warrior has X amount of aa, the knight has 2X, because they get exp groups so much more readily. If a warrior spends X amount of plat to become close to a knight for aggro (doubt they can surpass), the knight can spend X amount on plat to become BETTER at tanking than a warrior. The only people who think warriors are fine are dealing with raid MT's, who have a guild's resources backing them, or warriors with a very large chunk of change to drop on hate weapons. Joe Average warrior will flat out suck in comparison to John Crappy knight. Devs admitted as much in the last fan faire that warrior taunt is broken. Its been 4 months, and I still havent seen a change. /defensive isnt enough to cut it in an exp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">On a specifically shaman level, the thing I've noticed more about Shadow Knights (haven't done too much much work with a Pally as MT) is that I can usually cast my slow as soon as the MOB is in range, rather than waiting for a aggro to build. <br />
<br />
The SK holds aggro better than any other class in my experience. Less hits on party=quicker pulling=more XP=WAY more desirable to a group than a warrior. <br />
<br />
Considering taunt is supposed to be the Warriors main attraction, if another class does it better then there's obviously a balance problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if a Warrior could taunt like a Knight:<br />
<br />
There would be no challenge whatsoever to those heavy and fast hitting raid MoBs.<br />
<br />
For example - my Paladin tried tanking a named rat in CoDecay with our VERY well rounded group. I was sitting at 7khps, had a rune on as well as an inctacast CH item. The Mob chewed through me in under eight seconds.<br />
<br />
Fast Forward to a level 62 Warrior, who had TEN HITPOOINTS MORE than I did ... and with /disc Defensive, we managed the named without too much of a problem. <br />
<br />
You may see a tank being played, you may live with someone who plays one, but until you yourself play a tank, you won't fully understand it.<br />
<br />
In that same regard, with the advent of KEI dispensers people prefer Shaman to Chanters in their groups, because they can go out and buy new KEI for three hours, but the Shaman Buffs are more of a bitch to replace - so maybe we should give Chanters Shaman buffs, to even that one out as well, right? To you, that's a stupid idea ... just like snap aggro for a Warrior is a stupid idea. It would overpower their class that, yes, DOES need a little help - but it's pretty frickin' funny ... because the Warriors in my guild always MA in groups, even when I'm there, even in T3. You know why? A GOOD WARRIOR can hold aggro. <br />
<br />
/em kicks the dead horse some more<br />
<br />
Right now, Warriors are whining and bitching because they're not the kings of Raids *AND* EXP groups like they used to be. My Paladin lived thrpough the Kunark Nerf, and anyone who says &quot;It won't be like that&quot; gets a resolute /rude and muttered string of explitives in greek that you wouldn't want to translate, for your own good. <br />
<br />
Why pick a Knight if a Warrior can snap aggro, has more HPs and can /disc defensive to take half damage?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Being a great raid tank is fine for the 5% of warriors that end up as MT for a RAID guild. Most of the rest of the warrior population finds themselves performing a job that a Knight can do just as well , offtanking on raids.<br />
<br />
In xp groups, which represents a significant amount of the game for lots of people, warriors are now without doubt the red headed step child class of EQ.<br />
<br />
Yep, I'm a retired warrior, now casually playing a shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem with all the viewpoints is that the person writing the viewpoint is a different type of player. A casual warrior = piece of.. you can be a warrior and play casual and expect to be really good. But a casual shaman that plays once a week can become REALLY good. In bot I'd take a warrior ANYTIME over a knight because even a crappy 65 warrior can tank a named mini and give me loots, while a paladin and oh god no a sk will crumble most of the time... <br />
<br />
In tactics I'd rather have an sk/pal because his snare dot is very useful..<br />
<br />
In CoD I'd rather have a Warrior and possibly Paladin (not sk) because the nameds ust smash the sks to bits.. (under 100AA sks)..<br />
<br />
Try pos giants with a sk or paladin, 1 or 2 procs and their hps is nothing..<br />
<br />
Try pov/tier 1 where you kill like crazy and constant pulls, sks &gt; paladins and warriors generally suck..<br />
<br />
Stupid tallon zek has to be killed soon so I can know for sure, but I am pretty sure in tier 4, warriors really own all the other tank classes..<br />

anyway just a perspective, maybe not the right one, but mostly likely right =]</div></div><hr />

you have *NO* idea whatsoever what you are talking about, do you?<br />

The reason warriors use duel wield is for *aggro* . Not because it boosts their dps by a ****load. Knights, dont use shield/1hander combo because it SUCKS for dps unless you are in the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Making a warrior's taunt *better* will TRIVIALISE a LOT of mobs. There will be *NO* reason at all to use knights again. Sorry, been there, didnt like it.<br />

Any Warrior worth a sh*t would be sporting a BoW over any 1H combination in the game, especially on a raid-level mob. <br />

As people said earlier (too lazy to quote anyone directly) the place Warriors are having issues are within the first few rounds while they're building aggro, whereas a Knight would just drop an aggro spell on a mob and have it stick to them instantly and permanently. I'll take a Knight over a Warrior in an exp group any day, if it was just a choice of class versus class.<br />

Actually, I leveled to 60 side-by-side with a warrior, my RL mate.  We shared everything, and I can say with absolute certainty that he had, at 60, the same plat value in gear as I had in spells and gear.  While my shaman was a fine specimen of her kind (even in this garbage mishmash of Thurg quest armor and similar gear), the warrior - in, how did you put it?  &quot;as much plat on weapons as many shaman spend on spells&quot; (actually I'd given him a few Kpp for a new weapon shortly before he put his warrior aside) consistently was losing aggro to knights FIVE LEVELS LOWER.  Not to mention, he couldn't defend ME (which he rightly assumed was his job to do!) because it really was a crap shoot as to whether after a resisted slow or two (not to mention the odd heal), he would be able to gain aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
All else aside, you had torpor/malo/pox/vob/levi/eb at 60? cause on my server that's usually 60+40+40+20+10+10 = 180k Not counting anything else fos = 1k, khura = 10k pet 55 costs 2-5k, tae ew armors needed, wicked bone.. no way he spent that much money and was unable to taunt, please link magelo</div></div><hr />

Oh, you're right, my having VoB or Levitation really did have a LOT to do with my success as a shaman in XP groups.  *rolls around laughing for a bit*<br />
<br />
Before you hurt yourself fluffing up your plat estimate to even more ridiculous proportions -- you can't compare drop spells that I could (and did) get in XP GROUPS (yes, I was lucky to have such friends) to a drop from Plane of Sky (7th isle, is it?), queen in chardok, and the odd couple of dragon scales.  Finding a handful of people to head down to Seb Crypt is just a *tiny* bit different than navigating PoS.<br />
<br />
Saying that warriors should humbly lay down having any use whatsoever in XP groups in return for being the tank of choice for raid encounters and the odd BoT group (which if you're lucky, will drop .... a RUNE, for a spell the warrior couldn't care LESS about!!) -- I guess you just don't like warriors too much.  There are a goodly number of them cursing the day they GOT defensive disc.  And for damned good reason.  It's the red herring they've been getting slapped in the face with for a few expansions now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Basically it boils down to how the warrior/knight play their character.  I have played with some pretty horrible knights who I wouldn't trust to be able to take agro back after I cast slow (IE: a paladin who only casts spells to heal himself so he's just a self-healing warrior).  In those cases, I would start casting root as soon as slow landed.  There are warriors that I would gladly place my life in their hands because I know they are going to do everything in their power to keep agro.  But they also know that I know my class and spells well enough to know when to cast certain spells and when to wait a few seconds.  (IE: don't stand there and chain cast and wonder why I got agro)  Honestly I have a warrior husband and a paladin friend that I regularly play with.  I have the same play style with the warrior in duo situations as I do with the paladin.  I don't change anything.  Well except for healing the paladin once more than I do the warrior.  Outside of that, the spell casts are the same with the same timing in between.  Unless the paladin and I are having an agro contest, which btw, I can win every time ;)  We've even had an agro contest between the paladin and the warrior.  All they end up doing is bouncing the mob back and forth, spreading out the damage over both of them and leaving them both cackling at me yelling at them!<br />
<br />
In short, I would say that you needed 2 more choices in your poll.  1) Both and 2) Depends on how the person plays the character.  And yes, warriors do need something tweaked considering they have been passed over since Kunark for anything class specific.  The AAs they get are nice but nothing spectacular.  True they can get new weapons, but if they aren't in a guild that is able to help them get these new weapons, it really doesn't matter.  A lot of the warriors out there aren't even going to see any of the agro increasing weapons out there.  Why should they have to get a weapon to make them more desirable in an xp group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I have a 56 warrior i retired a few monthes back, mainly cuz he was on same acct as my shammy and I wanted to play the shammy instead of the druid I dou'd with the warrior. My warrior had full cultural, an rbb, and used a frostbringer/black blade of torment. I had no problems with shammys/chanters getting eaten, clerics getting eaten or mobs ping ponging around. I worked hard to hold agro, I used kick, disarm, taunt and would even sit down if I had to. <br />
Took about as much work as playing my shammy does. Really if a warrior is willing to learn how to hold taunt by making sure they have proximity agro, slams when thats up(big races) and all the other stuff they can do the job just fine.<br />
Pallies however kick ass in xp group. Sk's are ok, but they can be lazy, at least on my server. I had 7 different MT's in xp groups today. 3 SK's, 2 pallies, 1 warrior and 1 ranger. Was in Tier 1 pop, either poi or pon. Pallies were both awesome, Ranger was my dual boxed bitch, he did awesome, 1 sk did awesome, and the warrior I'd take over the other 2 sk's. I had a few 2 mob pulls with 2 sk's in group and later the same with 2 pallies in group. With the pallies i didn't get hit even slowing 2 mobs at once, with the SK's i managed to get killed once with only 1 mob in camp because they didn't want to taunt it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">By way of disclaimer, let me state that my main is a 65 warrior, currently at 40 aa and rising.  My shaman alt that brings me to this board is 53 now, and a joy to play, but at heart I am a warrior, so feel compelled to reply to thisthread.<br />
<br />
Over 110 people have responded to the pole, and of those, only 12 chose warrior(I was one of the 12, but I am biased).  This is not news at all to the warrior community.  We know, and spend endless hours debating what should be done.  We mostly agree on one thing:  The disparity of agro generation between warriors and knights is far greater than the disparity between ability to tank.  With the amount of damage a PoP mob can do, agro is the number one issue people look at when selecting a tank.  For this reason, there is a basic imbalance between plate tank classes.<br />
<br />
There are 4 schools of thought on a solution to this problem:<br />
<br />
1:  Raise warrior agro, either thru new skills, improvments to taunt, improved itemization, etc.  This is probably the most popular camp.  Detracters say that raising warrior agro would trivialize too much of the game, and rewards less skilled players.<br />
<br />
2:  Increase warriors damage absorbtion, either thru higher hp's, higher ac, better mitigation.  Detracters point out that this will do nothing to offset why knights are chosen first for exp groups.<br />
<br />
3:  Lower knight agro, most commonly by removing the ability of knights(pallies mostly) to use spells that will have no effect on their target(cease and desist for pallies, 15 mana and 25 mana spells, do not effect mobs level 55 and higher, but do generate significant agro).  Detracters point out that nerfing just sucks, and many believe that making the game harder is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
4:  Things are ok as they are.  People in this camp point out that warriors group every day, and with great success.  Detracters point out that warriors get groups usually only when their is no knight available.<br />
<br />
As you can tell from this, the issues involving warriors have been discussed, at length(with much namecalling) in the warrior community(among others).  This thread will I am sure be added to the growing list of similar threads we will point to when we say that our class is broken in relation to knights.  Now to respond to a few comments here.<br />

Now the warrior lacks spells and relies on abilities and weaponry to boost their ability, its a different method to handle the same situation. Now i feel warriors are not broken cause of the exremtly easy to get weapony to get that is available for them. The hammer from the PoI dragon and the red epic or even a swiftblade of zek or something with low delay will bring sufficient aggro for them to be a excellant MA. they will still need to build aggro, but i feel the warrior has moved out of being king of the EXP tanks for a reason. Warriors are without a doubt, hands down the ONLY solution for a raid encounter, the defensive AA and other AA tips the scales so far in their favor that 99% of the time a guild would have to be foolish or just silly ( cause encounter easy ) to let a SK or Pally tank. Any serious encounter, any challanging situation is going to go to the warrior. This would be very unfair to the SK/Pally if the current balance was not in place cause again th SK and Pally would be kicked to the curb. Right now a balance exsists between the knights in the warriors each has a role to fufill and they seem to be built around those roles and perform their &quot; specialty&quot; well. Frankly i think its greedy of warriors to wanna be boosted up so they can resume their role a king tank in EXP groups, your putting 2 classes out of a job and making their lives harder and less fun. I think warriors need to appreciate the abilites available to them and realize just how good of a raid tank they are. <br />
<br />
Several things here...First, warrior epic is not &quot;easy to get&quot;, the hammer from PoI dragon(Cord Hilted Spike Driver) is not commonly available to most warriors, and Swiftblade of Zek is a horrible  agro weapon.  Second, and the biggest issue here is that both warriors and knights have valid and usefull raid roles.  Different roles mostly, but both have roles.  To say that because warriors get the &quot;3 minutes of glory&quot; role due to /disc def for boss mobs is a good reason to make them last choice for exp group tanks is simply wrong.<br />

And yeah, a warrior with rubbish weapons will likely have trouble holding agro, but then again a knight with rubbish armor will have problems taking hits. A 4.5k knight tanking in pov is a hairy thing indeed. <br />
<br />
The issue is that between a knight ads a warrior with equivelent gear the agro gap &gt; the tankability gab, by far.<br />

Posted by Mardark:<br />
The shaman can relate alot to warriors. Both classes do great jobs with the right equipment/spells. Sometimes you have to do something extra to get what you need to do your job. So it really comes down to the issue of being a gimp warrior with poor equipment, that does nothing but bitch and moan about taunt being broke. Or being a Shaman (or insert any other class here) that doesn't have malo/torpor and does nothing but bitch about spell drop rates, and how they can't do their job <br />
<br />
Both Malo and Torpor can be obtained by single groups, for exp.  Name one good 60 + agro weapon that can be single grouped, for exp, at level 60.<br />

<br />
Many guilds now are using knight to tank during all clearing to boss mobs, for tanking any mob that does not require /disc def, and for many utility roles, not to mention off-tanking.  Knights are far superior to warriors in that role.  As far as the whole &quot;kunark era&quot; thing, it simply is not even remotly true.  Since then, the exp penalty for knights has been removed, defensive skill caps have been raised, many new class specific spells have been added.  Even if warriors and knights generated agro at the same rate(which almost no one advocates), knights would still be better off than in Kunark.<br />

I am too lazy to post links, but I can give you names.  Greatstaff of Thunder(2hb, has agro rated about equivelent to epic, with much better DPS) and Blade of War(32 delay, 48 damage, procs ebraging blow, considered currently the end all be all of agro weapons).  Also, Windblade and War Marshall's Bladed Staff are considered better agro than most equivelent 1 hand combo's.

Sorry about the length of this post.  It is an issue that is important to me, and so simply cannot resist putting my 2 cents worth in.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">At my level(56) I would much rather have a knight tanking.  As others have said, they have a much easier time keeping agro.<br />
The other night I was in a PoD courtyard group and we had a Pally tanking.  Everything was going fine, smooth, and constant.  Halfway through the night, he had to log and we picked up a warrior of a similar level(even higher I think).  He could only get agro halfway through the fights.  The cleric was getting frustrated because of all the bouncing.  The cleric and I got to talking and decided that I should tank instead.  I loaded up my 2 poison dots and slow of course and went to work.  I never lost agro and because I use so much mana with the spells, I would constantly canni down while getting beat on.  I would only need 1 CH near the end of the fight and would be near FM/FH for the next pull.  With me tanking, we were pulling at the same rate when the pally was there.<br />
Unless the warrior is realy well equiped, I'll keep the knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">This is a pretty loaded subject, really.  There is a LOT of hard feelings on the warriors side about this.  I have played both warrior and paladin, but recently erased my pal to create shaman.  My 'main' server is FV, so I had to delete him.  When I stopped playing my warrior, it was simply due to the fact that the class was not quite to my tastes, not to any concern over any play issues.  A melee class character is not conductive to a relaxed play schedule.  You must have a group at higher levels, and it takes time.  When its time to go to work, you leave, or get fired.<br />
<br />
Remember, this used to be exactly the opposite, and the warriors were the ones saying that the current state was okay.  As with everyone, what worked for the warriors made them happy, and if it made someone else unhappy, who cares.  Unfortunately, things havent been balanced, they have simply pushed the pendulum the other direction.<br />
Someone pointed to the old notion of a 20% xp penalty to hybrids as being fair, actually it was just nonsensical.  There is already a 10% xp bonus attached to warrior to help offset the fact that they do have limited abilities.  The idea was a warrior did few things, but did them very well.  Warriors work just as well as they always have, and knight spells produce the same aggro generation they always have, it just didnt matter before.  At that time, a knight suffered a severe dps disadvantage opposed to a warrior, he had a substantial hp disadvantage, and difference in gear.  Not always a large difference, depends on exactly what expansion we're using for a reference.<br />
Along comes pop, scourge of all classes (except charmers).  They overbalanced the power of slow by making mobs hit hard and fast.  But they overdid it.  The mobs hit SO hard and fast, that it suddenly became imperative that slow land AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Suddenly tried and true methods of aggro control learned through their eq careers were tossed out the windows.  Slowers had to stick a slow quicker, to avoid killing the tank.  Unfortunately, this often meant a dead slower instead.  In the past, a shaman could take aggro for a while, in anything less then a raid zone.  So the knights, mostly paladins at first, stepped forward to tell us a little secret, namely that their spells are aggro.  They had been saying all along, we just didnt listen.  It was a change in perception that gave knights the enormous leap ahead that we saw in pop.  They had been catching up for some time.<br />
<br />
Without precise aggro control a less than optimal group in pop would be destroyed, at first.  Later gear and techniques caught up and gave us the wide range of play styles we have in pop now.  But at first, you almost had to have a cleric, for instance.  But a cleric wasnt always available.  I know clerics complain that they arent needed anymore, but this is in part because of techniques learned in pop to stay alive when a cleric wasnt available.  As an aside, this is much the same reason that enchanters are unhappy.  They went off to charm solo, and people learned how to do without.  Now with charm nerfed, they feel like they should be able to find groups quickly, but people have gone on to other techniques, making them no longer required (but still nice to have).<br />
<br />
Two hand AA's and wonderful knight weapons were a way to somewhat balance the knights poorer damage output.  As with so many things in pop, it worked out differently than they reall expected.  At this point in time, a knight with the right weapons and aa's can outdamage a dual wielding warrior.  This is due to the fact that a preposterously large number of melee hits, hit for minimum.  Minimum is always 1+damage bonus.  For those of you who havent played classes with a db, a slow 2s weapon gets a substantial bonus at high levels.  If you always hit for min, hitting for 51 is vastly perferable to hitting for 11.  <br />
<br />
As for the person who thought a knight with a 1 hander can keep up with a dual weild warrior, all i can say is, its not even close.  Without the db and AA's, a warrior will completely dominate a knight in dps.  With them it can be equal.  A knight generally uses the sheild for resists, interrupts and ac.  A non-tanking warrior can again pull ahead by using 2h weapons.  But a tanking warrior is almost locked into dual wield to maintain aggro, reducing dps.  Bear in mind, though, that the knight who is tanking is also suffering from a severe drop in dps.  Anytime your casting, your not swinging.  To be honest, there is little reason for a knight to swing at all.  They dont add substantially to the dps of a group, and can maintain aggro with spells.<br />
<br />
So here we are, a knight can gain aggro faster, which is perfect for pop.  A warrior can take the hit better and take more of them, but you have to use the classic technique for controlling aggro.  Whats to be done?  If you give a warrior instant aggro, there is absolutely no reason to EVER include a knight.  Give a warrior a button to push to get instant, absolute, manaless aggro, and kiss knights goodbye, dont let the door hit you on your way out.  ANYTHING less and the complaints from warriors will continue.<br />
My solution?  I've thought this through from many different angles, and I cannot think of anything that will make warriors satisfied that will not totally trivialize the use of knights.  That being said, heres a few ideas:<br />
Taunt crits, give an AA to have a (2-5%)chance to give 100% of the mobs hate to the warrior, erasing the hate list except for him/her.<br />
Add some hate so kicks, so it can be built up faster.  You still need to hang a warrior out to dry a little longer than a knight, but a warrior will have another chance to build hate, not just aggro.<br />
Increase the chances for taunt to be successful by a little.  This does nothing to build hate, but taunt should actually work when you press it (sometimes).<br />
Widen the hp gap.  Add another 2 points to PE for warriors only.  Despite what has been said, there is more than 200hp difference between equal equipped wars and knights.  But it should be widened some.<br />
<br />
Sorry to be so long winded, but I like paladins.  It would still be my main character despite any problems if I were someone who spent hours at a time playing, and always liked to groups.  Since changing to shaman, I've grouped with pals who cant hold aggro and wars who couldnt seem to lose it, and vice versa.  Much more important is the person behind the box.  Bear in mind, knight was a VERY hard class to play in the past.  This tended to bring people to it who were patient.  Warriors tended to attract the people who wanted a short path to 'uber' (halfling warrior, anyone?).  This is changing.  You're gonna see a LOT of bad paladins in the future.  You are going to remember the good warriors with a smile while you curse the guy who just WONT stun to gain aggro.<br />
And, speaking as a former paladin (still one in my heart), slow is overpowered, but oh how i love it  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I agree completetly with Litgruv.<br />
<br />
Knight are the best XP tank, for the most part. Warrior are adequate XP tanks.<br />
<br />
Warriors are THE best raid tank. Knights are less than adequate raid tanks.<br />
<br />
IMO, Good balance. Without that balance knights would have no primary purpose in Norrath.<br />
<br />
Little story: <br />
The other day I was in PoV IC camp. Normally, I like to do this camp as the only slower, healer, and CC in the group without too much of a problem. Q really helps to be an efficient healer. In this situation, a knight really healps to get early hard aggro so I can slow ASAP and minimize required healing.<br />
<br />
Well, on this day, I was lucky enough to have an SK tank for us. This was an UBER SK from the UBER guild on our server. Not sure why he was grinding in PoV IC, but anyway...I literally did not have to heal him. I was shocked! I became the puller for the group so all mobs were slowed on incoming and I was root parking them as they were finishing up the previous mob. The only person I was healing was myself. No other healers in the group, all DPS. I think it was a mage, rogue, ranger and wizard. Every time I glanced at the SKs HP he was at 90, 95, 98% HP. This went on for about a half hour or so, but then I had to leave. After 30 minutes of non-stop POV IC action I never had to Q or Tnargs the SK.<br />

Am I the only one a bit shocked by this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gear use to be the balancing factor for most classes, since kunark that has all been pretty much thrown out the window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">IMO, Good balance. Without that balance knights would have no primary purpose in Norrath.<br />
<br />
No for several obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
1:  Not all warriors raid, nor should they be expected to.<br />
<br />
2:  If warriors are not needed in exp groups, how will they get the levels/AA's needed to raid.<br />
<br />
3:  By that argument, clerics, who arguably have one of the most key roles in raids, should be far from desirable in exp groups.  We know this is not true.<br />
<br />
4:  Knights have very definate raid roles, and in may guilds, that role is growing.  In fact, knights have a better raid role than a non MA/SA warriors in most raid situations.  SK's provide mana(thru &quot;mana taps&quot;), group buffs, and better DPS than warriors, not to mention FD pulling.  Paladin's offer less DPS than warriors, but do offer spot healing for some AE mobs, emergency LoH(ok, that is rare), stuns(some use in raids).  Both are very capable(preffered in fact by many) for tanking while clearing and off-tanking adds.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but the concept that warriors and knights are balanced because of warriors raid role is a complete fallacy.</div></div><hr />

From the sounds of it, you are not in a high level raiding guild, and while most of eq might not be doing high level content, it's the high level content that NEEDS to be balanced. Ie if the high end game is trivialized, then soon the game will be nothing... anyway ALL warriors should be expected to raid and built for raiding. What else is a warrior for? hmm.. I want to play a character that is not able to do much damage, is not able to cast any spells, just has a lot of hps FOR WHAT? You pick a warrior because even in a small raid to codB (yeah you can raid cod with a group of 6) you can take the greaters damage while a cleric heals you and some peeps add damage.. that's all you do in the game, that's all you are meant to do, RAID! <br />
<br />
Warriors ARE needed in XP groups, or at least tanks are and warriors ARE tanks.. go to CoD (hehe good spot to be a warrior) and wreck havok, go past the easy area rats to the DEEP rats where every 10 or so mobs is a named unslowable and see how good a warrior is! and how amazing the xp is! <br />
<br />
I have never seen a big raid where the sk FD pulled, I have never had an sk group buff me? dunno what spell it would be.. I have seen an sk give a WARRIOR SK aggro!! I have seen them debuff, and I have seen them HT (strategically) but I have not seen them do their mana thing (too much aggro? dunno but just never seen them).. they have their role. Paladins are the 3rd best healers in the game (wave of marr nuff said) nice buffs (350 bss).. and they can tank mez better than warriors and specially sks because they stun to take less aggro and can be independent of a 2nd heal source (they heal themselves).. <br />
<br />
Of course none of this would matter if warrior aggro was &quot;fixed&quot; the warrior would taunt some random god, go taunt all the adds while the clerics showered the tank with heals (not worrying about aggro of course the tank has all of it) the enchanters wouldn't even mez, they'd nuke the mobs because the warrior would have all the aggro.. what adds comming in from east side? tank_02 -&gt; /gu AE Taunting EAST side, heals and kills please..<br />
<br />
I like these chats personally, and I have a strong opinion when it comes to warriors and how overpowered they are when you are not just pulling a mob every 40 seconds.. <br />
<br />
I was xping in tactics today with my old sk friend, it was stupid, he would pull, I would chain turgurs until it stuck, then I would BoS while the druid and cleric and rogue and monk were all doing as much damage as they could, xp flew out the door, how RETARDED.. my little sister could do that.. do you really want it THAT trivial? I say we need to take LR5 AWAY from the paladins/shadow nights.. they are obviously sooo broken that people are complaining about warriors!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I could write some romans about that theme but ppl. would always come with the same arguments.<br />
<br />
1. Game would be trivial <br />
2. Nobody would take knights.<br />
3. Warr shine on raids / knights in exp groups.<br />
<br />
to 1. Raid<br />
When I ( gnome Warrior / BoW ..) am the MT agains a BossMob I loose aggro for some seconds one time in around 100 fights, maybe less. So where would the game be trivial when I could start these fights with a roundabout 500 aggro skill? Maybe the guild could start 3 seconds earlier?<br />
to 1 Exp.<br />
Aggro Lock is already there, used by knights. No warrior wants aggro lock. Most want a real chance to grab aggro early.( not the RNG)<br />
<br />
to 2 Raid<br />
Knights are tanking some Bosses in Time ... now Knights are best Add tanks ... knights are best Tanks on the move. Warrior tank the Uggly ones ... warrior do damage.<br />
<br />
to 2 Exp<br />
Knights would still be better at aggro. Knight would still bring in their spells and possibilities.<br />
<br />
to 3<br />
Bah lame .... where do the warrior come from on raids when they cant get groups? Twinks? Over all you would have 95 % Exp time and 5 % raid time. And there is only one Warrior on a raid to shine as a MT and more knights to shine as add tanks ...<br />
<br />
But the question to be answered is.<br />
<br />
How can it be that ppl. in a tier 2 zone take an unknown 62 knight over an unknown 65 warrior for tanking?<br />
<br />
And that is what happend now. And thats it where there is no balance.<br />
<br />
Btw. my girlie ( 65 monk ) tanks in CoD and Sol Ro Tower and Ele fire and BoT Minis and .... normally  with a combo out of monk cleric (2box) and monk chanter druid (3box), so don't bring stuff that these cant be tanked by a knight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">In POP:  Warrior used to be better, particularly if a named could spawn.<br />
<br />
But with LDON, Knight is far better.  Our warrior (65, 150+ AA's, good aggro weapons) puts his aggro stuff away and pulls out dps weapons so that the Pally can tank in LDON.  Warrior takes way too long to get aggro...<br />
<br />
LDON in many ways will remove need for warriors.  First, warriors are not needed, knights far superior tanks for LDON adventures.  Second, I have yet to see a piece of armor that warriors can wear that isn't all plate wearers -- and with mana.  So the warrior gets AC x, Pal/SK gets AC x, plus wis/int and mana.  Before long, the knights will have equivalent AC and hps.<br />
<br />
I know one warrior who would gladly give up defensive and evasive disciplines to gain a mana bar and taunt spells... assuming they don't quit in disgust before some sort of aggro fix is made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Xilr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Kunark and Velious filtered out all the people who did not *really* want to be a Shadowknight (or Paladin).  If your grouping with a Paladin or Shadowknight who is older than the &quot;KEI Generation&quot;, the odds are really good your grouping with a quality player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The reason warriors have dropped in xp group value is not really because of gear or knight upgrades or whatever.  It is because PoP mobs are build on an entirely different theory than mobs in prior expansions.  <br />
<br />
The old model of xp mob design: mobs hit like wussies.  The main way that they get harder is to add more and more hit points and mitigation.<br />
<br />
The PoP model of xp mob design: mobs hit like pianos dropped from skyscrapers.  They have crap mitigation and relatively few hit points.  The main way they get harder is to make them hit even harder.<br />
<br />
A lot of things were balanced for the old model but became messed up in one way or another under the new model.  The archetypical example of this is charm.  But other balances shifted as well, like the warrior vs knight question.  Knights always had much better aggro control.  But who gives a rat's ass about insta-aggro control when you are fighting mobs that take 5 rounds to kill a naked enchanter.  When you are fighting mobs that will one or two round any caster or slower, then the value of insta-aggro control goes way, way up.<br />
<br />
Now, the interesting question is how to fix this, how to help the xp group warrior?  They aren't going to go back to the old model of mob design (thank God).  They also probably just can't give warriors across-the-board aggro increases either.<br />
<br />
The first reason for that is the raiding warrior.  A lot of encounters would be utterly trivialized if warriors had significantly more aggro generation than they do now.  The real culprit here is defensive/evasive.  Adding those skills was probably the worst thing they have ever done to EQ (the only close thing is not nerfing the crap out of complete heal when Kunark or at least Velious came out).  Any real rebalancing of warriors and knights would have to begin with the removal of those disciplines, but so many encounters are based around them that I don't see SoE ever putting in the work to do it.<br />
<br />
The second reason is the xp group knight.  If knights don't have significantly better aggro generation, they will be back to their old status, which was worse than warriors are now.  <br />
<br />
The common answer is to significantly increase the aggro generation of warriors but let the knights still have a significant aggro advantage over warriors.  Leaving aside the point that this does nothing to address the raid problem, it is just an example of typical fuzzy thinking you see on MMOG message boards when people discuss balance, buffs and nerfs.  The knight advantage is either significant (i.e. it saves casters) or it isn't.  It is an essentially binary outcome.  If it is, you have changed nothing.  If it isn't, you send knights back to Kunark.  The lets buff everybody and everything will be warm and fuzzy response is popular, but it probably won't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Warriors are for raids, not xp group. The main tanks (and backup MTs) for their guilds are balanced. The rest are just dead weight and suck in raids, xp groups and solo. Shame :(</div></div><hr />
