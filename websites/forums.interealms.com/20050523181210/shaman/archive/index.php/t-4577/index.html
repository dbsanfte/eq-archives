<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Enraged Golem - for wizard epic in the plane of fear.<br />
<br />
A guy I know swears he is slowable, but he isn't a shaman so I really can't trust his source.  A shaman I know said he is slowable with POI.  Our list has him as unslowable, but lots of mobs are on there before the addition of POI with luclin.<br />
<br />
Can anyone who has done him recently confirm for me if he is slowable with turgurs or POI or not?   <br />
<br />
Thanks much<br />
-Henora</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unslowable, totally MR..and a total weako.  Lots of HP but a single cleric can keep a tank up the entire fight without even trying.<br />

<br />
No way in hell are you getting Turgurs to land.<br />
<br />
I recall trying PoI as well, with similar luck...had to stop when the resists got him aggrod on me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nothing landed on Golem except unresistable stuff like Malo and Tash.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm kind of pig headed about these things, so I landed a Plague of Insects on him after Mala, Malo, OOS and Insideous Decay.  I think I was only luck to do so.  Being single-minded about trying to slow the mobs gets me killed at times, but I find that you CAN slow some of these critters, but it's too late in the fight to be of any practical use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you're right, he was easy.<br />
<br />
Turgurs was resisted as expected, and so was POI, though I only cast it once.  Thanks for the info guys.<br />
<br />
-Hen<br />
<br />
btw -malo, doesnt stack with mala and oos/tash/mala/malo don't debuff DR so your good luck with POI was purely off Insideous!  good work! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">that's right, I must've been REALLY lucky :)<br />
<br />
While I was reading that he was slowed by a plague of Insects, my guild was yelling at me, &quot;Why are you casting that, he's unslowable!&quot;<br />
<br />
I laughed myself silly  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">His melee is laughable for a raid mob.  His hps are quite a lot tho, so all you need is good DPS.  Last time I did him for a guild wizard I popped Rabid Bear and did around 7k in damage to him!  Not bad for a non melee I thought :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just an FYI in case you guys aren't familiar with it (though I'm sure you are!):<br />
<br />
If you're debuffing disease on raid mobs, don't overlook Insidious Malady.  Insidious decay is like malo and insidious malady is like malosini.  ID does -40 dr and is unresistable, but IM does -60.  So, ID them IM, then POI.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah Land he sure does have some Hp on him.<br />
<br />
took us like ~6 mins with 3 monks, 2 rogues, 1 war, 1 Sk, 1 bard, 1 wiz, 1 druid, 1 shm, 2 botclerics, 1 ranger.   All level 59-60.  Monk tanked most of the fight hehe.  I loaded avatar for the first time in months and gave it to the rogues before they used disc.  :p<br />
<br />
Grats to our one and only weezard on epic.</div></div><hr />
