If melee balance is handled the same way Wis caster balanced was done you will get 1-2 changes, a promise of more and a silence after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is one of those things that have just eaten away at people until they've turned it into a giant ogre of a problem.  Yes, melee in general need some changes.  Yes, warriors need some changes.<br />
But... Last night, in mistmoore catacombs, I was in a group with a warrior, shadowknight and paladin, all wielding two handers(levels 61-64).  The shadowknight and warrior were wielding primal weapons, dont know what the paladin had.  The paladin did pretty much what you might expect, tanked, but little real damage unless slay went off.  The sk and warrior were another story altogether.  When we started, my hitbox filled with big hit after big hit, the paladin and my poor doggie were seemingly the only breaks in 100+ hits.  When the 200+ and even a few 300+ went by, I knew for sure my dps was seriously outclassed.  No mana needed.<br />
I've seen this time and again, when &quot;underpowered&quot; melee can equal or -out- damage me and do it continuously.  Sure, I get in 2 or 3 spear of torment in on the same mob before it dies, I might even come close to the damage output of the others.  But, I'm gonna have to canni a while to get it back, while the melee is hitting the next target.<br />
Now, this IS ldon, which is tailor made for melee dps, so it doesn't necessarily appy elsewhere.  Put a caster up on a mount, make sure they have all their mana regen and spell crit AA's, different story.  But, theres still a lot of people who actually spend a little time playing between 1 and 65 (w/100+AA).  I'll agree that melee is seriously underpowered in comparison at the top end, but most of the way up there, is a different story.</div></div><hr />

They might be thinking (now) that warriors are really broken, then everyone logs a warrior on the 18th and suddenly they think &quot;Wow, everyone wants to play a warrior! Problem solved! Lets get back to work on the broken door in grobb!&quot;<br />
<br />
The only thing that I see actually working is if you feedback/petition/whatever that you are cancelling your account due to apathy on balance and then actually cancel (at least for a day).  They WILL see a mass cancellation of accounts--I doubt they will see or care about lots of people standing around in POK afk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Anyone that doesn't really see a problem with warriors, monks, and to a lesser extent rouges hasn't really done that much research or parsing IMO. I've had too many warrior and monk friends retire due to how boring their classes have become that I haven't even been playing EQ lately. Really sucks when all the people you started playing with don't even want to play any more because their classes are completely unneeded in groups.</div></div><hr />

I had the opportunity to play a level 60 warrior in very high end gear before POP came out, and nothing in EQ has given me the adrenaline of tanking big mobs with all the red text flashing by.<br />

If they could just be a bit more allround it would be very cool.<br />

Speaking of Warriors, id like to see the Defensive disc improved or lengthened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">What you just described was enjoying TANKING.  Not the warrior class.  Due to changes that've been made to the game, warriors are pretty sub-par tanks.  Read up on paladins tanking Quarm.  Warriors have every reason to be pissed.<br />
<br />
The EQ line has always been that warriors are limited in what they can do, dependent on other classes for EVERY thing - because of their singular position as The Big Tanks.  That's been taken from them gradually, and it's time they got something else to compensate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'll be logging my warrior in for the first time in about a month for this.

Haven't you ever cringed when you joined a pickup group in someplace like BoT and found out you'd be working with a warrior instead of a Paladin or SK?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well only way something like this works is if enough people show up and block up enough space that it becomes a zone disruption. Of course zone disruptions are against policy but if you have say 100 people or more just sitting there, cant see Sony banning all those accounts, and can see them actually take notice. Well at least read the GM's report when they make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tweadle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Guys please don't dismiss this out of hand . We play a fun class , it makes EQ enjoyable , we have utility and can solo and are desired in groups . <br />
<br />
I played a monk to 55 as my first char . I havent played him since the monk nerf due to its crushing impact on his ability to solo,which is what I primarily did with him . It was fun . Soloing in dangerous areas and coming out on top was a thrill . As we all know .<br />
<br />
These wariors and monks have been feedbacking , have been petitioning ,and have been posting to relevant boards for a loooong time now . SOE has been cut and pasting the same melee fix BS on thier website since May 2003 . i kid you not ,they cut and pasted it every month !!<br />
<br />
They've been patient . Don't let the fact that we enjoy playing EQ detract from the reality that many players do not anymore . Simply due to the fact that action or inaction on the part of SOE has marginalized thier class to the point that it may as well not exist at all .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Klonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">What bugs me about this whole thing is the communities all standing behind warriors when Paladins and Shadowknights deserved the support before PoP and didnt get it. PAL/SHD were completely, utterly useless all thru Kunark and Velious, and pretty close to completely useless in Luclin.  No one cared however, no protests, no sympathy.  Maybe its because raids don't require PAL/SHD.  Amazing how some classes get things done so quickly.  (10 months isnt quick?  Try 3 years:P )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't stand behind the warriors and monks, I think they're blowing class drawbacks way out of context and I personally hope the people in attendance on the sit in get banned as they are probably the people filling up every messageboard with whining.  Every single Warrior in my guild has said to me they don't know what the entire fuss is.  <br />
<br />
As for a paladin and a shadow knight tanking Quarm please look at the magelo of the Paladin and Shadow Knight in question (The Shadow Knight has only 500hp less than the best warrior on my server).  They were equipped with the best gear the game has to offer as well no one said how long the cleric rotation had to be.  I can guarantee 4 (??) months after Vex Thal was cleared there were SKs and Paladins tanking Aten and Emp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">On BB, the leading raid guild dropped VZ (it was one of the  melee zeks, I sort of drifted off during the discussions) using a paladin as MA (same one who did Quarm).  He was on the same CH rotation they used for warriors.  This guys is uber, but there is something very wrong with a Pal MAing for a top tier boss mob raid.  I don't think pallies or SKs need nerfing as they are mostly balanced, but warriors are underbalanced.  It's clear when the pally or sk can outaggro a similarly geared warrior and do better at staying alive.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to fix this as it seems that hits and damage work differently under pop.  An 1800AC pally is mitigating damage as effectively as a similarly geared warrior on defensive with fewer aggro control issues.  Either the role of the warrior changes, or they need more damage mitigation and aggro control abilities, but the basis of the current issue would appear to be in how combat is handled post pop.</div></div><hr />

I told you you could host the show NEXT month Daffy.  This is THIS month.<br />
<br />
Warriors need aggro help.  I know several players that refuse to group with warriors as main tank - they'll disband if the group aquires one.  Really sad, because it's not THAT big a deal to adjust your play to avoid the aggro.  It does tend to reduce DPS/efficiency, though, depending on group makeup.  Anyone with DoTs and/or nukes can tell the difference between a warrior and SK/Pally as MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">By far, the best LDoN group I have been in (finished a collect in 45mns, did another and finished in less than half an hour) had pets for melee (shaman, 2 wiz, necro, mage, and cleric all in their 60s).  That's gotta tell you something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">It does tend to reduce DPS/efficiency, though, depending on group makeup.  Anyone with DoTs and/or nukes can tell the difference between a warrior and SK/Pally as MT.<br />
<br />
Exactly. Warriors tend to hold the group back in terms of what members can deal dps wise. They tend to require the same or MORE healing than knights because to riposte. They offer no utility.<br />
<br />
Exp mobs are like stuffing envelopes for mass mailout. No one cares if one guy licks the stamp JUUUUUUUST right if he takes 4 times as long to lick it, and reduces everyone else's efficiency. There is no reason to take a warrior in an exp group fighting the normal weak mobs people fight for exp. They need a boost.<br />
<br />
My suggestion of course, is a aggro proc disc. Fast recycle. Why disc? So you cant /defensive while using it, which would screw with raid balance. Theres other stuff they probably need.. the riposte bs needs to be fixed... I dont know if offhand riposte immunity would work or not. But that would probably go a decent ways.<br />
<br />
More warrior specific armor, with significantly higher hp/ac, or better effects (strikethrough, aggro focus on crud other than lame shields, etc) would help.<br />
<br />
Right now, taking a warrior in an exp group is like taking a one legged man in an ass kicking competition, when Johnny 3-Legs and Spiked Shoe Ted are lfg. His one leg needs to be AMAZING to work, or his ass made of adamntite, and right now, its not.</div></div><hr />

Everyone who has played EQ for more then 15 minutes knows that warriors have some issues. Having a drama queen convention to &quot;support&quot; warriors isnt any kind of answer to a problem =p Im sorry if it makes me an &quot;angry rude zekker&quot; to point that out directly. Nice way to erect a straw man at me and completely derailing the thread though.. WTG!<br />
<br />
Warriors need some work, but having a whine-in isnt going to do anything but reinforce that some people will never let go of the notion that being a drama queen is the best way to get what they want.<br />
<br />
EDIT: AND FYI a Paladin tanking Quarm doesnt show how much warriors are broken so much as it shows how much latterday itemization and AA(lr5 et al), broke EQ in general. Which indirectly screws warriors over, as their main advantages over knights came from gear.(at least historically in EQ). Dont get me started on LR5 and its bastard brother CS5(whatver the pop one is called =p). Talk about a way to bring every melee class(not just knights) up to a high avoidance factor. /vomit.</div></div><hr />

I dunno, sit-ins seemed to garner attention in the 60's.....<br />
<br />
Waiting patiently seems to have yielded 2 things: jack and squat.<br />
<br />
I realize knights claim they were useless for 3 years (this isnt entirely accurate, but they did kind of suck early on). So? Should warriors suck for 3 more? Thats pretty selfish to want others to suffer merely because you have.</div></div><hr />

So? Should warriors suck for 3 more? Thats pretty selfish to want others to suffer merely because you have<br />
<br />
I never claimed any such thing, so please dont attribute this sentiment to me.<br />
<br />
There is a huge problems with buffing up warriors, as I will detail here..<br />
<br />
a)pure tanking power: it is a curve you see.. there is a point where a warriors better tanking(getting hit not taunt) diminishes due to gear and AA. You need a certain level of tanking to do X mob. Making warriors tank even better doesnt help this, as anyone can tank once they reach that golden minimum.<br />
<br />
b)Taunt: I dunno heh, I dont have an issue with warrior taunt, the warriors I know and group with have pretty snappy aggro, and it aint like we are elemental/time geared or anything. *shrug*<br />
<br />
So how do you fix it? You up warrior DPS? you are screwing over monks and rogues.. oh ok up their dps too? Now you are making EQ too easy and have to make encounters harder. Oh lets make mobs hit harder, make defensive more important? Great that just means guilds have to have a ****ton of warriors to tank switch with on these mobs that take an hour to kill, everyone back off from the giant blackhole created when all the knights quit again.<br />
<br />
Warriors need UTILITY. Not DPS, not more tanking or hitpoints then what they have, neither of those are a real fix. Utility is where warriors are hurting.<br />
<br />
The problem is. 90% of warriors just want to nerf knights back into the stone age(kunark =p). Where knights were completely and totally worthless. Thats not a real solution heh.<br />
<br />
I think people who dont think Absor or whoever know about the problem are deluding themselves, I have no doubt that they are completely aware of the problem with warriors, and really are just stumped about how to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Warriors were screwed the day Kunark was released and they (a) added defensive/evasive and (b) didn't nerf the everloving crap out of complete heal.  Any sensible tank rebalancing would begin with the removal of both, but I doubt they could do that now.  So expect to see some halfassed solution that either leaves things the way they are now or sends knights back to Kunark status.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I think alot of the problem was in creating a completely non magical beefy tank melee in the first place. Its a nice idea that fits in with all the pen and paper rpg precedent, but doesnt really work in a persistant environment. Mostly because the things in a pnp environment that prevent the massive propogation of &quot;special melees&quot; like paladins, rangers etc are things that dont fit into a mmog.(high stat reqs, alignment etc).<br />
<br />
I kind of think EQ woulda been easier to balance with no warrior class at all, and monks/rogues merged into one class with some minor magical abilities and &quot;backstab&quot; changed into something more like a critical strike(can be done with or without a piercing weapon). <br />
<br />
But hey thats just a personal wet dream, just a whimsical whatif.</div></div><hr />

Future Plans for October\November, 2003<br />
Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future of the game. Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed about what those plans are. Please understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development time.<br />
Development on the following projects continues. We appreciate your patience as we work out the details.<br />
Class Balance<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time. Some options being considered are:<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate. The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
Shields and blocking<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield.<br />

We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield.

Under Review 01/27/2003<br />
- We're reviewing the tanking ability of the various melee and hybrid classes to be sure each class is competitively balanced with the others. The main factors we're considering are the ability to take damage, deal damage, and the additional abilities of each class. The goal with this review is to find any issues where melee classes are not &quot;bringing enough to the party&quot; when comparing their package of abilities. We're paying particular attention to the avoidance-focused classes such as the monk, to be sure things end up where they should.<br />

<br />
Warriors have no utility, they gave it up to be specialized tanks, and did so willingly.  Turning the warrior class into something it is not is simply not the answer.  Also, note that as knights point out frequently, utility is now how they get most of their groups...snap agro and being able to take the damage is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">i say make a Paladin, get to level 9 for Cease, stun crap, and tell Warriors, &quot;Hey, my Paladin is 75% Warrior and holds aggro just fine. You get the other 25% and are bitching? Pft!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">The &quot;kunark problem&quot; that nobody seems to be bringing up was the experience system at the time.<br />
<br />
It was generally known that if you were a ranger / paladin / SK / bard, you took more experience to level.  Troll SKs had the worst of it, taking something like 40% more experience to get a level.<br />
<br />
Nobody really cared.  If you made yourself a TSK, people called you a masochist but that was about it.<br />
<br />
Then came ShowEQ, and people discovering that, when you GROUPED with that Troll Shadowknight, he got 140% of his &quot;split&quot; of the XP from any one kill - and he took that extra 40% from the GROUP's experience.  Everyone else got 92% of their &quot;split&quot; of the XP - and you got less and less with every hybrid you added.<br />
<br />
That's when hybrids - not just knights - had the worst time, because they a) took experience from their groupmates and b) didn't bring anything to the table worth losing that XP for.<br />
<br />
Verant did two things:<br />
<br />
First:  They changed the way experience was divided in a group.  It went from being divided based on the ratio of character's XP to a ratio based on levels.  This eliminated the penalty of grouping with a TSK.<br />
<br />
Second:  They admitted that hybrids weren't actually powerful enough to deserve the XP penalty, so they engineered it out of the game by having hybrids get more XP per kill.<br />
<br />
They did a bunch of things after that - got rid of the double whammy mana penalty, improved 2 hander damage, introduced a bunch of hybrid-only gear, and made hybrid-unique spells that they didn't share with the parent class.<br />
<br />
But the biggest &quot;fix&quot; to hybrids was to make it so that, if you grouped with one, you didn't automatically level slower.<br />
<br />
Now the point of all that:<br />
<br />
Currently, if you use a warrior as your group's tank, you will kill slower.  People have to watch their damage output or they will get aggro off the main tank, which wastes healer mana and causes death downtime.<br />
<br />
If you have a warrior in your group, You Get Less Experience.<br />
<br />
If you have a paladin / SK tank, You Get More Experience.<br />
<br />
It's the hybrid XP penalty all over again.<br />
<br />
I don't want to see knight classes nerfed.  I have way too many friends who play hybrids, and I have SK and bard alts in their low 50s.<br />
<br />
I DO want the game to be in a state where an XP group gets the same amount of experience regardless of the class of the tank.  <br />
<br />
Because, as it stands now, even after playing a warrior for 65 levels, I won't take one as a tank in any pickup XP group I'm in with my shaman, unless I know the warrior personally.<br />
<br />
That's broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Much has been made about broken taunt.  So much so that its become a rallying cry for the sort of people who dont understand taunt in the first place.  Its misused and misunderstood a great deal, so when a warrior cant hold aggro, 'taunt is broken'.  I fairly regularly group with a 61 war that holds aggro just fine, even under fast-paced ldon conditions.  He doesn't use a proc weapon in either hand, but he does understand taunt and hate.  <br />
The whole aggro problem started out as a rather limited thing.  High level warriors in xp conditions were being beaten out of groups by fast aggro knights.  This has spread into the most widely debated subject on eq messageboards and has taken on epic porportions.  Hordes of warriors are playing alts, claiming that they can't hold aggro.  Yet they hold aggro in exactly the same way as they used to.  More and more tools have been added to help warriors.  Hate proc augments and such are here for just this one purpose, yet the screams grow louder.<br />
Its gotten to the point where I just cant have sympathy.  People are blaming poor aggro management skills on 'taunt is broken'.  Taunt still works folks.  It does not work as often as it should, but it does work, same as it always did.  <br />
Just making the existing taunt work reliably would fix the problems that any skilled warriors are having.  This will not solve the problems of the unskilled.  Knights just offer an 'easy' solution, no understanding of taunt/hate required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One might point out that people now have a PERFECT understanding of taunt and hate.<br />
<br />
If you have a knight, he has the hate and the taunt.  What more is there to understand?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Well said, Trevurg, well said, just what I was thinking and telling on some other forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">There are three dimensions to a high-level EQ character, in no particular order:<br />
<br />
1. Utility on raids<br />
2. Utility in a group<br />
3. Soloability<br />
<br />
if you want to add a fourth add<br />
<br />
4. Farmability - ability to farm greens for tradeskills/quests/profit<br />
<br />
Warriors score high on #1, low to medium on #2 (Pally/SK more desireable), and off the bottom of the chart on #3 and #4. Warriors were never designed to solo, but at LEAST they should be able to kill greens better. And they need a definate boost in #2. Warriors shouldn't have to continue to get the short end of the stick everywhere except raids.<br />
<br />
My suggestions for adjusting the class?<br />
<br />
1. Give Warriors an ability like Assassinate that has a chance to kill a green mob instantly. This is not likely to affect any high-level raid encounters, but it sure would boost their farmability, and everyone has to do a certain amount of that.  Yes, they already get Finishing Blow, but that requires the mob to be at low health.  Another alternative would be to give them a brand-new and very generous damage table for fighting greens.<br />
<br />
2. Give Warriors a second taunt-like ability. Well-equipped warriors got BoCs or similar weapons that proc aggro, three expansions ago. Those abilities, perhaps on a lesser scale, should be standard equipment by now, just like the spells from two expansions ago are standard equipment for casters.<br />
<br />
3. Warriors need better damage mitigation when NOT using defensive. POP mobs just eat them up too fast. This should be phased so that lower-AC warriors see more benefit - i.e. Time-equipped warriors probably don't need the help.  This might take the form of a rune-like ability to limit the effectiveness on longer raid encounters, or a straight Bulwark of Vie-type AA in addition to defensive disc.<br />
<br />
4. Warriors need a downtime self-healing ability that works faster than bandaids. This ability should take 100% of the warrior's concentration, like bandaging does, so he can't do it during combat or while pulling, but it would reduce the downtime after a fight if no healer is available. Perhaps simply an AA to increase the sitting mana regen by, say, 50 or 100 per tick for a specific duration would do it.<br />
<br />
5. Increased DPS but ONLY if the warrior is the focus of the mob's attention. Basically a clickable AA ENRAGE functionality that causes all of the mob's hits to generate a high-damage melee attack back. The fact that the warrior must be the focus of the mob's attention means that this ability won't unbalance raid encounters, but the extra DPS should, for the duration of an AA, bring the warrior's DPS up to, say, that of a monk or rogue. This would increase the warrior's desirability in groups AND boost the solo/farm ability without breaking raid-level encounters.  Tune it so that the monks and rogues don't get shafted by messing with the duration and reuse time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The problem is that taunt puts the Tank at the same agro level than  the most hated mate, but then the mate makes dmg and recovers the agro...<br />
<br />
SK and pallys can get more  hate after taunt (stun,darknessnare), puting them higher than the others in agro, so when the before-hated mate does dmg, he doesn't recover the position in the hate list. <br />
<br />
Warriors can do this only with a BOC or similar, so lesser equiped warriors lose the agro fast after taunt.<br />
<br />
Warriors should get a direct hate increaser ability:<br />
 +(2*skill_lvl) hate, refresh each X secs <br />
to do after each taunt or in fight. <br />
<br />
'warrior_001 spits in mob_001's face making him really mad' (+400 hate when 200skill)<br />
<br />
disclosure: IMHO</div></div><hr />

<br />
A warrior with good gear and AA's can already outdamage a comparably equipped and AAed monk. Warriors need something more than a damage upgrade I think. Both warriors and monks require an innovative fix that allows them to bring something besides DPS/tanking to the table. Of course, we all know what the liklihood of that happening is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Klidoren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I used to play a warrior, and for those that are against this whole thing, or saying that its about parses, its not. Yes warriors like damage, but its about taunt, its about taking a beating better then most classes cause that is what a warrior does. When pallys and SK's were upgraded for mitigation combined with their spells they can hold taunt better, and tank as well or better then a warrior, thus making a warrior less usefull.<br />
I group with my friends warrior all the time, i have to give him those 10 seconds or so to get aggro, to land my slow, the whole time watching him lose 60% or so of his HP. An early CH, or an early slow/cripple, nuke will easily steal aggro, while an SK casts hate and i can land slow soon as i see the mob. <br />
Its an advantage that the knight classes got after they were &quot;fixed&quot; which IMHO was truly needed and made them into what they were meant to be.<br />
Now its the warriors turn, snap aggro, another taunt system, a bit more dps, whatever, just get them back doing their only job, tanking.<br />
As far as melee rebalancing, I dont see it as much. The fact magic users can solo a mob and we cant, who cares, put a rogue, ranger war monk in my group anyday, they dont run OOM after 3 hours of killing. <br />
<br />
I like Flabbo's thinking, something for aggro, something to get the dmg they take down some, not upping warrior dps then having rogues and monks bitch.<br />
It's not warrior wanting to nerf knights, its that knights have utility, warriors only have tanking, and that was taken from them, now they are just low end DPS, or sponges for Raid mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">For anyone complaining about warriors crying for nerfs, remember, there were JUST as many calling for a nerf TO THEIR OWN CLASS.  Plenty of warriors have begged to have /disc defensive REMOVED from the game if that's what it would take to make them a viable class again.  The question isn't even &quot;are warriors broken&quot; anymore.  It's &quot;Are they EVER going to be fixed?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is about people who had a perfectly good main character one or two expansions ago who are now lepers on their own servers (or at least feel as if they are) because they KNOW they're half a tank, compared to knights.<br />
<br />
I'm already happy with this call to arms, because I've heard people say &quot;man, I didn't realize they had it so bad.&quot;  Even though most people aren't going to pick a warrior to tank (unless it's a friend or guildie, or in elemental-plus gear) - most people don't (or didn't) know exactly how bored and useless this class has become.<br />
<br />
I think of it this way.  Warriors are a parent class.  SK's and Paladins are hybrids of Warrior and Necro/Cleric respectively.  Knights are now better at their function (tanking) than their parent class.  What if Beastlords got an 80% slow?  What if they could buff better than we do?  Wups, they have that... dang.  So anyway, what if they could outslow and outheal their parent class?<br />
<br />
Warriors don't even care if they get their old job back at this point.  They just want A Job.  Any job.</div></div><hr />

I have groups with Warriors tanking *all the time* and they do excellent jobs. Probably because they learn how to play the class instead of complaining that they're broken. Probably because the groups are full of competent people. <br />
<br />
This whining **** is getting old, really fast. <br />
<br />
Learn to play the class.<br />

They're complaining because Knights get snap aggro?<br />

Warriors sat pretty for so long, and flat out said Knights shouldn't be a necessity but something there if a Warrior wasn't. So excuse me while I pretend to give a half a tug that Warriors played by the byproducts of two cousins who got drunk and screwed on prom night want their class made easier for them.<br />
<br />
Do Warriors need a little more utility? Yes. All pure melee do. <br />
<br />
Are Warriors are broken as they believe themselves to be? No. The only thing broken on most Warriors is the off switch for their whining.<br />
<br />
All Warriors need is some way of making up the experience penalty of having to wait another THREE SECONDS to slow or Nuke, and a taunt button that makes fun of the we-todd-did (insert class here) who overnuked/didn't evade/FD because they didn't learn to play their class either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">That warriors were better than knights for several years is NOT reason for them to suck for the coming 24 months. This entire revenge crap is getting old.<br />
<br />
A warrior in group means waiting to cast slow.<br />
<br />
A knight in group means you can malo on incoming, slow the second the knight has engaged, cripple and then cheal someone and the mob doesn't move toward you.<br />
<br />
For exp purposes the fact that a warrior mitigates damage a little better than a knight has no meaning what so ever. If the cheal lands on the warrior at 44% but on the knight at 39% won't make a lick of difference.<br />
<br />
Monks in velious gear tank well enough for tier 2 planes. I've had bards in luclin gear tank in pit in tactics without any problems. <br />
<br />
The aggro abilities on warriors are broken. For no benefit what so ever to the group I get stuck with a tank that makes it impossible for me to add any dps.<br />
<br />
Monks do a bit too little damage, rogues do a ****load too little damage. All three pure melees are more or less broken. (That stonewood compound bows are droppable and found in quantity in any bazaar is a real kick in the nuts for an old rogue player. That 30% of all classes outdamages rogues while having tons of utility spells and the ability to solo an aa every 45 minutes is just insane on a whole new scale.)<br />

Knights are exactly where they should be imho. Warriors, monks and rogues all need some serious loving.</div></div><hr />

With that now out of the way... i will be there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Well, I'm not a warrior and I'm calling for a nerf.<br />
<br />
Giving warriors snap aggro (like what Paladins have) is bad for the game.  I doubt it will happen.  <br />
<br />
Giving warriors the same aggro as Paladin is no solution, because Paladins do in fact tank essentially as well as warriors AND they have a very powerful array of utilities.  Group heals, fast heals, fast roots, loh, stuns, res, undead damage, horribly unbalanced itemization . . . it's quite an assortment.  <br />
<br />
Leaving warriors with worse aggro is even worse.  <br />
<br />
The answer.... nerf Knight aggro.  There you have it.  <br />
<br />
Ignorant Paladins and SK will whine about &quot;we're going to back to bad days of Kunark&quot;.  Most have no clue what they are talking about.  Sony has LONG addressed those issues by changing how experience and mana pools operate.  THOSE were the big beefs, those were changed due to incessant whining (hi Kryss) and they will NOT be effected by a valid nerf on snap aggro - WHICH was never an issue then.<br />
<br />
Folks who claim that any cry for a nerf is bad form and should never happen are silly.  It's a game.  It needs to balanced to be a better game.  If it's not balanced, it's not a better game.  Tuning things is how you balance them.  This can, should and must happen.  They haven't done enough of it, and that's why problems get so deep rooted.  <br />
<br />
Snap aggro ruins gameplay, and it needs to be gone, not expanded.  Why make groups work on their aggro when they don't NEED to if a Paladin is there?  Answer:  they won't because they'll grab the Paladin when they can.  This is not a suitable or fair role for warriors.  <br />
<br />
It's time to lower the hammer and nerf hybrid aggro power.  <br />
<br />
It's the only answer that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Kryss, you are clearly an an ******* and an idiot. Do the warriors you group with have some magical proc ability? You even admit that the rest of the group gets to sit on their thumb for 3 seconds while the warrior swings, hoping it will proc. Yay, i do nothing for 205 of a mobs life. Perhaps make warriors give a 20% exp bonus? :P Then again, this is assuming the warrior has  taunt weapons. They dont come free at any level, and are far too uncommon. A BoC costs 400k on my server, and even that doesnt get the job done. How old is this weapon? Its high time new tools were added, and this goes beyond relying on luck, and holding your group back for aggro management. Of course, 20 or so ldon missions will net a warrior one proc augment... assuming they can find groups willign to suffer with them as tank. Better hope its a good weapon too, or your SOL when its upgrade time. Then again, the paladin doesnt need any missions to outperform the warrior.<br />
<br />
Warriors have procs (out of their hands), melee dps (nearly useless), taunt (nearly useless) and ae taunt (so leet.. usable every 15 minutes ****!) to control aggro.<br />
<br />
Who cares if warriors 3 years ago laughed at knights. Doesnt give them the right to laugh now. And more to the point, lots of people on either side back then have moved to new classes, retired, etc. Knights had it rough then, they got fixed. Warriors suck ass now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Kazandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I am in full agreement with Gart, Nerf Knights. Sometimes endless upgrades can actually be worse than a good solid nerf now and then.<br />
<br />
So knights will have to use weapons with aggro procs? Wooptifukin doo, i dont bring a tank to my group to provide dps, its just an added benefit if its there. And when im the only healer in a ldon mission guess what? Pally group heals will still save the day a few times before were done. SK instant 7500 damage just might too. Or the better tankability of warriors (see next part). It would come down to flavor and personal taste.<br />
<br />
The second thing that needs to happen is to give warriors actual better tankability, POSSIBLY with another nerf (to all classes), or simply by upgrading warrior defense (trivializes the game even more). I am in favor of nerf everyone elses defense personally (yes even my own bot giant soloing defense), and i am very much aware i will get flamed for saying so.</div></div><hr />

Must be in melee range.  Roots the mob and roots the warrior for a few seconds, for as long as warrior's endurance &gt; zero.<br />
<br />
Endurance drains faster depending on mob size (if that can be determined) and level.  For instance, a level 70 dragon grappled by a 65 warrior would probably only be grappled for one second, whereas a level 60 mob might be grappled for five seconds.  The max grapple will come out to about 8 seconds on a light blue mob (i.e. your endurance will run to zero in eight seconds), or 12 seconds on a green mob.<br />
<br />
The longer the mob is grappled, the more angry it will become.<br />
<br />
Other random unnecessary stuff:<br />
Any damage shields on mob will be inflicted on the warrior upon grapple and every tick afterwards til grapple breaks.  Any damage shields on warrior will be inflicted on mob upon grapple and every tick afterwards til grapple breaks.<br />
The warrior and the grappled mob can only single attack and can only hit with the primary.  If a warrior uses a 2h weapon, it will only do half the damage-- the mob won't have this penalty.<br />
Instead of draining endurance based on size and level comparisons, maybe compare on level and str+sta comparisons.<br />
The grappled mob will study orgo and tutor me for my wednesday midterm.<br />
The warrior will study bio and tutor me for my thursday midterm.<br />
Once grapple ends, they will write my med school application essays for me.</div></div><hr />

 all wars can get a anger 3 proc, its available in ldon...<br />
<br />
 if they dont have it, yah that sure sucks, but wars are gear dependent. <br />
<br />
i kinda like your idear gart, the first real statement ive actually liked in this hole discussion, eventho im very much against the snap agro, since its the knights area, but if it became the wars area maybe that would help... but im just afraid how it would change the ways of trivilazeing raids.<br />
<br />
 ppl saying that a knight tanking like a war with def, wake the **** up ~ and for those that say that BoV is too overpowered... hey a war can get BoV too, and wars do migrate more dmgs then knights... they have more hp, just thier agro that sucks. <br />
<br />
cheers, i agree that something needs to be done, but ppl crying about more hp, ac, migration whatever need to share that crack they are smokeing cuz it must sure most be good!.<br />
<br />
ps. all those things from wars need better solo skillz, higher con-combat hp regen, and they take more dmg due to riposts... priceless, gave me a good laugh :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Kazandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Warriors do not mitigate better than knights to any meaningful degree. Slightly more hp is not better mitigation, only mitigation is mitigation. And wars just dont have enough of it. Hell, I as a shaman have tanked in some bot groups while we looked for a new tank and it usually went just fine. Of course, that says more about the sad state of the game than anything else... when a good tank is not even required to tank plane mobs we have a seriously bad game overall.<br />
<br />
In short, Nerf Knights (and maybe the rest of us) and buff wars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Woodoo, it's hard to take what you say seriously in this debate since you're using a damn monk to tank in time.<br />
<br />
Your guild epitomizes the fact that itemization has been ****ed over more times than Jenna Jameson.<br />
<br />
You're using a damn MONK to tank in time. But then again, warriors are ok. No.. scratch that. TANKING itself is broken, and a class that willingly decided to do nothing BUT tank is, well.... broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">KryssAndTrip,<br />
<br />
You are clearly trying to keep you status quo for your alt Palladin.  Please go away and let the shaman debate this. (I suggest PON site where some of the other ass hats like you post)<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE: PON site is actually behind getting warriors upgraded.  But KryssAndTrip can join the few who are @#$@#$ heads and say different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Woodoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">hmm thaak, we do use a monk to tank, its not cuz wars cant tank, its cuz we wanna get some challange back into the game, by doing various encounters diffrent ways then are normally done.<br />
<br />
by letting a monk tank in time is not a fu to all wars, its simply just to show that items are screwed up, or more like that something needs to be done. - take it as you want.<br />
<br />
i do agree with you in most of what you write, and i think too that wars are broken.<br />
<br />
but you have to agree with me when im saying that giveing more hp, dps and snap agro... that would kinda make raids even easyer then they allready are...<br />
<br />
general i think we are on the same boat:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Kazandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Just to repeat myself. The answer is not more powering up of wars or anyone else. The only way to REALLY solve not only warriors, but tanking and the game in general, is a sound beating with the nerf bat.<br />
But Sony is too chicken to do that. I hate to say this but things were better when Verant was running things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Woodoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">ok sir explain instead?!<br />
<br />
 beating everyone else then wars with nerf bat?.<br />
<br />
 yah ok that would make them happy but what about the rest :P ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
no one likes a nerf for any class.  Unless you're just mean spirited.  People ask for inprovements not nerfs.  Every Nerfs hurts you as much as them.<br />

<br />
PS: You wanna wix warriors? give them a mitigation bonus, and an overtaunt.  a taunt that raises them 50 point above the highest on the list.  Give them Leather Mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Kazandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">The game as it is now is TOO EASY! Quarm tanked by a knight. Time gods tanked by monks. Enchanters able to tank plane mobs (i have done it). Nukers, doters, melees and bards not even thinking about their aggro when grouped with a knight. These are all bad things.<br />
<br />
The game is already trivial. Buffing warriors would just make things even easier. Its time to bring just a little challenge back in the game.</div></div><hr />
