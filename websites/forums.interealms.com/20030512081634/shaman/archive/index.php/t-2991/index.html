<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>budakai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 60 Ranger and a 52 Sham and was looking for some tips on where to Duo to get xp mainly for the sham, AA points are bonus for the ranger (not neccessary though)..   thanks for all the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd use bow skills on the ranger and kite them with the ranger as the damage with a good bow is obscene.<br />
<br />
Add the shammy pet to run after mob and use cripple with some dots..<br />
<br />
One possible way :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fubah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman: Grab yo JBB..  Slow the mob.  JBB it down while meleeing.<br />
<br />
Ranger: Disband and Watch the shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm.. I duel comp a 60 rogue with a 58 shaman.<br />
<br />
Good spots would be.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove: <br />
  Good thing your ranger is 60, he can single pull shrooms easy $$.<br />
If your ranger is epic'd then its ok if slows get resisted.<br />
Otherwise buy him a journeymans walking stick to offhand for tashes OR malise the shrooms first then slow. <br />
<br />
Just get shaman to DR buff you (and him) and put on any DR resist gear (this is important). Maybe mem cure disease for when the ranger gets Slowed. <br />
Make a pet as well now that they dont aggro stuff.<br />
<br />
As Shaman levels he will have less trouble slowing.<br />
<br />
The Grey:<br />
  Used to be good though there are a ****load of traps there now (even more than when I used to exp there 3 months ago).<br />
<br />
Temple is still ok. Camp Temple front/back Golems and Static Snakes.<br />
Pull wanders if you run out of mob... though with all the traps this is a pain in the ass now.<br />
If you aggro a shimmering rock-fiends run like hell into Ssra til the shammie gets higher levels.<br />
Getting to outside Ssra temple is fun.... snakes see past invis (they are undead) but nothing else does.  <br />
Also both chars need Enduring Breath though there is an easy quest in Katta that will give you an EB necklace for 3 shissar organs off the snakes in The Grey.<br />
As an added bonus, Named Golems will pop. These can drop some nice gear. Shattered Golem is easiest. Other ones might squish you until Shammie is 55 or so.<br />
Named snakes also pop but they are nastier than the Golems (I think). Also drop phat loot.<br />
<br />
Guess you could level the Shaman on SolB Bats and Bugs but you'd not get much exp for the Ranger.<br />
<br />
Or similarly do Dawnshroud Hopper/Tribeman caves. Good exp for shaman but bad for you.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Once shaman gains a few more levels you could go do chardok or duo HS entrance if you got a gate potion....</div></div><hr />
