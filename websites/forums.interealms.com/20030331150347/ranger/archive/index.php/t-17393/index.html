<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Epiphany EQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read Crydee's sticky post over and over.  I'm just soliciting opinions on where to best spend my points to get the best effect.<br />
<br />
I've gotten the first 6 General out of the way now, so it's time to work on Archetype.  I went for Run Speed 3 (no brainer), and Regen 3 (probably a bad choice but too late now).<br />
<br />
So I'm planning to go for EQ and then AM3 as soon as the class abilities are open to me.  I also plan to spend the next 12 points on Archetype abilities to open up the Class abilities as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
The real question here is whether to go for ND3 for the extra HPs, CF3 for the extra DPS, or split them up and do ND2 + CF2 perhaps.<br />
<br />
I figure I'm a fairly typical ranger at this point.  I am an offensive melee DPS class most of the time.  I tank occasionally (mostly when the MT goes down or we get a problem add).  I use archery for agro-free early damage or when trueshot pops up.  I hope to shift over to archery as primary DPS, but that is many many AAs away.<br />
<br />
So let's hear everyone's 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ytrill Stonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds to me like you're after the best archery damage you can get, as quick as you can get it. I'd do CF1, 2 and 3 to complete Archetypes, then get EQ and AM3.<br />
<br />
Later, you can come back to tanking, HP, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went ND3 the whole way. I gained about 300 hp.<br />
<br />
Then went EQ (you will not regret getting EQ before AM3).<br />
<br />
Then got AM3.<br />
<br />
Now I'm working on CF2.<br />
<br />
Don't regret getting the extra hp since it has saved my life a few times. I don't like AoE dots. *shiver* Not at all. Hate AoE rampage. *ugh* Now that I have AM3, I stand outside the AoE and shoot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ND2 will probably increase your damage output more then CF3 because you'll be alive for longer periods of time!! :) When your dead (and we all know lack of HPs is the leading cuase of death in everquest) your DPS becomes zero!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Epiphany EQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is it worth getting CF1 just for the sheer excitement of seeing crit messages?  That would mean getting CF2 and ND2 with those 12 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>grinrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My plan, for what it is worth:<br />
<br />
CF1<br />
MC1 (600 more mana an hour, 2 more Califaction or 3 regens)<br />
ND1 (more hit points)<br />
CA (Get hit for less)<br />
ND2 (even more hit points)<br />
<br />
CF2 and CF3 only increase melee crits from 2% to 2.5% and then to 3.0% (if I read correctly, not much bang for the points until AM starts kicking in)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Legenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did a little bit of everything, in no particular order: SCF1, CA1, CS1, ND1, CF1, MC1. Now that I completed EQ/AM3 (and some more) I'm not going back and filling out the rest of the Arche's and some PoP skills (CF3 done, FotA next)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's pretty much what I did - CF1, MC1, and CA1 I would definitely recommend, the others are kind of iffy, depending on how you play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elindel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I ended up doing CF1 ND1 CA1 CS1 ND2  And I was pretty happy with that.<br />
<br />
You could do ND2 CF2 as well, but then you'll have to do at least CA 1 and CS 1 if you want to do PE later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dangoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What I did pre pop:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diamondeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I went:<br />
<br />
Runspeed 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
Combat Fury 1<br />
Mental Clarity 2<br />
Natural Healing 1<br />
Combat Agility 1<br />
Endless Quiver<br />
Archery Mastery 1<br />
Now 2 points out of 6 for Archery Mastery 2<br />
<br />
My choices are a bit unusual, but at them time I was soloing Velks a lot and needed regen AAs for reducing downtime.  I still think the Mental Clarity 2 was worth it (for those occasions where I'm in a group and no enchanter is around, or soloing and C3 isn't available) but if I could change it I'd probably put the 2 for natural healing 1 into something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kedaek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So far, I've done:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Regen3<br />
Natural Durability 3<br />
Endless Quiver<br />
Archery Mastery 1  (4 points from 2)<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't regret going ND3 at all, I would suggest it to any raiding ranger. My guild is currently pretty much done with Velious, starting in Ssrae temple, and working on Tier 3 pop zones, so the hp for AE's is very, very handy. Had I gone differently, I would have done CA1, CS1, CF1. I don't really care for mental clarity, as I'm not huge on soloing anymore (used to love FG :( ). So I always have some type of mana regen.<br />
<br />
Not really sure yet what I want to do after AM3. Ill probably go something like:<br />
<br />
Combat Fury 1<br />
Ferocity 1, 2, 3<br />
<br />
Then I need to fit in CA1/CS1 and PE. I also gotta find a spot for innate camo, and combat fury/casting fury. So much I want and so little time to do this between raids. :p<br />
<br />
For those who did Casting fury.... Is it a significant damage upgrade? Or is it mainly for just seeing a nice big crit every once in a while? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you plan on getting am3/eq, hp/ac is almost pointless.  At least at this point in time.  Most of the time when you use archery you wont even be in harms range.</div></div><hr />
