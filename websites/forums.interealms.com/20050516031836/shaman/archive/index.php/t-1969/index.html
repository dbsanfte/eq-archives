<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=1969">How do you organize your spell book?</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cerdle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Think this was a thread before but not a poll. I just wanted to see how you all organize your book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Current Organization:<br />
<br />
Page 1 - 4 most common spells.  page 2 is all my buffs.  <br />
<br />
Pages 5 - 8 are less common spells.  All my resist spells are on one page.  Bear Form, Pet, Summon Pet all on one, then things like Cha Buff, Summon food/water/bags , levitate, etc.<br />
<br />
All my old spells start on page 25.  I only have the highest lvl buffs, Dots, etc in the first part of the book, everything else that is 'outdated' goes back here in some sort of pseudo order...I try to keep all the DDs on a page or 2, all my heals together, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Two things I do to help speed things up:<br />
<br />
1) my Meditation Hotkey is \book 4.  This puts me in the 'middle' of my most common spells.  One page left or right and I have most of my spells that I would ever swap out during combat.  <br />
<br />
2) a hotkey for \book 25 takes me to the spot where my old spells are.  If I ever need to whip out burst of fire or some other spell I don't have to page, page, page, page all the way to the back...I know they are all past 25.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Main lineup of spells is on page 1.<br />
<br />
Main lineup of buffs and haste is currently on page 40 - need to move talisman of kragg there still from page 37.<br />
<br />
HoS is on page 31<br />
<br />
Malosi is on page 31<br />
<br />
Cripple is on page 35<br />
 <br />
Older buffs for PLing purposes (the ones that aren't &quot;too powerful for your target&quot;) on page 25<br />
<br />
Chloroblast is currently on page 37, but needs to be moved up to page 1 in place of superior heal so I stop memming the wrong one.<br />
<br />
Pets are spread out but lvl 55 pet is currently on page 37 - will move it to page 40 soon.<br />
<br />
Slow, is of course on page 1, it's in the main lineup.<br />
<br />
Summon food/water/bag is all on page 12<br />
<br />
Old dots on page 23, I think, and old DDs are next to it<br />
<br />
Everything else (as far as I can think of right now at work) is kinda randomly spread out...<br />
<br />
Oh, resist fire/cold/disease are on page 10, but the new group disease resist is on page 31, and group posion resist is on page 33 I believe. Resist magic is on page 30. Resist poison is on page 27, I think.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: you all know about /book &lt;page#&gt; right? Who needs hotkeys when you can zoom right to the page you want :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I should organize it more, but for the most part i keep the spells im gonna cast alot in the first 10 pages.<br />
<br />
Basicly what i do is i scribe my new spells in the back, then swap them for lower lvl of the spell in the front.<br />
<br />
ie: when i dinged 24, spirit of ox replaced that of bear, and when i ding 34(soooooooo soon :(), health will replace that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gawgan Zolah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I KIND of do the &quot;sort by specialization&quot; one. Up front i got the &quot;healing hand&quot; symbol. Then the &quot;Sheild buff&quot; icons for a few pages. &quot;arm buff&quot; icons for a few pages. Then my &quot;evil damaging hand&quot; icons. After that my &quot;poison&quot; icons and &quot;disease&quot;. The &quot;sow n speed&quot; symbols come next. &quot;Eye&quot; after that, then &quot;Summon&quot; icons. &quot;shrink n bind&quot; icons come after that. the last few pages are &quot;Disempower&quot; icons and &quot;malosi&quot; icons. Canni is also at the back here, i call it the &quot;Misc&quot; section.<br />
<br />
It was confusing for about 3 minutes... i got every spell memorized what page its on, even 3/4 months after i quit the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Inner fire, what page</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
Page 1-2 is my primary combat lineup.<br />
Best Poison DD<br />
Best Poison DoT<br />
Best Disease DoT<br />
Best Slow<br />
Best debuff<br />
Root<br />
Regrowth<br />
Sup Heal<br />
Canni<br />
Gate (not generally memmed' but when I want it, I want if fast!)<br />
<br />
Pages 3-4<br />
Most used Attribute Buffs (best of each except str, which I use HoS for), including the Single and group versions<br />
<br />
Pages 5-6<br />
Resist buffs (fire, cold, magic, poison, disease)<br />
Cure line (DA, blindness)<br />
Pages 7-8<br />
Situational buffs, debuffs, and utility spells.<br />
<br />
Pages 9-19<br />
Various other spells that I still use on occasion (Best Cold DD is here on page 10 which I like for some odd anal reason in bottom right), and some blank room to mem next line of spells so I don't have to shift all over the place during the next major book organization effort.<br />
<br />
Pages 20-21<br />
&quot;Waiting for Rez spells&quot;<br />
Lowest mana cost spells for Div, Abj, Evoc, Conj. work<br />
Inner Fire, Burst of Flame, Sense True North, Sense Animal, Summon Food/Water, etc.<br />
<br />
Blank space and some oddballs I don't remember until...<br />
Pages 33-34<br />
This starts the organization of older (now obsolete) spells by category.  Spells situated in my own way, with lowest level of each in the upper left, highest (yet still obsolete) is in lower right of each page.  One page each for Str, Dex, Agi, Sta, Cha, HP, AC, old resists, old pets, old nukes, old DoTs, old Heals, etc.<br />
<br />
Yes, I am a bit compulsive at times.  But I know where almost all of the spells are and can find them ALL relatively fast regardless of whether you ask for Harness of Spirit or Spirit of Monkey. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i dont remeber why or where i got the idea but i have an intersting way to organize my spell book.  I made a 4 hotkeys called, 'buffs'  'debuffs'  'utiltity'  and 'damage'  and each one was linked to a differnt page, i think 10 20 30 and 40 repectivly.  that way when ever i need to mem a spell i just click on the right hotkey and i can have the spell i need in view, i rarely need to click the change page buttons.  the only spells i  cant see with my hotkeys are older buffs (and some grp or resist buffs), and my older healing spells.  i have found that this works really well and saves me flipping through my spell book all the time.<br />
<br />
/em gets back to the grind to 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">all the spells i use go up front, with group versions of spells on the direct right of the single version</div></div><hr />

<br />
3/4: Buffs...agi/sta/focus/levitate/etc, also the 55 pet.<br />
<br />
5/6: Offense/Resists. 5 has Pox, Ebolt, Malo, Insidious Decay, Plague of Insects. 6 has Epuration, Cleaninsing, RM/RC/RF.<br />
<br />
7/8: Getting into catch-alls, but basically any summon or &quot;wand&quot; spell goes here. Spirit pouch, food/water/companion, annul magic, bind, shrink/grow, celerity, and bear form<br />
<br />
9/10: Stuff I barely ever use, but don't want to search for when I need it...torrent of poison, ice strike, shadoo, imbue ivory, bind sight, maniacal strength, stuff like that.<br />
<br />
11+ facing pages of spells that have been replaced, grouped by level. That crappy 50 pet buff, and all 51+ spells that were replaced all go together, rather than spacing exactly by level.</div></div><hr />

Wow i thought i was the only one who did it this way.  I have all my high level stat buff spells &quot;arm spells&quot; on first-second page.  All high level shield spells on third-forth.  All heal spells on fifth-sixth.  All &quot;boot&quot;  icon spells on 7th-8th and so on.</div></div><hr />

Page 30; Other stuff I don't want to have to search the book for when I do need it; ie; Imbue Ivory<br />

Pages 3-4 are my dvination spells<br />
Pages 5-6 are my group buffs<br />
Pages 7-8 are my &quot;Shaman Class Spells&quot;<br />
Then are 6 pages of the latest and greatest buffs<br />
Followed by 2 pages where I keep the DOTs, and malise<br />
Then 2 pages of debuffs, slow, etc<br />
Then a page for AOE spells, a page for Shrink/Grow/Bind and a page for pet spells.<br />
<br />
All outdated spells are thrown to the back of the book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Page 1,2 - Spells with a shield<br />

Page 7,8 - Spells with a mound of dirt and a Grim Reaper and red arm<br />
Page 9,10-Spells with a blue arm<br />
<br />
and so on. You see what I'm getting at.  When I get the next spell in the spell set I take the old spell and stick it in the back of my book and scribe the new spell in the front part.  Seems a little simplistic but it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jedcea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Page 1-2 Smaller heals, cholorplast, etc, for when I am buffing lower levels or being main healer. So in other words spells I actively use, but not on a daily basis.<br />

These are spells I use frequently but not my main line-up. <br />
Spells I use a little more frequently then pages 1-2<br />
<br />
Page 5-6 Sight spells, invis, lev, SoW, Spirit of ben lieh, group regrowth, Envenomed Bolt, pet etc. <br />

My main line-up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My book is awful.<br />
<br />
I started doing them by levels, that is, when I got to a new spell level, the new ones went to the back.<br />
<br />
That was ok at first, but now:<br />
<br />
My food and water are page 1-2<br />
<br />
Bind is 3-4<br />
<br />
Gate is like 5-6<br />
<br />
Some spells are in the middle somewhere:<br />
<br />
Sow is page 3-4 I think, but Bi'Lha (whatever that stupid name is) is at the very back, so it's a pain to switch between keeping group SoW'd and then someone else asking for one.<br />
<br />
all my current arms for buffing are together<br />
Talisman is with them, but HoS is at the back<br />
<br />
Pets were together until I got my lvl 55 pet (in the back)  Bears are toward the back, but different pages.<br />
<br />
Nukes are alll over the place( ne reason to make these nice, how many Shamans use them anyway?)<br />
<br />
Debuffs are all over the place (Malxxx wherever, slows spead out, etc.)<br />
<br />
Heals are spread out too ;)<br />
<br />
My book is a mess.  And it's even worse when so-an-so below level 50 asks for something.  When I die, it's a real chore to find all my spells again ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Here goes, see if I can do this from memory...<br />
<br />
Basic order is (from front to back):<br />
<br />
Standard spell lineup (best heal, slow, debuff, dot, canni, etc)<br />
Main buffs (harness, talisman, stat buffs, sow, etc)<br />
Secondary buffs (lev, ac, rage, etc)<br />
Utility spells (vision, invis, shrink, grow)<br />
Summons (food, water, pouch, puppy)<br />
Cures (disease, poison, blind)<br />
Resists<br />
Dots<br />
<br />
Then way way way at the back (starting at page 30ish) are every other spell ;)<br />
<br />
At level 57 it looks something like this.<br />
<br />
Page1<br />
  Chloroplast, Malosini, Turgurs, Plague of Insects, Canni3<br />
Page2<br />
  Ice Strike, Root, Greater Bearform, Insidious Decay, Envenomed Bolt<br />
Page3<br />
  SoW, Spirit of Bih'Li, Talisman of Kragg, Regrowth, Celerity<br />
Page4<br />
  Maniacal Strength, Riotous Health, Deliriously Nimble, Dexterity, Harness of Spirit<br />
Page5<br />
  Levitation, Guardian, Enduring Breath, Charisma, Sup Heal<br />
Page6<br />
  Rage, Malosi, Togors, Cripple, Extinguish Fatigue<br />
Page7<br />
  Invis, Acumen, Shrink, Grow<br />
Page8<br />
  Summon Food, Water, Pouch, Spirit of Howler<br />
Page9<br />
  Cure spells<br />
Page10<br />
  Resist spells<br />
Page11<br />
  All dots except my best poison dot<br />
<br />
Every other spell except for the highest version of each line is well past the first 11 or 12 pages.<br />
<br />
I used to buff newbies all the time, but now since Im putting all the lower level spells at the back I just tell em that my spells are too powerful, give them Harness and sow and send them on their way :)</div></div><hr />

Takes a bit of time when I get my new batch of spells, but after that I can switch spells out in barely more than the memming time.  I never have to sift pages.<br />
<br />
&quot;Main&quot; -- pages 1/2 My &quot;general purpose&quot; spells, such as Root, SoW, Turgurs, Chloro, Cann, Ebolt and Plague, Blizz Blast, and Alacrity. <br />
<br />
pages 3/4 -- Bear, current Pet, Spirit Quickening<br />
<br />
Buffs 11/12 -- Current stat buffs, HoS/Tali/Shield, Bih'Li, next page holds resists/rage, further pages hold progressively weaker stuff. <br />
<br />
Heals 21/22 -- Yep. Heals &amp; Cures. <br />
<br />
Combat 31/32 -- Debuffs, Slows, Flash of Light, older DDs and DoTs<br />
<br />
Misc 41/42 -- Gate/Bind, Shrink, Sight, Food/Drink, Invis, etc. <br />

I ended up organizing cuz I got tired of switching spells in combat (for whatever reason... dr00d left, now I have to SoW, chanter gone, now I have to hasten) and having to sort through stuff.<br />

Less often to page 1/2 for hp/stat buffs.  The others generally once I have them mem'd for our area I don't have to go to those pages.<br />
<br />
My real book is like this:<br />
<br />
Page1 - AC/HP buffs<br />
Page2 - Stat buffs<br />
Page3 - Sow/haste/bear/pet<br />
Page4 - Resist buffs<br />
Page5 - Heals<br />
Page6 - Cures/Regen/Canna<br />
Page7/8 - Miscellaneous: Root, Enstill, Gate, Invis, see invis, bind, shrink, grow, levitate, 'somethingelse'<br />
Page9 - Slows<br />
Page10 - debuffs: cancel magic, malotype, insidious whatever<br />
Page11 - Disease dots<br />
Page12 - Poison dots<br />
Page13/14 - asst nukes<br />
<br />
Page49 and before, old spells I don't use anymore<br />
Page50 - summon food, water, true north, lvl 1 flame spell (practice spells)</div></div><hr />

Page 5/6 are my hodge podge buff page including SoW, Lev, EB, Shrink etc<br />
Page 7/8 are for stuff like bind, blind, gate, and other misc utility spells<br />
Page 9/10 are for Last circle spells that were replaced (for LOM situations or loss of LVL)<br />
Pages 11-18 are Open for scribing new spells (so i dont have to constantally look for a new place to put them)<br />
pages 19-50 are for past spells in order by spell level<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Voted none-of-the-above...<br />
I put my solo spells on page 1-2 (dots, drowsy, malaise etc..)<br />
I put my group spells on page 3-4 (AC/Stat buffs and healing)<br />
then the rest are organized by icon (blue strong arm, poison dagger, scary malaise face etc..) its worked for 29 levels so far..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I do mine by type of spell:<br />
<br />
Cures are at first pages<br />
Buffs<br />
Resist Buffs<br />
AC spells<br />
DD's<br />
Dot's<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I organize by use!  I organize by lvl as a base but steadily move up more useful spells, such as invis, lev, sow, etc.  Nothing worse than having to go on treasure hunt for sow in your book when you accidentally un-mezed it.  Speaking of which, does anyone not keep sow mezed at all times here?  And for what i have mezed I always get heals, a dot or 2, slow, sow, and fill rest with buffs I can switch between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I havent kept SoW memmed since I got my epic booties.  I keep heal, gate, canni, root and turgur memmed.  Normally have a dot, regen and haste memmed too.</div></div><hr />
