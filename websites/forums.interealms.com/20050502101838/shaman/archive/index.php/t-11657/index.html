<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For a long time now and for good reason , we have griped and bitched about alot of things. Become so frustrated we even turned on oursleves at times. But since the release of LoY we have seen group shrink potions and spell , group Pure blood , group haste , usless spells removed , illusion potions to alchemy.<br />
<br />
I look around and i see a company that is paying attetion to not only us , but the game in general. I always had the view that with all the staff changes at SoE that it was a matter of cleaning up a mess that was made. It seems to me right now they are clearing up the mess very well. <br />
<br />
So i wonder what you all are feeling. Are you still disgruntled ?  Do you still feel neglected ? Are you with me when in feeling some what of a burden and weight lifting in these last few weeks ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Where do you stand ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">clearly ASITFTSE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wasn't really all that upset before...  SHM has been a great class to play and pretty well balanced for some time now, so I don't think we were &quot;Broken&quot; before.  But, that's not to say we couldn't use some tweaking and I think they've done a great job with this recent patch doing just that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am really happy with the changes that they made.  I finally have a little bit of use for alchemy, even if it is just for fun most of the time.  The spell changes look pretty good also.   I am also extremely happy that they added the priest line of spells as researchable.  I have been looking for torpor for months now, the lowest I saw someone selling was 150k  then they went and traded it for about 50-60k in pp and items.   Not being able to find the spells, its not the money is the real problem and I am extremely happy to see that they finally did something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's nice to have somethings useless, for the most part, changed into things a bit more useful.<br />
Personally, my only real gripe lately has been the spell turn in, which always seems to give me the same spells now, either Tali of Gindan, or Ferine Avatar. Other than that, being a shaman is great  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In the 3+ years I've been playing a Shaman I think now is the best time yet to be playing this class. Decent skills, group desirability, improved spells and spell usefulness, better pet, and an overall positive outlook for Shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Soe seems to be working on fixing a lot of long standing issues.<br />
Now if they could only fix the DoT Agro so that it would be an option to use our poison dot line during raids we are more or less done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well!<br />
<br />
I have to say that I am very pleased with the recent changes.  It really looks like SOE took a look at what we wanted, thought about a good way to implement it, and then followed through.  <br />
<br />
Returning Disinefecting Aura to its original function: Good!<br />
<br />
Adding Blood Of Nadox:  Good!<br />
<br />
Adding priest researh:  Good! (sort of -- would have been nice if it wasnt in the hands of INT casters, but good enough)<br />
<br />
Changing STR/DEX:  Good!  I got my first ever spectral parchment yesterday and would have felt terrible turning it in to get Aim Of The Gindan or Talisman Of The Gindan.  It had to help that people were saying &quot;take it out and dont replace it with anything, just get rid of it&quot;.  :)<br />
<br />
Fixing Doors In Freeport:   REALLY GOOD!  Er, wait, no, not really.  NOT BAD though.  <br />
<br />
New Alchemy:  Good!<br />
<br />
New folding alchemy potion bag type things:  Good!  I really, really, really hated carrying around two bearskin potion bags and a medice bag for 45 levels.<br />
<br />
In general, there are really only two things that I think the shaman community is hurting over now:<br />
<br />
1) DoT agro / usefullness<br />
<br />
This is somewhat subjective.  DoTs have a place in their current form, it is just unfortunate that that place isnt in groups.  A problem, I think, but I can live with it.  Its certainly not the end of the world, and SOE has done a little to alleviate it with the much less fizzle-tastic rain and spear of torment (a much faster DD than we ever had before) and Velium Strike (a crit for 2K is a crit for 2K).<br />
<br />
So I can live with DoTs.<br />
<br />
2) Focus Items<br />
<br />
We're sort of out in the cold on some focus items.  You can get a few good ones as a shaman (like a wicked bone atlatl or a ceramic rod of storms) but the ones that affect our DoTs are so weak that its not really even worth the effort of getting them.<br />
<br />
Again, a problem, but there ARE some good ones so I can live with the focus item situation too.<br />
<br />
In general, I think we gained alot in this patch and I also think that we should be truly happy with the changes and the focus on our needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>drakaranxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have never been unhappy about playing a shaman. I don't think that I was ever unhappy with my shaman. I have learned how to play him better over the years and now I feel that I am a very good solo'er and I know what I have to offer a group. Even if all they ever want is a slow, regrowth, or backup heal. But hey! That is why I am there.<br />
<br />
-Double X</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm very happy with the recent changes to our class. Playing a shaman can be frustrating with the demand to buff this or debuff that all the time. They've added a few things that add some variety to the class and I love it. <br />
<br />
The only other thing I can think of to improve the class would be some aa skill that would increase the duration on our detrimental spells like slow and dots. Maybe an increased mana preservation skill for these spells too since we can't crit. Or just add slow/malo back to affliction focus tiems.<br />
<br />
Oh ae malo too plz...</div></div><hr />
