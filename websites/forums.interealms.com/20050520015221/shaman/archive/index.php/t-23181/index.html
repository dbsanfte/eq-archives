<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been out of the loop for some time now.<br />
Long time RZ player, quit because I got tired of it all.<br />
I was wondering what you guys think of the new PvP changes on the Zeks and especially on RZ and what you think this has done to the Shaman as a PvP'er.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't really pvped with my shaman since the patch, but I can tell you that with 250ish PR, I can land blood of saryn in about 1/7 tries. With 300+ MR I can land bane in 1/7 tries. I can get rooted quite often. I can get stunned some. In that aspect, I don't like it, but I can live with it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there is no more insta-gibbing. 40% is max damage a caster can do to you, so I haven't died in any pvp against a wiz(haven't tried SK/necro)<br />
<br />
I still can't kill bards. I doubt I could kill necros or sks. any other class I'm fine against, I think.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I saw a 65 rogue do a crit BS for 2400 in pvp the other day, I don't think I like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nukes hurt people now, it's awesome.  Also, if I just chainclick my root ring, eventually it sticks after a few tries.  Pretty awesome on that silly caster that is trying to run from spirit call.  Oh yeah, I landed Blood of Saryrn on someone with 257 PR and I creamed my pants.  All in all I like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BunglesVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, try to fight a 65 ranger with... you lose. End of story. Don't come back. Unless you make a ranger and keep Trueshot up.<br />
<br />
Bungles</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I kill ppl again...life is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like the changes.  If you check Lucy you can see the resist mods on our spells.  Seems like our dots were made less resistable, and with the 40% spell dmg cap its pretty hard to finish us off (for those who use the stoic line of regen spells).<br />
  <br />
  My pvp strategy has changed from dispel and malise first so i can land SOMETHING, to just throwing all my dots at my victim then keeping myself alive while they rot.<br />
<br />
  Plus the AC reduction has benefitted us battle shamans.  Sure melees can hit us harder, but pesky druids and mages can be seriously pummeled by a shaman with a good weapon and slam ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FreyrSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spells land a fair bit easier, though you tend to get beaten up by melees  quite a bit more.  For instance, a monk hit me for 978 yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On Vallon Zek I have noticed that my spells sometimes stick..whoopee! ;)</div></div><hr />
