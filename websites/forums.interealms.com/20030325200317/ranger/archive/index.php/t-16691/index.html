<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fetin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is a pritty lively board. So I was thinkin lets get everybodys thoughs on the way Rangers do what we do. So if you got a method of hunting and killing and don't see it on this thread or have another spin on one already here POST IT! I'm trying to compile everybodys fav way of hunting at most major level junctions. With any luck this list will answer any questions anyone has to ask about Ranger strats and anyone who needs it has only to look. I appreciate any contributions.</div></div><hr />

ok I'll get this party started then....<br />
<br />
the Druid method:<br />
Rather simple, all you need is a reliable root and a dot (one of the drones line ). Get a mob you want to kill in an area with little or no wanderers. Hit it with snare followed by root and then your longest lasting dot, followed by sitting and meding. Re-apply dot whenever it wears out. Re-apply root whenever it seems prudent ei: when you have full mana and haven applyed it recently,  when it wears out, or when you know its about to wear off. Re-apply snare whenever it wears out or seems like it is about to. As a ranger this can take some time to do. Also remember this DOES NOT work well with summoning mobs and casters...<br />
<br />
See now isn't that easy... Lets get some oppinions and other methods up here pweeeease! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kedawen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have a melee partner and a little room to work? Try bait kiting.<br />
<br />
Ranger snares the mob, then continually cast TW or Flame lick and plink arrows  while dragging the mob around. The other melee beats on its back.<br />
This works fine until you get to summoning mobs.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Some areas have critters from opposing factions. For example, when doing the FM cycle, I would drag the high level sarnaks to a group of goblins, they would beat him down to a bubble or 2, then I would finish it off.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you panic some fish underwater, they don't move, so you can use your bow to good advantage. I remember when I first made 51, I did it with the barracuda in LoIO just to see the double damage. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Some giant size gritters can be hit with the bow while in melee range, so you can get double damage and use trueshot while soloing. Giants, Cyclops, Wurms are some examples.</div></div><hr />
