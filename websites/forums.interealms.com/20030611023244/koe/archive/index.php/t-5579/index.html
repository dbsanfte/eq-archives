<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got this in my email via the Sony EQ newsletter... I've heard of it a long time ago but don't know if it's anything worth trying for:<br />
<br />
=======================<br />
Lost Quests - The Blued Steel Hammer<br />
<br />
The &quot;Blued Steel Hammer&quot; is a weapon of legendary repute, but whose existence has been relegated to myth. Most people believe it is no longer in the game.<br />
<br />
Those people are wrong!<br />
<br />
The &quot;Blued Steel Hammer&quot; was the reward for a very old and notorious quest that could not be completed for a while. Most players have forgotten about the hammer…<br />
<br />
However, the Blued Steel Hammer is out there. It is one of several items that no one has yet discovered. Or &quot;rediscovered,&quot; in this case.<br />
<br />
&quot;I implemented the Blued Steel Hammer quest a long time ago, before last E3, but no one has discovered it yet,&quot; says Jeremy Ellis, designer on EverQuest. &quot;'Old school' players should recognize the name of the item and the quest it starts with, known as the 'Priestess of Najena' quest.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, start questing!</div></div><hr />
