That's funny as hell to me, because I guess Mage pets were supposed to walk around in a full suit of armor, so they made it innate.<br />
<br />
How incredibly super gay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Greetings,<br />
<br />
While I have no problem with Mage pets being summoned with a full suit of armor...and a pair of swords, for that matter, I do think that our pets should at LEAST get innate SoW(I mean, it's a freaking SPIRIT WOLF and it doesn't get to RUN like the &quot;Spirit of the Wolf&quot;?  No one at SoE sees this as wrong?), and probably innate dual wield in the higher levels, as well.  <br />
<br />
Mages are a pet class.  They rely pretty heavily on their pets.  Besides, they can summon all the items and put them on their pets anyway, so what's the problem with cutting down all the stupid button clicking and having them able to use a spell that costs more mana, with a nasty recast (to avoid chaining fully equipped pets at mobs and unbalancing things) that will summon pet_x with a full set of gear?<br />
<br />
If innate dual wield for our pets is frowned upon, then a significant DPS increase to make them worth while when they're not dual wielding would accomplish the same thing.  I'd HAPPILY have our pets lose the ability to dual wield if their DPS got doubled, or adjusted so that their current DPS while dual wielding became their normal DPS while not dual wielding.  That way, I would have about the same DPS in the pet, without all the stupid practice daggers I carry around now.  This would, of course, mean that we'd get SLIGHTLY reduced proc rates with mage weapons (1 weapon VS two) but honestly, I'd live with that. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp, as usual.<br />

<br />
while they're at it why dont they cut down on stupid clicks for shaman by giving us a group/extended FA/buffs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Greetings,<br />

I'm with you on the group FA.  I'd also like to see Talisman of Alacrity become 60% like SLTW so it's actually useful.  Then I honestly wouldn't have all that much clicking to do in the buffs category.  <br />
<br />
My biggest gripe with clicking comes from Canni4.  If the new canni introduced with GoD were made available to most of us, rather than the 6 shaman who will eventually see it...I think this would go a long way to allowing us to use our time more productively than smashing the canni key every time it pops to maintain our mana.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just bitter.<br />

I remember when everyone complained about how stupid it was to put level 65 spells (and even 63 and 64 haha) in PoP on &quot;uber high level mobs that only 1/10th of the server will see&quot;.  Now you'd be hard pressed to find people that don't have their level 65 spells.  Hell, there are pickup groups (groups, mind you) doing BoT towers and getting runes.  Even the gimpiest of slap-dash &quot;65 only&quot; guilds gets bags full of runes a week.<br />
<br />
You'll see the spell eventually, quit complaining.<br />
<br />
p.s.:  No, I don't have the spell either.</div></div><hr />

I know about a dozen folks in that situation right now, all 65th level primaries.  In general, we buy our spells rather than dealing with BoT.  If you wonder why, I can find you a dozen threads about how BoT sucks.<br />

Guess how many ancient spells i have seen. <br />
<br />
One.<br />
<br />
Thats right, i have SEEN 1 acient spell and it was ancient aegolism that is much worse then Virt so it was pretty useless. So please dont give us this crap about &quot; we will all see our spells &quot;.  Spells from runes are dropable, these are not, the only way you getting these spells is if you got and get them yourself, no one can farm them and turn in and give you the spell.<br />

I have no fear though, i suspect your tune will be changing soon enough when you actualy try to get them.</div></div><hr />

what really bothers me is that the only single solitary problem that i have ever seen Brenlo identify (as a problem) is not fixed and that they are &quot;looking into it&quot;.  pet shrink.<br />
<br />
while we identify problems; thru comparison, game play progression, experience, parsing, ect; there is the problem of getting that point accross to Sony.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shaman is the class SOny wishes would go away. They've phased us out by making our stat buffes useless, our dots longer while fights are slower, slow harder to stick and less useful when it does, and our heals more and more gimp while mobs do more dps. I'm thinking before Sony fixes any of our complaints they will give us all the option of trading our shaman for a bl with the same level and all our aa's banked, just to get us to shut up.<br />
No other parent class can be replaced quite as efficiently as we can, and in many ways they bring alot more to the table than we do. Imagine the outcry if rangers could port, if pallies could cheal, if sk's had the same pets and dots as necro's etc etc.</div></div><hr />

Don't blame him too much.  I started with a shaman, and didn't read message boards, had no high-level shaman friends, and basicly blundered my way to level 46 before I even knew I could even giveanything to dogdog.  I was level 52 before a higher level shaman told me that dogdog could dual wield if i gave him 2 weapons.  At that time, I thought damage and delay mattered, so I went out of my way to collect up FS daggers and shortswords for dogdog to use.<br />
<br />
But I learned better...as we all do.<br />

This problem is part of the huge warder problem Beastlords have been having. They have been complaining/feedback/bugging about it constantly for 6 months.<br />
<br />
SOE have been officially &quot;looking into it&quot; for 4 months since Absor's first comment on it.<br />
<br />
It is not at the top of their list of things to fix yet according to Brenlo.<br />

You're right.  I was born into an uber guild.  I didn't spend the first two years of my play time solo.  I had to scrimp and save to get my level 65 spells just like you did.  I had almost all of them before I joined the guild I'm in now.  <br />
<br />
Shut the **** up.  Pardon me if I get a little tired of the crying that goes on about every single aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
That being said however, it's true they're NO DROP, Ancient spells and therefore fundamentally different from the Rune spells.  But that doesn't change the fact that people still cried about how difficult they were to obtain.  <br />
Does being a casual gamer mean you want access to everything I spend a lot of time trying to attain in a tenth of the time?<br />
<br />
Even when I was REALLY casual I didn't expect to have all the spells, all the gear, all the focii of the uber player.  Part of the reason I started playing more as the time became available is because I wanted some cool stuff for my little pretend guy on Everquest.  *gasp* I set a goal for myself .. THE HUMANITY!!<br />
<br />
But now with LDON more than EVER (btw check my tunic and arms before you open your pie hole) you can approach a VT/Elementally-equipped player in terms of gear and focii.  So there's ONE spell that is UBER rare (just like Ancient: Scourge of Nife.. why aren't you crying about that?) that most people won't see that is a marginal upgrade (mostly a time saving device)  to an existing spell.  <br />
<br />
Is it worth getting upset over?  It's not like everyone who plays expects to get every item.  I don't expect to get the new canni spell.  It's just really rare.  If I do get it it won't be for a long while, and I'm ok with that.<br />
<br />
This thought process that you're ENTITLED TO WHATEVER YOU WANT is ridiculous in an MMORPG.  You want that, go played hacked Diablo 2 or somthing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not particularly upset, but you seem to be.  You made a generalization that was blatantly false, I pointed it out.<br />
<br />
Now think back for a minute, to when you were scrimping and saving for those spells.  When you went into the bazaar and saw 2 copies of Q for sale for (gasp!) 40k!  (even when the most I've ever had is 18k after a month of part time Droga farming)  Then, in the next 10 seconds, some bazaar bot got both and jacked the price to 65k.  Nice feeling, eh?<br />
<br />
The point is, I would like to earn what I get.  I want to get a rune drop, without being ganked by uber_necro_00 (been there), without being trained for the 5th time (done that), without farming for 3 MONTHS for ONE SPELL just to feed those bazaar bots.  Those are my choices.<br />
<br />
Drop 2k off your hp, play 10 hours a week, and tell me about how everyone has their 65 spells.  Until then, take it back to the rant boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Well, I was going to reply with some witty remark, but it seems most people beat me to tearing you to pieces already.<br />
<br />
I don't expect to be handed things in this game.  That's ridiculous.  What I would like, is for my class balance not to be based on something that isn't achievable by me.  If I have to work hard for it...great.  Before you go &quot;opening your pie hole&quot;...check my magelo.  See the incorp?  I'm taking advantage of the means available to me to advance.  Now...tell me how this relates to a spell that is literally impossible for me to atain unless I join a raiding guild?<br />
<br />
I never once said I wanted things handed to me.  And I fully expect to be less powerful than those that put in the seat time, I'm not arguing that.  That's why I'm not complaining about the ancient Dot you mentioned.  This new canni is an ability that ALL shaman need to have to bring our class back into line with where I personally think we should be.  It's not just a nice to have spell that adds a little more DPS.  You can't compare the two, they're completely different.  If it weren't such a cruicial, game changing ability that I think every shaman should have, I wouldn't have mentioned it.<br />
<br />
Make this an AA that I can obtain through grinding...or a spell that costs 3K LDoN points.  Anything that doesn't require me to alter my playstyle to achieve, since it is a needed class update, not just a tiny boost in dps or the like.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is my personal opinion, and yes, you're definitely allowed to disagree. But please, don't put words into my mouth, and don't tell me that I'm not willing to put in the effort.<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />

<br />
Saying &quot;I don't have my 65 spells&quot; followed quickly by &quot;I refuse to go to BoT&quot; is crap. If you do not want to go where the spells drop, do not complain that you do not have said spells. If you want them, you know where they are. Go get them. Hell, send a friendly tell to an officer of an Elemental guild and you can probably sort out to buy one cheaper than the average bazaar bot.<br />
<br />
The same goes for the ancients in Luclin. With Elemental gear it's very easy to one group Seru and he always drops them. Almost every mob in VT will too. If you've done a clear you will have seen plenty. Eleven hours in VT with only one spell is not possible unless you didn't kill anything. We've had probably a hundred rot or fed to the Tactics gnome.<br />
<br />
Minus Ancient Canni, all the spells are pretty easy to get. Eventually Ancient Canni will be too. It's more of a convenience spell than a balance issue anyway.</div></div><hr />

You know, with the myriad of threads on this very topic you'd think a raider would occasionally get a glimpse of what is and is not attainable in LDoN vis a vis raiding VT+.  But, yet again, they apparently don't.  I can only assume they're just so far out of touch and haven't been in an LDoN other than to quickly pick up their slot 8 augs and move back to PoP/Gates.<br />
<br />
Haagen, please link for me from any site you choose where I can get in LDoN:<br />
- Improved Damage 4 foci<br />
- Improved Healing 4 foci<br />
- Mana Preservation 4 foci<br />
<br />
How about a Crown of Ambivalence?  Talisman of Vah Kerrath?  A neck slot with a FT5 buff that stacks w/ everything in the game?  The stuff my raid friends link me is so far above the best LDoN has to offer it's hardly a basis even for comparison.<br />
<br />
What do I know, I only spend 100% of my online time in open PoP zones and LDoN.  I'd humbly suggest doing a bit of research before exiling all casual players into LDoN forever in search of nonexistent &quot;near VT/elemental&quot; quality gear.  Unless by LDoN you mean &quot;in your dreams&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I think there is no casual and no raider problem, and that we ALL face the same problem.<br />

There are add-on programs that give you access to an item database which allows you to retrieve links to any item in the game.  Not saying that your friend didn't have the spell, just pointint out that someone linking an item doesn't necessarily indicate ownership.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want improved damage iv either get the ornate gloves or the anger of e'ci range/primary thing.. grand scepter of ice or something?<br />
<br />
If you want improved healing iv (which I actually still don't have), get ornate sleeves or either buy the tradeskilled item or work your own tradeskills up.  Doesn't take any raiding to get platinum.<br />
<br />
If you want mana pres 4 get ornate sleeves or the tradeskilled item.<br />
<br />
None of these require raiding and are all attainable in single groups.<br />
<br />
It may not be immediately accessible and there may be a lot of work involved, but it's possible.<br />
<br />
Also, if you want these items so badly, go raid for them.  Now lookit, I am by no means saying that casual gamers are not as.. cool, I guess or not as good or don't know as much about the game or whatever.  <br />
<br />
This game will always be about time invested versus skill or knowledge.  There may be a paradigm shift as more games come out but I doubt it.<br />
If you want the fancy ****, be prepared to spend more time.  Ask anyone who knows me in game, I had **** for gear until the past couple of months.  My proudest pieces of gear was my LDON sleeves and tunic, and my epic.  <br />
<br />
Hell, I still don't put in on that kickass chain tunic that drops in Ikkinz, I'm too proud of and spent too much time on my LDON tunic.<br />

I guess I don't understand the whining that comes because you can't get gear because you can't invest time.</div></div><hr />

EQ isn't about time, so much, as it is about who your friends are, and how many you have.  If you spent 2 hours a day playing in a large raiding guild vs. 2 hours a day on your own or with a small group, who do you think will be better off?  its NOT about time.  It's about the willingness to submit yourself to the high-end game.  Personally, i don't care to hang out with 50 or so 13-year old boys, pretending to have fun (been there, done that).  I'm not interested in gay jokes, or how hot Buffy the Vampire Slayer is, or all the cutesy phrases that get tossed around (teh win, teh pwn, asshats, ...makes baby joseph sayer cry), and so on.  <br />
I hang out with people i like.  If for some strange reason that number should get up to 60 or 70, then maybe we'll be able to accomplish all the great things this game has to offer.  <br />
<br />
But to be perfectly frank, I don't really &quot;need&quot; an improved canni.  Running out of mana isn't my problem.  It's never been my problem.  Aggro on dots, dots not running for the full duration, long cast time on crappy nukes and insufficient heals.  Those are the problems.  Whoever said that this spell was a convenience item, hit the nail on the head.  If this were a game breaking spell, I'd be upset about the placement.   Otherwise, I'll pick it up in a year or two, after they raise the level cap to 70 and trivialize GoD.  <br />
<br />
But to get back on topic, having to buy up all the daggers from fishing area vendors to feed to my worthless pet is outright ridiculous.  They ought to give us a summon rusty dagger spell.  We get summon pouch already, what the heck?  Unless the influx of rusty daggers into the economy would throw things out of whack.</div></div><hr />

Me too, actually.  My &quot;uber guild&quot; is full of real, mature adults who play EverQuest mainly because they enjoy being around each other.  I don't think we've ever talked about how hot Buffy the Vampire Slayer is, but there are some gay jokes (Hi Terial!)  Oh, and if you see us a night with 50 people on and we're not doing poTime, please take a snapshot and post it please.<br />

<br />
Oh, so &quot;submitting yourself to the high-end game&quot; (whatever that means; what an utterly meaningless phrase) isn't about time investment, it's about how many 13 year old boys you can steer onto a target during this mystical two hour window you've described, all the while navigating a conversation about how hot and gay Buffy the Vampire Slayer is?  Gotcha.  <br />

<br />
Amen.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I'm still not clear on this mystique &quot;the high end game&quot; has for some of you.  It's like to some of you, two different types of people play the game -- those who were born into a high-end guild, and those who were cursed by their genetics to forever be casual.  Lemme tell ya, I'm just a regular guy who has some free time between work and school that manages to squeeze some decent play time into EQ.  I'm not a morbidly obese shut-in with social anxiety disorder who sits on the computer so much my retinas are imprinted with the EQ logo. <br />
<br />
I like the game, I think it's fun to get new gear and kill new stuff with my friends.  I don't see where the resentment comes in.<br />
<br />
Futhermore, I can understand I'm being abrasive, and as such I'm receiving some negative reputation.  That's fine.  But inane comments such as:<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems to me you were always uber pretending to be casual, shame you forgot your roots.&quot;<br />
<br />
are stupid.<br />
<br />
What the **** does that even mean?  What a nonsensical sentence. &quot;You were always uber pretending to be casual&quot;... thanks, I guess -- that kind of sounds like a compliment.  In any case it barely makes sense.  See my above statement about being &quot;born into an uber guild&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'm not in a raiding guild.  My job severely limits the hours and times I can play.  Vex Thal?  Nope.  Made it to elemental planes and Tower, now working on Sol Ro and Fire.  Only spells I'm missing are the Luclin Ancients, Primal Essence, Malos, and Blood of Saryrn.  I'll eventually get Malos and Saryrn, but PE?  Highly unlikely.  Ancients?  Nope.<br />
<br />
BACK TO THE ORIGINAL TOPIC (remember that?  Dogs, armor, etc?):  Our pets were unwittingly improved a bit with the pet patch - Goner seems to be a slightly more durable speed bump now.  I'm really not surprised that mage pets can be summoned fully geared.  Summoning is, after all, the mage's trade.  <br />
<br />
Equivalent to that would be Goner having innate buffs and/or SoW, since that is (or at least was) OUR role in society.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind a 1 hr level 65 pet buff that included<br />
. SoW<br />
. 36 AC<br />
. 60% haste<br />
. 120 Str, 100 Dex<br />
. 100 ATK<br />
. 650 HP<br />

As for the dual wielding with rusty weaps, bear in mind: We've always known/assumed this was a bug.  Brenlo's statement pretty well confirms this.  Don't be too surprised if it goes away.</div></div><hr />

Who cares about extended range except for the occasional time your barely in range to heal someone?  Mana preserv beats out ER by a huge amount in importance.  Granted I don't really care about ID either, but I rarely nuke except in phase 1.<br />

Back to your regularly scheduled comments! :)</div></div><hr />

So to answer your question, the guy who spends 2 hours a day in LDON will probably be better or off, or at least even-steven with the &quot;2 hour a day uber raider&quot; (no such thing, in my experience)<br />
<br />
<br />
back in my raiding days i knew several people who would only log in a couple times a week, usually for the candyland raids.  There were also some who got home late from work every night, and could only raid for a couple hours, due to the time constraints.  These were the people who picked up all the rotting gear no one else wanted, gear which is a good deal better than what you can get on your own.  Of course these people aren't the norm, i never said that, but they were certainly better off gearwise than someone not in a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
My point was that obtaining top end gear isn't just an issue of not having enough time to play EQ.  You HAVE to be in a raiding guild to do it.  Joining a raiding guild takes a lot of sacrifices.  <br />
Less time spent hanging out with old friends.  TONS of time spent waiting around, 50 people take longer to organize.  Canceled events because enough of X class didn't log on.  Politics and griping about loots (yeah, not every raiding guild has these problems, if you don't then congratulations you've won the game).  Having to put up with people you normally wouldn't hang around with.  <br />
This is what i meant by my &quot;utterly meaningless phrase&quot; submitting yourself to the high-end game.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's completely out of line to want top-end gear/spells, without having to raid for them.  GoD is a step in the right direction.  Difficult single group encounters (2 or 3 group would be ok, anything that doesn't involve herding cats), with nice rewards.  They just need to take it up a notch.  The end-game doesn't &quot;have&quot; to be based on raiding.  Thats just the way they've made it.</div></div><hr />

I've sometimes wondered what it would be like after having one. Coming to the board these days I get to find out in real time as my brain gets sucked out Egyptian mummification style (as well as study some post-op patients).<br />
<br />
But right, original topic. I just thought of it, but what about this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=1376)?<br />
<br />
BTW PE sucks. They add research recipes, but they make it use Yaeth 73 right, which is also used for RGC, so it's expensive when you can find it for sale. However, if I luck out and get another page I'll make you a copy. I'm going to leverage my playtime and get RGC from the nice man in North Ro. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Primal essence can be gotten off a hammer that drops in Acrylia Caverns off the big worm there.  You'll see my name on the picture of it at allakhazam's.  It's a &quot;primal cudgel&quot; and drops 3 out of 4 kills.  At this point, the worm is one or two groupable.  Some other nice stuff drops off him too, like a pretty good melee belt and a caster robe, plus some spells.  The hammer  is castable only on your own group though, but it is a nice clicky to use up buff spots if you will be fighting mobs that dispell, and some casters still like the STA. <br />
<br />
At this point in the game though, STA is the only really useful buff it gives.  (PE gives 20 to all melee stats.)  Wearing full ornate with 3 elemental pieces(belt/cape/mask), I'm already full STA, so it's already not even useful to me except pretty much as a junk buff.  Great when you're with clowns who leveled up so fast they don't feel they have any responsibility to a raid to get a insta-clicky junk buff, who insist on getting all their buffs fresh again every two minutes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, don't fret if you don't have PE.  It's gettable by one or two groups, and even if you get it, it's worth isn't super high at this point.<br />
<br />
On the new canni spell -- the way mana pools have skyrocketed since  PoP first came out, and now with people even getting or full of Time and GoD items, it's pretty ridiculous to have to rely on the same old canni to restore enormously expanded mana pools.  An upgrade to canni is long overdue to every player in the game who even plays the class -- not even by spending AA, just off a vendor.  <br />
<br />
It's just an adjustment that makes sense.  As everyone and even Sony acknowledges, it's nothing like a game-unbalancing thing that we canni better in the first place, so they should just let our ability keep up.  <br />
<br />
Anyone remember how painfully tedious canni 1 was when you didn't have anything better?  It was a nightmare of clicking.  What a pleasure and a relief to get past it, to either canni 2 or canni 3(I skipped canni 2 myself).  The game became SO much more fun when you weren't miserably desperately clicking and trying to keep up.  Canni 4 isn't quite that bad for me yet(but hey I'm only in ornate), but is it all and completely about tedium and annoyance?  Yes.  Is clicking canni more rather than less any part of a &quot;challenge&quot; or something compelling that makes the game more interesting and exciting for me? that really makes the game more of what the game should be? separates the weak from the strong, the smart from the dumb, the creative from the unimaginative?  Is clicking more rather than less in ANY WAY AT ALL anything that rewards or challenges me or anyone else? <br />
<br />
Nah.  It just means canni 4 is pretty outdated.<br />
<br />
Fixing it won't &quot;steal anything&quot; from the ubers who feel they should have a better canni than anyone else.  (Ubers don't even have it yet anyway.)   It won't wreck or disturb the game in any way whatsoever.<br />
<br />
It will just make the game less of a chore to the wrist and fingers, less annoying and repetitive.  <br />
<br />
It just makes sense.  That kind of thing always makes sense.<br />
<br />
But in the last zone of the game, where people will have already essentially &quot;won&quot; the game and run out of content anyway?  Kind of too late in a way by then.  What would it matter?  When it could have mattered all along.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm feeling MUCH better now.  /nod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I also agree that there's no reason the game has to be disproportionately rewarding for those who join raiding guilds(or get botted in them to scoop up items when they're not even there).  <br />
<br />
The game has been that way for so long now that it might SEEM like that's just reality, but this is a game, and they can construct reality however they like.<br />
<br />
GoD (one or two groupable nameds and loot campable trials) and LDON both proved they can construct the game so that non-raiders can still improve their gear, and not be stuck ONLY in POV/POD/PON/POI/BOT despite being level 65.  There's no reason they couldn't expand that model or mine variations on it, and doing so would greatly expand their player base and help ensure success of the game.<br />
<br />
There's no particular reason that you can't make things just as hard to do for three groups or two groups as you can for 12 or 15 groups -- and then balance the rewards to be equivalent to what you do with 12 or 15 groups.  Remember, the goal of raiding is to be challenging, NOT just to have large numbers of people.  Having large numbers of people does not at all make things necessarily challenging, or show the virtue or superiority of those players that are just tiny cogs in the great big, somewhat anonymous wheels that big guilds and raids can be.<br />
<br />
It just takes more thinking about design and less &quot;zerg&quot; strategy to design for smaller &quot;raids&quot; or events.  <br />
<br />
Right now you can beat many raid targets just by getting enough gear on enough people, or getting enough raw numbers, to essentially slam your way through raid events that used to be thought difficult.  Most guilds do tons of things that are trivial to them.  The members don't necessarily work any harder or smarter than you would have to in order to do a rough three-group or two-group raid.<br />
<br />
To keep tiny raids or events from being completely swamped by the usual 100 man uberguild, you'd probably have to instance them like you do LDON, or make it so a zone can only hold so many players.  And like LDON, you could adjust the zone/dungeon to the level of the players.<br />
<br />
You'd need to do the adjustment better, though.  Right now, a LDON that is challenging to some 65's is a joke to others.  You'd have to measure the hitpoints or something of the whole group to see how hard the mobs should be.  Something more determinative than mere level alone.  It would take less lazy coding.  The uber-raid mentality of the game at present has made just too wide a gap between even the most lame arse AFK raider in even a sort of halfway decent guild and the hardest working, smartest casual player.  Level alone means next to nothing these days.  It has never, ever meant less in the whole long history of the game.  Something is very wrong there.<br />
<br />
Anyway, one of the things I've enjoyed the most in EQ, on both my original druid(don't hate me!) and my now fat old shaman has been figuring out little tricks on my own.  It can be very fun to find a way to kill mobs solo that scare off whole groups, just by experimenting, taking the chance of unrezzed deaths, fooling around and thinking things up.  I've made a fair amount of plat all by myself doing it too, and gotten some very nice spells and stuff for my main and my alts and the characters of friends.<br />
<br />
Raid leaders and strategists do the same thing against bigger targets as soloers and duo'ers and single groups and any configuration or number of people can do against smaller targets.  Heck, it's even harder for smaller numbers because you can't just count on having the crushing superiority of numbers or people with the best possible gear or just the right balance of classes.  There's really no reason that being smart and hard working but small shouldn't be just as rewarding as raiding -- where sometimes at least SOMEBODY is smart and hardworking, but on the other hand you can often follow along in a pretty mindless, mechanical way, go AFK for long periods, have someone log you in for a flag or to scoop up some gear when you're not even online, or even be a BOT for crying out loud.  Being a raider, even a &quot;hard core&quot; raider, is hardly the definition of effort or thought or creativity you put out -- often it comes down to nothing more than time spent.  For the vast majority.<br />
<br />
And I'm saying that as someone who raids five nights a week for usually four to six hours a night.  If I raided any more I'd have to do it from the unemployment line.<br />
<br />
Make the game just as rewarding for people who want to play &quot;hard core&quot; but can only manage to do it in short bursts or for limited amounts of time per week.  LDON gets to be too dull and the rewards aren't nearly as exciting as, say elemental loot is.  Yet getting elemental loot can take far less time than anyone spends on getting and aug'ing a piece of LDON loot.  There's no reason that the game couldn't be constructed so that one group or two or a few groups couldn't get the same level of reward for the time, creativity, and smarts and effort they DO put in as those in raid guilds get for what often amounts to merely a simple expenditure of time on their own part.  I love figuring out small things I can do on my own that nobody would think I could do; raid leaders love figuring out new things; neither is necessarily any more creative or demanding a path -- at least not to the extent that the gap between non-raiders and raiders needs to be this gigantic, echoing, bottomless canyon.  <br />
<br />
Ornate arms -- 45 hitpoints.  Elemental arms -- 135. Time arms -- let's not go into it.  The gulf between even the smartest, hardest working casual player and the most horrible, laziest, crummiest raider who ever played the game is disproportionate.<br />
<br />
Unless EQ has become &quot;Traffic Cop - The Game!&quot;  An incredible simulation of what you need to do to keep people from falling off bridges, running in the wrong direction, and drowning in mud puddles!<br />
<br />
There are many challenging, fun things besides raiding.  For many people, raiding is not even really all that fun at all, and some can't stand it.<br />
<br />
There should be room in the game for more types of people, and rewards that are more in proportion to a player's brains than strictly their ability to show up(or be botted) for extended periods of time.<br />
<br />
We need more small raid content.  That would do an awful lot to prevent people from becoming burned out on the raiding grind, and it would release meaningful and fun advancement(LDON can be somewhat meaningful, but it's not all that fun, especially when you consider the time commitment) from the deathgrip that raiding presently has on the game -- a deathgrip so pervasive that it's pretty much taken for granted by now that this kind of game couldn't possibly work any other way than by having your advancement be all about gigantic numbers(how often do you hang out with 71 other friends at a time in real life, or would you even want to) and huge time commitments.<br />
<br />
There are all kinds of ways to make a game.  EQ as it works now is only one of them.  <br />
<br />
Changing it would require a lot more coding than they're willing to do right now, but then again, they would gain and keep many more new customers if they put in more challenges for smaller numbers -- and they would keep from losing many thousands of people as they trickle away a few at a time, hour after hour, day after day.<br />
<br />
As far as a game &quot;world,&quot; this one is too narrow. Just like there are many different ways to get by in the world, there should be quite a few in EQ, not just three(raid, casual one group or solo, and LDON).  At present, it's kind of a half-made world, instead of one fully fleshed-out and alive.  Too narrowly envisioned.  Too much of types of play being polar opposites, and not enough fusion to make something interesting and vital and alive in the middle.  It's like black and white and no shades of gray.<br />
<br />
I know Ever&quot;Quest&quot; is over, but that doesn't mean Ever&quot;MASSIVE Raid&quot; is the only way it can ever be, for now and forever, unless you want to be a red-headed stepchild in the game.<br />
<br />
LDON was a nice step in the right direction for a lot of people.  We still need a more fleshed-out game, though.<br />
<br />
The mere fact that so many people can't even conceive of a worthwhile way to play besides raiding, for themselves and others, shows how dry and empty the game can be.  It's a game WORLD -- it should be more alive, like a world, full of all kinds of things to do and ways to do them.  <br />
<br />
There just aren't a lot of options now.<br />
<br />
Me, I'm forced to raid if I want upgrades of real significance.  So I do.  But you know what would be more challenging than doing X raid mob yet one more time after it's already been done 20 times, with big numbers of people?  Figuring out how to make two or three groups succeed on a tough mob somewhere.  Some people do that by ganking BOT tower bosses they're often far overpowered for ... but there are only so many of them to go around, and the gear isn't really an upgrade for me at this point.  The people who do that just sell the loot or let it rot, in great part.<br />
<br />
But it's a very fun dynamic -- it's just not worth the time in this game, when you don't get the rewards you really want UNLESS you commit to giant zerg size raids.  Or put in 10,000 hours of LDON to get a narrow selection of mostly lesser stuff.  That's not the fault of the dynamic inherently -- it's that not enough worthwhile content has been made to reward that dynamic in a game that is, shall we say, dynamically limited.<br />
<br />
That's one reason some people are so excited about WoW, and you see people posting on it all the time -- you really CAN get ahead without just doing gigantic raids.  EQ needs more of that type of creativity, and it is entirely possible to put that kind of thing in a game.  We're just so used to the same old thing that some of us can't see it or think it's a terrible thing to have variety, and rewards tied to effort and creativity and cleverness directly, instead of funnelling the rewards directly into a raiding system virtually regardless of what boneheads are in the guild or the raid.</div></div><hr />

Reading comprehension really is key to discussions like this.  Let me quote myself (as you did):<br />
Haagen, please link for me from any site you choose where I can get in LDoN:<br />
- Improved Damage 4 foci<br />
- Improved Healing 4 foci<br />
- Mana Preservation 4 foci<br />
 <br />
Haagen made a point that LDoN was near VT/elemental in quality. I provided some simple foci that were not available in LDoN to refute his point.  I never said there were none available to the casual player- I simply was making the point that there is none available in LDoN and that LDoN is nowhere near VT quality, much less elemental.<br />
<br />
Please read my posts in their entirety and detail prior to wasting time responding to a point I'm not making.</div></div><hr />

BlargX, I'd love to buy you a virtual beer.  You get it.  Just because something is a certain way doesn't mean it always has to be that way.  A truly dynamic world has rewards for all playstyles, not just one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">back in my raiding days i knew several people who would only log in a couple times a week, usually for the candyland raids.  There were also some who got home late from work every night, and could only raid for a couple hours, due to the time constraints.  These were the people who picked up all the rotting gear no one else wanted, gear which is a good deal better than what you can get on your own.  Of course these people aren't the norm, i never said that, but they were certainly better off gearwise than someone not in a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
My point was that obtaining top end gear isn't just an issue of not having enough time to play EQ.  You HAVE to be in a raiding guild to do it.  Joining a raiding guild takes a lot of sacrifices.  <br />
<br />
<br />
So which is it?  Does it only take a couple hours every few days to scoop up all this rotting loot which is way better than anything you can obtain, or is it &quot;a lot of sacrifices&quot; to get the gear?<br />
<br />
Are you even trying to be coherent?</div></div><hr />

nice selective quoting.  include the next few lines of my post.  You know, where i list the sacrifices that have nothing to do with the time you have to play.  The sacrifices are made in the way you spend your time, not how much of it you have.<br />

Sorry, I can't identify with people who guild with players they don't like.  I don't understand it, it's a foreign tongue to me.  I joined the guild I'm in because it's full of kickass people, not out of a desperate desire to be &quot;uber&quot;.  Yes, Virginia, I joined an uberguild because of the people.  Go figger.<br />
<br />
If every raiding guild on your server is full of a-holes, and that's the only thing keeping people from enjoying the raiding experience, or trying it out at least, then maybe they should try a different server.</div></div><hr />

PETS- I hope they fix our pets, as it is, I barely ever cast mine. Innate Dual wield would be a big start.<br />
<br />
SPELLS- I have most of my Ancients from Luclin. I got them almost a FULL year after PoP had been out. By that time, none of them had any value, except MAYBE the DOT, and even then, I got better for that spell slot. The new Canni is not a balance issue. I agree it should be available to ALL shaman (hell I want it on a VENDOR) but I really don't care if I ever see it. I never run out of mana, and I barely use Canni 4. Canni 5, + a couple 4's between, +FT15, plus all the stupidly sicko mana regen buffs seems more than adequate. The new Canni is a convenience, nothing more. <br />
<br />
Casual vs Raider- Most of you know my views on this, if you read these boards at all. I am a raider. I currently play less than 10 hours a week (3 hour chunks a few times a week). My guild uses a point system, the more I raid, the more I earn, the more upgrades I can get. Leaves the ball in my hands, basically. <br />
<br />
Someone here said that if you want to be in a Raiding guild you have to make sacrfices. That is true to a degree, but lets take the equation one step further, shall we? If you want BETTER GEAR you have to make sacrfices. I am truly sorry if this doesnt fit your ideal of how a game should be. I also apologize that you only got 3-5 years of enjoyment out of your &quot;casual&quot; status, while some of us aer still enjoying the rest of the content. Sure does suck to play a game that long, especially compared to the  27 other games you have played in that 3-5 years . . . mumbles something about a &quot;new rope&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'm not clear what point you think you are making, but all you are demonstrating is that this design is stupid.  <br />
<br />
There's one Luclin ancient - Ancient: Scourge of Nife.  I have it too.  It's a good dot, and I've gotten plenty of use out of it.  I don't use it much now.  <br />
<br />
There's a Velious ancient - Ancient: Feral Avatar.  This is a 3.5 year old spell now or so.  At the time it was qualitatively different, but now it's not useful.  Although I'm ST keyed, I don't have it.  It's irrelevant now, as Ferine Avatar obviously replaces it.  <br />
<br />
That you, as a self-described raider on a limited basis, only got these spells one year AFTER PoP came out says an awful lot - but one thing it doesn't say is Ancient:Chaotic Pain will be reasonably obtainable for most folks until about 3-4 REAL LIFE YEARS have passed with commensurate expansions - if then.  That's assuming the trends remain, and don't worsen as they have.  <br />
<br />
Now, you love modeling yourself as a paragon of work ethic and the value of delayed gratification, and there's certainly value in those things, but those who question the game design you incessantly defend are not lazy, stupid, hypocritical welfare cheats as you suggest.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I think it's a spell with significant gameplay effect (far more than any previous Ancient ever had), and anyone who thinks otherwise is flat-out nuts.  They will be proven wrong, but time will tell.  Gameplay will not always be reduced to the GoD style of insta-mana dump.</div></div><hr />

i never said i wanted things handed to me.  Quite to the contrary.  I just want more challenging/rewarding 1-2 group content.  Thats all.  Consider my 1 little group.  The endgame for us is the Ikkinz trials.  These weren't created as a final destination for the casual player, so to speak.  They are there to slow down the raiding guilds progress through the expansion.  As a result, when my group gets all of the 2 or 3 drops to be had from there (and augs for them i guess, since this will be our only type 8 gear), we will be done.  Plain and simple.  Either that or we have to join a raiding guild to improve ourselves, which none of us really want to do.      <br />
<br />
I'd really like to see a souped up version of LDoN, where you could pick a difficulty level between 1 and 10 (normal level is 1, high risk about a 3 or 4).  With the rewards scaled up to Time level gear.   Make the best buyable gear 5000 points or whatever ridiculous number, as long as the option is there.  <br />
While this isn't perfect, it would pretty much assure a small group  something challenging and rewarding to do when they logged in.</div></div><hr />

There are no Velious Ancients.  Ancients came about during Luclin, both Feral and Scourge are Luclin stage ancients, as thats when both came around.
