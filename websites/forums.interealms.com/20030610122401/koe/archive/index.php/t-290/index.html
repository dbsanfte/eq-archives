I'm posting again because I forgot the time I want to meet, I would like to meet in Field of Bone at the zone around 7:30 PM Eastern.  However we need a few more people, I'm aiming for around 2 groups, and we really need some enchanters.  Please come :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can get one enchanter and one healer, you can do one group in there at that level.  The exp in there is very good.  Evil types will want to be careful as this zone can trash your OT Outpost faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you very much for the info :)<br />
Obviously this raid failed tonight because other KoE plans overrode it.  A hate plane raid was postponed or something until tonight which totally bombed my plans :( That's ok, I hope to get it going sometime later.  Just watch for my port :)</div></div><hr />
