<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rebul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi, i've been wondering, all i have from the quest so far is the black dire pelt that someone let me loot while i was at MM.  i'm wondering if i actually need to kill black dire for any type of faction hits, and if i could just go get the boots now..i have not started on the epic quest whatsoever.  all i have gotten is the pelt and thats it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My advice would be to start the quest and do all the steps up to the boots....it should be easily solo-able to that part and you already have the pelt for killing the Black Dire...there is no faction hit for killing him so you'll never need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DO the first part, its insanely easy and you get a nice shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, do the first few parts. While the test of patience takes about an half an hour, it's not terribly difficult (except on your patience ;) ). You don't need to kill black dire to get the faction hit as the only faction hit for that part is from turning in the pelt. The two fools in RM aren't difficult, depending on your level. They're level 32, so if you have a pet, you can take them. They seem magic resistant, so I'd just sic the pet on 'em and use the cold nukes. Try to slow if you can, but don't blow all your mana. I killed them at 44 and it took only two blasts of blizzard blast to send them running. Anyways, good luck to you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, do this as soon as you can, those booties have saved my furry butt on so many occasions... they made ToFS worthwhile...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I doubt you will be able to turn the pelt in without having done a few of the other parts.  The epic quest is faction based, and each part of the quest you perform gives you additional faction.  If your faction isn't high enough, the mob will just eat the pelt.<br />
