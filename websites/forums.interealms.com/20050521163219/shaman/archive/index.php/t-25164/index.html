Re: Reminder - answers to my &quot;10 questions&quot; ? 		<br />
	<br />
You guys are seriously misunderstanding the point of the response.  Allow me to translate and clear up the confusion.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Don't bump old threads&quot; is actually corporate speak for:<br />
 <br />
&quot;We were really hoping this thread would drop off the front page or two if we didn't address it.  Stop posting on it so it will go away.  It looks bad when we don't actually do anything, and we don't want to call any more attention to it than absolutely necessary.&quot;<br />
 <br />
This is largely comprable to the ever popular, &quot;Currently under review&quot;, which translates as:<br />
 <br />
&quot;Leave us alone, we're having another ping-pong round-robin, and we'll get back to it when subscriptions run so low the corporate guys actually pay a visit and see that we haven't actually done anything in months.&quot;<br />
 <br />
And, of course, lest there be some confusion, anything that involves, &quot;Rytan has . . .&quot; translates as either:<br />
 <br />
&quot;Rytan suffered brain injury during the Reagan years, and now equates Shaman with Drugs.  He sees the word and just says no without further consideration.&quot; or,<br />
 <br />
&quot;Someone higher up the food chain forced Rytan to actually do something marginally beneficial to shaman, but Rytan managed to sabotage it by making it castable only on moss snakes.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Please let me know if anyone is further confused by corporate speak, and I'll be happy to translate.<br />

 I found this on the EQLive boards and thought it should be preserved here just in case it happens to mysteriously vanish.   :)<br />

.... Brenlo is not in the office this week not only due to the Thanksgiving holiday but also due to an unexpected medical emergency so I can not even ask him about getting these answers.  When he retunrs on MOnday I will ask him about it again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Which Monday do you expect him to return?<br />
