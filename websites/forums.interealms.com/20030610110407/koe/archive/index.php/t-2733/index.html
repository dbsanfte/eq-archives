<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You bet she did!! Like a ton of snowballs to the combined forces for The Corps and KOE!!  Jezebella aka Jice lead a sweetly excuted raid into the ladies chamber.. the raid forces suffered one wipe out then regroup... and re assulted the lady.. she tried to twart the second swarm yet failed.. <br />
<br />
Four groups, aided with the shameless buffing of many higher level Koe/Corps, had a wonderous time.  For many this was their first dragon slaying.. <br />
<br />
Congrats to Grayeyes for her White Dragon Scale.  Seraphina received the Hammer of somethingerother.. and the pouch and eyepatch went to The Corps. <br />
<br />
Beware old dragons.. shake in fear.. for now your days are numbered.. no longer will you prowl in your chambers all soft and cozy.. for you have a new and stronger threat... your blood will roll .. KOE/Corps will join together yet again to bring you to your rest... now go cower in your corners and prepare for death!!<br />
<br />
Congrtats to ALL!!!  Great job!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is the same thing I posted on our board...Bored, scattered, and with little to do, saturday was starting to look like another wasted day.  Then Rizz sends me a tell and we talk.  He wants to kill Nag.  Nag isn't up, but I say &quot;How about Vox?&quot; to which he says sure.  KotE hasn't had the best track record against Vox and its been eons since we have done her, but I am salivating at the chance to take out an old school dragon with alts so I log on Jezebelle and start gathering the troops. KotE people arrive and Rizz shows up eventually and we get started.<br />
<br />
Attempt #1- I totally blew this one.  I didn't check with my trackers to ensure the lair was clear and I mistimed the seiver charge. End result was Vox CHed like 4 times before the spank finally finished.  I knew, however, looking at how hard we were chewing her down, that we had her at this point.<br />
<br />
Attempt#2- Textbook perfection.  We even had a main tank for most of the fight (Fenna) holding agro.  She never got off a single heal.  I knew she was oom and that was it, she was hitting the canvass.<br />
<br />
Loots were pretty solid on the average.  Fortunately we are running with a crowd that is not out to screw us here, but I feel like we made out like bandits thanks to Rizz's overwhelming generosity.  The loots were-<br />
<br />
White Dragon Scale- Greyeyes for Bard Epic<br />
Warhammer of Divine Grace- Serephima<br />
Torbin's Mystical Eyepatch- Melrin<br />
Some gay Treasure Pouch- Modari/Morn<br />
Icecommet- Orren<br />
<br />
I would like to thank KotE for the privilage of leading this run.  Running big fights like this and doing with 26 what takes others 50+ is why I play this game.  Thank you again, Rizz and everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grayeyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey, Jice, thanks for leading the raid!!  I'm one happy lil bard!  :)  Thanks KoE and The Corps!!! And gratz to all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really have to level up a secondary...<br />
<br />
Watching from the sidelines, this was fun, but I wanted in on the action soooo bad... but everytime I got within half a mile<br />
<br />
 &quot;I will not fight you, but I WILL banish you&quot; <br />
LOADING...PLEASE WAIT<br />
You have entered Everfrost Peaks<br />
<br />
Heheheh think I saw these 3 lines about 8 times, between trying to watch, trying to get at the adds in the lair and trying to grab corpses for the CR after the first run... oh well... at least I got to whack some IGs and stuff :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Great Job on leading Jice, and Grats to all :)</div></div><hr />

CONGRATULATIONS to everyone !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Halvard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you guys for inviting me along for the fun. I had a good time even though I spent most of the raid in the bear and spider pits.  hehe   FYI Take an invis potion the only things that see thru invis are the icy terrors at least in the tunnel out. After 2 deaths I got the honor to fight with you guys and see Vox fall for the first time in my game history. Thank you all for a great time. :)<br />

P.S. There is nothing like the feeling of having FD stick when Vox and 4 ice giants are try to pound you into the ground   hehe</div></div><hr />
