<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Made a twinkie tonight, using SoW potions and noticed they wear off in about 12 minutes and they drop when zoning. Is this maybe due to the recent newb changes or are we seeing a bug here? My experience says that SoW potions will last around 20 minutes and don't drop when zoning. This is from my other characters.</div></div><hr />

Ok, it's been a long time since I used SoW potions on a newb twink, I usually wait till they're older, it was probably a coincidence that it wore off at zoning time. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, if you are zoning with less hp than 1 + your hp from hp gear (say you have 300 hp from your equipment and you zone with less than 301 hp) then all buffs and debuffs/dots fall off and you come out on the other side with 1 + hp gear and no effects on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah ha, that's it, I was wondering why I was coming out of zoning when low on hp with more hp than I could have healed in that time and that's when the SoW dropped.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

THANK YOU for that bit of information.  Couple weeks ago I was in Tenebrous Mtns and received my first buff of KEI (not something I see regularly at lvl 48). I was pretty pumped, but 2 pulls later I had to zone into Katta with a couple critters on my tail.  I was extremely low on health, and when I zoned in ALL my buffs were gone including KEI. I was pissed, and figured something was bugged...but now it makes sense.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yup. server thinks your dead.<br />
