Actually, if you do the calculations with the currently accepted formulas on eqtraders, both sets of combines will come out as about a 50% success rate at max skill (thats why the trivials are different), or 75% with the appropriate AA (dont know if rogues get a poison aa skill like our alchemy AA though).<br />
<br />
I'm going to get Mok's skill up to provide a service to the guild after I'm done doing whats necessary to optimise Yella for raiding. I picked up a kaylinite stone in the bazaar for 10k the other night, that should make a nice 45 hp + effect aug once I'm done with it. Should be fun tinkering stuff up for guildies :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I made my &quot;slightly ahead&quot; statement with the assumption of +% Alchemy modifiers. Phil. stone, Umbracite Swarm Orb, etc. When the values of a 220 or 230 skill vs. a 271 combine are calculated against a 252 skill vs a 327 combine, the advantage goes to alchemy.<br />
<br />
Thank you for pointing this out though. &amp; yes I'm still amazed that SOE &quot;balanced&quot; something to make the 2 redheaded stepchildren of tradeskills valuable.<br />
<br />
All aa's being equal between a rogue &amp; a shaman however, the rogue has a lower chance of failure when creating treanic or slugworm acid; Both skills have a triv of 151 for that combine.<br />

It's ironic. Alchemists in demand. People offering 5kpp per combine success. (Hey, if it's their supplies &amp; they understand the risk; Hell yeah!)<br />

Oh yes. You can poof the aug at 2 stages in the process. 1st when you try to improve the base stats by JC. 2nd during the &quot;etching&quot; process of applying the desired &quot;mark&quot;. With unmodified skills &amp; no AA's that comes out to a 25% avg. success rate. Scary huh?<br />

Aye, it's tempting to just sell the Augs for pp rather than actually try to use them for anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not necessary for them to be scaled since the success rate maxes at 95% at the trivial value. You get a small bonus once your skill exceeds the trivial by an amount (think its 50), but basically shaman should have about the same success rate as rogues with this combine if they have max alchemy skill + geerlok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Aye, it's tempting to just sell the Augs for pp rather than actually try to use them for anything.<br />
<br />
The &quot;flow&quot; type augs are pretty useless without being modified, so the price you can get for them should be low. At the moment the prices in the bazaar are just stupid, but I expect they will decline. Given the failure rate no one in their right mind should be paying 20k for a flow stone. I can see that some of the &quot;gem&quot; types might fetch higher prices since they can produce decent augs even after just the JC step. The flow ones are really only usefull after going though all 3 steps.<br />
<br />
At the moment the biggest bottleneck are the slugworms (trean flies are in supply because the &quot;gem&quot; style augs are not :) ). I've never seen any drop, and the only ones for sale in the bazaar are 100k atm (again, a stupid price given failure rates).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I wonder if the people charging 100k for slugworms realize they are making the finished product cost about 1 million pp?  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No, they are just stupid and greedy ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">No, they are just stupid and greedy ;)<br />
<br />
Greedy, yes. I've made several completed flowstone augs for friends &amp; guildies &amp; every time i've asked them &quot;are you sure?&quot; before sacrificing that precious slugworm. 12sta/40% haste for a bazaar geared woodelf ranger, I understand. BUT 12cha/EE5 for an ele. geared HE enchanter? /boggle. On the latter, the rng was especially cruel &amp; I blew up 3 slugworms(precious) &amp; 1 radiant skflow stone(junk) just to get it to its current minor state. I WILL NOT do that again. I'm dreading the pure stage; Wonder how many scoriae will get wasted?<br />
<br />
In the first few days of OOW I made a couple of flowstone augs that in hindsight were a mistake, but at the time I didnt know any better. +12svp/BA4 &amp; +12svc/IH4. I'm pretty sure though that the drop rate was nerfed for slugs &amp; scoriae however with the 1st oow patch; My supplies for both plummeted afterwards &amp; I can attribute only some of that to people wising up to the scarcity. As a consequence, I'm sitting on about 5 &quot;minor&quot; flow stones that are awaiting scoriae :/<br />
<br />
I don't think flowstones are useless however. The prices for them keep plummeting on prexus. I think their utility will be as nice alternatives to the ldon +6sv augs for bumping up a resist thats a little lower than the others. Just equip that radiant +12svd for example to bing up that svd thats lagging a little behind. With more &amp; more &quot;prismatic&quot; resist checks these days keeping all your svs as high as possible only helps. This is of course you can spare the slot.<br />
<br />
Gemstones are definately where it's at though. Trying to equip our guilds lead tanks with dodge3's if they dont already have it, &amp; DPS types with strikethrough &amp; fero3/cleave3, again if they dont already have the latter. Shielding is nice for everybody, especially dress-wearers.  FT &amp; IH/MP5 for the go-to clerics... It goes on &amp; on.<br />
<br />
Finally got around to making an aug for myself, spellshield/AE5. I was retired for over a year &amp; my hp's are sooo seriously behind that I hate casting C5 while soloing &amp; in sticky situations, leaving myself more vulnerable to being one-rounded down to low-hp aggro by these HARD hitting mobs. I know AE5's usefullness will decline as my hp's &amp; manna pool grows, but for the time being, the benefeit is fantastic.<br />
<br />
Time to get to lvl 70 &amp; salvage 3 :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for bearing with the long post. I've learned a lot in the past few weeks that's for sure. Any feedback you might provide would be most welcome.<br />

<br />
Wow.. I am amzaed you state this as a golden fact. Please I would love to see the refernce to this. I know for a fact someone with a alchemy skill at 37 will not make Blood of the Wolf at a 95% success rate. Even at a capped skill I am hard pressed to get 95% sucess rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">There is a hard coded limit of 95%...but I always thought it was Trivial + 100 (so around Alchemy 137 you get to 95% success on SoW potions).  <br />
<br />
Here are the calculations:<br />
<br />
Success* = Skill - 0.75*Trivial + 51.5 <br />
(rounded up, for Trivial&gt;= 68)<br />
<br />
Success* = Skill - Trivial + 66 <br />
(for Trivial &lt; 68)<br />
<br />
This is from http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=g175&amp;menustr=030000000000<br />
<br />
My 'conventional wisdom' (Trivial + 100) was wrong as well.  But it's too early in the morning to figure out exactly what the success rate for Slugworm Acid would be for Rouge vs Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: guess it wasn't too early.  My calculations show a shaman with 210 Alchemy has a 146% success rate on Slugworm Acid.  Rogues would be even higher.  So both classes are equal at making Slugworm Acid (95% chance of success).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think this has largely been fixed.  I remember when I used to make a bunch of metal bits (18 trivial, my skill was over 180) and I would get a 10% failure rate.  It was definitely more than 5%.  I had to make more recently and it seems to be ~5% now.</div></div><hr />
