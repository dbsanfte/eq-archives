<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I was just wondering if anyone has an UI that shows your HP in a different color above or below a certain number.<br />
<br />
For example, anything above 1924 HP, it's green, and anything below 1924 HP, it's blue or something.  This should make it easy to visualize when it is safe to do a canni5.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know I just need to look at the HP numbers and figure it out that way.  But is it even possible to tweak the UI to do that for us?  It's more of a curiosity thing than anything.<br />
<br />
And to add to that, is it possible to add a canni5 re-use timer on the player-window too?  And if so, how is it done?<br />
<br />
Thanks to all the UI gurus in advanced.<br />
<br />

<br />
The celtic gui has the percentage of the health bars and they change colors depending on the amount of damage but they are related to your TOTAL hitpoints so the percentage and colors will change based on buffs. So be wary<br />
<br />
Starts 100 green turns yellow orange and red depending on the percentage of health.<br />

Figured Id find the pic for it<br />
