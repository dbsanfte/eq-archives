<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Currently it's GoD.  <br />
<br />
The drama surrounding it has been first class entertainment, and it's keeping surviving high end guilds nicely busy so my lower end guild can pick off some targets we weren't getting regularly before. <br />
<br />
Oh!  And the frequent patches have been faboo for catching spawns too.<br />
<br />
All around, an A+ expansion.  Can't speak to the content, but the side effects have been GREAT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As much as I complained about the faction issues, I'm going to have to say Velious. I loved ToV.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Velious for me. The first time in Kael Arena, that was when I really felt I was in a true raiding guild. The tension hoping that some legs or BPs would drop. And the anticipation of moving on to HoT -&gt; WToV-&gt;NToV was always there as motivation.<br />
<br />
HoT was a big step up, AE-casting mobs that hit hard and fast, tough to slow, awkward pulling, maddening wipes. <br />
<br />
Never did see much of NToV - previous guilds were too small, and then when I got in a NToV capable guild we did two raids there and left it, as there was better loot to be had elsewhere.<br />
<br />
PoP would be my next choice, a nice range of targets but the progression is just too much of a pain with all the flagging for it to be considered teh best.<br />
<br />
Old world planes were cool, but PoH was more a challenge due to wacky aggro with walls and stuff. Naggy and Vox were and still are great :) Nothing like slaying a dragon deep in its lair - other dragons just aren't the same somehow! But the targets were too limited and repetitive after a while (not that I played in those early days but got to do the content later)<br />
<br />
Luclin - bah, clearing VT anyone? Emp keys? VT keys? Sure the loot is hot but you certainly had to take the pain to get any gain.<br />
<br />
Nah, Velious is the winner!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">pop, by far for me. <br />
<br />
i enjoyed vt as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Old world!  Hate and Fear break ins were classic, with no raid tools and stuff either.  Run to the safe spot, camp out and wait in chat rooms for the signal to come back in hehe.  Sitting outside ole Naggy's lair and seeing a dragon for the first time too... nice rush.  Got my hammer off of him on first raid too ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Velious then kunark then PoP for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nothing beat old time Fear raids.  Nothing.  <br />
<br />
I haven't seen an encounter yet that compared to breaking Fear with level 48 to 50 people with really crap gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gotta throw my hat in for old world content raids...I remember my first Fear break in...the warrior had a FBSS, full crafted and a pair of SSOY...was a rush lol, took 9 hrs all told and was a rough CR with no rezzes heheh.<br />
Velious is the only other expansion that I seriously raided....got a full set of Kael in the bank...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">PoFear, PoHate, and Velious would be my favorites.  Nothing like the risk of losing your body on a planes raid to put you on the edge.  Velious was great because the story seemed to stand out in the expansion.  There was a reason to be there, and you truly felt like you were part of the story.....besides, dragons are cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My vote on SOL.<br />
<br />
SOL was fun because Shaman still play a major role in raid. I remember my guild only had problem with raid target with other guild once in SSRA.<br />
<br />
I know those KEYS was a major pain but that also make my guild more closer by helping each other. Some mobs have way too much HP at that time, but better than clearing 100 plus mobs sometimes when you feeling lazy to slow 100 plus mobs.<br />
<br />
For some odd reason I do love VT raid, simple you can get 30 plus quantity loots in around 4 hours, and knowing my friends/guildies getting upgrade like that was simply great.<br />
<br />
Velious was fun but too many KS, trains and rush for the raid target.<br />
<br />
POP simple is hell, 72 plus people make some serious graphic lag.<br />
Not to mention some cock blocking form the urbers. <br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Have to say Luclin, but mainly from a standpoint of lack of real other experience.  Sure, I've done Kunark dragon raids, and ToV, and ST.  But those were epic raids and happening to have enough bodies online and mobs up (like Kland, Vindi, etc).  My new guild, however, is currently heavily raiding Luclin.  I've learned a bunch about raiding from the encounters here, and consider it my favorite for raiding.  I know, I know...I'm a n00b.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>JuyshinRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">velious; i still have my screenshot of my first dead zlandicar (in human form no less, i didnt have some graphic option turned on), with a full raid mostly dead and those still alive barely breathing.... and me meleeing him oom for the killshot. now i can stroll in and duo the thing without breaking a sweat. kinda sad. i felt important to a raid then, as compared to now... where i just sit there and watch tv until the thing dies and i can ask for its loot. and then going back to ST in the end of last year and killing kerafyrm along with 150 other people... i was still ****ing useless, but it was fun =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">PoP because boss named are scripted and much more interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have actually enjoyed everything up to PoP.  I have very few flags so experiencing alot of the raid mobs in PoP has been quite limited.  But the top of the list has to be Kunark Raids.  Yeah, the Dragons are awesome when you first meet them, but there are alot of Epic mobs I enjoyed killing too.  It was the first time in EQ where you had to have a &quot;strategy&quot;, and be flawless for victory.  Vox and Naggy were like this too, but I never got a chance at em due to....well, they were the only big kills available at the time.<br />
<br />
Even though these same mobs are soloable/duoable, I never pass a chance to go back and visit them.  My all time favorite is still Trak.  Talk about being nervous with a CR like that in your future :P  Seb is still the best dungeon in the game IMO, too bad so many people hate it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">hmm neck and neck with velious and pop raiding. Although, the number of people taking up raiding since pop is probably going to be highest, so pop I guess would get a lot of votes. Personally, I voted luclin comparitively the minority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I didn't come around to raiding until the PoP era, and I was only 58 when it came out and with me being on a European dominated server, there was no way for me to get into raiding.. so I missed the whole rush of excitement with Kunark - SoL expansions (although I've went back and have done just about everyone since.. i wasn't there for the farming days).  I joined my currect guild just before they hit time.. so most of my experience of heavy raiding has been Time and GoD.... so on that note GoD has been my favorite raiding.  I honestly think there are some innovative fights in GoD and even with the toughness of the encounters, it's been a lot of fun for me so far.  The Summoner Ring, Mindreader and the Barxt script are just events that I have a blast doing, cause they all throw different variables out there and are difficult even for the seasoned guild.  One time we might kill the boss with almost no deaths and the next time we might do it with mininal people left standing.  <br />
<br />
On that note.. our last Devastating Construct kill was one of those that I will remember for ages.  Rogue is too close to the guy pulling without SoS on and we pull two reg mobs plus the named.  Two pets were fighting and we quickly got rid of the two adds but lost alot of people to the spirit adds.  The fight went on and on with one tank standing and one pet as the dps.  Tanks def goes down and he falls and named proceeds to tear away at the dps still left when he gets to me with 2%.  I had literally me and a druid left alive in my group plus about 10 total people in the.  He hits me two rounds and then falls over dead from those that were still left alive.. mere seconds before I was run over by two of the spirit adds.  Was a hellacious fight and one that I'll remember for a while.  Twice during the fight I had to bust out my blackflame sphere to cure myself so that I could cast again.  One of the most fun times I've had in EQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Yayo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">PoP for me. I never raided much pre-pop so I missed all the fun. I did however go back and do some of the velious content I had missed but we were too well equipped for it to be challenging.<br />
<br />
Some of the PoP encounters are truely epic. Rathe, Xegony, RZ, time etc... Encounters that last a really long time. I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's too bad that all the PoP people missed the fun that was velious. <br />
<br />
It truely was a good time without all the headaches of flagging and requiring a mass army of people to get things done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Velious, with Luclin a close second.  All those nice long fights in SoL really make a shammy feel loved :D  But everything in Velious was just a blast.  I personally believe, despite the fact I do like Luclin and LDON and PoP, that everything in this game has been downhill since Velious.  That expansion was EverQuest at its best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Velious hands down, even though that was the &quot;MeleeQuest&quot; era.  It was nice to fight bosses that weren't tied to million-hour, bug infested ring events.  NToV is the best raid zone in the game.<br />
<br />
More importantly, it was easy to get into the story of Velious.  I cared about the factions.  I could not possibly care less about whether &quot;diabo xi xux aten xa xi xa xux vex xi xa xus&quot;, &quot;pixxt axxt mixxxat xxat&quot;, Morden Rasp, or some heroin chic elf ghost lives or dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I remember velious too....the squabbling over the spawns, the guilds who ran over weaker ones in front of them in NToV just because they could...ah yes, the good old days. The modern era is so much worse with it's masses of raiding content and instancing. It's so inferior to Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Certainly wasn't perfect.  Back then I made a bunch of feedbacks and posts to the effect that bossmobs should have fast respawns, but whenever you raided one of them you got a flag that would banish you if you tried to fight it again for a week (or whatever).  De facto instancing.  Only a small fraction of worthwhile raid content is truly instanced today, so it isn't like we live in some instanced Utopia now.  To be honest. I don't remember all that many serious problems until Luclin, when Europeans and guilds with largely school-aged North American populations got a chokehold on the content because of the spawn times and frequent patches.  But different people have had different experiences, I suppose. <br />
<br />
Today, I guess there is a &quot;mass&quot; of content, but there are still times there isn't much worth doing, because there is also a &quot;mass&quot; of people doing raids.  The rigid progression structure narrows your reasonable targets to a small portion anyway.  You used to be able to take a shot at, say, Yelinak whenever he was up.  Now you'd need to make sure everyone has their Dain flag, their Velks flag, their Lord Dojo flag, their Tormax flag, their Vindi flag, and 37 other flags before you could even think about having a go at Yeli.  Counting flags in the alt-r window is some scintillating gameplay.<br />
<br />
In any event, I'd rather race to content that doesn't suck than have the latest &quot;ring of annoying crap&quot; event handed to me on a silver platter.  It is like running to the library to check out the last copy of Hamlet vs having Reader's Digest delivered to your door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, I remember it rather differently, when we were making our first forays into NToV, and learning as we went along. What invariably happened is that more advanced guilds would come along and basically decide to run over us, because they had the benefit of experience and gear. It was a very frustrating time for us, and allmost broke the guild. The problem back then was that there was basically only one thing for guilds at that level of development to do, and that was NToV. It was a small pie and there were a lot of hungry mouths to feed, so it brought out some of the worst in people. Greed and inconsiderate behaviour became the accepted norm in most guilds. Nowdays its different, if someone is at a target most times other guilds walk away and do something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">velious +1 vote</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Old world for me. breaking past the giants into the dragon's lair to face an immediate assault, discovering a secret tunnel in the marshes that leads to a towering intradimensional portal, hell, even just slowly gnawing your way down to the Ishva Mal or Goblin Kings. It was great stuff, and you didn't feel like you had to win. If you lost, well, you might have a time getting your body back, but another guild usually didn't immedaitely steamroll your CR to take out your target, thus keeping you drom really doing anything from three days to a week.<br />
<br />
My next choice would have to be Velious, simply for the grandeur. Though it had the &quot;win&quot; mentality, you really DID feel like you were raiding something, taking part in a three-way war, rather than just running in, killing Raid_Mob_01, and leaving.<br />
<br />
IMO, Velious was the last good expansion. Everything since then seems so very cut and paste. Swear got god, I can make better zones with the Neverwinter Nights Toolset than the devs seem to crank out for EQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yar, Velious was the Golden Age</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Velious for the massive raiding capabilites plus the 3-way faction system.<br />
<br />
Still, i like Kunarks environment even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Velious, no contest.<br />
<br />
Remeber the adrenalin trying to break into KD arena with 36 people - I was in a mixture of Jaundiced Bone, Totemic and Rygorr, and getting tht first piece of Thurgy quest armor was just too uber!<br />
<br />
40 peeps wiping 2 times on zlandicar (or Klandi, I always get them mixed up; the one outside DN), but waxing him 3rd time around.<br />
<br />
First time in HoT (Rule 1: DONT OPEN THAT DOOR!...Rule 2 SEE RULE 1!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Luclin, the raid encounters were enjoyable and many of them unique and challenging in different ways (apart from VT, where everythings nearly the same with a AE silence, unslowblity and a few other small differences from boss mobs).<br />
<br />
Next I would place either PoP or Velious simply for Kael (I love that zone to raid in, so much fun!).<br />
<br />
Kunark is too trivial so nothing there for me, old world planes (PoF) although fun are also too trivial. Barely raided in GoD but so far its been interesting but just the usual clear to and kill boss in a straight fight.</div></div><hr />
