<br />
Actually the tremor would suck too.  <br />
I wonder if the Tribunal is friendly to Tribunal shamans?  <br />
It would be nice to get some kinda neat quest from them instead of just mindlessly whack-a-mole having to kill your own gods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If faction is in effect like with PoG I for one wont hunt there. Hosing your faction with your home town would suck. Course with SH it might not matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
~Bax? <br />
<br />
Every time you hit something you take damage.  Just like a normal damage shield except it is cast on the attacker rather than the victim.  cleric spell Mark of Karn does this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mark of Karn removes the damage shields from mobs. A reverse damage shield cast on a main tank would actually be pretty bad. Anyone with a TI-82 can tell you that an unslowable mob like the Avatar of War loses a good chunk of its hitpoints to its habit of unrelentingly hitting someone who's automatically, unreistably hitting back for 120 every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">mark of karn heals any pc that hits the npc with the mok buff on them. mark of retribution is a spell cast on npc's that acts as a dmg shield against the npc.<br />
<br />
most considered mok a revers DS because the effect was a reversal from damage to healing, but both spells can be considered reverse DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow.. that's confusing ;P<br />
<br />
Heh<br />
<br />
<br />
The AE range might suck if you have to be in melee range to cast on it though.<br />
<br />
The 'rumors' I've heard is that the Tribunal will be non-kos to friendlies, but there will be a jail area where you can go kill and quest.  Sorta like HoT in ToV, with no faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sound like fun things to look forward too actually.<br />
<br />
<br />
Along the Damage Sheild vein of thought:<br />
<br />
Traditional damage sheilds were cast on players, surrounding and protecting them.  <br />
<br />
Cleric damage sheilds became known as the &quot;reverse damage sheilds&quot; because they are cast on the mobs not the players.  Mark of Karn heals a whole 8points per main hand attack on any player that attacks a mob with said DS on it.  Mark of Retribution damages 15points, per successful attack of the mob on a target, on any mob with said DS on it.<br />
<br />
MoK's true purpose is overwriting damage sheilds rather then actually healing people, though it does help rogues and monks.  This is a wonderful tool when you really dont want to dispell that uber mob of all the debuffs, slow, dots everyone smacked on it.  Of course these are both magic so there is quite a high resist rate. :(<br />
<br />
I assume it is called a Reverse Damage sheild because the God would be casting it upon his foes, not himself.  Basically hes gonna MoR you for what looks like 10dmg, so every time someone with Justice on them attacks they will be damaged by 10 points each time they connect, along with the 800point first hit.  (*thinks of that on a rogue or monk... OUCH!*)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A MoK version of a DS from this spell would be incredibly weak overall on the god.   Whereas a MoR type spell would be insanely powerful, as it means he is permanently DSd for all intents and purposes.<br />
<br />
  MoR also makes sense on the lines of Justice.   &quot;You hit me, you will be hurt.&quot;   Tha tis far more just than &quot;I hit you and look, I feel better&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
  I would say a MoR type of spell is the most likely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  As for faction issues....  I really hope it is a NToV / HoT type zone where we can talk with our Gods, but the catch is the story of the gods.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Tribunal is 6 judges, who pass judgement over ALL beings.  And everyone is guilty of something.   There is one who brings the condemned to Trial, and he is the only being who fears no judgement of the Tribunal.<br />
<br />
 ....  SO my thought is that the 6 will be up normally.   I really hope they work like normal Gods, and summon all remaining beings in the domain when aggro'd (meaning the other 5 Gods.....).    You then have to fight a full group of gods at once.   Meaning our gods will be about the most BA things out there jsut cause they fight dirty.<br />
<br />
  If it works like that, then after finishing off the Tribunal 6, the seventh approaches for the TRUE fight of justice.    Would be cool I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">only melees should be hit by it. <br />
<br />
Assuming, of course, that your spells can hit it from outside melee range. Not always the case though...<br />
<br />
that stamina drain is evil, tanks will absolutely freak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Stamina loss doesn't mean a damn thing.  At least not yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bah it takes 7 of your gods to  do the job my one god does.<br />
<br />
That tells me my god can kick your gods' pansy asses )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah, we pwn yer pansy ass god all the time!  Like every week or something.  He's a fun kill and clearing Fear doesn't take long when you pull assloads of mobs at a time and everyone takes one.  <br />
One of these days I will also get the kill shot!<br />
<br />
Fear remains one of the most fun raid zones for me, for playing sake not loot.</div></div><hr />
