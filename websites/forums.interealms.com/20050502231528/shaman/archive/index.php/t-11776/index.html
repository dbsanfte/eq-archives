<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
Does this sound familiar to you?  My wife was always bugging me about playing EQ at night.  (usually from 9pm - Midnight).  We weren't spending enough time together after the kids went to bed. (which was true, I'll admitt) So, we tried to give each other about an hour together after the kids went to bed (watching TV etc.) and that seemed to work well for us.  Anyway, when I would boot up EQ, she would sit over and watch while I played, which was cool.  I would tell her about the game mechanics and the basic story line (good evil and about quest, etc.) and she thought that it was pretty neat, she liked the graphics alot too.  This got to be a nightly happening, so I thought she might like to play (she isnt a gammer normally).  She said yes, so I made her a kitty Shammy ( I play a Barb shammy, so she knew the basics of shammy playing), AND NOW I CAN&quot;T GET HER OFF THE COMP!!!!! heheheh.  Last night she was on from 9 untill midnihgt!!!  I'm really not complaining, I actually think its pretty funny, and I'm glad she is having fun, but this has put a serious &quot;crimp&quot; in my leveling.  I'm thinking I need to get a second comp, so we can group!!  This happen to anyone else??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">husband and wife teams in eq kick booty.  i'm sure it's fun for them too.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I only wish my fiance would start playing EQ, would make my life a lot easier :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehehehe...Good Luck Hamman!<br />
If I had started playing EQ before my wife and I got married, I'm not really sure the wedding would have happened!!  EQ caused alot of problems for us (my fault entirely).  Thank God we got it straightend out!!  Whatever you do, don't let her think that the game is more important to you, than she is!!  Just some kindly advice from someone who has been there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it's great untill she starts calling out &quot;Oh Shandrillar&quot; In bed, then you might want to rethink things ;^)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehehehehehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are you saying my honey has a name other then his game name?!<br />
<br />
Whoopsies!   ;)  :p <br />
<br />
What I recommend Shandriller is you get two computers as well as two accounts.  Sharing a game is worse then sharing a car or bathroom.  The other person is bound to be using it or needing it the minute you want to.  Plus its much funner to play WITH them then to watch over their shoulder.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
Getting your spouse to play is a GOOD thing in my book.<br />
Yes, you should get a router and a second machine ASAP. :)<br />
<br />
You shouldn't have made her a shaman imo, though your bias is  perfectly understandable. ;)  If she isn't hooked on playing a shaman yet (probably is though, lol), try to find her another class that will complement you better.  My spouse is an enchanter, and I'm never without KEI now unless I'm too lazy to get it. :D  I made several characters for my spouse (on same account initially) and it took awhile until we found one that &quot;clicked&quot;.  An enchanter was the ticket.<br />
<br />
My better half started playing at least 6 months after I started Frekkels, and now we're within 2 levels (62 vs. 60, though granted, I'm 50+ AA ahead :p) of each other.  It didn't take long at all to get us to a point where we could group together for exp, and that was with no powerlevling &amp; only very mild twinking.<br />
<br />
Husband/Wife teams are excellent.  I think they usually make great partners, and I'd much rather have half a dozen RL pairs on a raid than 12 individuals.  Fewer miscommunications occur, and there are generally less AFK's that halt the raid, since one person can autofollow and cover their partner while the other grabs sandwiches, takes care of kids, let's out the dog, smokes, etc.<br />
<br />
Most of my closest IG friends are other husband/wife teams.<br />
<br />
Aside from all that, getting my life partner to play the game eased most of the stress that EQ was putting on our marriage.  The whole &quot;come to dinner/bed/etc&quot; issues became less of an ordeal because my spouse now understood what a raid entailed.  The &quot;I can't quit &amp; leave until I get my body&quot; excuse stopped causing a fight over &quot;that stupid game&quot;.  (Of course afterwards, my spouse learned when I was tradeskilling in a city that I COULD just stop at any time.)<br />
<br />
We started out on the same computer on the same account.  Eventually, it became an issue where we HAD to get another machine and do a character transfer to a new account.  Save yourself the trouble (and xfer expense) and just buy her a new account now and another machine.  New systems are much cheaper to buy nowadays, and if you shop around you can get a deal that will likely run EQ better than your existing machine.<br />
<br />
If EQ is a hobby that you can enjoy sharing with your RL partner, I think it is great.  You'll be happier spending time together and get fewer complaints that all your wife sees is &quot;the back of your head&quot; while you are home at night. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My spouse plays EQ, for EXACTLY the reasons you listed, and it works great.  She chose a warrior because it was simple to play and I chose shaman because it went well with a warrior and because another RL friend was playing a wizard and shaman goes well with that, too.<br />
<br />
It's so much nicer having all the EQ stuff in common than it was when she was watching sitcoms in the other room while I played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Boy does this sound all too familiar!!  My hubby had a 40ish shaman when I finally decided after months of looking over his shoulder that I wanted to give it a shot.  I made a barb shaman on his account to test it out.  After the second day, hubby got me my own account set up and picked up EQ for me on his way home from work (already had my own computer)!  One year and four months later, we have the Wanderaimless Assault Team of a 65 warrior and a 62 shaman.  It works great on raids because even if we are in different groups, I can let him know what is behind him, which mob to tag next, or I can even tag a mob for him and keep it occupied by tanking it to keep it from eating the chanter. :)<br />
<br />
If nothing else, EQ has IMPROVED our communication as a couple and drawn us closer together!  The family that slays together, stays together!  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Most of my guild are couples (married or not), and family members of those people, friends, brothers, etc. It's the best way to build a lasting guild, in my opinion. Even the lowest level people in our guild have been playing 2 or 3 years, and been in the clan most or all of that time. In fact, I dont think there is anyone in our guild that has been a member less than 2 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can count Yourself lucky if You got a partner who plays EQ also.<br />
<br />
My girlfriend hates computers, she hates RPG's and she doesnt speak english very well, so much for that...<br />
Which means that I can't play very often, but what can I do.<br />
<br />
Well, apart from the 3 points mentioned above, she's cute  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wish my husband would play :(  I did get him into it a little bit, but I'd alreayd been playing for so long, and he isn't as intense about it as I am.  He got to 32 with his mage but rarely plays it, because he doesn't want me PLing him much and he wants to play with me.  At level 65 in a guild that raids pretty much every night, I usually don't have time to PL him and I certainly can't group with him! :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow, thanks for all the great replies.  I can't wait to go home, and have my wife check out this thread (maybe she'll not hassel me about the idea of a second comp) hehehehe.  It is really great to see how alot of great Guilds and teams are made up of RL partners.  The Quote &quot;the couple that slays together, stays together&quot; is kinda cute.  BTW aside from twinking her a little (Ry'gorr armor and a decent spear) she has done great on her own.  She is almost lvl 24, in less than a month of fairly sparse playing time.  I wish I knew then, what I know now about farming silks and such!  She is MUCH richer than I ever dreamed of being at 24. (about 900pp)  Anyway, thanks for all the replies, and keep the good news comming!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nannolan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My wife HATED the games I played. :(  I slowed down on my time online by waiting for her to go to bed before I logged on which helped a lot. Then one day she sparked an interest in EQ. Long story short, she started playing in September of last year and now has a 65 cleric with 30 AA's and loves playing. The key is having 2 computers though. Play together or don't play at all. What a blast!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yup need to get another computer. Shortly after I got married I was having trouble sharing the computer with my wife (both of us wanted to play Baldur's gate 2 at the same time) so against her objections I built her her own one which she was pretty happy with.<br />
<br />
When I first got into eq at the pushing of some of my friends, I knew that she was gonig to want to play too even though she was saying she wasn't interested so I bought a second copy of trilogy while it was still on sale for like $20. Less then three days after I started she got involved too and now we spend a lot of time together online.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mootski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Shandrillar, just make sure you have 'rules' by which you and she plays and you don't want things to get out of hand.  EQ can easily become 'unhealthy' in terms of free time spent playing and if she is stuck at home, the temptation to play will be there......</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My wife hates EQ.<br />
<br />
I play quite a bit and she is mostly reasonble but some times she pulls some &quot;I want attention&quot; crap when I am in the midle of a raid.  I try very hard to just ignore this kind of behavior and not reward her for acting like she is 12.  She will get mad and be grumpy for a few days, but she gets over it and then I get to sleep in the bed again.<br />
<br />
A little bedroom faction work on the wife can go a long way to make life smooth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I started playing in Feb of 2000. A friend from work told me about the game, so I went out and got it.<br />
<br />
Using my experience in AD&amp;D and MERP, my first character was a &quot;pre-fix&quot; half elf ranger in Surefall Glade. After getting to 2nd level, I decided that something else was in order. I then started a dwarven warrior, who is still my main character.<br />
<br />
This entire time, my wife was annoyed with the game. &quot;What do you mean, 'There's no pause button?'&quot; &quot;Why does it take so long to exit the game, just shut it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
I got her a copy of the game and she made a wood elf druid. Since we had two computers already, we would duo constantly once I got her caught up to me. She had nightmares about getting trained in Crushbone.<br />
<br />
She's now one level ahead of my main, and her primary alt is 3 levels ahead of mine. Once she got the hang of it, she took off and I've been struggling to stay with her. She's now has her epic, is the Guild Leader of our guild (I'm an officer) and is pretty well known on the server.<br />
<br />
Since my wife and I started playing EQ, we've only purchased one other game, Diablo II, and were both back playing EQ within 2 weeks. (We used to buy ~1 new game each a month at up to $50 a whack). So EQ has saved us a ton of money there.<br />
<br />
How many people can honestly say they spend as much time with their spouse as a couple that play EQ together? We've had &quot;raid weekends&quot; that we've been online from Friday night until Sunday evening playing, together the entire time. EQ is our together time. We enjoy playing together and miss the other when they're not playing. I wouldn't have it any other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I started this game in the EXACT manner that your wife did.  As a matter of fact I never played any games before either.  The only thing that I did do was read fantasy books, and there was a brief D&amp;D stint with my brother when I was 13 that lasted one summer.<br />
<br />
As many have said, get a second PC, a second account, and have fun.<br />
<br />
My husband and I played for about 10 months fighting over the PC, it is not fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kaldia Gaurav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I met my boyfriend in Friona Vie, he showed me how to find the bar, lol! We were online friends for several months, and since i work for an airline, i thought i'd go visit him. we've been together ever since =) was the best chance i ever took! and we still play every night together!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Falmorn Hawkborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My wife and I were introduced to EQ by some friends of ours (a RL couple).  The friends now have a 65 bard and a 65 rogue, while my wife has two mains at 51, and several 20+ alts.  Me?  I have a 52 shaman, a 25 ranger, and a 8 cleric that's gathering dust.  We've discussed getting a second 'puter and another account, but there are unfortunately a couple of problems - no space and no money.   :(   But we'd do it in a heartbeat.  After all, I'd love to duo with her warrior.  Ah well, maybe we'll win the lottery.  Yeah, and maybe I'll have over 1.5k AC and 3k HP without buffing and new gear.   :)<br />
<br />
And we manage fairly well on play time.  *That* comes from communication in RL.  I would highly suggest that you make sure to talk to each other face to face, and not in /gsay, /rsay or /tell.  It makes life much, much easier.  Just my $0.02, YMMV.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You guys are lucky, I started playing EQ about 2 years prior to meeting my girlfriend. Let me make this very clear...she HATES that I play it. I used to play EQ 4-5 times a week and couple hours at a time. Now I'm reduced to playing 1-2 a week maybe an hour at a time when she's not at home. If I have the nerve to play while she's at home I get that spending &quot;time together&quot; crap ! I don't go to the bars because I quit drinking over a year ago, I don't watch TV much because there aren't that many shows I like to watch. I used to play EQ instead of watching TV or going out getting drunk at the bar. I don't see anything wrong with playing EQ or any other game, maybe its not the most productive hobby, but its a hell of alot better then smoking, drinking, or anything along those lines. So those of you who have a significant other that you play EQ with or doesn't mind that you play...cherish that, because my 'ol ball and chain HATES it !  HATES that I like it, and pisses and moans whenever I have a desire to play it. <br />
Ahhhhhhhh good 'ol days of being single !<br />
<br />
Oh ! and they need to add one more choice to the poll. <br />
HELL NO! needs to be added.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">LOL you have no idea how many male EQ friends of mine have asked my hubby (Mahalito) and I to help them get their significant others involved in EQ.  The only thing that I tell them is to not push it.  Most of them have made the mistake of making their character for them and twinking it up only to have them not really get into playing.  What has worked the best is to let the significant other initiate the playing from character creation.  Call it pride of accomplishment :)  The way Maha got me interested is he needed some maps and info looked up.  Being a natural researcher, I did some surfing and found what he was looking for and more!  I got to thinking that it looked kinda cool so I looked up some more things.  Then I started watching over his shoulder.  Then I started running him through zones when he would get lost (I can read a map using landmarks and he can't hehe).  After that the rest is history :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Simply buy another PC, get another account for her and done. Fun to play with someone you know well, just that don't you both neglect yer own real life either, while playing :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Janathia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">A lot of these stories sound familiar.  :D   I bought EQ for my husband in Aug of 2001 for his birthday. As I watched him play it, I thought the game was silly, not to mention the graphics looked terrible.  I mean, what was the point of the game?  So you run around killing things...non stop. Okaaaay.  Whatever floats his boat, I thought. He kept trying to get me to play, but I just wasn't interested. <br />
<br />
Then Luclin came out.  New graphics!  A kitty race to play (I'm partial to cats...)!  And hubby kept hounding me to play.  &quot;We'll group together! It'll be fun!&quot;  I was reluctant so I made a deal.  He had to upgrade my computer so that I could use the new graphics.  Heh....didn't think he'd go for it. I was wrong. He did.  So, my excuses not to play didn't work anymore. /sigh   So, on Dec 9th, 2001 my first char, Janathia, was born, a kitty shaman.  Hubby also made a new kitty character with me, a beastie.  We grouped and had fun.  Then I was hooked.  Unfortunately, I became a little more hooked than he was.  He prefers to play the lowbie characters, and will delete chars just so he can start over again.  His highest character to date is a 34 pally.  Two of my alts are one level below his highest char.  Whoops.</div></div><hr />
