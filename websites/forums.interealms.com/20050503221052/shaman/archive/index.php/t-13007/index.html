Here's what I have found so far:<br />
<br />
Akheva:  In the second big room, between IV and Va'Dyn, there is a hall to the left with a bunch of stones in there.  Facing the big statue, I set up in the back left corner.  There is a centi there.  Kill it.  Spawn time seems to be 22 minutes.  I pulled 5 stones and killed them.  As I was about to pull more I stepped on the pile of broken white tiles near my camp, and triggered a trap.  A rock thing appeared and attacked me.  I killed it and he dropped a shard.  Total time:  25 minutes.<br />
<br />
Sanctus Seru.  Take the teleporter to the second floor.  There are plains &quot;legionnares of the hand&quot; and a lot of names, like &quot;Legionnare Fircka&quot;.  About my 15th kill, a named legionnare dropped a shard.  Total time:  1 hour.  (There was someone from WC here killing them as well.  About two hours after I left, he sent me a tell asking how my luck was with shards.  He told me he'd killed about 70 with no drops yet, so your results may very)<br />
<br />
Acrylia:  A short ways from the entrance, there is a sliding white grill gate with two grimling skullcrackers in front of it.  These are supposedly the only ones that can drop shards.  I killed them both and the second one dropped a shard.  Total time: 5 minutes<br />
<br />
The Grey:  Sun Revenants around the pool in the back corner of the zone.  As my 7th kill was running away it aggroed another.  I killed the add and when i checked the two corpses they both had shards.  Total time:  30 minutes  (The guy that had the camp before me got his shard in his first quad kite, so seems to be very common).<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert:  I was passing through and someone shouted that a shard was rotting on the sun revenants up on the plateu.  He said it was his 4th shard in 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
DSP:  I was powerleveling and alt in the hopper caves.  I was set up down in the big room at the bottom of the cave where 3 other rooms branch off.  I got about 4 shards in 2 hours.<br />
<br />
I did all of this easily solo, so it should be very easy for anyone in a duo.  Hope these details help.  Good luck. <br />
<br />
So, these are the easily soloable shards:<br />
<br />
Seru, DSP, SD, Grey, Akheva, Acrylia<br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye is also soloable pretty easily, but the camp is really really boring and you'll probably want company.  Fungus Grove is soloable too, but not really worth it.  Would be faster to get a partner.  The Deep shard is probably soloable but I didn't try.  You'll have to deal with lots of light blue adds.  Ditto Ssra shard.  Probably better for you to get a group for these last 4.<br />
<br />
edit:  where I said &quot;really really boring&quot; I meant &quot;a godawful crime against humanity&quot;, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah kinda what jinheim said. Though if you can find one person to duo with i think it would be considrbly easier.  Me and my druid (gasp) friend duoed almost every single shard.<br />
<br />
warning if you try to solo FG one, need to keep the bugs rooted when they start to run or you can get adds and its ugly.<br />
<br />
In acrylia caverns, the Runed (i think) grimlling is fully MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The scepter frame can be soloed as well if you have decent armor/hps.  Here's how that works.  First announce that the zone will no longer be safe for the next 5 minutes so everyone should stand clear (if anyone is actually in that zone).  Then invis up and go plunging down the hall (sow speed), go as far towards the scepter area as you can triggering traps along the way which will give you a GOD AWFUL train behind you.  At some point you'll need to train them all back out and you'll take some damage.  A virtue would help a lot here.  Train the trap-spawned critters out and then zone back in.  The trap-mobs will be gone unless they aggroed other people (who will shortly be gone teehee).  Get your hps to full, invis again, and go further.  It will probably take a couple times of training trap mobs to zone before you clear the way totally.  Once you have cleared traps tho, then go back to the scepter area where you will find a line of 4 hooded mobs and behind them, an altar with 4 &quot;sacrificial remains&quot; and above the altar will be 3 of the 4-arm types.  This part is important and you should shrunk at least once for it to work properly.  First thing . . . DONT SIT.  Not unless you are invisible at the time anyway.  You must get on the altar behind the sacrificial remains right in the middle of the corner thingy.  Only the nearest 3 remains should be killed . . . and you must kill them without taking your back off the wall or stuff will aggro and you'll have to train out again.  They have like 1hp each so mem a small nuke (burst of flame perhaps), and zap the three nearest you when they are up.  They respawn in 3.5 minutes, and at some point, killing one will trigger an invisible soul mob to spawn which you will see by his name.  Give him the wisp stone and the EE and get your scepter.  Then gate out.  <br />
<br />
Fungus Grove shard can be soloed by a 60+ shaman as well, and at 65 it is trivial.  Just play around with it some, u must kill lvl 60 mobs to get shards.  The royal guards and the warriors will drop them.  Drop rate can really vary lots.  <br />
<br />
The Deep &quot;may&quot; be soloable for a 65 shaman, but you're going to have problems with the respawn.  It will be tuff, best to take a group of under 60's along on an &quot;adventure.&quot;  I recommend grabbing people who are LFG in this level range as they often are willing to join ANY group as long as it's a group hehe.  Give yourself the first shard that drops, let them know this ahead of time.  Chances are they won't give a rat's ass anyway.  <br />
<br />
Ssra shard just group with some guildie melees who need bane weapons and your shard will drop.  Is soloable but would be a giant pain in the ass with the kind of trains you can generate in there.  Be prepared for 3-4 mobs at a time.  Best to bring some guildie melees who could use ore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've helped 2 people camp ME shards.  1st time it took about 8 hours for a named to pop, 2nd time took about 4 hours.  On top of the time it takes for the named to pop, there is the chance of a KS (which almost happened the 2nd time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At least 9 of the 10 are soloable. Maybe All 10.<br />
<br />
Shards:<br />
<br />
FG: Bug warriors and Royal Guards. Set up in the hall in front of the 5 spawns with priests and warriors. Kill the pat. Then kill the 5. They can be single pulled if you're good. Royals cannot be and there's always 2. Everything runs so root.<br />
<br />
AC: Kill the two PHs flanking the iron gates to the AC city area. Make a right and take the second left from the zonein (I think). Invis works fine. Runed Grimlings are fullly RM. All runs, so clear the 3-4 mobs first, as they run to them.<br />
 <br />
AR: Set up in Vadyn kill area (that nook left of the hall to his room) and pull everything, especially shaded stones and shaded golems. I've seen the rarer shaded golems drop them most. Rubble rousers also drop shards.<br />
<br />
Sanctus Seru: Just kill the 2 Legos of the Hand or their PHs at the zone-in. Everyone talks about the second floor, but I found too many pats to be decent. Stuff runs so keep root up. There's one pat behind the 2 zone guards to worry about; kill it imo.<br />
<br />
The Grey: 6-7 Sun Revenants around the pool. Single pullable. Easy.<br />
<br />
SD: Sun Revs on the plateau. Easy.<br />
<br />
SSRA: Shard drops in the mines on the lower floor. Mobs with corpse and drudge in their name drop em. NOT single-pullable, but slowable. This might be a hard solo if you have to clear. There are no pats to worry about at least.<br />
<br />
DSP: Kill sambatas and rockhoppers in the cave. Easy.<br />
<br />
Deep: Though Leeches drop em, most commonly across the invisible bridge. If you want to solo them, get buffs and/or a DA idol. Zerg to chasm (right, right, left, left, right I think) and jump. Hit /q in mid-air. Log back in. Fall a bit. Climb up back wall and move to THO tunnel left of burrower tunnel. There are 3 TH's you can single-pull. Very soloable for a 65 shaman. They can nuke, charm etc depending on what mob you get. If want to kill more than 3, the next pull brings 2.<br />
<br />
ME: Three camps.<br />
<br />
Seer (near DSP zone, 3 scouts near a rock). Suckbutt camp. Adds a many. Not worth the trouble to solo since you cannot single them without lull/harmony.<br />
<br />
Battlemaster (near AR zone, 2 scouts near a rock). Passable camp. Easy solo, just root pull. You will get adds and you will get trained.<br />
<br />
The Prophet (east of BM camp, 3 scouts, 2 near a tree). Best shard camp. Easy solo for a 65 shaman, tho the Prophet himself hit in the 170s with 1200 AC, nukes, snares and gates (bad if the other scout repops). Slowable tho. I'm told only the 2 scouts near the tree are Prophet PHs, which mirrors what I have seen, but kill the third so he doesn't add ever. Set up camp high on the hill tho and runners will start to walk to BM camp.<br />
<br />

<br />
Other VT key bits:<br />
<br />
Staff frame: Buff and sow. Run in and spring every trap between the zone-in and IV. Zone out fast. Invis up and move to the IV hall. Instead of making a right to the IV room, make a left like you're heading to Shei. There, you'll see a portculis (iron gate), directly across from VT room. Go thru, move along wall and into a raised stone area at the center of the room. Go to the very back of the raised area, so you're facing out. There will be 5-6 sacrificed remains there. Finish the job. A shimmering presence will spawn. Hand in a wisp stone (mage summoned) and then an EE to the next mob that pops.<br />
<br />
Planar rift: Kill emp. Kill wraiths. 40 drop each time.<br />
<br />
Orb of Luclinite: Kill any SoL boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Landragoran: &quot; ... First thing . . . DONT SIT. Not unless you are invisible at the time anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can sit just fine at 65.<br />
<br />
Landragoran: &quot;Only the nearest 3 remains should be killed . . . and you must kill them without taking your back off the wall or stuff will aggro and you'll have to train out again. They have like 1hp each so mem a small nuke (burst of flame perhaps), and zap the three nearest you when they are up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rule of thumb. If you can melee them, you can kill them without aggro'ing the 2 mobs above you.<br />
<br />
Landragoran: &quot;They respawn in 3.5 minutes, and at some point, killing one will trigger an invisible soul mob to spawn which you will see by his name. Give him the wisp stone and the EE and get your scepter. Then gate out.&quot;<br />
<br />
NO. Do NOT give the shimmering presence the wisp stone AND EE. Save the EE for the mob that you trigger with the wisp stone. See above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">FYI Acrylia shard has changed. Apparently you can zone into inner acrylia now with no key and the shard drops in there. I got that info from the Safehouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grummus works wonders for slowing the MR mobs in AC.  Ssra can be done easily with a shaman, bard, and DPS/tank. <br />
<br />
The Deep and ME are the only tough ones.  ME is just a mindless camp and The Deep is an excuse to wander through an unused zone followed by a mindless camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At level 60 a member did all 10 shards with his monk and 2nd comp'd level 60 shaman.  I did 6 or 7 of the shards solo as well.  FG, ME, and Akheva being the ones I got with a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got my Acrylia Shard last night. We camped the Arcanist who drops a 14/22 1hs and 36/40 2hs (which looks like RZTW sword, let the safehouse whining commence!)... To get there you head to the big room with the buildings, then head up the steps past the undead (gotta kill them, they see invis) Then go to the right where the ring of the High priest used to be. Click on the little statue thingy and you're inside Inner Acrylia. From the room where you enter. go north and down some stairs, and into a room with a table with lots of grimlings, and a &quot;jail&quot; type room off to the west end. We camped here for about 3 hours... We didn't see anything for 2 hours, then got 3 shards in 15 minutes time, off of the mobs called &quot;A Sanctum Bloodguard&quot;<br />
<br />
Random stuff sees invis there, hits for 160 or so, and has around 10-12k hit points... I wasn't able to single mobs at 64, and there really isn't much room. It's probably soloabe but CRing if you get unlucky would be a bitch and a half. My strategy was to trick some people by bringing them to &quot;Check out inner acrylia&quot; and secretly get my shard :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One more thing about Inner Acrylia...  Lest your non-casters think that they're stuck, the ZO is on the second floor, Sacrificial Cauldron room.  It's a blue tapestry on the wall, takes you to the AC Zone line in GF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There's also a zoneout in the jail near where I described,  you click the box thing with the spikes on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Avoozl0001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just solo'ed the new acrylia caverns shard.  Its probably easier to do now then it was before.  Just harder to get to the area then it was before. I set up shop where the gate is into the building area.  Then I started pulling all that stood in the way of the statue that warps you into inner acrylia.  Took about 40 mins for me and dogdog to get past all of those mobs.  You could probably invis after you kill the undead or even use IVU potions to pass the undead and then use regular invis to get to the statue.  But I wanted to take my time and ease my way in.  Once in inner acrylia just kill, kill, and kill.  I just root parked and let dogdog tank em.  I got mostly 75% of the mobs single, but occasionally I would get an add but it wasnt anything me and spirit call 3 couldnt handle.  My shard dropped off a santum bloodguard.  Hope this helps any of you other shaman that need to get the shard.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just wanted to add the FG is really easy to solo, there is 2 warriors on a hill before you turn to where the warlord spawns. At 65 it was a very peaceful camp that i didnt have to even pay attention to. You can single pull from the walls and  once they down there is plenty of downtime for you to go afk and do somehting in RL. Dreaded this camp hardcore, but it was probably one of the easiest for a shaman. Max hit was 171 i think, nothing puppy couldnt handle with Q once in a while. got another 15% AAin a casual camp in about 1 maybe 1.2 hours. Next weeks patch would allow you to kill more of them for more XP so would probably be even better as the soldiers were only LB to me at 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">so anyone got any ideas on how to solo/duo/trio Ssra shard ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ssra would be tough to solo/dou.  The skelly's there come in clutches, at times 5 or 6 of them and the like to summon a lot.  Don't think it'd be worth it.  Also, it's where green metal drops, so you guild should be heavily camping it anyway, you shouldn't have a probkem getting in a group there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ya , AoEing got me and 3 other people shards in 30 min. I cant image doing tht camp solo/duo/trio effectivly atleast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think it's possible to trio, but it's just not worth the risk.  One of the peeps would have to be a chenter, as crowd control is SO important here.  Having four would be even easier, with a cleric....<br />
<br />
So why not take a full group?  it's fun to tear through all those skellies and go deep into the mines  :)  I just LOVE pulling 11 mobs ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When I did my VT key I spent one evening duoing with a 62 warrior and it was ****ing hard work and not worth it.  Better to try and get a group together for it - makes life a hell of a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">To inject some light relief a Necro guildmate who due to work pressures rarely ever gets to play set out to solo all the shards. Took him a little over 2 weeks to get the lot and he did them all solo.<br />
<br />
He's a bit of a loony and died a lot, but it is doable as a Necro.<br />
<br />
As shammies only the Ssra one would be a real problem apart from the huge annoyance factor of rarity of some of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't see why you couldn't solo/duo/trio SSRA mines. I've done it with 4 with shaman as the CC (me)  We didn't really need the 4, I was 2boxing cleric/shaman and other was on Wiz/Paladin.<br />
<br />
You would have to have an IVU potion to get to the bottom where they drop the most, pull with AE slow or root most likely.  As soon as you get them all rooted away you could work on one.  It wouldn't be very enjoyable, but I don't see why it couldn't be done.  I'd much prefer the most people possible to kill off the mines, but it would be a doable challenge.  <br />
<br />
With AE slow, fast cast root/slow, and not much being resisted, it does'nt seem like it'd be all that difficult.  Be ready for a rez though, I'd imagine it'd be reasonably high risk if everything didn't go real well.</div></div><hr />
