<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">getting close to 70AA at this point and I have gotten most of what I consider &quot;important&quot; AA's. A little torn where to go from here. <br />
<br />
What I have - <br />
run 3<br />
regen 3<br />
mc 3<br />
canni 5<br />
mgb<br />
scr 3<br />
scrm 1<br />
radient cure 1<br />
virt. paral. 1<br />
healing gift 1 ( err whatever the crit heal is)<br />
spellcasting fury 1<br />
quickbuff 1<br />
<br />
The next logical step seems to be AA that help my durability. While I will get the HP increasing AA, it seems to me the 200hp I will get from maxing it out is a little silly to start with. Reducing the damage on hits taken or avoiding them alltogether seems to be more logical. What step did most of you take from here?<br />
<br />
Not hitting any of my stat caps either at this point with buffs.<br />
<br />
Opinions, ideas, theorys, flames, please.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure what your playstyle is or where you hunt, but you can't go wrong with getting ND3.. 250 or so hp is nothing to scoff at.<br />
<br />
Mix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ND3 is a no brainer. HP's help in ooooo soooo many ways.<br />
QB2 is a good buy too to get you to max casting speeds with a spell haste type item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definately ND3. You are lacking defense skill as well. Remember we are playing high aggro with slow and we need to tank some.<br />
<br />
Go for ND3, then work on CA / CS. Maybe QB2 inside for a quick torpor / quiessence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shying away from QB2 atm, level one and blessing of reverence gets the job done for me. I dont solo much these days. <br />
<br />
Spell casting mastery? guess not, mana is really not much of a problem. <br />
<br />
Channeling focus? This seems to be a skill I would really really want.<br />
<br />
The PoP damage avoidance skills require the luclin counterparts to be completed first, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have most of the same aas that you have. Differences are:<br />
<br />
I have QB2, SCM3, Rabid Bear, while you have Fury 1, Healing Gift 1, MGB (and I don't).<br />
<br />
I am now working on my tanking aas. I am going to do CA1,2,3 then ND1,2,3 then CS1,2,3. After that I will probably do LR, unless I start raiding big enough to warrant MGB.<br />
<br />
I am less interested in Channeling mastery because not getting hit in the first place seems better than getting hit and channeling.<br />
<br />
I definately found QB2 and SCM3 to be quite useful. Quiescence is 3.0 seconds with QB2, Haste of Mithaniel focus, and Blessing of Reverence.<br />
<br />
SCM3 reduces fizzles and saves a ton of mana. It means casting Tears of Saryrn more and casting Cannibalize 4 less. I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">CA3 and LR5 are awesome, yes you have to do CA first. SCM3 is also decent. Hell, so is ND3. Truthfully though, CA/LR is probably better then ND because one hit in PoP pretty much wipes out those extra hps from ND. IF I were you, hmmmm....it's a tossup truthfully in my opinion. Can't go wrong with CA/LR, ND, or SCM. I don't have channeling focus aside from 1 so I can't say how noticeable it is. I guess I would lean towards CA3/LR5 if mana is not an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Looking at the list, ND3 would be a good direction, but I'd also suggest Spirit Call (lighten up!)  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Go for the puppies! <br />
<br />
... although I'm starting to think that I'm the only one here that really likes Spirit Call. I find it incredibly useful. Not as much for the extra DPS which isn't all that great (it's basically a 3000pt, 1 minute DoT once every 12 minutes) but for the ability to offtank adds. Even unslowed, they can usually keep a mob busy for the full minute on an overpull. <br />
<br />
Solo, they're incredibly useful against summoning mobs. Root the mob, send in the dawgs, back off you and your pet and you have a minute breather in the middle of fight to regain mana and hitpoints, reslow, etc. I know people used to solo Guardian Wurms pre-PoP w/o it but I certainly couldn't w/o it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have all the AA's you have, excepting Healing Gift and virulent paralysis.  I have 106 total AA, so have some additional skills ... here's my feedback on them:<br />
<br />
I think shaman tend to undervalue SCM3 ... I know I did.  But I do fizzle less with it, and for fights where I'm a patch healer, the mana savings allow me to keep going a little longer before I have to start taking Cann IV breaks.  It is handy.<br />
<br />
I like ND3.  I like QB2.  I got the first level of channeling, but noticed no difference, so I didn't pursue it.<br />
<br />
I like spirit call ... its not a huge deal, but especially when soloing the ability to do a good bit of manaless damage is handy.<br />
<br />
I'm currently following the Combat Agility and Healing Adept chains at the same time.  (ie, HA1 &gt; Ca1 &gt; HA2 &gt; CA2, etc).  I'm pretty sure I find CA more valuable that HA.  I may leave HA at level 2 and finish up CA first.<br />
<br />
The critical nukes have an odd appeal to me, I spent two points on a lark on crit nukes, and I really enjoy the skill.  It's fun, even if our nukes suck.  I'm always tempted to take it up another level or two.<br />
<br />
Just some observations,<br />

Get that and ND3, can't believe you haven't already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Do not underestimate SCM3, despite what people say shaman can run oom very easily if they are doing their job well (ie doing more than just slowing), and it gives a HUGE mana improvement.  Extremely noticable, and very useful.  ND3 is also good, especially for when you want to canni5 just after a rez w/out low health agro if your hp is not yet high enough.  Haven't started CA3/LR5 yet but i have heard very good things about it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Radag, I hope to god that you were joking- 62 AA at level 55?  Jesus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OMG..... SCM !!<br />
<br />
SCM is the number one AA for any casting class .. after that get ND maxed out then the defensive ones (they do so much)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Spell casting mastery is Definitely nice. I put it off for quite a while and basically did all 12 aa point for all 3 lvls of it in a few days after pop came out. Made a noticable difference. Yeah shaman can generate mana at a pretty impressive rate but we can also spend it very fast and when you're generating your mana you can't do anything else.<br />
<br />
ND is nice for you it would add about 250hps unbuffed. Never a bad thing really. Would give you a bit more slack room on cann v for safety and would get better as your gear gets better.<br />
<br />
QB2 is a nice one too. Thats where i'm personally stopping to allow and item to max haste out at 50%.<br />
<br />
Of defensive abilities CA/LR seems to be the best of the bunch and if you want to improve your survivability max that one out first before touching, CS/ID.<br />
<br />
Spirit call is fun and the later lvls do get cheapper too.<br />
<br />
Personally I just spent 3 points on metabolism. It's cheap and makes a major difference on your food consumption on your horse. Definitely worth it if you use a horse alot, especially if you use stat foods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Agree completely with Ineluk -  and not just because he's from my server and an ex-guildie! SCM allows you to do things you couldn't otherwise - mana may not be a problem in most situations, but when you start having to chain cast Tnarg's to keep people alive, you will appreciate it. ND is a no-brainer too - an extra 250ish hp that doesn't take up an item slot. I'm working on the tank AA now (CA2 so far) and I like them, but I wouldn't get them before scm3 or nd3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Improved Meta is very under rated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">SCM it is then, thanks for the info folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Some of us say that Shamans do not have mana problems, so we should not need SCM as much. However, consider that there is probably no class that casts as MANY spells per hour as a shaman does. We are literally always casting a spell - even during our downtime.<br />
<br />
SCM comes into play every single time you cast a spell (well, not including Canni4). From that perspective, you can see why SCM is really VERY good for shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>hamani101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">nd3 was 316hps exactually for me with sta maxxed at 280 ...<br />
<br />
also question on combat agility, people in guild have said i works off of your dodge skill, anyone know any truth to that? and if so how could it be any good for us considering we have dodge at 75</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Any thoughts about Planar Power? <br />
<br />
Personal situation is that PP will benefit with Wisdom and Stramina.  Wisdom at about 285 and Stamina at 247 unbuffed.  <br />
<br />
Have very similiar AA's, have ND3 but only QB1 (8th shawl) and SCM1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Personally Planar power is pretty low on the list for me.<br />
<br />
On the sta side of things you get half the hps you would pre 255 for post 255 sta so for shaman thats 1.5 or 1.65 with nd3 hps per sta so the 5 point increase in max sta gets you a wopping 7-8hps. On the mana side it isn't quite as bad ends up being like 35 mana but still nothing major. Not worth spending the aa on imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I thought ND was calculated on your base hitpoints, so if you have 1200 base (nekkid) then you would recieve +120hp from ND3 (10% increase).<br />

ND affects your geared hps, but buffs don't get ND bonus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ND3 is calculated using your base STA + Stamina Effects (gear, spells).  If your HP is 2500hp with only your gear and a stamina buff, then you should get +250hp.  It would be interesting to see if Kragg + IOS + STA would give more or if it would still give less (since Kragg &lt; Soul).<br />
<br />
It does not include direct hp effects like Focus and/or Aegolism.</div></div><hr />

Yes 62 aaxp at 55 with 30 in the bank.  I am sad to say that at this time I plan on leveling up to 61 or so for the new pet and farming for trade skills.  I very much wanted to compleate ND3 CA3 CS3 CF3 and SCM3 before leveling up but the trade skill farming is just starting to take up all my time :(.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does the 8th shawl have to do with QB1...  does not the effect on the 8th grant an adition 20% duration to buffs spells.<br />
<br />
So with scr3 + scrm + 8th shawl == 70% extended duration on buffs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm just adding my two cents...<br />
<br />
I didn't even bother looking at all your AA because two big ones got my attention right away.<br />
<br />
I would spend your next 24 points on maxing SCM and ND3.  If I had to do AA's again I would get ND3 and SCM3 immediately after Canni5.  They are excellent to have maxxed.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">SCM3 and ND3!<br />
<br />
and I still heavily recommend biting the bullet and getting QB3.  Less useful as torpor decreases in usefulness in POP, but then you get Quies and with no negative effects and the low mana cost it's my primary heal once again, supplemented by Kraggs/Tnargs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Radag just out of curiosity, why did you get 92aa before level 60? Level 60 is the sweet spot for Shamans. My only possible guess would be you found a very sweet spot for aa at 55 that goes lt blue/green at higher levels. A solo spot of course. If my guess is true, I wonder how that spot stacks up against aa in POP which is pretty fast. How fast can you crank out an aa point, assuming my guess is correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I personally would not get qb2 if I could do it again, definitley don't do qb3.  qb2 is a bit nicer than qb1, but I would rather spend my points elsewhere:<br />
<br />
Haste of mithaneil + qb2 = 45 % haste<br />
Haste of mithaneil + qb1 + botr = 40% haste<br />
Haste of mithaneil + qb2 + botr = 50% haste<br />
<br />
10% haste for 4 AA points falls into luxury in my opinion.  It was huge when qb was the only way to speed up buffs, but not so important now... I'd Only do qb3 if you're a hard core pre-pop solo finatic or can't find a Haste of Mithaniel item to suit your needs.<br />
<br />
As for the initial 6 points, I wish I did run 3 and metabolism 3. regen 3 is not noticible but buying food is...</div></div><hr />

If I could start over I would skip regen3 and get metabolism3. Once I got torpor 3hp regen means almost nothing. But the damn horse is way to hungry.<br />
<br />
After maxout ND / CA / LR / CS / ID I think to power up tnarg's mending. What would you do: max HG / AHG 1st, then HA / AHA or max HA / AHA 1st and then HG / AHG. Or build both up at the same time ( HG1 / HA1 then HG2 / HA2 then HG3 / HA3...)?</div></div><hr />

I only have 62 aaxp total with 32 spent and 30 in the bank.<br />
<br />
I have no special sweet spot and I did most of the aaxp at 53 at about 3 and 1/2 hours per aaxp.<br />
<br />
At one time this character was lvl 60 but I sold the exp bar to twink a monk and played a monk exclusivly to level 54 then  I quite EQ for a time.  When I came back I decide to pick up my shaman again (10 aaxp and level 51) and naked.  I remember how painfull was at 60 before (pre pop and it was taking about 8 hours for an aaxp with malo / torpor / no epic).  After thinking about it for all of 2 seconds I decided that it was better to get faster aaxp and farm for equipment at 53 then it would be to go back to 60 and have total garbage for equipment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Hmm - after re-reading what was posted here about Natural Durability, I am thinking it might be better than I figured.<br />
<br />
To clarify - I have roughly 1000 extra hit points from +HP gear (not +Stamina Gear). Will ND3 affect the HP from those items, making it 1100 HP?<br />
<br />
With ND3, if I equip an item that adds 50 HP (and no Sta), will I actually gain 55 HP?<br />
<br />
I had always heard that ND affected Base (naked) HP and HP from +Stamina items and buffs, but I was not aware that it increased HP from +HP items.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should have done ND sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Like someone above said, if you got 2500HPs (with gear + Sta buff) you would gain 250HPs from ND3.<br />
<br />
<br />
How much HPs would you want to get from 1AA?<br />
With 3000HPs(sta buffed) and you buying ND1,2 and 3... broken down, 1AA = 25 gained HPs.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: Back on topic.  SCM3 then ND3 would be my advice on AA path. I was going for ND3, but got ND1 and bite the bullet and did SCM3, less fizzles = great. 10% less mana on all alteration spells, 3% less mana on all other spells adds up alot.</div></div><hr />

The way that they spawn one after another means if you start moving as soon as cast time completes you can space them out a bit, so that they are pushing exactly where you want them to.

and getting ready for CA2.  i wanna get CA3 then will think about SCM or scr3+scrm (most likely wont happen).  also wana get LR5 sometime soon.<br />
<br />
Worst part about AAs for me is my slow rate of getting them.</div></div><hr />

But I do fizzle less with it, and for fights where I'm a patch healer, the mana savings allow me to keep going a little longer before I have to start taking Cann IV breaks. It is handy. <br />
<br />

        Hummm are sure about the fizzle ? I have SCM2 and i still fizzle like hell . I know this write in the aa description but well verant....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Okay, I don't know if I can add a lot to this discussion, but what the heck, I'll throw in my 2 cents.  Maybe someone will get some use out of it.  I'm level 65 and got 212AA atm, so I have a smattering of skills.<br />
<br />
Here's the profile.  Equipment is a bit out of date, but the AA's are correct.  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=261042<br />
<br />
I agree with most people on the initial stages--run3, regen3, MC3, canna5.  <br />
<br />
If you are in a raiding guild, MGB.  Also nice are SCR3 and SCRM.  One note on SCRM--if you have something like the blessed coldain prayer shawl, or another buff duration extension item, I'm not 100% sure it stacks with SCRM.  I have heard (though never bothered to check) that buff duration can't go past 2x the original spell.  Perhaps someone here has tested it and can correct me on that.<br />
<br />
My recommendations on AAs from that point depend on your equipment.  It's a no-brainer that hitpoints are vitally important.  I'd recommend going with hitpoints whereever possible until you can canna 5 with self buffs on, and still remain above 1.75 bubbles of hp (ie, not get low-hp agro).  After that, my personal recommendation is to go for combat agility 3 and lightening reflexes 5.<br />
<br />
ND3 might give you 250 hp.  So what?  That's less than 2 canna's, and not even 1 hit from a mob.  CA3 and LR5 will get you hit 1/3 less.  With mobs hitting 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hundred a hit (frequently doubles or even quads), which is better?  250 more hp or not getting hit for a couple of times?!?  No brainer there.  CA and LR are GREAT.  Sooner or later, you will get agro unless you are so cautious that you're limiting your group(s).<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd avoid the healing stuff until you have pretty much everything else covered.  The healing AAs only work on tnargs, endgame.  That's quite a limit.  12AA to get an aditional 130 hp on your heal isn't worth it when there is other stuff to get.<br />
<br />
I would also recommend combat stability and innate defense over additional HP skills if you can self-buff canna with no agro.  On most yard trash, my average hit with CS3 and ID5 is probably about 200-300 depending on how hard their max hit is (still toast on boss mobs, mind you).  It goes REALLY well with LR5.<br />
<br />
Quick buff isn't bad, but it isn't worth the AA IMO compared to LR and ID.  Especially LR.  Let's face it.  Aside from torpor/quiesence (which can't really heal that well in PoP anyway), why do you need to cast buffs fast?  Answer: you don't.  If you have spell haste items, it's a real waste.  Spell haste is hard capped at 50% regardless of what items/AA you have.  You can't shave more than 1/2 the cast time off.<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure 1 is a good investment early.  You can take a lot of stuff off with it.<br />
<br />
Virulent paralysis 1 is a good investment to get a mob off of you when root fails.  It's situational, but it works.  Also, if you have 2 stacked mobs and can't target . . . well, it's surprisingly useful at times.<br />
<br />
If you want a toy, spirit call is fun and cheap.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, I can't recommend the CA/LR line highly enough.  The CS/ID line is also very good.  Maxxing both of those takes 54 AA, and it's WORTH it.  You can start to see improvements in just about every level of them you get.<br />
<br />
After you max LR and ID, then I'd probably go for SCM, depending on your mana regen/wis.  It helps, but not as much as people seem to think.  You may have some kind of mana preservation device anyway.  If you have something with preservation of mithanial, or mana preservation IV, it just isn't gonna help all that much in comparison.<br />
<br />
I haven't noticed a great improvement from channelling focus, so . . . up to you.  I wouldn't be in any hurry to get it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Modify your Magelo profile manually, temporarily:  check ND3 skill to find out how many HP it would give you.<br />
<br />
Apparently ND3 does increase the HP value of straight HP gear.<br />
<br />
ND3 is not just about absorbing more hits. It's also about hitting the Canni V button and having more HP left over - very handy for those of us in the 2K's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">SCM3 , ND3, CA3 are best archtype AA, SCR for longer is nice after get them all, MC3 is need for canni3 :(<br />
<br />
canni5, GB2 is must have skill !! also MGB if you in raid guild not matter how many other shaman have MGb already<br />
<br />
for PoP, SC1 is fun AA, RC1 is useful sometime, LR is good too..<br />
<br />
I have 128AA now, if I start again I will  get AA in this order : MC3-&gt;canni5-&gt;SC1,RC1-&gt;GB2-&gt;ND3-&gt;CA3-&gt;SCM3-&gt;SCR3-&gt;SCRM-&gt; LR5 -&gt; other</div></div><hr />
