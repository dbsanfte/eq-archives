<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magoliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can't decide between either an iksar or vah shir as race for my shaman.  I'm thinking iksar because of the AC and regen.  But I have never played a vah shir and I believe that they have no xp penalty (feel free to correct me if I am wrong).  I think I might lightly twink it as I get money, speaking of that anyone know a good spot to farm cash as a 57 mage?  I have also played an iksar shaman to 21 *my very first character post 20 and I loved it*<br />
<br />
Any help and suggestions would be greatly appreciated,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Statistically Troll and Ogre make the strongest Shamans, but they also have big exp penalties, and also Troll regen supposedly becomes less and less of an impact at higher levels. If you don't want an exp penalty, go with barb or Va shir. I believe the difference between the two isn't very much, but I I'm pretty sure that Vashir get natural ultravision at the expense of very high food consumption, while Barbs are just the middle ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">which is the best class?  which is the best race?  all depends on your play style and what you feel comfortable about.  You've chosen Shammy, fine....  Penny encapsulated the differences between the races above.  If you can deal with being big, ugly, hated and have a big exp penalty, Troll is a fine choice.  If you want to be cute, friendly, eat twice as much as anyone else out there and sneak, cats are your choice.  Iksars have a good natural AC, regen and +100 whine about no JBB.<br />
<br />
It's all your choice, in the endgame, we're all very much alike</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haha Magooooooooo ... Its all about play style .. i chose iksar, never looked back. With the Velious armor it doesnt matter anymore, yeah Iksar have crap for armor at lower levels, But you can find stuff to get you by.  The biggest argument you'll find is JBB vs Iks regen.  <br />
<br />
JBB not usable til 49<br />
Iksar cant use JBB  <br />
Regen is king for soloing, I always have loved it. <br />
Ive played a barb shaman, with a JBB.  <br />
Comparison i found between them. There isnt one, its a myth.<br />
<br />
A good played shamn will never notice the difference between races, why you ask? We all do the same thing. Its not about Race of Shaman ... its the person behind the Screen playing him.<br />
<br />
just my 10pp worth.  See ya in game bro</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its not been comfirmed about kitty racial penalty, but general consesusu is that they have NO exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Barbarians have 5% penalty.  Thus so far katts are the easisest race to lvl, although at high lvl they are maybe the weakest, as they have noticeably lower Hps.<br />
<br />
I have a sneeky suspiscion that froggs will have a 5 or 10 % racial penalty, as they supposedly have lots of useful racial advantages.....lol    yeah right ....they can hold there breath a bit longer, yery useful  :P<br />
<br />
Although very cute katts have an awful melee animation- look like they doin a 1Help the aged1 disco dance, its pretty ugly.  However they seem to run fast wich is nice- babrs run like they waering cement bots, and ogres kinda wobble anlong.<br />
<br />
perspnally if u gonna do aa exp alot id say that 20 % penalty is a real pain in the arse....<br />
<br />
So in conclusion...i have no idea wich is best race LOL<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's true vah shirs don't have any exp penalty at all. I leveled up my cat more or less solely in a duo with a wood elf and we got the exact same amount of exp all the way up.<br />
<br />
Cat's safefall and sneak abilities really should be valued more than they are... very useful and conveniant.<br />
<br />
2 things I really miss, though, are regen and bash from when I was a troll. Switching from troll with a fungi tunic to my cat made me wonder if cats had negative regen :( ...and no matter what some say - regen is the best still at 60 with torpor, just not that game changing as it is while leveling up.</div></div><hr />

I had always heard that racial penalties don't apply to AAXP...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would just say start up one of each race you are interested in and drive it around for a bit.  I have played an iksar to 52 a troll to 36 and a ogre to 60.  I like driving an Ogre the best but I miss the regen on the other 2.<br />
<br />
I think the strongest shaman race overall is probably troll frollowed by the lizards.  Ogre is probably the best for raid slowing.  I would probably be a troll but I have a spare tire in real life and did not want one in game.</div></div><hr />
