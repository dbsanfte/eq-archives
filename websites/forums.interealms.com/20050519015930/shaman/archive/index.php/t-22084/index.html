<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kabruk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if the emp key can be solod by a 65 sham with relatively good gear and skill.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm.. well, certain parts of it can be.  Hardest part is getting the damn things to spawn.  However, I don't think that you can get the final piece needed by yourself.  Can't remember the exact name of the item, but it's the one that drops near the port in point where Emp ssra is.  In that room only the named drop the pieces and they have about a bazillion hps.  Even with 30 people there it takes about 5 min to kill each one.  To a shaman if you could do it, would take 2 hours</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Commanders are pretty easy themselves. I think a shaman could solo them with fairly good gear (probably with gear as good as mine or better). Getting them to spawn IS the hard part. And the elites on the second floor are immune to slow...and flurry...and eat dogdog for a light snack. Commanders are fully slowable (from my experience). Summons too, so no root rotting. =(<br />
<br />
Taskmasters, some are partially slowable, some are fully slowable from my experience. Possible to solo pull at 65 so very probable that a shaman could solo them.<br />
<br />
As for the insignia, I'll go with what Valsuvious says, since I haven't been there yet. But usually you can pick up one of those when you go to kill the emp.<br />
<br />
Edit: I'd suggest finding a tank-type person to duo them with for safety. I did pretty well with a 65 mage friend. Otherwise you'll have to tank &quot;in teh face.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One other potential problem is if the Commander spawns in the Assassin room.  You can't get there unless you have a rogue pick the lock.  And if there's a commander up in 1 spot on the first floor, he won't spawn anywhere else.  So if he spawns in the assassin room, you're screwed if you're by yourself.<br />
<br />
Advisor Zekuzh (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8733), Arbitor Korazhk (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7860), and General Kizuhx (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7859) are the 3 mobs that drop the Ssraeshzan Insignia (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17286).  The problem with soloing them is that they've got an enormous amount of hitpoints, 1 has a wicked knockback AE, and many times they come with friends tagging along.  However, my guild will usually have unkeyed people along that can loot an insig right before we port into the Emp's prep-room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are some mobs that are unslowable that spawn around the commanders areas. But if you have a decent paladin or SK with you, i think you could manage even those without working up too much sweat.<br />
<br />
Insignias are harder. My guild used to clear the insigna room for those missing it before each emp raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Level 1 is simple to solo and get your com 1 part (the idol). Com 2 will be more difficult soi recommend you come with a tank, you, dps, healer (or DPS, depending on how competent you are at healing). All the elites are unslowable and flurry for com 2 so its a difficult solo. Com 2 himself is similar to com 1.<br />
<br />
The pouch won't be too hard, once you get into the basement go in and right, and right again so your in the corner of the room. Warden Mezukh (sp?) will path by and he drops a pouch, won't be too hard to solo. Theres another 2/3 TMs that are defintely soloable by a shaman but I've forget there names unfortunately. www.eqmaps.com has a good map for Ssra basement so you can find the TMs easier.<br />
<br />
The final part, the insignia I wouldn't reccomend doing with less than a group and a proper healer (cleric). The normal mobs have around 100k HP and te nameds have 200k HP. Luckily they pop after about 4/5 PHs have been killed. I personally prefer to do it with a raid before going into emps room as its much quicker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You have to remember that this being non-Pop if you bite it, it makes for a very nasty CR.<br />
<br />
Try to get some other folks to go with you.  This is trivial for a single group, yet kind of risky for a solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Agree... if commanders are already up in a spot you can't get to, you're done.<br />
<br />
But commander camps can be solo'd.  Theoretically, you can just keep two or three spawn spots cleared and get a commander to spawn.  Then you don't have to worry about the unslowable elites.  Fully slowed, you can easily tank these with Q alongside of doggie.  I usually do this with a mage or necro though and you can tear em up.<br />
<br />
Never thought about soloing a taskmaster, we get them when we go down to do cursed cycle anyway.  Insignia definitely needs some help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Com2 commanders summon.  I think they are immune to slow too, if I can remember.  I got mine duo'ing with a BL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unslowable: elites on the second floor; 3 of the 8 named Taskmasters in the basement (Kavamezh, Zerumaz, Warden) -- Guide to High Level Slowing (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=12590). The first floor is friendlier.<br />
<br />
All the mobs summon I'm pretty sure.</div></div><hr />

Com 1 is an easy solo and actually pops quite a bit more frequently than what I have read -- just soloing around the right swimmy, and killing everything in that room a couple times is enough to get him to pop.  There are two guards right behind the entrance to the room (in front of the swimmy ramp), but they come single if you pull from just inside the hallway.  I've done this guy several times now (after I soloed it, I helped several different guildies get their idols).  I've never bothered with the other camps to get this guy.<br />
<br />
Com 2 is a little tougher camp (up the right swimmy), and is a much rarer spawn.  I don't like to solo this as I cannot kill them fast enough imo.  Also, the elites seem to pop more frequently here, and I cannot solo those.  I have done this with a mage, a necro, and a wizzy duo though.  And, it was super easy each time.  However, I've only seen this guy a couple times in about 8 shots at him.  I haven't gotten my ring yet, although a couple have dropped.<br />
<br />
The insignias definitely require a group (at least for my guild).  There are some guards that block the entranceways that need to be split, for one.  And, we have even seen two named spawned in the guard spots that we had to break through.  The monk pulled em to the right as he ran in first.  Then, the rest of us tagged the first one to come back and pulled it to the far left.  The named aren't slowable in this camp but are stunable.<br />
<br />
The pouch is an easy pick up if you do Cursed at all.  If you do, I wouldn't even worry about soloing it.</div></div><hr />
