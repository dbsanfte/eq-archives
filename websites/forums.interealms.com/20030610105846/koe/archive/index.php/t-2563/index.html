All I can say is, I will be very suprised if they don't win this year... if everyone stays healthy.</div></div><hr />

Honestly Zou, you'll learn to be disappointed in what Hullie brings to the Deadwings.  &quot;The Spoiled Brat&quot; (used when mentioning &quot;The Golden Brett&quot;) as he's known as in St. Louis will not be the catalyst that wins you the Cup.  St. Louis &amp; Dallas learned from their mistake of paying him the millions he and his agent think he's worth, and dished him off.  Guess Detroit is next in line for disappointment and a let down, hope you enjoyed throwing your money away ;)<br />
<br />
All this does is give my Blues more reason to pound your arses into the ice everytime we face you this season.<br />
<br />
You'll have to get past us first ;)<br />
<br />
&lt;H1&gt; GO BLUES!!! &lt;/H1&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Brett Hull had a tremendous scoring touch. He was a natural goal scorer in the truest sense of the word. He has put up numbers throughout the course of his career that make many &quot;offensive stars&quot; green with envy.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly for the Red Wings, they got him 3-4 years too late.<br />
<br />
He will show flashes of the offensive brilliance that have been prevalent throughout his career, but he's another old man on an old Detroit hockey club. He'd be a boon to many clubs, for his experience and leadership. Hell, in Dallas they actually taught him to play in the defensive zone! But Detroit doesn't need another aged star, well past his prime: they need young blood.<br />
<br />
Right now Detroit is an old team, that keeps getting older.<br />
<br />
Now, I have to confess I am giggling about the Rangers aquiring Eric &quot;I'll suck my thumb if I want to!&quot; Lindros.  I think they gave up a LOT of talent and potential for a player who will be lucky to play half the season. Phillie is a divisional rival, and you're kidding yourself if you don't think that there are Flyers ( as well as others throughout the league) who are gonna be hunting for ANY opportunity to smoke Lindros and end the career of the biggest waste of talent and ability in NHL history.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually from what I hear, is that if the Cry Baby goes out during this season Philly has to pay up some cash. That was in a paper down here. Now, of course I have no idea if this is true but who knows. I thought as well that Philly will be going after him, but if Clarke has to fork out cash for Eric getting hurt during the season I dont think he will be marked. But who knows. <br />

GO LEAFS!!!<br />
GO PENS!!!!</div></div><hr />
