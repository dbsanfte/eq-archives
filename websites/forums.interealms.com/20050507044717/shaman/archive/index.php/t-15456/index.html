<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Omri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From what I understand, mounts consume food/water at an increased rate. So what im wondering is, I keep a stat food in my 1st inv slot and forcefeed myself fishrolls, when im forcefeeding myself will this also forcefeed the mount?  I just dont want him to be eating all stat foods.<br />

Best advice is to keep the cheap food in the early inventory slot, and click your stat food only when you need it from one of the last inventory slots.</div></div><hr />

I'm confused, cheap food in early inventory and click the stat food?<br />
<br />
So basically if I have a bunch of patty melts, and 1 halas meat pie, I can eat the meat pie to gain it's stats, then the patty melts will be the only thing left and I will retain the stats? <br />
<br />
I was under the impression that you eat to fill yourself up and then put stat food in the top inventory slot (higher than other food).. and then you just force feed yourself the other food.. does that not work with horses?</div></div><hr />

If you only have 1 Halas 10 lb. meat pie and force feed it, you will lose the stats. If you keep yourself full by force feeding the cheap stuff, you won't have to worry too much about your stat food...although I keep at least 5 on hand, instead of just 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, put the Halas 10 lb meat pie in your bags as the next item you will eat. Then gorge (manually eat) your cheaper food, like patty melts. Since you force fed yourself, the meat pie wont be eaten for some long period of time.<br />
<br />
You only get stats from food/drink if the stat food/drink is the next item to be eaten by the automatic food/drink consumption system.<br />

Innate Metabolism 3 reduces your need for food and drink by 50%. When sitting on a mount, that basically takes you back to what you used up before you had a mount without Innate Metabolism. With Innate Metabolism 3 and not on a mount, your food and drink will last twice as long.<br />
<br />
When I first got my mount, I thought I was going to go bankrupt buying food. Dropped 3 points into Innate Metabolism, and worry about it about once a week now on my shaman, and every couple weeks on my rogue.</div></div><hr />

False. Innate Metabolism 3 will make your food last half again as long.<br />

Item's for horses/drogomor's would be nice too. &quot;A more comfortable saddle&quot; could give an extra 5 points of FT. :)</div></div><hr />

This is sony we're talking about. Thier descriptions of other aa's are know to be compleately innacurate (SCM for example). My personal experence with IM3 is that is sure as hell makes food last alot more than 50% longer. Have I timed it? No but I went from going threw a stack of stat foods like HMP's or misty picnics in a week to them lasting 2-3 weeks. Before getting IM it was soo bad using a horse frequently that I was using iron rations. IM makes a HUGE difference.</div></div><hr />

ok... 1 point reduces hunger and thirst by 10%, 2 points by 25% and 3 points by 50%.<br />
<br />
Unless sony has lied to us...<br />
<br />
A horse/drogmoor will double your consumption of food/drink.<br />
<br />
IM3 will reduce your food/drink consumption by 50%<br />
<br />
normal usage rate of 1<br />
<br />
mounted usage rate of 2<br />
<br />
IM3 usage rate of 0.5<br />
<br />
mounted with IM3 usage rate of 1</div></div><hr />
