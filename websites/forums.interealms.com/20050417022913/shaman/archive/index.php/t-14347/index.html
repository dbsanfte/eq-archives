<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>faffon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yeah, i cant seem to find a good place to group.  I was gonna try HH but being KOS really makes that anoying.  DSP is still to high, and split paw is always empty.  Any advice would be great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ihopp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mseru is always nice. If that does not work for you then I would recomend heading out to LoIO to the Sarnak Fortress.  I am sure that will get you some nice XP. <br />

You know, you can always chill in PC till lvl 26:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chelesa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One place I've been trying out lately as a wizard (24)with my husband (beastlord 25) is the lizards outside of Cazic Thule.  The experience is nice and steady and fine steel seems to drop quite frequently, making it loot friendly.  Occasionally you'll get an add with your pull, but for the most part we are getting singles each time.</div></div><hr />
