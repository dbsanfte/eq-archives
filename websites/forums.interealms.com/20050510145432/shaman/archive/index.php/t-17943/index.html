<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play on a red server and since I do we usually pvp some. Well last night I was going up against an enchanter, which isn't all that hard. You dot yourself with a nice long disease dot so they can't mez you.<br />
<br />
I toss the low dis dot, Sicken, on me and guess what? It is doing no damage to me. Now I have a dot on me but it isn't breaking mez. Long story short, I lose the battle.<br />
<br />
But then afterwards I go and test some of my other dis dots. I start casting the next higher up until I get up to the 49 Plague before any of them start doing any damage to me. I wasn't mezzed while testing these dots, I just wanted to see if I took damage then regenned.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug? Is my regen too high? I know they were working because every 6 seconds I would get a 'your bracelet of the deep sea glows'. Do you no longer take damage before your regen or if your regen his high does the damage not 'count' for breaking mezes?<br />
<br />
Just really confused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh that's kinda funny.  I thought it would be on a different timer than regen.  I find it hard to believe that they'd tick at the EXACT same time and cancel each other out.  Interresting none the less...  definately makes PvP vs a chanter much harder if we cant do that now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That is strange, I've never heard of that before, but I would think it would still report the damage to you no matter how good your regen is.  Perhaps they have put some code in to help out the lower than 50 players so they can't accidentally dot themselves.  They figure that by 49 you have learned not to dot yourself and start letting you screw up :P.  Did you watch your hitpoints while you were dotted to see if you were actually taking damage?  How much do you regen per tick?  I can't view your magelo from work so I can't tell.</div></div><hr />

I BoS'd myself just the other night on a 5 pull hard LDON pandemonium....now I know why it causes so much aggro cause I was mighty upset by it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup was watching hps while dotted with 39 and below - wasnt taking any damage and was just regenning like normal. Not until I used 49 was I taking any damage, but that could have been because it was above the damage that my regen heals.  I always remember watching health go down then up due to regen.<br />
<br />
OK just did a test with 39 scourge. I did a few ticks with and without replenishment on me. Without replenishment I was taken a little bit of damage, but with replenishment only when I had a BA tick &gt; than regen would I see any damage done. If your regen is greater than the damage done by the dot, you will not see any damage taken. I guess this is seen by the game that your dot is doing no damage and will not break mezzes.<br />
<br />
So moral of the story is if you want to break mezzes with a dot, you gotta use something powerful than your regen. Sucks because used to be any dot on you would break mez. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your conclusions are correct. <br />
One thing i am not really sure of is if the DoT damage has just to be greater than your innate(worn) regen or if regen buffs(icons) apply to this as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont think my innate regen is over 24 / tick that scourge does, so I think that regen spells DO count in the equation before the game will say you are 'hurt'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Buy crimson potions instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Regen spells definitely do count.  I usually go with scourge and then click off replenishment as soon as I'm mezzed or just click regen off to start with.  Soon as I click off replenishment and the dot ticks mez will break but the mez will not break with replenishment.  I'm not sure if it used to be different but I know its been this way for a good 8-10 months at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good idea on crimson potions but are they not affected by regen like the dot spells?</div></div><hr />
