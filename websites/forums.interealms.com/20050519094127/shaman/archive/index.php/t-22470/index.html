Headlines!<br />
-------------------<br />
Veeshan's Peak has been re-worked.  Enjoy the new challenge.<br />
A new Adventure Zone appears on Stormhammer.<br />
You can now remove augments without losing them.<br />
<br />
Veeshan's Peak!<br />
-------------------<br />
With this revamp we have Updated the level and NPC list for the zone: Please note that this zone is now an elemental level zone!  The entry quest to Veeshan’s Peak has been changed. The original key quest has not been modified.  However, the new entry quest uses the old key and offers an alternate quest to do instead of the original key quest. <br />
<br />
- Items in the zone are now of elemental planes quality.<br />
- Faction now matters: Dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now speak to players if you have the correct faction and can understand them.<br />
- New quests and lore: The dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now give players the option to acquire items through questing for them.<br />
- The zone is now an exp zone as well: Hunting in the areas before the dragons yields experience and loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Adventure Zone for Stormhammer<br />
-------------------<br />
Stormhammer gains a new adventure zone. This is a 2 group adventure zone for characters of level 65.  <br />
<br />
Can you help the Eldritch Collective find and rescue Professor Bartleby Beckelbracker?  Search the Desert of Ro for the whereabouts of Bartleby and his assistant Bomo and try to save them from the steel clutches of their enemies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Augment Removal *<br />
-------------------<br />
- You can now purchase special &quot;distillers&quot; that will remove augmentations without destroying them.  These distillers are sold by a merchant in Butcherblock.  The item inspect window for an augmentation will tell you which distiller is required to remove it.<br />
<br />
- The existing solvents can still be used to destroy an augmentation if you don't want to keep it.  You no longer need a different solvent for each augmentation slot.  The interface will allow you to select which augmentation you wish to delete.<br />
<br />
- For those with custom UI's, you will need to update your EQ_Container.xml file in order to use the new augment window.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pets *<br />
-------------------<br />
- Zoning pets are in. Persistent pet data includes: Items, Spell Effects, hit points, mana, name, height, and mana cost to summon them. All PC summoned pets should zone with you in all instances except for when you die. Pets will also follow the same rules as no rent items if you log with a pet.<br />
<br />
- Pets can be shrunk again. Please wash them in only Cold water to prevent inadvertently reducing their size.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tribute Changes *<br />
-------------------<br />
- Some items have had their favor value lowered.<br />
<br />
- Players will now &quot;Pre-pay&quot; for tribute benefits. When benefits are activated, the player will immediately be charged for those benefits from their Favor pool. After that, the player will be charged every 10 minutes for the next 10 minutes of benefit. If benefits are deactivated before the timer is depleted, no refund is given for the time remaining.<br />
<br />
- Players now have the ability to activate/deactivate the tribute benefits they've selected (as a whole) whenever they like using a button on the Tribute Benefit Window. However, every time the player activates his benefits, he will be &quot;Pre-pay&quot; (see above). The ability to change selected benefits (downgrade) away from the Tribute Master has been removed.<br />
<br />
- When visiting a Tribute Master, the player's benefits will deactivate. Players may re-organize their selected benefit load, but will not be able to &quot;preview&quot; the benefits (seeing the effect on their character when the benefit is selected). Benefit descriptions should give the player a good indication of what the benefit will do when activated.<br />
<br />
- The EQ Label that shows the Tribute Benefit Timer will now show green when benefits are active and gray when they are not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Changes<br />
-------------------<br />
- Manastones will no longer work in Forgotten Halls.  It was not intended for the item to be used there and some naughty folks were taking advantage of the zone.<br />
<br />
- Malcohm Thimbleton, in the Plane of Knowledge will now swap out some Robe Graphic items for Tunic Graphics. *<br />
<br />
- The Staff of Revealed Secrets now has a 2hb weapon model instead of the little stick it had before.  Enjoy your bigger stick.<br />
<br />
<br />
UI Changes<br />
-------------------<br />
- It is now possible to display your mana as a numeric value on your inventory screen. *<br />
- By mousing over your buff icons, you will now be able to see the buffs remaining duration. *<br />
<br />
Berserkers<br />
-------------------<br />
- Berserkers now have innate crits beginning at level 12.<br />
- Tainted Axe of Hatred now comes in stacks of 20.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additional Notes<br />
-------------------<br />
- You now have the ability to sell back LDoN items and augments to the adventure merchants for a percentage of their original cost. *<br />
<br />
- We have increased the number of NPC debuff slots from 30 to 50.  Necromancers rejoice. *<br />
<br />
- The Doppleganger AA's re-use timer has been reduced to 30 minutes. *<br />
<br />
- Sprint and Planeswalk have had their movement rate increased. *<br />
<br />
- Beware!  Many named mobs in Gates will now summon. <br />
<br />
- The Hide all traders option, for the Bazaar, will no longer need to be reset each time you enter the zone. *<br />
<br />
- /stopspellcast will no longer give spells recast delays.<br />
<br />
- Leadership: Group/Raid mark npc should now update for people that are added to the group or raid.<br />
<br />
- Main assist will no longer clear if the main assist zones.<br />
<br />
- Bards should once again play the stringed instrument animation when playing a stringed instrument song.<br />
<br />
- Hynid fleshrippers, tide feasters, and shore stonemites in Natimbi no longer hit so hard.<br />

I'm stunned.  Winter must have come early to hell this year.  It's amazing what losing 25%+ of your playerbase will do to your customer service.<br />
<br />
Next thing you know they'll remove some zone flags and give monks their mitigation back.  Yeah, yeah, it's a pipe dream. :)</div></div><hr />

Veeshan's Peak!<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
The entry quest to Veeshan’s Peak has been changed. The original key quest has not been modified. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it just me or are these two statements contradictory ?<br />
<br />
I have 3/4 of the pieces for the original quest, are they any use now ? Does anyone know ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Woot ! zoning pets, but in the nothing-makes-some-people-happy corner, wheres the /petname command ? If my pet keeps his name all day, I want to be able to choose it !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Faction in VP. Great.<br />
<br />
So now i have to sacrifice CoV faction for killing in there ? I know it may sound kookey and crazy, but in a RPG, it was fun having good dragon faction.<br />
<br />
So, kill and get item instantly or quest for a year for it...<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, i hope it doesnt turn out like that anyway. I guess we will see.<br />
<br />
And im sorry, but giving people a way to get the VP key other then the original quest is just plain stupid. Its yet another dumbing down of the game and example of how this game is about instant gatification other then a adventure. But who cares right ? Its a waste of breathe anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other then my disdain for the VP stuff, looks like a good patch. Pet zoning is awesome. Pet shrink will be a welcome return for sure. I just hope the next patch deals with some class issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow. Talk about a huge free for all PVP rampage in VP when servers come up... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And im sorry, but giving people a way to get the VP key other then the original quest is just plain stupid.

<br />
You assume it is an easier alt quest.  Who said it isn't like the &quot;alternate&quot; way to get Green Dragonscales for the Warrior epic.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They didn't mention WHAT faction VP is on....I would suspect it is not CoV at all. More likely the faction that the Kunark dragons are on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First off, CoV faction probably has nothing to do with Veeshan's Peak.<br />
CoV is Velious faction.<br />
VP is a Kunark zone<br />
The faction in VP will probably be related to Ring of Scale etc dragon factions if anything.<br />
Lady Vox has her own faction.  Nagafen has his own faction.  Ring of Scale has their own dragon faction.  CoV has their own dragon faction.  Trakanon has his own faction I think.  I know there's another dragon faction involved, but I can't remember what it is (You can get rogues with SoS to solo pull dragons to zone in of VP).<br />
<br />
Secondly, they stated that there will be quests available from the dragons.<br />
Looks like the return of kill or quest for the loot.<br />
I like the idea of the faction thing again.<br />
I miss faction.<br />
I'm tired of all the &quot;your faction with kos mobs that you can't possibly raise has gotten worse&quot; that's out there.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, before you go bitching about the alternate quest to get in to VP, why don't you actually see what the alternate quest actually is?<br />
The original quest for VP was so gimp, that badly equiped level 60s can get keyed.<br />
It's a quest that many of my friends and guildies were doing before the patch in about a day, not a freaking year.<br />
You might actually want to see what you have to actually do before you say the quest takes a year to do.<br />
You can't &quot;nerf&quot; a quest that easy.<br />
The alternate key quest is probably going to be something that will allow a guild to get multiple keys at once if they want to raid the place.<br />
An unfortunate part of the VP key quest is that even though it's so damned easy, you can't have more than 6? people on a server get flagged every week as Trakanon doesn't drop any more teeth than that (3 teeth on average, 3 day respawn?).<br />
Some of the camps can take many many hours as well if you are unlucky with spawns (KC and TT spawns for example), and only 1 person on a server at a time can be camping each of these.<br />
If you have a guild wanting to go to VP, assuming that zero other people on the server are trying to get in and that all 60 people in the guild need a key, you are looking at approximately 2.5 full months to get 60 people keyed for the zone.<br />
That's why there's an alternate quest of some sort most likely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
What was said was that when the new AA backend went in they would then set a date for this refund.<br />
<br />
Not sure if the new backend went in or not, I'll see if Brenlo has any info.</div></div><hr />

SOE knows the boat is sinking and the effort to fix it is going forth.  Whether it will work or not remains to be seen.  Too many issues over the years festering now have come to light and it is very hard to fix all without impacting game even more.  Kind of a damned if you do damned if you don't situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I might dig up that thread where people whined and bitched about &quot;Another elemental raid zone, the raiders get more, blah blah blah&quot; and toss it in some faces, honestly. Damn pessimism is whats REALLY killing this game, IMHO. Looks like I was right after all. One group XP areas, nameds, and EP level XP. One group. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">sony hasnt lost 25% of its player base lol<br />
I based this on the report of 55k players online by one of the attendees at the recent Summit who saw the actual numbers.  If I remember right this was early-mid afternoon PST and late afternoon/early evening EST.  I simply ran the numbers and compared them to what they stated previously (400K/450K depending which you believe) and against what the server numbers were roughly at that time back when the server numbers were shown.<br />
<br />
Feel free to provide contrary evidence if you believe that SOE hasn't lost significant subscribers and is attempting to improve its customer service out of the goodness of their heart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Noooo they lowered tribute points on some items, hope it wasnt anything I use regularly QQ!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I suspect the tribute nerf is on things like forged picks and hammers that cost a couple of pp to make and yielded 320 and 507 respectively.  (Not that I turned in a million of them or anything. ;))  Hopefully most drops and stuff were left alone, since they didn't seem too crazy, although I suppose they might adjust some of them to more closely reflect current baz pricing, since that seemed to be how the initial values were set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">May be just the way im reading it but these last 2 quotes seem very contradictory.<br />
The quest is very very easy to actually do.<br />
You have to kill level 30 and level 40 creatures for some drops, pick up an item in a newbie zone, find a weapon commonly dropped in chardok (I've probably destroyed about 100 of those staffs in my life), etc.  The only &quot;hard&quot; part is finding 1-5 other people to help kill Trakanon, unless you can just go solo him yourself.  (that last part wasn't a joke).<br />
<br />
The problem with the quest is that if someone is camping, say, the dreadlands item, then no one else can at the same time.  If it doesn't drop for 6 hours of camping it, then that's 6 hours longer before anyone else actually wanting to get the item can start camping it for theirs.  Competition of a camp for a level 30 mob by level 65 players doesn't make a quest hard.  Killing level 70 mobs that require 50 of your guildmembers to come help you kill it with chances of wiping is a hard quest.</div></div><hr />

Actually regardless of level of pet and player all 50+ buffs stick on pets. I did this yesterday for my brother playing his 25 necro. I had SLTW, FoS and Replen on Gobarer.<br />
<br />
I do hope this patch fixed this. I love the idea of pet's zoning but I'm groaning at the thought of level 4 mages begging me to buff their pets in PoK.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The problem with the quest is that if someone is camping, say, the dreadlands item, then no one else can at the same time.  If it doesn't drop for 6 hours of camping it, then that's 6 hours longer before anyone else actually wanting to get the item can start camping it for theirs.  Competition of a camp for a level 30 mob by level 65 players doesn't make a quest hard.  Killing level 70 mobs that require 50 of your guildmembers to come help you kill it with chances of wiping is a hard quest.<br />
<br />
Thats just because of the way you decide to classify &quot;hard&quot;. Im sure there are people that think quests where you have to compete with vastly better equipped people with tons of time on their hands are &quot;hard&quot; to do. I would almost go as far as saying that the more guildmembers you have to get together to do it the easier it will be - for those people that can get as many people together - since the competition will be very minimal. And for the rest of us it wont matter since we cant do it at all period.</div></div><hr />

I might dig up that thread where people whined and bitched about &quot;Another elemental raid zone, the raiders get more, blah blah blah&quot; and toss it in some faces, honestly. Damn pessimism is whats REALLY killing this game, IMHO. Looks like I was right after all. One group XP areas, nameds, and EP level XP. One group.<br />
<br />
Errhhh.... so SOE says it is intended as an exp zone and you think that means that one &quot;random&quot; group of players can exp there?<br />
<br />
I dont think any of us has been there yet so we dont know for sure what its like. But its difficult for me to believe that if NewVP is suitable for almost all groups to exp in that SOE wouldnt have made a bigger deal of it in the patch message. My guess is that it is exclusively aimed at elemental(+) players but nothing could make me happier than being wrong.</div></div><hr />

I don't do LDoN hards with people I don't know, or who aren't vouched for by someone I do know, because I AM bazaar geared and that means that I have to depend on the skills of my groupmates much more than someone who buffs to 7k would.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the skill of the player under that layer of gear matters WAY more than the gear itself.<br />
<br />
Just because you've got Caer Cadarn or Triality or Agony under your name (a few of the Time guilds on Vazaelle) that doesn't mean I'm going to respect your ability to play.  I'm going to see how you play, then make my decision based on that.<br />
<br />
I've got Time people on my list of people I love to group with, but just because you walk into the group I'm in with Time gear, that doesn't mean I'm going to just assume you know what you're doing.<br />
<br />
Even people in Time gear can be stupid.  Trust me.  I've seen it personally.  Being Time geared doesn't necessarily mean that you're good. It means that you're in a Time guild, or was at one point.  Huzzah and congratulations on making it to Time, I respect your accomplishment.  Now earn my respect as a skilled player, someone I can depend on when 4 ticked off mobs come boiling into our camp because pac failed or a roamer happened to turn a corner at the exact wrong time.<br />
<br />
Call it jealousy if you will, but your butt isn't depending on those other five people.  So I'll pick the people I know have a clue and I can depend on over someone with a flashy guild tag.</div></div><hr />

It will be interesting to see how long it takes to go from max KOS to ROS to whatever level needed to do the quests. I know my ROS faction has caused pictures to be posted in the dragon post office.<br />
<br />
Being an optimist at heart, I like to think the VP change was tossed in to give non-raid types a way and place to get to E-Plane level gear/content for gear and xp progression. We really won't know right away because I am sure every E-plane guild will be rushing there to whack-a-mole the mobs to see what they drop and farming the hell out it for as long as it is worthwhile. Nature of the game.<br />
<br />
Then again, SOE may have made the zone entry requirements extremely difficult/impossible for those it entended to actually use it (non-raiding groups/guilds) thus preventing them from ever gaining access. The sadistic nature of SOE game development history suggests this.<br />
<br />
Regardless, for the majority who this revamped zone may actually have been designed for that time will be much further down the road ... after the elite have beat it to death.</div></div><hr />

I'm confused because Mistmoore gives good xp to normal groups(i.e. not power levelers) up to the mid to high 20s and a bit beyond.  Only level 12s I think you'd see in that place are those being power levelled.

Wulf, where did I ever say that normal non-raiders cannot handle XP groups in EP zones? Where did ANYONE say that, honestly. But there is a certain amount of &quot;efficiency&quot; at any level. If it takes a Bazaar geared group 4 minutes to kill an EP mob, and an EP group 2 minutes to kill the same mob, then who is getting better XP? <br />
<br />
Tell ya what though, I would be willing to bet that non-EP groups would struggle with some EP mini-minis, even EP groups do. But I honestly see VP quickly becoming a mix of EP and non-raider level people in groups together. Whether or not that trend will continue remains to be seen, but for the next month or so, I think groups will be very diverse and mixed in gear progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Well, a bazaar equiped group could xp in parts of the elementals, but folk like Binter need to understand that there is a wide range of difficulty. Field 1 of fire is similar to tactics in difficulty (ie piss easy). Castle 1 is easy as well, and I'm sure they could handle that too, even though most mobs are even cons there. It gets harder in field 2, where gear, particularly on your tanks, starts to make a difference. And of course castle 2 is harder still. That is PoF though, compare that to PoA where a bazaar group wouldnt have a snowballs hope in hell of surviving for any length of time. If you think gear doesn't affect performance, paricularly on tanks, you are seriously misleading yourself.<br />
<br />
There is a distinction between being able to do some content in EP (but not having access to it) versus having the sort of gear that someone who has won the right to be is wearing. When they talk about &quot;content geared for elemental players&quot; it is the latter they are talking about. It is tuned to their AC, their hp and their resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I camped out in VP before yesterday's patch and once the servers came up in the evening I was pleasantly surprised to find I was still in VP.<br />

Everything in there was dubious, which suggests they're on RoS faction. There's also a new clicky statue near the port in, but I didn't use it as I knew there's no way I'd get back in once I left the zone.<br />
<br />
The mobs were mainly DB still, although I'd imagine they're higher than the L60 of the old racnars and guardian wurms. I got excited when I saw Hoshkar's yellow conning pet - although poking through Lucy reveals it's a one off pet that just happens to look like a shaman pet.<br />
<br />
There were plenty of red cons around Hoskar, again all dubious.<br />
<br />

I then poked around some more, past a (red conning) Silverwing, before using the in game map (which works in VP now) to head east. The &quot;trash&quot; mobs were now turning yellow and red, but I didn't have much time to see them. Sadly, I'd been noticed:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Yah, I have lots of EP flagged friends, I know how hard the mobs are out there, they give me constant updates.  ;)<br />
<br />
Bazaar gear wouldn't get a group too deep in some EP zones for sure, no matter how good they are...because no amount of skill's gonna help you when you have 6khp and you're fighting a mob that quads for 2k...and mitigates slow.<br />
<br />
LDoN gear, properly auged, however, would carry a group much deeper into the EPs.  It's almost as good as Elemental armor itself.  I know a Paladin who has no EP gear at all, who has almost a complete set of Royal Attendant armor, heavily auged.  She has some LDoN hard gear filling the holes, a couple pieces of bazaar gear, and a couple of pieces off raid mobs in Luclin and earlier expansions.  This paladin has 9khp raid buffed, and she's the best bloody Paladin I've ever seen.  She blows the doors off every other tank, because she's that dang good. If you're on Vazaelle and you have the privilege of getting this Paladin in your group, just breathe a sigh or relief and know you're gonna be just fine.<br />
<br />
Yes, Shaquille, I'm talking about YOU.  :)<br />
<br />
But, my point is that a group of very well skilled people that work well together would last a heck of a lot longer than 6 people in need of personal time with the Bat of Clue, and might actually manage to surprise you with how far they can go.  Or even just 1 clueless person, for that matter.  Sometimes it just takes one idiot to destroy the entire group.<br />
<br />
Gear may be necessary for taking on the castle in fire or air or water, but gear can never replace good old fashioned know-how.  It can augment it, but it can't replace it.  A 10khp tank's gonna die just as easily as a 7khp tank if the cleric's a moron...it's just gonna take the mob a little longer to beat him down.  An 8khp shaman's gonna die just as easily as me at 5.5khp if the tank can't keep agro...you'll just last a little longer than me.<br />
<br />
Think about it...would YOU take a known clueless noob into your group if you're doing the castle in Fire, even though he's got the gear to make it there?  Where the mobs CAN kill you quickly, and you're relying on the skills of your groupmates to win?<br />
<br />
Gear does do one thing, though...it softens mistakes or accidents or just bad luck when you're working in an area where the gear makes the content easier.  When you have 8khp in an LDoN hard as a shaman, you can last longer if you get a resisted slow, which gives you more time to try again.  But this also has a negative side effect.  Sometimes putting bad players in great gear helps conceal the fact that they're bad players.  It also breeds a false sense of confidence, I've noticed; people in great gear start taking things for granted because they can fall back on their superior gear...then they're surprised when trivial mobs eats them for breakfast.  Being sloppy and relying on your gear just invites a nasty shock.<br />
<br />
*raises hand*..guilty.  I've done this myself.  Nothing more embarassing than getting killed by lava walkers and bats in SolB cause you're screwing around.  Just because it's green, that doesn't mean that it CAN'T kill you.  :D<br />
<br />
Well, now that we've gotten the humiliating admission out the way....<br />
<br />
Using my LDoN hard example, given the choice between a 10k tank who's an idiot and a 8k tank that knows his business, I'll take the 8k tank. I'll do so because we have a better chance of succeeding with the 8k tank, even if his gear isn't as good as the 10k tank.  All that hp doesn't do us any good if the tank can't keep the mobs off the casters....<br />
<br />
That's why gear doesn't impress me as much as skill.  Your skill will contribute much more to the group than your gear when we're doing hard (for us) content like an LDoN hard, where I'll be depending on your abilities as a player more than the gear you're wearing, just as you'll be depending on me.</div></div><hr />

There's a difference between the word &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;tedious&quot;.<br />
Hard things imply the chance of failure.<br />
The original VP key quest is just full of multiple multiple-hour long camps of green mobs, that can only be camped one at a time, adding even more hours onto the length of your quest.<br />
If I'm camping the DL item until it spawns, and that's a piece you need, it doesn't make the quest harder to complete.<br />
The quest is still just as easy to complete.<br />
All you have to do is get in line for the camp, and you'll have it completed whenever it decides to spawn.<br />
That's tedious waiting in line for camps.<br />
That's not hard.</div></div><hr />
