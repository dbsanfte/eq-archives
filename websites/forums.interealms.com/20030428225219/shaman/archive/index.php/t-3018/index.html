<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Artisan Smith (maxxed skill) now accepting orders on Karana for smithed barbarian shaman armor including the following:<br />
<br />
veil AC 10, WIS 5, mana 30, HP 30 <br />
neckguard AC 11, WIS 5, AGI 5, HP 25, mana 25 <br />
bracer AC 12, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30, 5 to all saves <br />
gloves AC 12, DEX 5, WIS 5, HP 25, mana 25 <br />
cape AC 14, WIS 10, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
mantle AC 15, WIS 5, DEX 5, HP 30, mana 30<br />
skirt (belt) AC 15, WIS 5, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
boots AC 16, DEX 5, HP 30, mana 30 <br />
sleeves AC 16, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30 <br />
helm AC 17, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30 <br />
leggings AC 22, STR 10, WIS 5, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
ringmail (tunic) AC 30,STA 5, WIS 10, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
<br />
Barbarian rogues can wear the above, too.  I can also make plate armor for barbarian warriors that worship The Tribunal with some pieces better than ToV quest armor.  There is a smithed leather armor that barbarian beastlords can wear but it probably isn't worth the costs as all of this armor uses some pricey ingredients.<br />

Send tells to Verdandi in the evenings eastern time or email me at verdandi@allakhazam.com. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Anyone know of anyone who can make this on Brell? Some nice pieces there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow...grats on being a grand master in smithing!!! It is quite an accomplisment, Dandi. Very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/shameless bump</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You didnt list your prices. What are they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That was deliberate as prices have fallen sharply for dropped armor but risen for blue diamonds, around which my armor crafting hinges.  In order to set a price on a given piece, I'm going to have to spend some time searching through Allakhazam and EQ Prices and then comparing to what stuff is going for in the Bazaar.  Were you looking for any particular pieces?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zebra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry I am not on your server because I love this armor and am looking to buy some. I have asked about and can't find anyone who has the skill level.  <br />
<br />
Do you happen to know if the coif/helm has a graphic, or is it invisible.  Most coifs are invisible, and i would love it if this one is.  Hate the horned look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I haven't made any coifs yet.  I'm tempted to make that and the gloves and boots to go with what I've got just to get a screenshot of the full suit, but haven't done that yet.  I'm worried that it would have the old chain look in old world graphics, and I refuse to be seen in an old world chain helm.  They make female barbarians look dorky.  So I have to decide whether my vanity wins out over making the screenshot available...so I'm still just sitting and mulling it over. ;)<br />

You might want to check your server's forum on the EQ Traders Message Boards (http://pub126.ezboard.com/beqtraderscorner).  Some servers use their forums more than others, but you might get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I went ahead and made gloves, boots, and hat to go with what I already had, so what you see below is a full set of visible artificers.  Please pardon the extreme dorkiness of the old world helm. *sigh*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zebra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, it is still pretty good looking and has some decent stats. <br />
Thanks for the pictures.  <br />
<br />
Anyone know any masters on Ayonae Ro who can make this stuff?  **starts looking around on the ground for blue diamonds**</div></div><hr />
