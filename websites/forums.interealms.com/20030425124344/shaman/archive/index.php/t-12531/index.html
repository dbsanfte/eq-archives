<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shrapnac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm losing my patience with this, and I've done the cleric epic for myself twice, once the old way(Skyfire camp rage for 3 days) and once the new way(Skyfire farming shards for mind numbing hours) not to mention the other cleric epic camps.  I'm only 51, doing it solo, but sitting in the dark water for hours, killing a mob every half hour or so, if some shark manages to aggro is totally mind numbing.  Anyone got any advice for me?   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

So when did you try this? Post here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=12496) says this part is broken after April 8 patch because Ooglyn warps back instead of arriving at her destination underwater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shrapnac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doh, I was doing it today, didn't even bother to see if it was broken, just assumed it wasn't.  I mean the quest is 3 years old.  Thanks for the heads up.</div></div><hr />
