<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>moops</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Every shammy in my guild has a fear tear available for MQ, I plan on doing everything but the tear. My question is will skipping the iksar broodling part make it so my truespirit faction wont be good enough for epic? Does killing the broodling increase true spirit faction??<br />
<br />
thnx Moops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, there is no faction hit for killing the iksar broodling. If you have done every other step, you should be able to MQ that tear with no problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Err yeah, to get the epic you might have to redo the earlier part of the quest to make up the faction hit you didn't get when someone else MQed that tear for you. Just turn in the books from Lord Ghiosk a few times until your faction is maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From what I have heard, that won't work, as you get a faction hit turning the tear to Rak.  Thus, you need to do a few of the previous steps more untill you cannot increase  you faction any higher, then you should be able to MQ it, otherwise, after Rak is killed, you won't be able to receive your spear.<br />
<br />
Anyways, havn't done it myself, but that's what I've gathered about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have Multi Quested a tear for another Shaman.  It works BUT you HAVE to raise your True Spirit Faction To Ally, make sure it is maxed before you turn in the last piece.  Do other quest parts until it says your true spirit faction can't get any better.  Then it will work.  You lose a faction hit to the shaman who turns the tear in for you.</div></div><hr />
