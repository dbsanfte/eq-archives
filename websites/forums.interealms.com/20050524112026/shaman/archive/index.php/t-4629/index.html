<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally think eq is gearing the game towards the players..for the first 3 years,they did nothing to ease players concerns, That was until DAOC,Shadow bane,AO popped there heads(where ya think they coppied the new ui from)..within the space of 1 year we have had so many changes,all for the players and now reading there latest post it seems they are making the game more soloable,CH for shammys is great,well 75% heal..it should see the price drop on torpor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some advisor for some well-known successful company (I can't remember the name) said something to the degree of: &quot;If you listen to the customer to the point of him running how the company works, then it'll be the downfall of your company.&quot; (not exact quote).<br />
<br />
I partially believe in this.  There's obviously problems with EQ.   And we all have different views what they are.  They should be addressed, but in a fashion where they keep how they percieve the game should be.<br />
<br />
This is something that has happened some time ago:  <br />
Once Verant listened to people whining how things got too easy after clearing  the &quot;end-game uber mobs&quot; several times,  things started going downhill.   Difficulty gets upped, then the larger base of players start to fall behind to the smaller player base above them.  Once they finally catch up, it's a repeat process.   <br />
<br />
Then items get revamped, because the mobs get too hard, then when enough people have these items, the tough mobs become less challenging.  Repeat process. <br />
<br />
Verant needs to get to the point of just saying, &quot;Congrats, you have finished the game.   Please buy our next expansion we are working on, to further your gaming experience.   Until then, enjoy what you have conquered...&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem is, they don't know what do to with their product at this stage.</div></div><hr />

It's quite simple, really. If no one had said a word and raised issues, the EQ Live team still would have done caster balancing, and they would have gone through the number-crunching and discussions in the office with a predictable number of results.</div></div><hr />
