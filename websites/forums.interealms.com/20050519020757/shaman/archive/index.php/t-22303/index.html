<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is an idea that I jsut thought up of....what if Cannibalize were not to be a spell, but a skill that we Shamans get? As in, the more you use it, the less health is consumed, and more mana is recieved. Or the spell increases in the same manner as a skill, as in it gets better as you use it. Just an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i dont think it will happen  but  from what i hear they might &quot; adjust&quot; the  hp/ mana percetnages   as soon as the can &quot;link&quot; the spells together so one cant be used with another cani  ie cani 3 and cani 4 chain casting   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i dont know if this is true or not  a dev said it afterall !</div></div><hr />

<br />
well it is not a bad idea ... how ever it cannot be implementet ... <br />
<br />
it free up a spell slot and the hole the more you use it the better it gets has a nice ring to it ...<br />
<br />
how ever the problem with it that since it is not a spell nor aa it would not have a cast time ( fx skills like forage / senseheading / discs ) this would make it abit overpowering if we could just chain click it while running etc <br />
<br />
to counter this they could make it so it as a long recast time but that would drive 60+ shamans insane since we have to chain canni in every spare moment we have to keep up with the group and be usefull .. <br />
<br />
<br />
all in all the idea is nice but it is too late since it would also mean the removal of the canni spells and since when did want to spend time changing somthing that only effected shamans ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, in theory it's a nice idea, but as chees said it wouldnt happen (shame)<br />
<br />
But don't let that fact dishearten other people with ideas, because where would we be without ideas? Seriously, please tell me, I want to know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ademaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, never thought about some of those negative side effects. :-O And as to where we would be without any ideas? Certainly not playing EQ!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they should make all cannibalize spells like the OoW/Ancient style one... multiply hp loss and mana gain by 3.5 and add 18 sec recast. the fact that twinks don't even use cannibalize 1 because the mana gain seems insignificant is pretty sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haakim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rather they make a new cannabalize that takes health from your target and gives you mana. Necros get lifetaps after all, its a not a new concept...only we get mana for health. It would be a bit more dps, which i'd take over more mana regen any day.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">that idea is sort of cool, a mana tap, there are spells like that, enc get them, not sure if they recieve mana back when they cast it, but its a good idea for shm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Haakim,<br />
<br />
I love the idea. Seriously, a CanniDot would rock. The more I think about it, the happier it makes me. Even if it only does a measly amount of HP / mana, a little bit is better than nothing.<br />
<br />
I still maintain that Cannibalize should keep it's 1.8:1 HP / mana ratio, and be converted into big chunk Cannis, or a passive mana regen like Necro Lich, giving us bear illusions (Since in hibernation, bears essentially metabolize their own bodies). The ratio would be worse than what Necros get (Though not by a whole lot), and it also wouldn't stack with KEI. But hey, passive mana regen is fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I still don't understand why they haven't added Canni focus effects to equipment yet.  You can get Spell shield +5%, or Strikethrough +5%.  But where's the Cannilbalize +10%, where instead of every cast of Canni 4 costing you 148 hp and getting you 92 mana, it'd cost you 148 hp and give you +10% mana (or 101)?  Or CanniV doing 1924hp and giving you 1172 mana?  I would love to see them add +Canni focus effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think its a good idea Ademaro. As to the complaint where people would chain click it while moving, it could just have a condition where a person has to be stood still to do it, kinda like hide. Its doable but I don't think it would be implemented by SoE at this stage of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">cannibalize as a skill would be nice, though it would run into skill cap problems.<br />
<br />
The main draw of it would be having cannibalize on a single timer, even after multiple upgrades to it, so we can get our high recast time cannis without being able to memorize two of them.<br />
<br />
It would probably be more practical to code it as a (cheap) AA skill and discontinue the cannibalize line after canni IV. Have it cost 1 point in class AAs and then give shamans upgrades in every expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I really want to meet a shaman that would have 2 canni's up at the same time.  I really would.  Even in the easiest exp groups I still need 1 more spell gem than I have and having 2 more gems would be sweet.  I dont have the spell gem real estate to devote to a smaller version of canni.  <br />
<br />
I think that this &quot;having 2 canni's up&quot; is a problem only in Rytan the Spell God and Master of Caster Balance's muddled brain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That'd be so awesome to have to raise a skill up to max when I'm already 65.  Oh, wait...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Rytan said they were waiting for the ability to link spells like disciplines.  I don't remember the exact comments, but I think they don't want to make changes to Canni 4 and below until they can do that.  The number of shamans with the GoD canni is very low, so it's not an issue.  I'm also assuming the OoW canni is going to be harder to obtain than the GoD one.  They don't want shamans to have ultra high mana regen by using 2 or more cannis at once.  If you have the ancient and canni 4 up, you can regenerate about 200 mana/tick and with Canni5 that goes up to 250 mana/tick over time I think.  <br />
<br />
It's not really practical to have 2 cannis up in raid or group situations though.  I think the point of us wanting them to have longer recasts and return more mana is to let us do more stuff, like actually type things and move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">this idea would work, think of skill like kick,loh, ht? they all refresh after a period i am sure  a shorter period wouldnt matter.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the recast part would work just fine. The problems with making it a skill is that you set an artificial limit on how good the spell can get, that being the hard cap on skills.<br />
<br />
Linked spells would work just as well though, so if they really are working on those that would be a fine way too. I am a little wary of being promised fixes in the future by SOE thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I could seriously see a HP drain/Mana gain type spell. Canni as a DD of sorts. Stealing the mobs spirit and using it to empower the shaman. Isn't that kinda the idea behind a shaman after all? Weakin the mob and strengthen the party?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sounds more like the role of a sk or necro, I personally don't go along with the idea of a hp to mana drain for shamans. I think one of the nice parts of shaman is choosing when you want an inflow of mana and being in control of it, no other class can really have that quality. Its just fricking annoying that the hp taken away for mana on cann 5 is so little that it has to be repeated so many times. I have r.s.i and wouldn't be surprised if that to an extent caused it, although it was also due to lack of ergonomic gear too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Who among Shamans (barring ancient Canni) DOESN'T cast canni like 100 times a day?  As far as it getting better the more times you use it, well, we'd all be at max within a couple days.  <br />
<br />
I'd rather see a canni counter, to see how many times I've cast it in my career.  My computer might explode trying to display all those digits, though.  I'm SO glad I chose to specialize in Alteration... that was easy, with all the cannibalize 1's I cast way back then, Spec Alteration was capped almost instantly.<br />
<br />
Would be nice to see it on a skill button though... but if they did it for us, the wizard would whine about Harvest.  I love this one thread I read where a wizard was complaining that he &quot;had to keep Harvest up all the time due to 10 minute refresh&quot;, and that &quot;shaman didn't have to have canni up all the time because it refreshes instantly.&quot;  Hmmm... riiiight...<br />
<br />
An interesting idea though, still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I find even when I'm sitting down med'ing and I go to stand up... I dont just stand... I hit the canni button to get up &lt;stilll stuck in canni I hell as I never bothered to do the canni II quest when canni III was so close...&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good to know that there are still morons in the world making me feel smart<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Who among Shamans (barring ancient Canni) DOESN'T cast canni like 100 times a day?  As far as it getting better the more times you use it, well, we'd all be at max within a couple days.Right, but until then, we'd be constantly failing the skill and struggling to get mana.  Fizzles, missed notes and &quot;fallen to the ground&quot; are already a huge annoyance at 65(I play a shaman, bard and necro) with max casting skills.  Until the canni skill is near maxed out, getting these messages and having crappy mana regen(ignoring canni5) would just suck.  Even though I have canni5, I still canni constantly with canni4 until it pops again or I'm at full mana.  Losing this ability for a week(it would take at least that long with the awful slowdown of skills experienced after 175) would suck.<br />
<br />
No, I'd much rather leave them as spells.  I don't think Sony should worry too much about Shamans using two canni spells at the same time.  If they knew anything about our class, they'd know that every Shaman is constantly short on spell slots.  I'd probably never do it myself, unless it was after a death, because every spell slot I have filled is used most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I wouldn't see a tap like this as an ability, just a new spell line. Drain a mobs HP's and gain Mana. Treat it like a DoT. Hell I wouldn't care if it drained 300hps a tic, and only returned 5pts mana.<br />
<br />
The scary part is, that ratio would probably be acceptable with the new quick fights. And being that the shaman is so good at a long fight...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">shaman getting massive mana regen by loading 2 cani's<br />
<br />
I comented on this before, I am to lazy to look up the post but the general message was somthing along the lines of.<br />
<br />
what moron whos ever PLAYED a shaman actually thinks they have room for 2 cani spells in their spell line up? especially when one of those will be a lower and crappier version? as is is right now Can4 feels like can1 did when I was lvl 53, just about usless. sure it works, sure I get back mana, but god damn it would be nice to finally abandon my macro that casts can4 5 times in a row. <br />
CanV is nice, its a life saver, but even that isnt enough to cover the cost of shaman spells, when things go truly bad and the group is handling things the best they can without dying why is it that I go oom first? inspite of having better gear? oh yeah its because for that 2 minutes I dont have time to chain cast can4 to keep up, I go from fm to oom before everyone in the group and with the 15% or so I get out of canV I drop a couple Q's on peeps.<br />
<br />
<br />
this is pretty much some imagined &quot;problem&quot; with the cani line that just proves the devs dont know **** about shaman.  as somone pointed out the only time it would be feasable to load multiple cani's would be after a wipe....but wait I am already the first one to rebuff and reach fm/fhealth after a wipe...what was the point again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, after gettin' clicky root pants finally, I had a free slot... 'till I got FA a week later!<br />

It was fun while it lasted! Hehe.</div></div><hr />
