<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got a Belkin Nostromo n52, and it totally changes the game. There are like 20 keys, scrollwheel, directional thumbpad, and three 'alt' keys for different settings.<br />
<br />
Finally, my left hand can do more than hit alt+2 for Can-4 all day. I can now use either hand to move (I use keyboard movement), target nearest NPC, and cast Can-4, Slow, Malos, Cripple/Malosinia (third debuff du jour). And it's RedShift+Can4Button to Can5, and RedShift+OtherButtons for all my /alt activate commands.<br />

<br />
- I just wish there was a matching device to replace my trackball...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i got one of them thingys also. Really cool device. Also works good for setting up afk spell casting, since you can make your own macros and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hissanhi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Would it kill them to make a version for us lefties ??<br />
<br />
My left hand IS my mouse hand and always will be, but I would love having one of these for my right... if they made it that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was interested in something like this, but anyone know if theres a wireless type of device like this?  Went looking for one awhile ago but couldnt find any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lefties and Righties might each find a useful item from http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/category/category_slc.asp?id=090304<br />
<br />
Wireless... I guess you could set up a wireless hub. Not as elegant, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AFK spell casting?  Like if you're working up divination spells for a new toon, you can cast true north and such when you're not even at the keyboard forever and ever?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, when you make a macro, it can be keyed to play once or repeatedly. Like how Ranger-bots can shoot arrows all day, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dang, that sounds great.<br />
<br />
So you find movement just as smooth as mousing?  I'm worried that just controlling moving with that little thumb pad would be so clumsy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Also good for fishing and foraging. I suppose something like this is against the rules, but Im not giving mine up any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heck just not having to click canni 4 all the time would be a very welcome upgrade in my game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KhunDawg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ya, I ahve had the n50 for a while and have swore by it.  They are awesome for multi boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, I would have loved to buy one.  If I could use it with my right hand!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Movement - I've never been a mouse mover, but a keypad mover, so it's the same. :) I have the thumbpad set up as the red, blue, and green 'shift' keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shakurae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh, Nostromo is nice. This is better .... <br />
<br />
http://www.xkeys.com/xkeys/xkpro.php <br />
<br />
I have both. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">At the same time on the same computer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bought n52 yesterday! Waiting for it to arrive in the mail. Can you guys that use it offer me some suggestions on how to get the most out of it? Thanks!<br />
<br />
Edit: Bought N52 not N50</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">does this replace the keyboard?  mouse?  add-on? How do you type in-game?  Seems like it might be cool, especially when I play my chanter, but not sure how it's supposed to integrate with existing setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shakurae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Blargx - No, not both on same pc. I bought and older version of the Nostromo a while ago (year and a half maybe). I use it on my laptop now (3rd account).<br />
<br />
Eriadoc - The X-Key is used in addition to the regular keyboard. I use that on my shamman's account (2nd pc).<br />
<br />
Shakurae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Maybe this will help - my 'default' and 'red' layouts. With no 'color shift' pressed or activated, this map gets used:<br />
<br />
http://morelight.org/samanna/n52/EQ.n52.default.bmp <br />
<br />
I hold the red-shift button to cast any AAs; any unmapped keys will do the default action. AAs are macros, like '/alt activate ##'; the rest are mapped to the keys that activate hotbuttons, or control movement.<br />
<br />
http://morelight.org/samanna/n52/EQ.n52.red.bmp<br />
<br />
The keys listed on the left are the 14 keys, top L -&gt; R, mid L -&gt; R, bot L -&gt; R.<br />
<br />
I haven't figured out a need for green and blue shifts, except that the blue matches my fragbox and keyboard lights. :D<br />
<br />
And this is just another USB device, plug it in wherever. Extra keys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Personally I use http://www.gamenationtv.com/hardware/strategycom.shtml (Microsoft SideWinder Strategic Commander) <br />
<br />
It takes care of movement, and has 24 keys per profile, with a switch that allows you to change between 3 different profiles. You can program this on the fly as well as it will record key strokes.</div></div><hr />
