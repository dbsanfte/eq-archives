<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My question is mainly for the Dragon trial.  What combination of debuffs have you found to be able to get this beast slowed the quickest?  We did Tash, Malos, Malosini, and still had enough resists to get 4 shaman killed who were all chain casting slows in an attempt to get it slowed within the first say 10-15% of it's HP's.  Any suggestions? <br />
   I am thinking of trying to use the GoD disease based slow initially, to take the heat off the tanks, and the DIRE need to get it slowed.  This will free time up for other Shaman to, pardon the pun, slowly get it slowed.  IE, less aggro from not having to chain cast slows.  Any input is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">there is no GoD disease slow.<br />
<br />
The slow from GoD, balance of the nihil, is a magic slow.  Nihil lands on Rydda Dar but was also heavily resisted with full debuffs (tash, malos, hos) and with a 1.5 min duration, I had it wear off before my raids (30-40ish ppl) had him dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lead with disease slow.  It lasts much easier than magic slow.<br />
After that, you *can* try to slow him, but I usually just skip it.<br />
The slow is only a slight slow.  The fight lasts about 1 minute.  It doesn't prevent that much damage.<br />
It's usually just better for me to spam the main tank with heals due to the length of time it takes to land a slow.<br />
There's too many times that slow just doesn't even land.<br />
Also, getting summoned and killed due to slow aggro just plain sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have managed to land slow on him in the past.  He's just like dragons in ToV, you need to be right under his belly to increase your chances of having slow land.  Problem is, when your that close you get on his rampage list easily.  Like last night, cast malos and turgurs wasn't half way through casting and I was dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">malicious decay -&gt;cloud of grummus -&gt; n00kn00kn00k!!!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Given that RD mitigates slow to only be slightly effective (approx. 25% of 40% slow, or 10% slowed), the shamans in my guild didn't spend too much effort trying to slow him. If you have a lot of shamans in attendance, it may be worth having one or two try to land Grummus (after MD). It's also a good idea to ask the Beast Lords in attendance to try to land slow as well. Swallow your pride :)<br />
<br />
A more important duty for the shamans is making sure you have someone chain-casting Abolish Disease on the MT and Rampage Tank, to cure the slow-debuff that RD procs and to help ensure your tanks are keeping agro.<br />
<br />
Any remaining shamans should be spam healing the MT and RT.<br />
<br />
That's how my guild was successful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You dont get on the rampage list because you are close, you got high on the rampage list because you cast malos before enough tanks hit him, so give a little more time next try before you land a spell on him, give the plate tanks more of a chance to whack him once.<br />
<br />
We usually start with the disease slow, from experience of trying to magic slow him its just not worth the time, as others have pointed out, try and help with healing, which is crucial in this fight, keeping the MA up the whole time is almost a guaranteed win.  Think I got Turgurs on him once and dont think we've been back since I got Nihil but will probably try that next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">malicious decay -&gt;cloud of grummus -&gt; n00kn00kn00k!!!  :D<br />
<br />
BINGO, this is how to take this guy out. Dont bother even trying to ge Turgurs on him. Just decay and cloud, then start dropping bombs. He has to die fast. Half the raids shamanas should do this til hes slowed, the other half (if there are more than 3, heh) can Malos/Sinia so the nukers can blow bigger holes in him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I was with Henora on one RD fight when our guilds raided together.  I had landed Grummus after one resist and then she landed Nihil (which obviously wipes out a longer lasting slow).  But I recall Nihil wearing off, so not sure that's the best way to go unless you kill fast or are prepared to re-slow him.  When it wore off, I was busy healing and wasn't prepared to Grummus again right away, plus got a couple more resists.  <br />
<br />
I don't have Nihil, but doesn't sound like a great spell outside of GoD unless you are following it up with a regular Turgur's, IMO.  Situational at best.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Like folks said the fight is only a minute or two long...forget slowing.<br />
<br />
Keep a tight CH chain and have a shaman or druid spot heal in that time.  Fight goes quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lasted longer than that for us ;), maybe it wasn't intended to lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">last only one minute if you're 72 may be</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">RD lasted about two minutes for our raid. Chain casting Turgur's is basically a waste of mana. We had six shaman on that raid, and four of them were MD-Grummus until it landed, and the others were Malos and Malosinia. We were all healing and nuking like crazy. He was disease slowed by 94%.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Took a stab at RD last night.  Grummus landed within the first few seconds, not sure which shaman cast it, but I cast MD, Grummus directly afterwards, and it landed as well.  Promplty after that I spam clicky'd my malosinia and chain nuked.  Velium strike didn't land too well, if at all, but Spear of Torment was rockin.  We wiped with RD showing 0%.  We did however experience about a 10-15 second period there where she was walled (untargetable), but she didn't seem to have a problem chewing through us.  During that 10-15 seconds, she killed a good number of people.  Next run, she dies.</div></div><hr />
