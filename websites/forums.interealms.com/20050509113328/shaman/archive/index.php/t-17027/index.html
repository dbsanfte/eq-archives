<br />
<br />
Well, I believe that the fizzle check is against the spell discipline (alt, evoc, etc.) and the channeling skill is the chance to continue casting thru being hit.  I don't think the two are interrelated.<br />
<br />
Although I dont have any parses, I have level 3 of the skill and I believe I channel more although it's not like &quot;oh my goodness I channeled thru that like a god&quot;. Anyway, level 1 is a good value at only 2aa's (IMHO), I would only train it up after 150ish aa's because there are other things better till then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can find better AAs up to at least 250, maybe even as high as 300, but that's just me I guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't train it until around 270aa.  I have chan focus 3 and I like to think that it helps.  It definately isn't a dramatic increase and there is really no reliable way to parse it, but I think I might be getting interrupted less.  It is very hard to tell though and it could just be my imagination.  I wouldn't really worry about training this AA until you have just about everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah this aa is low priority. Sounds nice on paper but not that much noticable on practicality. It definately does something but what it does is not worth buying until you have more prioritised aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have CF3 and it &quot;seems&quot; to make casting in water and while getting bumped around a bit easier.  That could be purely psychological though.<br />
<br />
Effectively parsing CF to determine it's value would be difficult as there are likely hidden modifiers for interrupts on different mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was one of the first aa's I maxed out after canni 5. Channeling heals while getting thrown across the room by Aten's Gflux is fun. I definitely noticed a good difference at level 3. <br />
<br />
Would recommend it to anyone, chanelling that slow or quiesc while getting pounded can easily save the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">An amazing cleric was in my group for a vindi raid, actually we were killing him with 8 people, so there weren't that many groups heh. She was from the local Tunare PoTime guild and was pretty uber. Anyways, we had no monk, so Vindi came with his guards. One of our 2 clerics died right off the bat before our 2 warriors could engage vindi and 1 of his pets. The third one stuck on the cleric. I slowed it, but I was just amazed at what happened afterwards. I couldn't peel it off the cleric and she was doing a solo CH wheel, just chain casting it on the tank. He was likewise PoTime equipped so the wheel was actually working. but the amazing part was she channelled through every single CH with this mob on her for at least 6 minutes, I mean a 10 second casting spell channelled through each time until she ran oom. We wiped and died, but I asked her afterwards and she had this AA.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be suprised if it made a big difference, its just very hard to measure as nobody really knows what effects chances to interrupt spellcasting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have CF3. It's very hard to say if I get less interrupts or not. I heard it SHALL help in water zones. I still can't channel any spell when a mob is beating on me in PoWater. Even some (3 or 4) greenies interrupted me 4-5 times in a row in SolB (I had a wall in my back). I did CF3 mostly to have all arch type AA done ;)<br />
<br />
To Penny: Some spells are harder to interrupt then others. I thing gate and CH are 2 of the harder ones. But still a very good job of the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I ended up getting level 2 of it once I had around 240. To be honest though, like many here I also can't tell much difference. <br />
<br />
It was rare to get interrupted by melee unless I was bashed pre the AA. Same still holds true ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zeeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No hard data to back up my claims however, as an enchanter I have noticed a huge difference in interupts.  Prior to CF3 I would never be able to channel a 6 second charm through a mob beating on me.  I do that quite often today.<br />
<br />
Having a 500 dps ex pet smack you around for 3K HPs and get the message 'you regain your concentration...' is worth every single AA to me.<br />

The thing is, unless they are just completely lying about the %'s effected in this AA, there is only about a 1/6 chance that you channeled because of chan focus.  The other 5 out of 6 times you would have channeled anyways.  I'm sure this is important for a chanter who has to channel a long cast-time charm through an angry, dueling wielding, hasted pet, but for shamans I don't think it is really a noticeable improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have channeling focus 2 and honestly I cannot tell much difference.  That being said, I will probably get the third level just so I can be done with the archtype page forever.  :)<br />
<br />
I have hopes that the third level will be slightly noticeable, but that might be too much to hope for.  It would be really nice if those abilities that are hard to spot had some visual indicator of when they fire; for example, a message saying &quot;The hand of the tribunal steadies you!&quot; would be nice.</div></div><hr />
