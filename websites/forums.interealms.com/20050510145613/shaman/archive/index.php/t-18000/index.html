<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaman11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just gained access to here and was trying to solo some stuff. So far anything I pull has moderate resists but it rootable/slowable. Also everything I fought so far summons. Its about 20 percent slowable which means they still tripple for ~700 like they're hasted. Some proc stuns, other casts 500 point messes and kill you.<br />
<br />
I guess my question  is - is there anything that a Shaman can solo in PoTime A and if the answer is no, then the follow up is what is the easiest mob in there? I'm pretty sure that the bristletail cats are soloable by a shaman with superior gear to mine. On my best attempt, I got it to 67.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is pretty much no reason to solo in time A. Noting there and so so xp at best not near worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most of the stuff have around 42k hp and give 7-8% aaxp iirc. It's not really worth exping here unless you are waiting for your raid to form or something.<br />
<br />
They have like no disease resist btw, so use VP3 instead of root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">btw, the mammoths and cougars are the easiest mobs there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe...people try to xp here?<br />
<br />
Only thing I ever do is aggro the golems that proc (maybe cast) FD and run over to the raid gathering area for entertainment <br />
<br />
Fun for the whole guild! :P</div></div><hr />
