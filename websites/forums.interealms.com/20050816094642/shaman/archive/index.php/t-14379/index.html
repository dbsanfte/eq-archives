<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to make myself a basic roadmap on where I will be spending my AAEXP as I aquire it. I plan to level first (maybe stop at 60/61 to get CANN5) but truthfully AAEXP is pretty unfamiliar to me, never really looked at it much.<br />
<br />
When it says &quot;12 AA in Archetype&quot; as a requirement does it mean 12 points spent or does it mean 12 levels? If I buy MC3 for 6 points, is that 6 towards the 12 or 3?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can provide.<br />
<br />
Also, if there is a &quot;common&quot; roadmap of AAEXP you'd suggest I'd love to see it (Run3, Regen3, MC3, etc...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">12 in archetypes means 12 points spent. If you're going for Canni V as soon as possible, then that will be all 12 points spent in MC1, 2, 3.<br />
<br />
Most shamans tend to go run3/regen3, MC3, Canni V.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm sure others could explain this better, but here's my take on AA's:<br />
<br />
You have to spend 6 general points to 'unlock' the archetype abilities.  Common spends are Run3, Regen3, Metabolism, possibly even Wisdom.  Most of these cost 1 point per 1 ability (or increase in ability) so Run3 -- 3 levels of Run -- costs 3 AA points.<br />
<br />
Once you've spent 6 general (they have to be spent, having 6 points banked won't help!) you can start buying archetype skills.  Most of the archetype skills cost 2/4/6 -- 2 points for first skill, 4 for second, 6 for third.  So by the time you purchase 3 levels of an archetype skill, you'll have spent the 12 points required to unlock the class skills (or if you purchase one level of six skills).<br />
<br />
Most class skills require (in addition to spending 12 archetype skill points) some archetype requirement -- for example, CannV requires MC3.  Class skills may have just one level -- like CannV -- or may have three levels; if the latter they usually (but not always) cost 3/6/9 (so 3 levels of a class skill would cost 18 points).<br />
<br />
In each of these cases, meeting the requirement of points spent (not levels, not skills, just total points in that category) unlocks the next 'type' of skills -- and grants you a nifty new title to boot!<br />
<br />
So a good 'general' roadmap to CannV would be:<br />
<br />
Two of the following:  Run3, Regen3, Metabolism3.<br />
MC3<br />
CannV.<br />
<br />
Then you get to all the 'other' fun AA's -- like SCM3 which saves 10% mana on all spells cast, MGB (always handy for raids), planar power (which increases all your stats maximum by 5), and so on. :)</div></div><hr />

That's exactley the information I was looking for! <br />
<br />
Thanks a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you dont need metab 3 to continue into archtype, regen/run 3 is 6...id only maybe reccomend metab if u had a horse and found it a plm keeping food/drink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't ever see myself wasting aa pts on metbolism until I have gotten so many aa pts there is almost nothing else to spend them on.<br />

<br />
Metabolism 3 is well spent.<br />
I don't eat crap food.<br />
Neither does my horse.<br />
I eat high quality food like hero sandwiches and kaladim ale.<br />
Those foods need items farmed to be made.<br />
They also cost me money in the bazaar because quite frankly, I h8 trh8skills.<br />
When I first got my horse, I was wondering why I had to keep buying so much food, until I found out my horse eats too.<br />
It was right then that I started working on metab3.<br />
Currently, a stack of miraculous food/drink lasts me about 2 weeks real life playtime, or more if our guild is raiding or I'm hunting indoors.<br />
Metab3 is more useful to me at present than regen3 is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Metab3 is awesome if you use expensive foods and are on a horse a lot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On my server MTP goes for 8-10pp (= 160-200pp a stack) same for kaladim ale. That would be 320-400pp for a stack of food and drinks. Sure, that will be enough for a day or 2 on a horse but then you have to restock it. In the same time you can get the 3AA for metabolism3. Sure that wont be much money but regen3 isn't that big too.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would say for the 6AA in the general tab get rs3 and (regen3 or metabolism3). Well, if you do lot of tradeskills you can even put 3AA into the tradeskill AA (after rs3). ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Riiiiight..<br />
Then I guess you don't want using good stat food (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29781) like this platter ...<br />
<br />
I have Metabolism 3 and it just owns. I don't have a horse tho, I never really needed one /shrug<br />
But making 1 stack of those platter takes some time and it's nice to keep the same stack for weeks of raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 plat !?!  Per bag of food ?!? I don't eat junk food.<br />
<br />
Misty Thicket Picnic: Str: +5, Sta: +5, Wis: +5, Int: +5, HP: +20, Mana: +30  - Cost 3-5 plat per item on MT.<br />
 <br />
Qeynos Afternoon Tea:  Agi: +5, Dex +5, Wis +5  - Costs 5-15 plat per drink on MT.<br />
<br />
At the cheapest cost thats 160p for a stack of each netting me:<br />
Str +5<br />
Dex +5<br />
Agi +5<br />
Sta +5<br />
Wis +10<br />
HP +20<br />
Mana +30<br />
<br />
Metabolism 1 reduces hunger and thirst by 10%, Met2 by 25% and Met3 by 50%.<br />
<br />
Seems pretty obvious why I spent those 3 point on metabolism when I grind xp 90% of the time in outdoor zones sitting on my Lizard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm curious why anyone wastes AA on Planar Power, unless of course they've gotten pretty much everything else?<br />
<br />
I mean, we've gone over the near utter uselessness of stats and people still spend AA points on them???  It's cheap at 2pts per level sure, but still those are 2 pts you could use to bump a resist up by 4 which IMO is more useful than 5 stat points.<br />
<br />
I just don't get all the people I see ooh and aahing over PP5 because now they can max out their stats at 305!!!!  Wis/Int is gimped at 200+ and Sta is gimped at 255+ so who freakin cares about 5 more of any of them really?  A shaman especially. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use MTP and QAT, a stack lasts me quite a while and I do use my horse.  I see Metabolism as interesting, but not as good as Run/Regen/Cann/MGB/Radiant Cure/Natural Durability/lots of dogdogs/lots of other AA's.<br />
<br />
AA's come easier for some than me, I know.  I'm very time-constrained.  However, I often have 30-45 minutes after I get home from work and before the wife and kids get home to farm plat in a greenie zone, like Crystal Caverns or any of the leather padding farm zones.  30-45 minutes once a week keeps me in quality stat food and drink all week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude thats great you think its useless.   I tend to agree with others and say Metab3 is well worth it.  I dont have yet but plan on getting very soon.   Im guessing you dont have a mount or if you do  perhaps are overloaded with plat.  Maybe your one of those shms i see in PoK  selling buffs fro donations.   I personally DONT see that as useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the others  out there who are looking for GOOD AA info,   Metab3   should not be overlooked.  Not one of the most important areas to train, but trust me, you'll be thankful when your not running back for food every day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I use Hero Sandwich and Qeynos Tea in my bag.  However, I have a bag lower than that with regular food and frink in it, which I forcefeed.  With my Metabolism 3, I've been using the same single stack of hero's and tea's and have eaten 3 and 2, respectively.<br />
<br />
Summoned food and drink works just as well, but since I have a drood that forages for the tea leaves, I have plenty of foraged food, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">pffft Rather spend the 10 Plat on a bag full of food then spending hours getting AA xp on something I SEE as useless.<br />

<br />
Since you only have 18aa according to your magelo profile it doesn't surprise me that you don't have Metabolism but then again you don't have alot of other nice aa's either or even cann v that most people consider first order of business. That doesn't mean just because you don't have it yet and don't see it as being useful that it isn't.<br />
<br />
The simple facts are.<br />
<br />
Horses noticably increase the rate at which you eat food. Anyone who's had one can confirm this since it's easily noticable. To me this was noticable to the point that it annoyed to have to stock up on food/drink so frequently using iron rations/pings.<br />
<br />
Fact 2<br />
Stat foods and drinks can provide descent stat bonuses. The better the stats the rarer/more expensive the food/drink on average. Someone already linked the platters. 75hps/mana food is nothing to sneeze at. If you want resists you can get those too. Food and drink have become yet another stat slot for alot of people.<br />
<br />
Combine those 2 facts together and you get the obvious outcome that it can be hard to use stat food/drinks when you use a horse. You have a couple options in dealing with this. You can buy/make lots of food/drink and just accept it. You can not us either the horse or stats food/drinks. Or you can do what you can to reduce the consumption rate, IE buy metabolism 3. Or you can try force feeding to save your stat foods.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't find the force feeding much of a viable option. Force feeding halves the duration that the food/drink lasts from it's normal duration. The decreased duration combined with accelerated consumption from a horse = food doesn't last very long. Making it a real pain to keep the food in stock and increasing the odds of accidentally consuming the good stuff.<br />
<br />
Personally use halas meat pies and kaladim constitutionals as my standard foods. That adds 30hps 10 sta 5 agility 5 dex and 5 sv all. Those wouldn't be practical imo with out metabolism. There are other options out there that add even more stats out there too. Those are just what i use right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok, question time here.<br />
<br />
Using both stat food and drink. Are you able to use both at the same time? I was under the impression that only the first slot effected the stats like this (like range does, but ammo slot doesn't). <br />
<br />
How does this work, and how are the slots arranged?<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Your topmost food item and topmost drink item are both consumed when you are 'hungry enough' and 'thirsty enough' -- if you forcefeed other food/drink first you'll never reach that point.<br />
<br />
Whatever food / drink would be consumed if that point were reached, is what is considered for stat purposes.  So if your top bag, top left corner, had a stack of hero sandwiches, you'd get the bonuses.  If the stack right below it was MTP's, you wouldn't get the int/wis from MTP -- but if you swap them around (even if you just ate a hero sandwich because you reached that point of hunger) you'd immediately get the int/wis.  Same for drinks.<br />
<br />
And you can get bonuses for your topmost food *and* topmost drink at the same time (but not two foods nor two drinks)<br />
<br />
That help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Geez, guess I have something to look forward to. I'll I do is buy 3 stacks of Iron rations and 3 stacks of milk and thats it. Sometimes I might have some fish rolls on me, but I usually don't spend my time tradeskilling that often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks Skeeter. <br />
Hell, been playing for 4+years now, and still learning new tricks :)<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For those that sneer at metabolism -- and for those that are using fish rolls and milk! ;) -- here is something to consider.  Now, if you're max wis / sta this isnt such a big deal, but for the majority of us...<br />
<br />
Foods to consider:<br />
<br />
Misty Thicket Picnic (aka 'MTP') -- 5 str/sta/wis/int.  Miraculous meals, so easy to forcefeed fish rools or iron rations to avoid wasting these.  I play on Test, so not sure on prod prices, on Test usually 10ish pp.<br />
<br />
Halas Meat Pies (aka 'HMP') -- 5 dex/sta/agi and 30 hps.  Also miraculous, but giant sized and weigh 7.2 pounds each.  On Test these are 5ish pp each if not cheaper -- can often get stacks for free off folks skilling up.<br />
<br />
Hero Sandwiches -- 10 str, 5 dex/sta/wis/int/agi, 30 hps, 30 mana.  Takes hero meat from HOH, so not sure if they're for sale -- on Test they're 'friends only.'  But yummy!  Miraculous meal.<br />
<br />
Justice Fruit Pies -- 15 dex, 5 sta/wis, 15 hps, 15 mana.  Miraculous meal that takes a POJ forage and a couple of celestial essences -- so plan on paying a bit more for these.  Again, on Test I make these for friends only.<br />
<br />
Drinks -- not as many options here!<br />
<br />
Qeynos Afternoon Tea -- 5 dex/agi/wis/int. Miraculous drink.<br />
<br />
Kaladim Constitutionals -- 5 sta, 5 to all resists.  Miraculous drink.<br />
<br />
Surefall Ranger's Trail Juice -- 4 dex/sta/wis.  Miraculous drink.<br />
<br />
Grobb Liquidised Meat -- 6 str/sta, -1 int/wis.  Miraculous drink.<br />
<br />
All of these drinks take a little work to make (either foraged items, groundspawns that take a while to collect, or a lot of combines) so they won't be 'cheap' -- but they're worth it IMO.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are other foods/drinks that are favorites -- but these are the ones I tend to make/use the most...<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Just to 'do the math' ..  Assume you have Hero Sandwiches and Kaladim Constitutionals in your top slot.  Here's the net effect on your stats:<br />
<br />
STR +10  STA +10  DEX +5  AGI +5  WIS +5  INT +5  HP +30  Mana +30<br />
+5 to MR/FR/CR/DR/PR.<br />
<br />
How much would you pay for an item like that?  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kaladim constitutionals do not require foraged ingrediants or a lot of combines...but they DO require a corking device (about 1k-1500pp from a reputable tinker) and wandering around Kaladim all the time looking for the groundspawn ingrediants.</div></div><hr />
