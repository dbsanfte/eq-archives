<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Learn to canni-dance. Everyone should at least know how it works and have a hotkey set up somewhere... love it or hate it, theres times it will be the difference between winning a fight and losing it. Typical set-up might be:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 4 (or whatever spell slot cannibalize is in)<br />
/pause 11 (or whatever lets you cast it and leaves time to sit)<br />
/sit <br />
<br />
This is from the tips at the top of the page.  I made it and I used it.  Than I just clicked the canni icon.  ( Which I click and dragged to a hotbutton)<br />
<br />
Heres the question.  That I'd rather feel silly askin' than not ask at 'tall ehehe<br />
<br />
I don't see why the canni dance button is better. . does that 2 secs of sitting between canni's help add to the mana regen? I didn't notice any difference when using it vs just plan hittin' canni.<br />
<br />
hmm okay thats it  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In terms of natural regeneration of mana (as opposed to cannibalising for mana), you get more mana regeneration sitting down than you do standing up. I don't know the exact figures, but lets say, for the sake of argument, that you get 1 mana per tick standing and 10 mana per tick sitting (a &quot;tick&quot; being 6 seconds)<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration is not continuous: That is to say that that, when sitting, you do not get 1 mana every 0.6 seconds over the 6 seconds. You actually get 0 mana for 5.999 seconds, and then you get all 10 mana in 0.001 seconds of the actual tick-over<br />
<br />
This means that you can run, jump ride horses and play the piano for most of the 6 second period as long as you are sitting down when the actual tick-over occurs. So, anyhting that you can do in between tick-overs does not effect your natural mana regen, as long as you are sitting at the right time.<br />
<br />
Canni-dancing takes advantage of this non linear natuaral mana regeneration. Bascically, because it is possible to stand up, cast canni, andsit down in less than 6 seconds, it is possible to benefit from both natural (10) and canni (35) mana regen. And the natural mana has the advantage that you do not have to sacrifice hp for it.<br />
<br />
The important thing is, though; when to be sitting? When is the actual tick-over? The easiest way to know is to open your inventory and watch your current hp display (we will assume that you have a regen spell running). The tick-over is when your hp make the icrease from the regen (hp regen is also not continuous, but comes in discrete bursts at the tick-over). <br />
<br />
You can be thankful you were not playing back in the days when the only way to way to see tick-over was to stare at your hp bar and try and see a 15hp jump in a 1 inch bar that was displaying 2000hp.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, in summary, it not the 2 seconds of sitting, its what happens when you are sitting, if you are sitting at the time when it happens!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the idea behind canni dancing is to try &amp; time the canni right after each tick &amp; sit down again before the next tick so you get a mana regen from the canni &amp; regular mana regen. <br />
<br />
so what the hotkey does is just eliminates you having to hit the sit/stand key twice for each cycle as well as the canni key &amp; it combines the three key strokes into just one... just hitting the canni dance hotkey over &amp; over for a couple of hours is sort of annoying, I wouldn't wanna triple that agro with three key strokes every tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehe guess we were posting at the same time Weyalan.. anyways what Wey said :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Under the old UI that was the easiest way. Under the current UI, the easiest way is to have one that shows your HP either as a raw number or a % on your player info screen (either in addition to or in the place of the bar) and watch that. That way you don't have your inventory screen up blocking your view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only two little things to add:<br />
My hp bar doesnt refresh at the same time my mana bar does... I woud say: look at your mana percent, not your hp. <br />
And the mana you gain sitting is proportional to your meditate... like 1 mana/tick for each 10points in medditate. (not a parsed formula, just an estimation).<br />
Love your percents: looking at a pixel waiting for it to appear was... ***.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol okay thanks guys great explanations :) I even put this thread in my guilds Q&amp;A lol it scared the non shammys :lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I understood the formula for figuring out one's natural mana regen rate was your meditate skill level * 0.08... meditate skill of 250 give a mana regen rate of 20m / tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">funny, i always made the hot key cause im lazy...and dont wanna click: stand, canni, sit...LOL<br />
<br />
i hate being w/o muh drolvarg or whatever it is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are UI mods that will show you ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Huckle Berry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If I recall right, in the old UI when in inventory would show a class symbol.  Every tick the symbol would have an animation of some sort for most classes.  Rng bow would turn, mage hand would open, etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just for perspective, with canni 4 I get 3% mana per cast, and if I time it right I usually get 1% from meditate.<br />
<br />
If you are on a horse you get to skip the dance routine, because you always get the meditate mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ouch, 55 is a late time to learn canni dance..only a few levels to canni4 when you can stop medding completely..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The dance is of most use during the early levels, once you get stoicism it starts to become quicker just to canni down and heal up.  That has been my eperience anyway.</div></div><hr />
