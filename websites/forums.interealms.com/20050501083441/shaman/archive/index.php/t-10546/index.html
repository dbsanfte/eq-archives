<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My fiance's rogue is 42 now... and I'm tired of the complaints that she can't join me on a raid with it (she used to have a high level cleric, so she misses it) so I need to get her some levels fast :o<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that I need to get her to 47 or so, and then take her to PoN or PoD... but these 5 levels are moving slowly.<br />
<br />
How do you folks PL an alt at this level? I'm 62, all spells, and she does get exp while grouped with me (albeit a lot less, but this way the pet can help too) and I basically pull with slow, root the mob, beat on it and send in pet, and use proximity to keep it off her while she tears it apart. I do however still outdamage her when the pet is up as well, so I keep us grouped.<br />
<br />
Also where to go? It's been a LONG time since I was that level :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could try city of mist, katta, seafuries in OOT, DL, BW, the hole, Velks.  At that level I would recomend CoM as they will be green to your shaman and you will not get the exp while she should get the whole.  You can try that in a number of places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Find a place with stuff that cons red to her that you can tank. <br />
<br />
Have rogue engage at max melee range. Slow it. Cripple it (adds agro for you and helps the rogue hit). Poison DoT if it wont KS the mob. Finally to keep agro cast flash of light. Just make sure that you are in melee range when you cast Flash or the mob will wander off blinded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm...I Pled a friends rogue while I was 50ish and she was late 30's.<br />
<br />
I went somewhere where the Mobs were red to her (Happened to be blueish to me).  We werent grouped.  I slowed and bebuffed one, rooted it, and stood right in its face.  so close I could smell its breath.  then it weas just a matter of keeping my health up (no problem) while she BS'ed it.  Just reapply root if it breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is it faster to be grouped and kill the mobs with more than 2x her DPS (with Righteousness and my pet, I KS her every time... actually I think pet alone does), or have her kill slower but be ungrouped and get full exp?<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Jagged Pine poachers.  All rogues, don't hit that hard, and you'll have a slight chance of possibly getting the half-elf illusion mask.  I spent those levels there with my rogue, but never got the mask.  Halfway decent loot - poachers drop animal skins which you can tailor yourself or just sell.<br />
<br />
City of Mist is good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Root the mob and stand on top of it, and keep the rogue at max distance.  Bloodgills should be excellent experience if you want to brave the water (not that bad).  Otherwise CoM is pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grimling caves in tem mnts were very good until 44. Like level every other hour or so. <br />
<br />
After that CoM is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This isn't about a place to PL, but a question to a previous poster. Are you certain that if the mobs are green that the person who does get xp gets the whole sha-bang? I could swear that they dont. They still get the percentage left over  that you dont take even though you get no xp.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a 'friend' with ShowEQ that cold verify the xp given?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would try the Hole Zone Entrance. You can single pull the mobs and the Rogue would get great exp. Is is still 18% exp bonus in the Hole?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nuor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd also suggest Bloodgills.<br />
They took me through 42-48 quite fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I leveled my warrior on the 6th floor of Tower of Frozen Shadow just fighting the drolvarg things by the front of that level. They will take you fairly quickly from the 40's to level 51, at which point they become mostly light blue. I didnt group with my warrior, even though we could. Just slow the mob and let the rogue do half of the mobs health in damage, then send in pet to help finish it off quickly.<br />
<br />
Seafuries would probably be a good option as well. They only hit for 76, and are still mostly dark blue at level 52 (some light blues).</div></div><hr />
