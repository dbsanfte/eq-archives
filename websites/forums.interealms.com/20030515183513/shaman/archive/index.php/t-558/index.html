<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here is my situation.<br />
<br />
I get the opportunity to play about 2 hours per day :( except on weekends :)  .<br />
<br />
Would I be better off soloing for those two hours or finding a group?  I am currently lvl 44, I have no problem getting a group but is sharring the exp killing me in the long run?<br />
<br />
Just curious as to your thoughts on this.  Also interested to find out how most of you play or played at lvl 44.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Experience for me has always been much, much better in a decent group. Duoing with any melee/hybrid class except Rogue is a pretty safe bet. Try to find a decently-populated zone in which you could both solo and group, so that you can be looking for a group while soloing, rather than running from zone to zone and possibly ending the night having gotten no experience. Avoid dangerous zones that require a full, well-balanced group, as you'll waste an hour sitting around, waiting for so-and-so's guildmates the Cleric and Enchanter to show up, because everyone refuses to fight without rez and Clarity at hand.<br />
<br />
At Level 44, I eked out the last bit of solo experience in The Overthere, and then headed to City of Mist and Timorous Deep for pickup groups from 45-50. I wish I'd started grouping earlier, at Level 40, with Togor's and maxed Defense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG take that back!! :)<br />
<br />
I've mostly duel-comped my rogue with my shaman and it rocks.<br />
Hasted rogue + slowed mob + buffed shammie = lotsa exp<br />
<br />
At level 44 I'd consider finding a melee (rogue or monk preferrably) partner and slaughtering kobolds in SolB.<br />
<br />
If duoing with a rogue just make sure your shammie has good good ac/hp/sta gear and buffs so they can take a few hits when the rogue evades to backstab (or when a slow fails! Rogues cant taunt, except by doing a big backstab or two).<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any class but Wizard here.  Root and rot doesn't work very well when the darn wizard is breaking it on you.  Any other class I don't mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soloing, at 44 is toughish because your strong enough to take an HG but it costs you about 5 mins of down time and I don't do Dreadlands out of hatred for the LOIO/FM/Dreadlands/Karnor people.  <br />
<br />
At 45, Ferrott is wonderful as you can do 2 specs in a downtime pulling the single tree and the first one in the cave (make sure you park your pet as you will aggro the spec behind the one in the cave and pull 3 if your 1) not 45 and 2) your pet is with you (his level aggros) ) which yields about a bubble an hour or so.<br />
<br />
Yes, I hate soloing too, but I'm in a mad rush to make 46 in 1 week while only getting in maybe 1.5 to 2 hours a night.<br />
<br />
Grouped, SK's are WONDERFUL as are Pallys and Rangers as well..especially rangers.. I LOVE havigtn a mana battery</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my experience, a good group will rake in the experience much faster than just soloing. You don't necessarily have to have a full group, but a duo or trio would be nice. Most of my levels have been the result fo grouping with a warrior and ranger. We made a great trio. The experience was incredible. I have soloed a lot lately to catch up some lagging skills and the experience still comes in nicely, but it doesn't compare to the experience I gained while grouping with them. It was nothing to gain a level in a single gaming session. Levels come more slowly now, of course, but fortunately, the spells are increasing in power these days, so soloing is much more viable. Also, it's nice to have a break from looking at other people's hp-meters. Both grouping and soloing have their advantages and disadvantages. I'd recommend that if  you don't have much time to play, solo. Or just put out the work that you're looking for a group. Solo until you get a response. That way, you don't waste any time waiting. Some nights, you'll find a group immediately, others, it could take a while. At level 44, though, you should have no problem getting into groups. By those levels, most players have come to realize how nice it is to fight SLOWED mobs as opposed to non-slowed mobs. Buffers/healers are almost always welcome also. Just do whatever you're in the mood for on a given evening. That's the great thing about being a shaman. You can group wonderfully, but if you wanna keep to yourself, soloing is fine too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman Monk makes a killer duo, as does really shaman (insert tank class here).<br />
<br />
<br />
Though never turn down a Duo with a Necro.  Fear kiting mobs with dot's and pets kicking their butts is good xp.<br />
<br />
Shaman, Necro, Rogue is just as good if not better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Takk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At your level, I did a lot of soloing.... I was in the same fix. Finding a group can be a pain at times. What you can do is pick a nice zone that requires a slower (usually in a dungeon) and with mobs near by that you can solo. I usually spend no more than 10 mins LFG. If I don't find one I solo...<br />
  The main reason why I would pick one place to group is that you want to develope a good rep. If you are a decent player, you will soon become a desired commodity. Finding groups becomes very easy. People tend to pick people they know...<br />
  For weekends get variety so that you don't get burned out on a place.</div></div><hr />
