<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buliwylf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. ow I know that I'm more of a &quot;lurker&quot; than poster, however I believe in getting as much information as possible. I have searched the threads continuously for many moons. I have found an veritable font of information on places to hunt solo/grp/duo, who to duo with, the best guides to alchemy and spell decritions aside from EQtraders and Lucy spoilers, probably a metric A**tonne of usefull tidbits on general playing pointers and tips for play.<br />
    That being said, i have a quandry, that all told, confuses the livin' hell outta me. A long time ago as a newb in full crafted dreaming of some mythic tales of nagafen(i just statred playing after Kunak was out for 3-4 months) I had the occasion to talk to some shaman freinds. Well more like shaman heros to me, when you have a rep for multi-mob-chain-pulls its nice to know a competent slower. I was asking all the questions about shamans ie. How does slow work really? Do you tank alot too? How is soloing for you? etc etc. I was told then (incorrectly I have come to find out) that slows were disease based. Period. End of story.<br />
     Fast forward a few years, 5 (yeah 5) server changes following RL friends back and forth from MM to various servers for one reason or another. Finally, about January I stop moving and playing various versions of my tanks (SK's mostly, several barbarian warriors) and decide finnaly on a class with all I ever wanted: a shaman.<br />
       So here's the question.... I have lived until most recently under the imppression that slows were disease based, and have, as such, debuffed with disease-line spells. Any mobs that resisted a first cast get debuffed and reslowed accordingly. Then all mobs of said type get debuffed 1st then slowed to maximize mann efficiency. I have NEVER used mal**** anything to debuff except for other casters and while have experimented with mal*** recently because of the boards I wanna know WHY? Why does it seem that Insidious Decay or ID works as a better debuff for Turgurs, which accorrding to Lucy's is a Magic check?<br />
      Sorry for the long-winded post, I just wanted to give a little info about me. 56 and going strong , have fun and remember &quot;If it can be SLOWED it can be KILLED! IF it's UNSLOWABLE I'll tank the SOB till he dies anyway![LEFT]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Our slows are checked against magic to land, but add disease counters.  They did this so that our slows won't get dispelled when people dispell mobs and also when a tank gets slowed by a mob a cure disease will get rid of it instead of having to dispell the tank and possibly stripping his buffs in the process.<br />
<br />
Until you get malo or malos my advice would be to cast your slow before you try malosinia (or whatever level spell you're at) and if slow gets resisted then toss on a maloxxx while waiting for your slow to refresh.  I say this 'cause you have the same chance of your slow landing as you do your maloxxx.   With malo or malos the opposite is true of course (they're unresistable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's all in your head.  You are expecting ID to help you slow, so when you ID and then slow lands, you attribute it to ID, and when slow bounces anyways, you right it off as an exception to the rule.  This is the same kind of thing that makes people think charisma helps you slow, agility makes you dodge more, etc...  I bet if you thought about it for a second, you could find about a billion real life examples of this same thought process at work (big one: religion ;) ).  I assure you that turgur's is 100% magic based as far as resists go.  It has disease counters, but it definately checks against magic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Warador's post summed up most of it.  Disease debuffs do absolutely nothing in terms of your chance of landing our higher pecentage magic based slows (Togors, Turgurs, etc).  If you feel it does it is because you've thought that way since level one.  At 56 I hardly ever had to debuff a mob to slow it so you probably just haven't noticed it yet but as you level you will see many times even normal experience group mobs will need some debuffing.  This will become extremely evident as you start raiding.<br />
<br />
For example long ago when I had just reached 60 I was raiding HoT.  I was one of two shaman on the raid but didn't have malo (unresistable).  So the other shaman would malo and I would slow.  Things went extremely smooth for the first couple of hours and I was usually landing slow on the first try.  When the shaman with malo had to leave it got extremely bad without malo.  After 60 minutes, 3 dead mobs and two wipes we had to call it quits because no one could get the mob slowed.  I decided right then that I would spend 100% of my time working on saving up for malo and after about 6 weeks I bought it for 60k.  The next week I went back with malo as the only shaman and everything went great.<br />
<br />
For now as Warador said don't worry much about debuffing because malosi has the exact same chance of landing as slow.  The only instance I'd really debuff first is if you can't take the beating of the mob unslowed.  Malosi has almost no agro so you can cast that all you want until it lands and then slow to avoid agro of chain slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use the Slow first - Malo if resist - slow again technique frequently.  But another technique is to have both Turgur's and Togor's loaded, and if Turgur's bounces then throw Togor's.  Gets you a lot of aggro, especially if both are resisted, but gets the mob slowed a bit faster.</div></div><hr />
