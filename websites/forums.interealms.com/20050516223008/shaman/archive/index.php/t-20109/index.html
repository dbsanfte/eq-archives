<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even posted strats won't help you much, you have to design a strat based on what you field for a raid force.  It's no good to have a strat written for 9 clerics when you only have 5.  <br />
<br />
Best way is to keep wiping until you finally get it.  Can be frustrating but feels good once you finally get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's not even really a strategy for this encounter.  The strategy is &quot;kill a bunch of mobs before the timer runs out.&quot;  That's all it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And what's so &quot;spoilerish&quot; in telling how to do something, Sciek? No need to get your panties in a twist if you don't want to tell. Sheesh. This site is for SHARING the information, and strats and battle strategies are one of them. Don't want to give it, then don't bother pressing the &quot;Reply&quot; button. Not to mention that I failed to notice anywhere in the rules a paragraph, which tells that no encounter data or mob data can be given on these forums here. Or you're one of those people, who prefers to keep all the data to themselves, and kill all the mobs needed for flagging so that no other people can get the flags, once you have your own flag?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Bertoxx strategy? In a nutshell, don't get hit.<br />
<br />
Seriously... if there is more than one player in your whole raid taking melee damage, you've just wasted 2 hours of people's time. That's really all ther eis to know about that fight, everything else derive from that simple fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The key to Bertox is having smart pullers driving the mob pulling.  <br />
<br />
You got to keep chaining them in.<br />
<br />
Once the nameds are all dead (I think there's 12), then the big cheese spawns.  <br />
<br />
By this time, we've holed ourselves into one of the hallways.  Pull Bertox with the guy you want to be rampage tank, and engage.  His rampage is a bear, so keep the clerics back and really be careful about managing the rampage list.  Multiple tanks should be shooting arrows in him before the heals start landing, ideally.    <br />
<br />
Do lots of DPS and kill him fast.  <br />
<br />
This isn't a very precise strategy, and lots better exist out there.  I don't lead the raid, I just run where someone tells me to go.  But this is what I've seen.  <br />
<br />
Bear in mind there's a timer.  So you can't dawdle on rezzes and buffing when folks die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1.  Kill the adds until the various named spawn.<br />
2.  Kill the named until there are none spawned, then go back to 1.<br />
3.  There are 12 named, plus Bertox.<br />
4.  Bertox has AE rampage and some nasty AE effects.<br />
<br />
Have fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think Sciek's point is that this is a Shaman forum not a strategy/spoiler board for EQ encounters. Perhaps more appropriate would be what is a Shaman's role on a Bertoxx encounter? And that would be nuke of course. I'm serious.</div></div><hr />

I did, in fact, answer his question... sort of.<br />
&quot;Was looking for a strat on the encounter anyone have one or know any links.&quot;<br />
I told him to go to the Safehouse.  I'm quite sure he can find a wealth of spoiler info there in their spoiler forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Morizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dont see the big deal in asking one question to a knowledgeable group of players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hail,<br />
<br />
I had a blast (sic) using Tears of Saryn &amp; Torrent of Poison for chain nukes on a Bert raid.  FoMM2 really shined!  :D <br />
<br />
We failed though when the pullers brought TWO named in at the same time.  :(  Not a good idea.<br />
<br />
As a shaman you should know which named are slowable and which are immune.  Debuff (&amp; slow if applicable) the named, assist heal as required, and rain nuke the trash w/o drawing aggro.  If you have an enchanter using charm in your group, babysit him since he'll squish awfully fast when pet breaks charm at the worst possible moment.<br />
<br />
Coordinate rebuffing efforts (you will likely have lots of post-rez buffing) with other shaman present to be more efficient.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just end up keeping Boar and Focus memorized the whole event, since people seem to be dying along the way.  <br />
<br />
Constantly swapping spells gave me a headache.  <br />
<br />
As a result, it was one of my not-so-favorite events.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pull a room at a time and then everyone nukes them down, pretty simple.  Use ae slows and poison nukes and dont be afraid to get infront of the mobs and let them hit you.  Mobs usually drop in about 20 seconds each with low 30s and pulls are typically 6 or 7 mobs per room that stack with a few roamers in camp.  Watch in awe as paladins and clerics with crit nukes clean up.  Pretty easy event if people arent slackers in your guild and afraid of taking a little pain.  With everyone on the ball should take about  30 minutes - 1hr to spawn bertox depending on forces once you get a couple runs for practice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You've got 2 hours (well, 2 hours and 5 minutes) to kill everything including bert.  I usually mem Tigirs, both rains, and whatever buff I'm responsible for.  <br />
<br />
Your monks will die, likely numerous times.  Buff them as soon as they're rezzed, don't wait for them to ask.  Time is critical, especially on your first few attempts.<br />
<br />
That's about it.  Monks bring stuff in, tanks pin it, everyone except the monks kill it, repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
On Bert, you need to be careful.  If people are too close to him (which they will be) they're going to get wasted by the ae rampage.  Unfortunately, it seems like you need to be within rampage range for spells to land, so get in, debuff him and get out.  Hopefully you won't die before he's debuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bertoxx ring isn't very hard.  My old guild spawned bertoxx on the first try at the ring, but we wiped because he popped directly on top of us.  What you want to do is fight the 12th king at his spawn point, then rebuff and run down the hallway to engage bertoxx.  We killed bertox on our first clean attempt, and that was almost a year ago.  Should be easy today.<br />
<br />
Tank pins him in a corner while melees attack from maximum range (this is how you fight all AE ramp mobs).  Burn him down.  It isn't a hard encounter, just long and tedious because of the two hours of constant pulling and killing.  Bertoxx himself is easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bertox is sooo much easier now that he doesn't wander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Trevalen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've never fought a mob with AE rampage before. I assume this means the mob does melee damage to several people besides the main tank. Is it a point blank AOE effect? How large is the range? Is this the same for all mobs? From a post above it sounds like melees attacking from maximum melee range will not be hit by the AOE rampage?<br />
<br />
On a somewhat related note, I once read a strategy that refered to 'jousting' as a raid strategy, which I think means having melees equip a big two-hander and running into melee range to take a swing, then running back out. The idea being that you leverage the high damage and long delay of the weapon to spend as little time in AOE range as possible. This sounds sort of gimp to me. Does anyone use that technique, and if so, am I missing any advantages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">IANAM (I am not a melee) but the trick to AE rampage seems to be to turn off run and slowly slowly slowly creep up to the mob with attack on. Moving up with tiny little baby steps, melee characters should find the &quot;sweet spot&quot; the place where they can damage the mob, but where they won't be hit by the AE rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've never fought a mob with AE rampage before.

<br />
<br />
Yep, AE ramp means everyone within range gets hit.  Range for rampage is just a tiny bit less than max melee.  I can't say if it's the same for all AE ramp mobs, but it seems to have been the same for all the ones I've seen so far.  And that's correct, melees at max melee don't get hit.  You can do the same thing as a caster, edge up until you start swinging but no farther and you should be able to cast on him without getting smacked.  It takes time is the only thing.<br />
<br />
For debuffing Bert, I'll usually just rush in next to the MT, debuff from there, and run out of range, both so I don't drag him closer to everyone else if I get aggro, and because I prefer debuffs to happen now rather than neatly.  That's largely personal choice though.  If I were the only shaman on the raid, I'd probably be a bit more cautious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">bert doesnt AE rampage, just really mean single target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Never heard that before, I'll have to turn Other Hits on next time and check that out.  If that is the case though, it seems like he's randomly picking people to ramp on rather than working off a proper rampage list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We've done bert kill flawless a few times, always one and only one rampage tank, and we've never advised max melee.  It is difficult to set due to his excessive melee range though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bert does not AE rampage .. period.<br />
<br />
Usually the best way to pull him is to use a ranger with WS for positioning, then all possible RT shoot 1 arrow, then main assist step in and take the aggro. Remember that Berts melee range is incredible large, so might need people and spam pets to push him to corner.<br />
From this point on it's about your MA, your healing crew amd your DPS. When defensive disc runs out the MA will probably just drop dead.<br />
<br />
Aparat from that stop killing trash (if you can manage) when King 9-12 spawned, because it's useless. Just takes down the clock.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

When he spreads the love around, it's 1 of 2 things generally. 1, rampage tank never got on the list properly. 2, folks got range happy on inc before MainTank got aggro and high enough on the list to control it.<br />
