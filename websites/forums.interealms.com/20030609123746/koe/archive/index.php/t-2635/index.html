<br />
Baking 142 - ran into a stone wall here because of the popularity of the brownie spawn in LFay for brownie parts. Someday I hope to increase this. It is just fun to me to make interesting stuff. Also can make any velious items like giant meat etc with stats. Wurm has plus 1 to a lot of things. All of the Velious items require components bought from the Othmir in CS. Feel free to bring me the items to be cooked. I usually have some things on me.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Blackened Tier'Dal: Int 2, Dex 1, Agi 1<br />
Smoked Wood Elf: Wis 2, Agi 2<br />
Dragon steak: Str 4, Dex 4, Sta 4, Agi 4, Wis 4, Int 4, Cha 4<br />
Frost giant steaks: Str 4, Sta 1 Banquet meal so lasts a while<br />
Pickled drake: Wis 2, Int 2<br />
Pickled frost giant: Str 3, Sta 3<br />
Pickled wurm: Str 1, Dex 1, Sta 1, Wis 1, Int 1, Cha 1, Agi 1<br />
Pickled wyvern: MR 3<br />
Sea green cookies: DR 2, PR 2<br />
Storm giant steaks: Str 4, Sta 1 Banquet meal<br />
Vegetable roughy: DR 2, PR 2 Banquet meal<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing 175 - Kind of lost interest in getting this increased because there is no use for me and never any requests for Smith made items. Is there anything currently that people need from this skill? Also one mega quest in SS that will need this up so I will probably get it to 195 soon.<br />
<br />
Brewing 181 - I am working at getting this to 195 just for grins. I don't think there is any use for it other than some interesting drinks from time to time.<br />
<br />
Fishing 128 - Not really a trade skill but is needed to get some fish for tailoring and shawl quest. Easy to increase.<br />
<br />
Fletching 195 - Needed to get it high for shawl quest so I did. Not sure if anyone needs anything from it? If people need arrows then let me know. I'll keep some on hand. Of course I can summon 3 dmg 75 rng arrows if you need them when we group.<br />
<br />
Jewelry 0 - Soon to be about 182 for shawl quest<br />
<br />
Pottery 148 - Easy to increase. Needed for Thurgadin gate potion so I think everyone should increase this. Not much use as a trade though.<br />
<br />
Tailoring 158 - Quite a few people got this to 158 for shawl quest. I am working on increasing this now. Very tough but should be in 160's soon.</div></div><hr />
