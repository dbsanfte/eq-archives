<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tossen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having read all the finger wagglers &quot;so called&quot; expertise in the area of Spell Casting Mastery from Graffe's, Mage's Compendium....pretty much anyplace that had any relevant info on the subject. 99% speculated guessing from what I could tell, and about 1% actual elbow grease of doing the work. <br />
I decided to finally come back to where I know the community is logical and wise.<br />
The question I have is this: <br />
<br />
SCM lists as increases the chance that a player will successfully get a specialization roll<br />
now everything I read from all caster sites denies this saying that ALL spells are given the same mana reduction regardless of what it is. They list test after test from hackers all over claiming they parsed the whole world down to the milisecond and none of it is true.<br />
<br />
Does your specialization come into account when using SCM3 or are all spells given equal mana reduction ? I tend to believe the words of the shaman then those lousy finger wagglers behind their parsed logs. I am 1 AA from MGB and then SCM is next in my sites and I finally had enough of the minions claiming they are right and everyone else is wrong.<br />
<br />
As I have only seen speculation from all these robe wearing freaks (minus those anoyying parse statistics which are for the birds in my opinion), I figured there are some of you out there who have actually seen results and can speak from experience. Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">about 80% of the spells I cast all day long are alteration. I am spec'd in alteration. I notice a lowered mana  cost MOST DEFINATLY. <br />
<br />
So does it work on things like icestrike, and acumen? I wouldnt think so. Then again this is everquest and it seems to be about 50/50 for things working the way they are supposed to. <br />
<br />
But if it did work on all spells then what would be the point of focus effect of things like mana preservation and affliction afficiency?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is it? <br />
Specialisation is the means by which a caster increases their mana efficiency in a given area of magic.  Once an Intelligence based caster reaches Level 20, or a wis based caster reaches level 30, they obtain the ability to specialise in the fields of magic.   Whilst a caster can specialise in all five fields of magic, only one field can exceed a skill of 50.  Whichever skill first exceeds 50 becomes the primary specialisation of the caster from that time on.  If you choose the wrong specialty, you can alter it by completing a quest in the Temple of Solusek Ro.<br />
<br />
How does it work?<br />
<br />
When a spell is cast a roll is thrown to see if it receives the specialisation bonus.  The higher your specialisation skill the more likely it is the roll will succeed, and the greater the benefit of the roll.  A successful roll will do two things: <br />
<br />
It will reduce the mana used on the spell. <br />
It will reduce the chance of fizzling. <br />
An unsuccessful roll will merely cause you to cast the spell with normal mana cost and fizzle chance.<br />
<br />
Note:  It has been confirmed by Geoffrey Zatkin, the once Arch-Magi at Verant that: <br />
<br />
Specialisation does not increase chance of recovering after interruption.  This is based purely on Channelling <br />
Specialisation does not make spells cast faster.  This is a fixed amount. <br />
To raise your skill you will need to spend one practise point in the skill initially.  This will raise your skill to around 25 or so.  Spend 1 point in each of the five skills.  After this the best idea is to pick the specialisation you want, memorise a Level 1 spell of that type and cast it on yourself for an hour or so until you reach 51 skill.  After that you can simply go and play normally safe in the knowledge your primary specialisation is set.  It rises fairy quickly so don't be surprised to see it climb up fast.  The max skill limit on specialisation is 5 + (5 x Level), with a maximum of 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kaneex - that info is, simply put, a load of crap. The part about how it works anyway.<br />
<br />
There is no roll. It is a fixed savings on every spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The original poster asks for shaman to come forth and tell him what we KNOW from our experiences and at the same time dismisses all the parsed logs from other classes... Um what exactly do you think we shaman are going to do if we want to KNOW what an ability does, if not parse logs?<br />
<br />
WTS : A clue.</div></div><hr />

They know what they are talking about.<br />
<br />
They parsed it..<br />
<br />
basically..<br />
<br />
SCM = ~10% on all spells<br />
specialization = ~10 on that class of spells<br />
<br />
the effects stack..<br />
<br />
<br />
note: this is from memory, and could be wrong.. but Graffe's has the full correct parsed information.<br />
<br />
They are the ones that know best.<br />
<br />
They are the experts on mana regen/mana pool/mana saveing<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I haven't parsed anything myself, but I can tell you that I am 100% sure my healing spells (particularly noticable when chain casting chloroblast) cost less mana (~10% sounds right) now having SCM3 versus when I had no SCM at all.<br />
<br />
No hard evidence of course, but there isn't any possible proof that would convince me otherwise of my observations.</div></div><hr />

agree, about 1 year ago there was a huge thread about parse on SCM, they got result and put it in FAQ; also they parse MP3 item random save 1-10% with average 6% save mana, not alway 10% saving<br />
<br />
this AA skill is very well worth it, only canni5 or maybe QB2 better than it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tossen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for those of you that posted some info. While I don't discount Graffe's sight having originaly played the Wizard class, the boards have changed dramticially from the old days where it used to be a great place for information to more of a &quot;I am right, you are wrong&quot; forum. So trying to syphon through a lot of that starts to get to you after a while.<br />
<br />
Laeelin, thanks for the breakdown. The 4 threads I recently read on it claim both sides and I have been away from that site too long to remember who always the posted reliable stuff. Having spent more hours than I care to mention reading everyone's thoughts, feelings, what they heard, what they know, what they think they know, etc. on Graffe's, I appreciate your input. I went back and reread just the FAQ section and it's well put together in regards to this topic.<br />
<br />
Nytmare, thanks for that thread. I had used a search on this board for just SCM3 but I either missed this one or something. I remember being overwhelmed over the amount of threads that popped up so THANK YOU as well.<br />
<br />
Krakster, you thoughts on the mana preservation are exactly what I was wondering too. But if it did work on all spells then what would be the point of focus effect of things like mana preservation and affliction afficiency?<br />
<br />
While I generally don't like to retort to unhelpful reposts I feel obligated to at this point. I in no way trashed ANY class in my post, merely the continuous line of &quot;self proclaimed experts&quot; on the two sights I listed. The &quot;My parse is right, you don't know what you are doing&quot; stuff gets old reading 25 times per thread. If you fall into that category then by all means, take offense. If not, then reread the post, think about it and should you have something helpful to post that other players can benefit from, feel free to post it. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for those who have posted some good info so far, it is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
