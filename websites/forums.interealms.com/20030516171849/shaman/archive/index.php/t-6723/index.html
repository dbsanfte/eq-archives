<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have heard many times about the firepots room, but where is it exactly?<br />
<br />
Also, do you need a key or faction to use the firepots room?<br />
<br />
And where can you go to from the firepots room?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The firepot room is in the southwest corner of Timorous Deep.  I forget the exact loc, but you can probably find it at www.eqatlas.com.<br />
<br />
There are the tops of large wizzie spires sticking up out of the water over the firepot room.  The entrance to the room is on the sea floor in the middle of the spires (short swim downwards).  Going through the opening will drop you to the floor of the firepot room if you don't have levitate.  It's a good idea to bind yourself on top of one of the spires instead of in the room itself - that way, if you ever need to go to the Timorous Deep zone itself, you have that option (there is no way out of the firepot room itself other than clicking on one of the pots.)<br />
<br />
You don't need any key, faction, whatever to click on the pots and get teleported.  However, some of the pots dump you in aggro range of the local guards at the destination, so if you are kos it is a good idea to invis yourself before clicking the pot (clicking doesn't break invis).<br />
<br />
The firepots go to various cities around Norrath.  This includes Cabilis (sends you to a spot in West Cabilis near the LoIO zone, far enough away from the guards to be safe) but doesn't include Qeynos (I think, memories fuzzy), Highpass, Paineel, or anywhere in Velious or Luclin (which didn't exist when the firepot room went live).  The various light sources match the city they go to - Lavalamps for Ak'Anon, black kettle with the Freeport insignia on the side for Freeport, tall gold vase for Cabilis, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Remember, Faydwer may be spawned near the FP room. So if you must bind there, bind near a safe pot and when you gate, be ready to click asap. Don't idle there. You'll deathloop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When the Timorous Deep became bindable again, I bound myself on top of one of the spires, and have used the firepot room quite a lot since then.  In that time I have seen Faydedar in the area only once.  I had dived down from the spire and saw a really big fish parked over the entrance to the firepot room.  It took a second or two for recognition to set in, then a mad dash for the room entrance and click on the Cabilis pot.  In that time, Faydedar only managed to knock a little under a bubble of health off the bar (including the falling damage from entering the room un-levitated.)<br />
<br />
He is a threat, but a rare one, and survivable.  I understand it's worst when Faydedar gets stuck inside the room itself instead of continuing his normal path ;)</div></div><hr />
