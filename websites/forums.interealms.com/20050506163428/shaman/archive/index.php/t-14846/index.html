<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking to find out how other guilds handle rune/spec drops on raids.  Do the have officer loot, DKP them, or /rand them off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">officer loots them, turns them in, and hands out the result or sells it if it's a dupe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild does not use a DKP system. When we first started doing mobs that droped runes they went to the buffers first to get those 65 group spells.. focus of the seventh, hand of virtue, etc. After enough of the buffers had gotten those needed spells to make our raid prep time easier they were handled like we handle normal loot. However when we get a new buff class member or one levels up that is missing their 65 buff spells they usually have the best shot at getting the runes before other classes.<br />
<br />
It is also expected but not required that if you win a rune and get a duplicate spell that the dup spell is given to another guildie who is missing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">as someone else said, my guild also loots the runes and turns them in and hands out the spells accordingly...specs just /rand 1000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Specs are 1 dkp, but an officer usually loots and does a hand-in for classes that need some.<br />
<br />
Runes are 3 dkp. If you get a dupe that someone else needs, the dkp cost can be transferred along with the spell. Officers sometimes get ahold of raid buff spells like Focus of the Seventh and hand them out to needy guildies.<br />
<br />
Remove Greater Curse looted from Arch Lich raid is handed out to Shamans and Druids in order of guild status.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Guild leader or other officer loots.  Turns into spell for whoever needs it.  Preference went to buffers (I think), like mam's guild, until they'd gotten their group buff spells.<br />
<br />
We use officer loot system, not DKP or random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, we turned in eth/spec/runes first those classes that they would make the most difference for the guild overall first. <br />
<br />
The end result was that by good resource management, we got a nice power boost for the whole guild and achieved a majority of full spellbooks before all but the leading guild on the server.<br />
<br />
I had all my spells since like February I think so some things have changed in the meantime but preference was not necessarily to buffers first.  At the time we used bards for almost all our CC, mana regen and haste needs.  So bardsongs were high priority.   <br />
<br />
We have only 2 main clerics, so getting the new heals for our druid and shamans was high priority.   When we got runes we worked hard for HOV because single target Virtue is not only time consuming but costs your guildbank a fortune.  <br />
<br />
Shamans also got a lot of rune turn-ins because all our spells at 65 are very strong.  With all the str/dex spells still on our spec reward table, we did not turn in spectrals for shamans.  We just bought the important spells in the bazaar and gave shamans some preference on runes until most of the guild had their important spec spells.  Wizard runes spells suck, so we just sucked it up and paid for the good one, Strike of Solusek, instead of blowing our limited amount of runes.<br />
<br />
We were also distributing these spells as we were levelling up, so there was some amount of prioritizing by if the person was even high enough to use the spell.  What classes we have multiples of, in case we get a dupe, etc.<br />
<br />
The decision-making process we used was detailed and the guildleader and I pretty much talked about who needed turn-ins everyday.  We still do, and our turn ins are just for twinks and apps now.  Spectrals are FFA for twinks or looted by apps on our raids now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">About 50% of our runes and specs go to druids.  I don't know why.  The other half gets /randomed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Our guild just random's to all 65 that still need runes. Nobody gets top priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/1 200 for everyone that's level 65.  That being said, lots and lots of members bought their spells a few months ago and only the poor people /random when they drop now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We havent had that many rune drops, those that have their 65 spells just bought them most likely (myself).  When they do drop (same with spectrals), we just random to those who can use them immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Everyone present who can use it does a /random 1 500 and the top roller gets it.  There was lots of discussion over this, but it's hard to make it work any other way in a &quot;casual&quot; raiding guild where some folks don't show up all that often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Our guild just random's to all 65 that still need runes. Nobody gets top priority.<br />
<br />
...  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Spectrals are randomed. Anyone in the raid that is 63+ can roll. Runes are also randomed, but only level 65 full members can roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">we random both specs and runes if you are of the appropriate level to use them. I kinda wish the officers would loot them and either rotate through each class letting that class roll for the spell or do the turn-ins to try and get the important spells for the classes with good 65 spells. I know it is all random but it seems like the same people win the rolls. At the very least, treat it like a radio station... if you win a rune roll, you can't win again for 10 drops or something.</div></div><hr />
