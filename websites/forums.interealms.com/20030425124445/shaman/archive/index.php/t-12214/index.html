<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">about a man in Normandy who wanted to use the waters off of Omaha beach to grow oysters, and to spend his time putt-putting around in his boat there <br />
<br />
Wait, it gets worse<br />
<br />
 There is, for instance, a cemetery which is the final resting place of Canadian soldiers who died in France in WWI. However, it is now in the way. At least, it is in the way of a French developer who wanted the land to put in some commercial development. So he proposed that the cemetery be relocated <br />
<br />
Wait, it gets worse<br />
<br />
 Vandals have defaced one of the biggest British war cemeteries in northern France with graffiti condemning the US-British invasion of Iraq, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) said Monday.<br />
<br />
Insults aimed at British Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush were sprayed in red paint over a monument to Britain's dead from World War I <br />
<br />
But why would somebody do this?<br />
<br />
What is the cold hard truth?<br />
<br />
 . Thousands of English-speaking soldiers who died in France to defend it, or to liberate it, apparently cannot rest there in peace. Their very presence is resented; cold and silent, drawing no breath, they speak loudly and deliver a message that the French do not want to hear, against which there are no arguments.<br />
<br />
They bear mute testimony to the fact that the French could not defend themselves. Because of their presence and their inability to speak, they puncture French pretensions to greatness. They represent irrefutable proof that the French have had to rely, again and again, on us for salvation, but we have not had to rely on them. In the last 200 years, no English speaking nation has ever required French help to defend itself.<br />
<br />
Tens of thousands of Aussies and Canucks and Yanks sleep forever in the cold soil of France. But there are no French military cemeteries in Australia or Canada or the US.<br />
<br />
For this crime, for speaking the truth about French weakness and decline so eloquently by not making a sound, not even our military dead can be tolerated; the French must lash out and punish even those who gave everything they had for France.<br />
<br />
Our war dead have been targeted because they can no longer fight back.<br />
<br />
There can be no greater demonstration of the blackness of the French soul than this desecration. <br />
<br />
I am now of the mind that the french will sink to any level of depravity.  <br />

<br />
Are the waters toxic?  It's their land (or sea, or whatever), and I can think of few things that would honor the US more than for this man to be able to earn his living in peace.  It's one of the reasons we were there.<br />
<br />
As for the cemetery, US developers have asked to move Civil War plots -- even those of folks from their own states.  American morons deface everything, war memorials escape neither their notice nor their paint.  Come visit Portland, Berkeley, or Seattle; you'll grow to loathe the idiots, and these are domestically-bred idiots.<br />
<br />
There are several French military cemeteries in Quebec, parts of New England, and one in Louisiana.  None, however, founded after the early 19th century.  I seriously doubt there are any French military cemeteries in Australia--but several in what used to be French Indo-China.<br />
<br />
It's not just the French that can be stupid, tho they are getting their turn in the spotlight.  I'll be glad when they fade back into their realm of fungi, furs, wines and blue-veined cheeses.</div></div><hr />

 Man, I like your posts.<br />
<br />
97% of frenchmen are opposed to Iraq war btw. Now, their wormtongue idiot reps say that now that war has started, of course they are on the side of Coalition. I hate the french more and more everyday.<br />
<br />
<br />
A full third of frenchmen want the Coalition to lose the war by the way, can you say stinking filthy idiots?</div></div><hr />

Stupid people doing stupid, thoughtless, insensitive things are infuriating, no matter what nationality.  The French are in the spotlight right now, so we see all their stupid people shining in all their radiant stupidity.  But there are just as many stupid people doing stupid, insensitive things anywhere else in the world.  They're just not the focus of attention right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its ironic that the French are now so 'sensitive' about the rights of Arabs.  Anyone care to compare the withdrawal of Britain from Egypt and other Middle Eastern places, with that of France from Algeria?<br />
<br />
Actually I don't think the French would give one centime for the life of any Arab.  What they are doing now is just another expression of their hatred of all things Anglo-Saxon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And while I would not want to see this actully happen. Let a plane fly into the Ifol (sp) tower, or let an anthrax boom go off in a train station in france. Then see what they have to say about things. Its easy to sit on a pedastool when thing dont actully effect or touch you. But when you fall it hurts like hell.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, true, but go back a bit farther than that and the French were a big help to the nascent USA in the Revolutionary War - thus the fact that your town was named after the Marquis de Lafayette.  I guess you get to pick your own statute of limitations.<br />
<br />
But I agree that in this case the French have been callously self-serving.  They wanted the Iraqi sanctions lifted so they could cash in on their big oil contracts, screw the Iraqi people.  Now that the war is a done deal they want to push through diplomatic channels to put the UN in charge so they can ram their contracts with Hussein down the world's throat and get Iraqi oil cheap.  Oil may have been a factor in the US decision to go to war, but there's no way it was the deciding factor.<br />
<br />
The Norman Schwarzkopf quote that's been circulating is &quot;Going to war without the French is like going deer hunting without an accordion.&quot;  Dunno if it was really said by him but it's funny anyhow :-)</div></div><hr />

Britain &quot;is not worth an old shoe&quot;<br />
&quot;Their failure in this regard is abysmal. They want to tell the world changes thought - as a matter of fact, they do not respect the world, they want to tell taxpayers and the domestic public to keep them deceived. We will embroil them, confuse them and keep them in the quagmire. They have begun to tell more lies so that they might continue with the perpetration of their crimes. May they be accursed.&quot;<br />
&quot;We will kill them all........most of them.&quot;<br />
