<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cavan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a level 10 barbarian shaman looking for a better way to upgrade my armor than saving up tons of PP and buying it. Is there any way for me to quest for some ringmail or ANYTHING better than leather? Also- I've got morning star and shield right now. I plan on trying to keep my ability to be a backup tank for while at least. Any better weapons out there that are within my abilities to snag? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I could be misunderstanding you, but from the way you are describing your current armor and weapons, it sounds as though you are buying equipment from NPC vendors. If so, you are spending much, much more plat than you need to. What you want to do is buy hand-me-down equipment from higher-level players who have outgrown their items, or who have looted equipment from MOBs and are looking to sell it. You should be able to buy a full set of banded armor, which has better AC than ringmail, for anywhere from 40pp (someone nice making it for you 'at cost') to 90pp (the standard 1pp per AC cost for banded).<br />
<br />
There was a thread here recently about low-level 1H Blunt items, so you might want to look that up for weapon suggestions.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to buy from other players, really your only options at your level are to (a) make tailored studded/reinforced armor, which requires bear/cat pelts and some smithing ability (I actually made myself a full set of Studded Leather around Level 8), or (b) save up a couple hundred plat and become a master smith so you can construct your own banded.<br />
<br />
I don't know of any doable quests at that level for armor, but it's possible there's something new on Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hello!  If you can manage to get yourself to Shar Val on the moon, there is a ton of questable armor with fairly decent stats for the lowest levels (under lv. 20 or so).  Best lowest level quest armor I know off.   You will NOT be able to get there yourself, need at least a camp to run thru Paludal Caverns at your level, and you dead meat if it drops.<br />
<br />
They did just add low level quest armor in Misty Thicket/Rivervale (Moss Toe Leather) but it may only be wearable by druids/rangers and maybe only small races (no clue for sure since I have not seen a compelted piece, but seems directed at hobbits).<br />
<br />
Honestly,  If this is your 1st character, I would worry about leveling 1st, upgrades 2nd.  Money gets easy to earn as you get older. <br />
<br />
After you have managed to save up 100 pp or more, drag yourself to your Server's auction zone (EC on the Torv Server) and look for deals on low end equipment.  You can great some great deals on lower end armor because so much better stuff is now available and there is a ton of lower, older armor in circulation.<br />

Good luck to you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As the others mentioned, banded armor is cheap (at most, 1pp per ac -- standard price, so don't pay more than that). Also, it will last you well through your twenties if you don't come across anything better that you can afford. Concentrate primarily on getting your spells first, armor later. Once you're at a point where you are buying spells in advance, start concentrating on armor/weapon upgrades. It's hard getting started, if this is your first char, but it does get easier to get money as you get higher in level. In other words, concentrate on getting levels and your spells. The rest will take care of itself. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Definately start out by buying pieces of banded, look for good deals.  Never pay more than 1pp per ac but you can often get better deals than that.  As my dwarf warrior started getting bronze, i usually would sell my banded for less than 1pp per ac, the chestmail (AC15) i'd sell for 10-12pp.  It's a lot better than selling to a vendor but as you get into your 20s yo don't want to spend a lot of time trying to sell that stuff to people so you make it cheaper.  As for better weapons have you dnoe the quest for the Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal yet?  One of the shaman trainers in the guild in halas offers the quest.  You start off by telling Jinkus Filligan that you want to make a delivery.  Next talk to Cindl about mammoth parchment.   Then talk to greta about ink.  Give ink and parchment to Jinkus and he gives you a poster.  Put on sow and run to qeynos and go to the bank.  Outside is a barbarian named Dun, give him the poster and take the list he gives you back to Jinkus.  He gives you the symbol.  It's an ac3, +1 wis, +5 mana neck item that will cast Hammer of Wrath. for you.  A 6 30 1hb weapon with a +2 damage bonus against undead.  Not great but it's a free magic weapon if your morning star magic.  This allows you to smack whisps.  When yuo get to about lvl 17 or so yo can go to the Palaudal Caverns on Luclin (if you have it) and group to hunt the bandits.  The exp at that lvl is amazing and they drop bronze brigadine armor (which is basically ringmail) which you can sell if it doesn't fit or you don't need it, or wear it.  You can also hunt in unrest at arounf 18 though sometimes it's hard to get into a group inside the house at that lvl.  But the stuff inside the house drops ringmail (too small for you though) and otehr stuff you can sell.<br />
