<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We  have only several potions that are really useful, and some just semi-useful. I was thinking of one last night that wouldn't have been too overpowering; a potion that has like Rune 4 on it or something!<br />
<br />
Post yer own ideas :(  mebbe Verant will mek us sum guddemz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would keep most potions the same but i would make them cheap so they could be used on a dailty basis.  I really dont think its the potion quality that ruins alchemy ( for the most part ).  Its the cost.  Make breeze potions 5pp to make.  NOT 300! o whatever insane number it is.  Make DS potions affordable to tanks for use regularly.  And so on... Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stinging wort, ds, sow (to the pre axp crowd) and the rejuv potions are the only ones that strike me as remotely useful now.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like to see an updated, resonably cheap to make and level restricted rejuv potion, make it 60+ usuable only, and make it actually regen a lot of hps (Supernal elixir in a bottle if you like) quickly whilst keeping the slow atk speed side effect.<br />
<br />
I always kept a stack of rejuvs on me pre 60, and they saved me and my group a few times when we got into trouble and desperately needed that little extra burst of mana they could provide with Cann.<br />
<br />
How about one that doubles the speed of the canni line whilst its in effect, ie making cann4 164 mana for 296hps.  I for one would sure as hell carry them with me as long as they were not obscenely expensive.  As long as they were not dirt cheap (I really can't see that happening somehow) I couldnt see them being overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've said it 1 million times...<br />
<br />
We need an Illusion: Gnome potion!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Panou Balou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*** five charges, ten charges, time to be able to combine twenty charges...<br />
(combine two 'ten charges' in bearskin potion bag)<br />
<br />
*** to be able to combine in our bearskin potion bag eight potions and one 'ten charges' potions (with only two charges left) for example, to create a new 'ten charges'.<br />
<br />
*** to be able to combine in our bearskin potion bag : two 'five charges' potions to make one 'ten charges'.<br />
<br />
*** like for the baking, effect/stats listed when we check the link of a potion !!! Time to make the things clear for ALL about the potions effects.<br />
 Who can tell me what's the effect of 'potion of adroitness' without checking his listings ? :) so imagine someone not working alchemy...<br />
<br />
<br />
adding: <br />
<br />
for our specific tradeskill we need two bags...please GIANT slots for them at least so we can use them like regular bags when not doing alchemy stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
**** and yes agreed: potions we have are good enough, just really TOO expensives !</div></div><hr />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 Hail,<br />
<br />
1. Lower component costs and/or raise vendor sell-back costs to make skilling-up less cost prohibitive. This has to be the WORST of all tradeskills in terms of cost to raise skill versus utility of the tradeskill. (Yes, smithing &amp; tailoring cost a fortune to raise. So does Tinkering. But they ALL have viable profit making recipes once you've attained high skill. Alchemists get vendor sell Titan's potions at high skill level.  )<br />
Make Gate potions less expensive to create so they aren't a toy of the uber rich, but can be sold at a modest markup to be made available to the common mid40's/50's player.<br />
<br />
2. Allow the level 65 shaman to raise their skill above 200. Heck, change the level based skill restriction formula entirely. My recommendation is to add 50 points to the skill restriction formula, so that you could obtain fifty MORE points based on level than is currently possible. (This would solve the currently impossible goal of reaching 250 in Alchemy.)<br />
<br />
3. Give us some more NEW potions. Make some utility potions for all classes if worried about shaman's already considerable power increasing w/ potion usage. Examples:<br />
<br />
a. An SOE potion (self-explanatory).<br />
b. Create a NEW line of potions. One possible choice:<br />
Transmutation line<br />
<br />
Soandso's Minor Transmutation- Changes all copper coin into Gold coin in a 100:1 ratio. (IE: 1000 copper turns into 10gp.) This should be an INEXPENSIVE recipe to make and help make alchemy less cost intensive to raise skill.<br />
<br />
Soandso's Lesser Transmutation- Changes all silver coin to Platinum pieces in a 100:1 ratio. (IE: 1000 silver pieces turns into 10pp.) This should also be an inexpensive recipe to make and be 20-30 points higher on the skill ladder over the minor version.<br />
<br />
Soandso's Transmutation- Changes all gold coin to platinum in a 10:1 ratio. (IE: 1000gp turns into 100pp). This should be inexpensive to make and be 20-30 points higher than the Lesser version.<br />
<br />
Soandso's Greater Transmutation - Changes 10,000 Platinum pieces (held on cursor) into a 10lb &quot;lead ingot&quot;. This lead ingot would vendor sell for 10,000pp, and would take care of player-player monetary transfers outside of the bazaar zone. The lead ingot would also vendor BUY at 10,000pp, allowing players an easy way to carry bulk cash.<br />
Figure this would be 20-30 points higher on the trivial ladder and still be reasonably priced to create (figure 5-6pp per combine attempt, so a 10 shot potions would sell for ~100pp)<br />
Soandso's Reverse Transmutation - Changes a lead ingot back into platinum pieces. Same trivial &amp; similar cost as Greater Transmutation.<br />
<br />
5. Let tinkers make a &quot;collapsible alchemy bag&quot; for shaman to use instead of carrying that lousy bag around. (The bearskin potion bag is fine as is at 10 slots, &amp; doesn't require collapsibility in my opinion.)<br />
<br />
6. Make MORE potions that are necessary for quest completion in the same vein as the recipe for the PoP all/all gate item quest.<br />
<br />
7. Make a Grandmaster's Alchemist Trophy once the skill-cap problem is fixed.<br />
<br />
Very Respectfully,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good Ideas Frekkels<br />
<br />
To continue on that line of thinking ... why not update Alchemy in a way that it effects some of the more problematic areas in EQ.   <br />
<br />
A.     Taunt potions.    Create a potion that increases effects of taunt.    Some could be class based as well.    Warrior only taunt potions.   SK, Ranger, etc.     Why not even make potions that offer taunt effects for all classes ... for the life of me I don't know why a Gnome Cleric would want to taunt but why not?  <br />
<br />
B.    Illusions potions.    It's been mention on a few threads lately ... but I would propose this with a couple of strings.    First that this potion has negative effects along with the Illusion.   Reason - potions should not impact another classes line of spells.   Could be anything - possible neg ATK or Wis/Int or even a movement effect.<br />
<br />
C.   Faction potions.    Again these could have negative effects on them but many other RP games allow potions to have this effect.<br />
<br />
D.   Focus Potions.    Even if these were very short term and minor they could be useful ... Esp if they were allowed to stack on gear based Focus items.<br />
<br />
E.    Proc effects on gear.    We already have this with the new quests in SS ... so why not allow Shaman's to create Proc Potions for weapons?     Even if they didn't stack on any castable proc's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Great ideas, I especially like the faction potions, tradeskill used potions, and 20 stackable potions :)<br />
<br />
How about a potion to bindpoint?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Along the lines of the taunt ideas, what about a line of potions that would raise and lower your hate? Something along the line of the Enchanter visage line of spells? With PoP, in just about all those zones, an Enchanter seems to be a must have in a group, but many exp zones from older expansions Shaman make quite decent crowd control, so often you have no Enchanter to cast those hate effect spells. A potion that the Wizard that nuked too early could drink instantly and lower his hate would be a life-saver. And this would in no way make Enchanters unnecessary to their groups.<br />
<br />
Illusion potions would put a huge fun element into the game, but I don't really see the logic in adding the negative effects. Again, something like this in no way would make a class redundant and unwanted. When playing my Warrior alt and I'm grouped with a SoW capable class, I'm not going to drink a potion, I'm going to let them cast on me. Potions cost too much money to waste when the effect can be gained from the party, and not all in the party may not be carrying SoW potions. (Of course, I'm still talking about levels 40-50's before getting run aaxp, but us mid levels are still a big part of the game too, don't forget us...LOL). Besides illusion potions, at least to me seem to be something to add fun to the game. Can you imagine illusion froglock and backflipping when casting a spell? :)<br />
<br />
Gate to bindpoint would be a godsend, but I think I rememebr reading on another thread on this subject that the devs will not put that, or player-made inviso potions into the game<br />
<br />
As a community, we are displeased with more stat buff spells. What about a potion that buffed attack value instead of stats?<br />
<br />
Also, a mid-ranged spell that would boost the fizzle check? This was my own mistake, but I didn't cast a divination spell until I got invisibility and ultravision at lvl 29. Nothing like fizzling an entire mana pool to cast ultravision one time. :(<br />
<br />
And to echo the most commonly raised issue with alchemy, make it more economically viable. The quickness, clarity and regen potions are all decent effects, but the cost of producing them makes the price we need to charge just to cover cost, let alone make a profit a joke as far as return on investment goes.<br />
<br />
A stroke of genius above. List the effects of the potion when you open the box describing it. In almost every case the name of the potion gives no clue of it's effect, so people open the bazaar search, actually click potion and see a long list of esoteric names. No one will buy a potion that they have no idea what the effect is. And even with our most popular potions, sit in the Bazaar and watch OOC. Fairly regularly you see the question &quot;What's the name of SoW/shrink potions?&quot; A new customer has no idea what potions can do, and the interesting names they have don't help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tenoq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i really like the transmutation idea; the ability to change tons of copper/silver/gold into platinum in the field is something that i'm sure many people have been wanting since the game came out. alchemy seems like a fitting medium.<br />
<br />
i've always thought one of the key downfalls with shaman potions was the abysmal durations. why the hell would you want to pay cash for an effect (damage shield for example) that you could more than likely ask someone nearby for. it's been my impression that tradeskills were supposed to be designed to where other players would actually want to buy the **** you make. i wouldnt mind the cost of herbs so much if the resulting potions would last as longer. say, &quot;whistle-wetter&quot;-grade duration for damage shield and haste potions and &quot;enduring drink&quot;-length stat potions. i mean, it's not like they're all that hot anyway, but if the amount of cash someone pays for a 10-dose flowing though potion went 3 or 4 times further potions would at least be semi-marketable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zcul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Illusion potions with illusions that could be used in combat - not to fail when you attack someone.<br />
<br />
Duration is controlled by different strengths of the potion<br />
OR by the level of the guy drinking it.<br />
<br />
/Zcul VZ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the transmutation should be a 1 shot, &quot;make all money go to the smallest coin possible&quot;  -- could you really imagine someone buying a 10 shot copper to silver, silver to gold, gold to platinum and paying anything more than a plat per potion?  you'd wase more time than it's worth....  creative idea though.  i like the idea of adding more melee focus potions... maybe even throwing in some tinkering melee focus items to balance it out a tad.</div></div><hr />
