So, as I was driving home it occured to me. . . why not ask for a better spell from Rytan--one that addresses the problem, but helps us in return?<br />
<br />
What happens if they increase the cost to 1000 mana, but make it last 5 minutes.  Only the most insanely geared shaman can cast it 10 times in a row, but it's actually a more efficient spell and less irritiating to keep on the group. . . <br />

Better to keep firing aggressive ideas at him than to let him introduce weaker versions of the spell ,as our &quot;possible&quot; options, and then whittle those down to nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds good to me too.  Now, lets all concentrate really hard and send a subliminal message to Rytan to make him think it's his own idea...or post our support for it on the EQlive boards :)</div></div><hr />

Does it turn it into FA, except with a 5 minute timer instead of 6 minutes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rytan actually came up with this option:<br />
<br />
Another option that's come up is to leave the spell with no recast, single target, and only allow the spell to hit people in your group.  I know your concerns with shrink but I don't think this would create a similar problem as it's a short duration effect and it's simply not practical to be swapping between multiple groups to cast this.  I'm not sure if this is better or worse yet, but it's another option. <br />
<br />
If there must be a change - I like this one. It won't affect grouping at all, and shaman that desperately want to use it on the world in a raid can use the raid functionality to hop from group to group. This change appears to have the smallest potential impact.</div></div><hr />

12 melees doing 100 proc DPS each sum to 1200 DPS.<br />

What nuker does 2400 DPS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What nuker does 2400 DPS?<br />
<br />
According to <br />
Rytan's post (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq...scending&amp;page=2) (at the bottom of this linked page), this should be figured as 600 dps, because of the build-up and decay times.  He's right about that.<br />
<br />
He sees 600 dps as what a good wizard can do, and proposes that this spell should create 300 dps by comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Would still be nice for raids, but then it screws group use.  <br />
<br />
Basically, right now, its balanced in groups (after pet fix).  Its not balanced in raids because it can be spamed on everyone about 2x before you go OOM (at least I do).  <br />
<br />
The main difference is you can't consider this our dps.  Its the raids.  Haste adds how much to a raid's dps?  Thats how we have to think of Panther.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Rytan comparing our 600dps to a Wizard was just crap.  Wizards STACK.  Panther does not.  Panther is a Buff.&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
If his goal is just to allow us to do 300dps.  Why make it so damn complicated?  Give us a new dot, a faster nuke.  Done.  <br />
<br />
I guess we have to ask Rytan:: &quot;what is your goal here?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll take a wild guess.<br />
Goals were:<br />
<br />
1.  Increase shaman burst dps without overpowering solo'ing.<br />
         A) led to... ta da, dps via a buff.<br />
2.  Allow shaman to heal and keep doing other stuff while dps is provided.<br />
         B) means no nukes.  Can't heal while you are nuking.<br />
3.  Make the overall dps gain something around 200-300dps.<br />
<br />
Obviously, this spell was researched in a group setting.  Most shaman, playing casually, don't cast this more than 1-3 times per mob in a fight.  100-300 dps is totally reasonable.<br />
<br />
If his goal is to allow us to provide burst style 300 dps to a raid only... IF, IF thats his goal.. then I say screw it.<br />
<br />
I don't care about adding 300dps to a raid.  That isn't worth my time to maintain, especially if it is in a rotation style buff cycle.  <br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt; I thought this was class reinvisionment?  Whats new about 300dps?  We could add 300 dps via dots for a while now. &lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Letting us increase melee dps by as much as an enchanter does with haste... now, THAT is reinvisioning a class.  <br />
<br />
I can't even remember the last time I hasted a raid.  Our contribution to melee buffs on a raid is pathetic.  Thats why I was excited about Panther.  I assumed SOE though &quot;Hey, you know those Shaman are supposed to be the king of melee buffage... lets boost them up to Enchanter level...&quot;.  Guess not.  <br />
<br />
Me.  I'd rather just make Panther group only, 2500 mana, not group targetable, not mgb'able.  Then at least its not annoying to cast.  One cast, boom.  All melee group gtg.  Removes the need to tweak the spell, and removes the annoyance for shaman.<br />
<br />
FA became Champion because FA was annoying and we bitched.<br />
Panther should transform into Group Panther, because its annoying, it would limit the dps (as Rytan seems to want).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't like the idea of making this a group only spell at all. Will just cause more hassles than it is worth when it comes to raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think that's the point - it would be more of a hassle than its worth to switch groups (so people would be unlikely to do it). Personally, I think it's a bit of a hassle currently  to buff panther out of group, especially with multiple shaman present.<br />
<br />
Pre-determining who is buffing who and trying to find your particular targets in the heat of the fight isn't much fun. 50% of the time, I fall back on buffing just my own group anyway.<br />
<br />
I'd be happy to kick back as the only shaman in a group of 3-5 melee, be responsible for keeping the buff on them and then do some other non panther related things - heal, cure, nuke, re-buff, whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1000 mana for 4400 damage?  Uhm.  No.Well if you are responding to Chutoi's proposal here, it would be 1000 mana for 550/proc x 10procs/min x 5min = 27500 damage --<br />
<br />
-- at 100% efficiency, which you would only get in specialized circumstances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hate to break to Rytan, but 300 dps ain't that hard to come by these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, as it is, most of our shaman get stuck in all melee dps groups, by request.  <br />
<br />
1. Champion.<br />
2. Group version of Panther recast 1min, single target recast 1min.<br />
3. Focus on healing... which seems to be our Primary role. Well, after we get our &quot;new heals&quot; which I don't see anywhere.<br />
<br />
That would be one acceptable setup for me.  <br />
<br />
Here's what my raid groups mainly look like:<br />
<br />
rogue<br />
rogue<br />
monk<br />
monk<br />
monk<br />
Me.  <br />
<br />
With Panther lately, I tell the melee, Hey, FD or something if you get hit.  Panthering the raid &gt; your gimp dps dude :)<br />
<br />
Its kinda true though haha.  2 pets with Panther &gt; monk dps lol.  <br />
<br />
After its nerfed, I'll probably want a monk or two alive:)  Group champion, group panther, then let me get back to my true role::: Healing and Curing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Oh.. oops.  missed the 5minute part.  Wow.  Thats way overpowered hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't see adding a 5 second recast as a nerf really.<br />
<br />
I have never had the time to cast it on more than 5-6 people during a raid level encounter, except at the end of a fight (last 10-15%) where I have cast it on about 12.<br />
<br />
I'd rather leave the spell as it is, but of all the options beign talked about, I myself prefer a recast delay somewhere between 5-10 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Why no have panther address 3 of our top 10 class issues :- DPS, Healing, and Survivabiliy?<br />

Make Panther have a Lifetap componant..........sounds good imho but very unlikely</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">main chore of healing?  i dont mind spoting here and there, but i HATE healing.  i keep a blast heal and HoT memed, but it is far from my primary role.  yes i've healed a few mobs while the cleric meds, or messed around douing named, but for the main part, i ffind a handy cleric and let them do that art in groups.  with panther and champion now days, and canni falling more and more behind, mana is something i have to watch now.  <br />
instead of letting rytan to sell you a nerf, and asking for stuff others can do anyways, why not put a bigger canni (aa canni, quickened canni, crit canni) on that list of stuff we need.  1500 mana for champ, 650 mana per cast of panther, add in random rebuffs (since omens mobs like to annul)....well it adds up and 1k or so mana from canni 5 only helps some.  <br />
<br />
they give us dps once, but took it away by request..</div></div><hr />

Chutoi<br />
<br />
At 1000 mana with a 5 minute duration, raid shaman would be able to cast it considerably more than 10 times before refreshes were due, particularly if they are channeling while they do it. It would actually result in a lot more overall damage from the spell, more than a 200% increase. Far from solving the problem it would make it way worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sorry.  Was thinking 5 minutes as extended by focus items.<br />
<br />
At approx 1k mana a cast, most people would be able to get it on at most 7ish people, and 1 more per minute for a max of 12 people if they stay oom and essentially able to do NOTHING else for about 7 minutes.  It's going to be heavily stacked at the front.  dps might be something like<br />
<br />
700<br />
800<br />
900<br />
1000<br />
1100<br />
600<br />
600<br />
600<br />
600<br />
600<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
With a shaman dedicated to nothing but full time Panther.  Still high, I grant you, but lower than the current version.  Plus, you can reduce duration by a minute and change numbers, or increase mana by 200 more and make it 1200.<br />
<br />
The thing is, you don't have to revert to a heavy-ass nerf batt a la the Rytan model.<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The thing that is against just a straight increase in mana is that SOE main concern seems to be burst dps on raids and with channeling + a healer shaman cannot run out of mana.<br />
<br />
Given that channeling was mentioned by Rytan I'm betting they want to ensure that it can't be used to get around whatever restriction gets put in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, if it's supposed to add 300 dps, set the proc rate at the current pet proc rate and give it a 1 min recast.<br />
Yes, it's no longer (over) powering raid damage, but it's still 300 added dps by the shaman.  Changes the overall popularity of the spell with everyone else, but it's still a decent spell for us (since it leaves us 55 sec out of every minute to do what we've done for the 6 years prior to DoN, just now with aggro free dps running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Why don't you just advocate graying out all our ****ing spell buttons while you are at it.</div></div><hr />

I doubt that that would work since it would probably result in too much agro for whoever it got cast on. You would have to be very carefull in that situation so that you dont mess up peoples agro management.<br />
<br />
Panther is so usefull because you can distribute the hate generated by it. Focussing it all on one person will have a number of effects that might be viewed as problematic. Firstly, it may be too much hate on non-MTs, and secondly, by significantly increasing the MT's hate generation it may allow more leeway for dps/debuffing classes to push the envelope. That may simplify a lot of encounters, which in turn could be viewed as disrupting balance, depending of course on the magnitude of it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You would have to be very carefull in that situation so that you dont mess up peoples agro management.<br />
<br />
Sorry that I assume that everyone who has reached level 69 and enough of a raid experience to beat emoush would have a minimum concept of aggro management.<br />
And since that version would be best cast on the main tank or your pet (which doesn't get aggro if a melee is around) aggro management shouldn't be an issue in the first place.</div></div><hr />
