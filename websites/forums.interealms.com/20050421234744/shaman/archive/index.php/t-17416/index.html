<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mascoma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I am the 29 Pally and my G/F is playing the 29 Shaman(she hasn't quite gotten a hold on the whole Canni-dance thing).  Lately we have been hunting in DSP with others(31Pally 30 cleric and 29 enchanter).  WE are looking for a place we can get to fairly easy and spend time DUOING. I dont mind grouping and like the exp bonus it offers but I am kind of at a loss where these two frogs should hunt from 29 till whenever.  I know that once we get up to 49 we can hunt in OS and Karnors but those levels are still a ways away. Right now I am just looking for a place where we can easily get exp( not a LOT of dying) but I am kinda tapped cause most of my other characters can solo or get a group easily(60 ench,52 necro, 40 monk).<br />
<br />
Also My g/f keeps running out of mana. What should i be focusing on getting here so she has more than a thimblefull of a mana pool?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Get her to learn that canni dance. You could increase her mana pool with wis gear, but mana recovery is more important than mana pool IMO, esp when we have such a great (and free) recovery tool. Also get a Fine Antique Ring (MPII focus), easy quest in PoK.<br />

I two-box a shaman and SK, probably similar to shaman/pally. I think I was in MS or DSP at your level. The SS zonelines in either zone are good pull spots, boring and lousy loot though.</div></div><hr />
