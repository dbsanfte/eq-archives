<br />
Now for prevention I think this is a fine idea but the thing that worries me is the pushing force for trying to make people guilty of something before they ever do anything.<br />
<br />
Here is the article (http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/story.jsp?story=287307) on the subject.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Minority Report&quot; anyone?</div></div><hr />

Then goes over some trash can, table, other semi concealed object and seems to place something in the area.<br />
<br />
Said man tells the cops, &quot;Cripes I just have a huge booger in my nose and needed to get it out right then&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting concept.  I suspect, however, that without some SERIOUS human backup, that this would backfire on anyone using it in the form of lawsuits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-22-2002, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cost for human back up would likely outcost the cost for just humans doing the monitoring.<br />
<br />
The computer is simply not advanced enough to do things such as this at this stage in time.  Perhaps give it another 10 years and some really really good hardware/programs, then perhaps.<br />
<br />
Until a computer can tell 2 human faces apart and tell 2 same faces being the same (with different expressions, etc), it's still worse than humans to recognize patterns with such a high number of variables.</div></div><hr />

It was about around Christmas when I read an article stating that the next generation &quot;lie detectors&quot; could detect human expressions and blood flows in the face when certain emotions or behaviors are exhibited.<br />
<br />
We are not as far off from things like this as you think.<br />
<br />
For something even scarier and again long time ago when I saw the article there are scientist in I believe the UK that are &gt;&lt; close to having a &quot;digestive system&quot; able to take the raw proteins found in meat and convert it into electricity to be usable for machines and computers.<br />
<br />
Couple this with some of the high reflex systems coming from the militart and some bad AI program and we may not be all that far off from a man eating fighting machine... sounds Sci-Fi but things are moving faster than you can imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow, if you can find the article on it, Telumentar, I'd greatly appreciate it. That's quite a bit of a work on the digestive system.<br />
<br />
The thing is, I personally loathe any &quot;prediction&quot; programs, as it is as fallible as the person who wrote it, and that means, it's quite easy to be biased.  Hence it is quite unreliable in the best cases.</div></div><hr />

I watched a very interesting special on TLC about the human face with John Cleese. They have a computer that was able to recognize him in four out of five disguises. The only one the computer missed on was when he was wearing these full goggles that completely obscured the upper half of his face. The computer was more accurate than a trained detective at picking him out of a crowd at a train station.</div></div><hr />
