I found all of the other ones in ock forest newbe zone, but so far after 300 picks off the ground no Shattered orc bone :P  Anyone have an idea?</div></div><hr />

From the dock area, as you leave it you'll see a building on your right you cannot get into. Behind that building you'll see a Erudite Broker. Jump into the water next to that guy and hug the right wall. After you pass under the bridge you'll see a hole in the wall underwater. Go in it and it will bring you into the building where the Black market broker is.<br />
<br />
Black Market brokers sell stuff from Players in the opposing town. Seeing as the Freeport area has an influx of Orcs you should easily find a shattered bone there easily. (I got mine for around 4sp or so I think)</div></div><hr />

Kool thanks, never did know where that was</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol this game keeps getting cooler and cooler.  I would have never found that place.  I wonder if I can pick up a spare kidney there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was able to pick up my Wailing Haze Adept 1 at the fence guy for 27s, where the cheapest in Qeynos was 65s.  Sweet deal =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup! Great place to check for Adepts too. Got a few for my monk for some good prices.<br />
<br />
It seems some Adepts that are uncommon in one city area will be common in the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm still looking for cracked barbarian after 2 weeks of checking regular and blackmarket. Bah!<br />
<br />
The shattered bones weren't a terribly great item, however, the weathered ones makes a very nice necklace and 25% xp at level 23.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sahsha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is there a faction hit on your city faction for using the black market broker?</div></div><hr />

None at all</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd look on Alla's - they have a lot of the quests there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>serp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The quest reward for this was a low level (grey to me when i finished it) necklace if I recall correctly... i sold it to a merchant for some silver.  Also some experience but I don't recall it being worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
I believe http://eq2.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?eq2item=4871 is the item you get.   Maxes at level 14.<br />
<br />
Might be worth it if you finish it low enough to use the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>skwayb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dude are you nuts.  27s for Wailing Haze Adept 1.  It drops like candy in the Commonlands.  I seen it drop like a dozen times.<br />
<br />
Also Alla used to be a good site... but this one blows it away.  Tons more quests on it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">27s is not at all out of line for a Qeynos based Shaman trying to purchase WH.  We cannot safely reach Commonlands, and the places we can reach do not have WH as a drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Constan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The run from Antonica to Commonlands isn't that bad if you know your path through Nektulos already. If you have never been there before I can see that being a rough trip. If you can find a lvl 30 or so to group with you through the run very little if any will be aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Or, spend an hour or so adventuring to build the cash, and spend 27s without all the dangers inherent in being so far from a home city.</div></div><hr />

Aye it was not that good of  a reward but the goal is to get all the bone quests done to get the end reward. I know with the butterfly collections u got rewards for all 3 and then 1 for having all 3 which was a pretty good item. Btw I did get the bone on the black market for like 11S :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The necklaces get better with each tier.<br />
<br />
In order they go<br />
<br />
shattered (level 10)<br />
cracked  (level 20)<br />
weathered (level 30)<br />
unscathed (level 40)<br />
enchanted (level 50)<br />
<br />
Now unscathed cannot be completed. Unscathed orc and gnoll are not dropping for anyone on any server. <br />
<br />
But weathered is very nice, I'm wearing it (click on my sig to see my profile). It's also a nice bit of xp. Also be aware that the level is the level it cons white at. So you can wear the weathered at level 20 - but it will be orange. At level 30 it's white, at level 35 it's green, etc. You can't wear it earlier, but you can bank it and get a nice xp boost when you're little. I have the glowing and shiny shards bracelet in my bank account waiting for me to ding 34 and 44 respectively. <br />
<br />
I'm currently doing the enchanted ones slowly, as I pick them up easily in the enchanted lands. I've got unscathed done to the 2 that don't drop. That should get fixed in The Big Patch. In the meantime, weathered isn't that bad, and it will be awhile until I have Enchanted done.</div></div><hr />
