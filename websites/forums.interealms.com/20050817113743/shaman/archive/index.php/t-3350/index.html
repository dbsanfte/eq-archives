<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Was because people were getting hit and thought it was the wizard, so they turned on him, while the sneaky shaman was still hitting them with AE's before it was too late?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well it is what i am doing too, since a couple of weeks?:p <br />
<br />
grab one wizzy or one mage,(i prefer a mage over a wizzy,because of the pet and they can mod rod/combine whit torpor it's awsome.)<br />
pull 8 to 12 mobs /all slowed and start ae dd, when the mage is OOM ,mobs are nearly dead and pets wacking at them,the mage can mod rod also.<br />
did it many times and worked very fine.<br />
work too whit a wizzy but they regain mana slower.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If Tigirs actually hit more than 4 mobs we would own xp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No, tigirs doesn't need to hit more than four. It's very possible to ae without it. What I do is pull a bunch with Turgur's then just have a bard ae dot. They're better than wizards because 1) they've got no med time 2) cantata is amazing and 3) they don't get their asses kicked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My bad, i meant AE groups. Think of the possibilities if Tigirs was pointblank with no limits on targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've pulled in seb ae groups, shaman works for that although it is not the most likely choice. Backup heals and your ac/resists help, rest doesn't really matter. Usually pull with range aggro or burst of flame. Even if tigir's was point blank it wouldn't add much, if the mobs aren't stunned your group is dead anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Details to follow soon guys.  But we are the KINGS OF AE and not some side show character begging to be let into ae groups!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I can see being a good healer with torpor (if you have quick buff) and able to pull due to the ability to have SoW... also giving everyone extra HPs always helps. Lastly Cannibalize ensures you'll be full mana in no time, and ready to go round up some more meanies while the others finish medding.  I was a pretty good puller of AE in chardok, the group was happy to have me there to spam heal the cleric or chanters if it got close :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We're still a marginal class for AE groups.  And that's being kind.   One cleric, two chanters, and 3 wizards are the best combo.  Wizards pull just fine from my observations.  Runspeed3 made that a reality.  <br />
<br />
Unless you have something to add to this Crashem, kindly stop being a . . . spear . . . tease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Plus wizard epic has a rune effect, which makes them great pullers for AE. Less stuns on the run back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In my observation mana is not an issue. At least in seb one group can tear down pretty much the whole top floor except crypt without much respawns, and you have to wait on the wizzies and chanters to regain mana anyways. So cannibalize is useless.<br />
<br />
Torpor is overrated here, it is a slow heal, and more importantly you obviously can't cast it on pullers, and after the pulling there is no real need for healing.<br />
<br />
Cleric won't want focus for their blessed armor, and the chanters/wizzies probably don't want it either because they fear the spells more than the melee damage. Hence, focus is only nice for yourself, and is useless if you compare it to the many classes that have more hp than you without focus.<br />
<br />
In short, except chloroblast your spells won't really matter, but even the healing should normally be covered by the cleric. Many classes can pull for an ae group, what is more important than your class is the experience you have in pulling in the dungeon in question. I agree with above poster that most groups would prefer 3 wizards. Cept maybe that someone has to loot anyway and wizards will need to med ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siwi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">..is a pretty uncommon AE group.<br />
<br />
Shaman pulls lets say 12 shrooms in FG, each one with turgur's, runs back to the camp and witht he help of the Wiz / Bard / Mag AEs / Rains them to death?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm, i've done that actually. Single turgurs works better than tigir's there, you could pull up to that many shrooms, but that would take a while if you have to slow each one and also you might get cursed and stuck for a bit which will slow down your pulls even more. Let's say you pull 2 patches at once and get about 12-15 shrooms each pull, having casters to ae them down might be fun but will cause you downtime. Considering this downtime in my experience the experience gained by such a group would not be much better than having a couple melee to bash them down while you keep pulling. Also, on the server I played on, you'd be lucky to find 2 whole patches up. Our own Torrent of Poison spell isn't that swell either, remember it will never hit more than 4 targets, meaning if your first wave hits 4 shrooms, it won't hit any more shrooms on the 2nd or 3rd wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Go to FG.  Get your self a melee partner.  Hybrid preferably (ranger is da best).  Buff 'em up, regrowth etc you know the drill.<br />
<br />
Make a tone of DS pots.  Give to melee (if ranger/sk stack em on)<br />
<br />
Shaman pulls with slow. Melee gets aggro, Shaman Epic.   Repeat x 10, torpor as needed.  <br />
<br />
Important thing is each time you get back to camp your partner has to swith to the new mob to gain aggro.  And Shaman needs to keep epic going <br />
<br />
Works with shrooms because their melee is weak, could potentially work with other mobs toos.<br />
<br />
Not a strategy for the faint of heart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jilan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was messing around in Bazaar arena after a wipe yesterday and hit 6 or 7 people with Torrent of Poison.  Maybe he means our rains were changed for PvP?</div></div><hr />

30-40 mobs theres AE<br />

<br />
I'm also pretty sure I remember hearing they put a +20% exp bonus on every kill on all the zeks (though it may have only been sullon, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) which would explain for part of the reason Crash can AA so quickly, I'd estimate an extra hour or so for us blueblies, assuming you can find a zone to do it in</div></div><hr />

Shaman work good in these for keeping the bard alive, torpor does well for it.</div></div><hr />

i am pulling 12 to 14 mobs sometime but i am only grouped whit a mage or a wizzy (only 2 in group).<br />

14 mobs when you are 2..is  like about 42 for a full group (6).</div></div><hr />

I fully expect you guys to have figured this out by the time I'm high enough lvl to do this. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">If I can find a bard and the place to myself sometime I'll try that bard AE thing in FG.  Big if tho.  I've done Bard AE before, works well since they can do over 300 dmg/tic to stuff unlimited targets.  If the stuff is slowed and their singing skill is high it can be pretty strong.  Just gotta chain torpor em.<br />
<br />
Erm . . . wait wait wait . . . idea.  Duel your partner (shaman as well) and pull an assload of slowed mobs, then stand on either side of the mob clump and target each other with poison rains . . . with lots of PR up of course.  Get the target number for AE restriction lifted.  <br />
Maybe, not sure if this works on a blue server.</div></div><hr />

But doesn't the shaman damage shield potion stack with the bard damage shield song and bracer damage shield?<br />

Would chain topor allow a bard to stand in the middle of the pack and tank it while singing DS and AE dmg songs?<br />

If I was him, I'd just drop little hints and watch all the AA xping shamans work themselves into a frenzy.  Nothing like a bit of a mystery to make the time pass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Uhm...   We've basically figured out most, if not all of it already.  Read the thread before you start calling names.   The trick resolves around 2 main things:<br />
<br />
Topor to keep bard alive<br />
<br />
Poison buff bard, target bard on PVP server (might or might not work if you /duel him on blue server) to avoid the max number of targets that AOE can hit and then cast Torrent of Poison.<br />
<br />
Being able to use Topor to keep the bard alive thru the beatings might be the only reason why a Shaman could do the AOE thing when any other class might not.  &lt;shrug&gt;<br />

<br />
<br />
I am trying to work out if this is what he is doing for 2 reasons:<br />
a) He claims we are the Key people, no-one else, and for this method a bard is key as well<br />
b) I would possible class this as an exploit (using /duel to allow ToP to hit more than 4 targets) and he has stated before it is not an exploit<br />
<br />
I may be wrong at that may well be the method used, have been trying to catch Crashem online for days and never seem to cross times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I will add this. The times I have been in FG I have seen a lot of &quot;so and so was victorious in a duel to the death&quot; messages. <br />
<br />
At first I couldn't imagine why people were dueling there. Now maybe it makes sense. <br />
<br />
Also, Jilan said he was able to exceed 4 targets in the arena. PvP. <br />
I think the /duel option is doable on the blues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Anomalos - get your facts straight before you start slamming the guy.  Crashem hasn't hidden a thing.  For quite a while now he's been taking the time to discuss his method at length with people that take the time to log onto TZ and chat with him about it.  The other night he &amp; I had a great talk about his method &amp; it seems very solid &amp; very doable.  I haven't had a chance to try it out yet due to RL &amp; a couple of raids getting in the way, but tomorrow night, I'm rounding up one of our guild's bards &amp; going to try this out for myself.  I'll have to try someplace different than FG though since on Veeshan, it's tough to get a few mobs to yourself let alone the whole zone...</div></div><hr />

You would do good to stop speculating and go talk to him on his server, he's very helpful and spent probably 4 hours discussing and showing me his principles. <br />
<br />
I'm only 58, no torpor yet (/sigh it's in the bank, I need to level faster), and I am even able to use his ideas, although not with anything near his efficiency. <br />
<br />
His ideas work. There is room for improvement, but they are insanely better experience than killing one at a time, although I personally still prefer one at a time just because it is more familiar.</div></div><hr />

Just the fact of Crash posting here, got me thinking of all the spells I have, thinking of different ways to use them again. Some spells I would never consider using got a once over. <br />
<br />

At the moment I can see 1 AAXP in 90 mins, though I haven't got near there yet.  I will need to think a lot about how to get it down to 1 AA per 60 mins.</div></div><hr />

I will add this. The times I have been in FG I have seen a lot of &quot;so and so was victorious in a duel to the death&quot; messages. <br />
<br />
At first I couldn't imagine why people were dueling there. Now maybe it makes sense. <br />
<br />
Also, Jilan said he was able to exceed 4 targets in the arena. PvP. <br />
I think the /duel option is doable on the blues. <br />
<br />
People used to duel alot because AE groups for bandits get so many lore rings they leave one on a corpse untill they can sell the other one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Well, going to be looking for Crashem on his server, or Fulaq on mine. ;)  I have to say, just from quickly looking at our spell lists - I don't see it.  I thought the duel/pvp, hit many npc's with rains was it, but experimenting &amp; posts here indicate no.  Still, was able to get 1 blue in 2 pulls (3 or 4 shrooms), simply with chaincasting Torrent.  (Man, if I could only chaincast that like the lizzies in CT!)  Quite honestly, I can't see how we are the key class to doing this, though, as a wizzie (or druid, mage, etc) could outcast us in the same situation.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Clues so far:<br />
<br />
- Shaman is key/king :)<br />
- Works even at 58 even though torpor/cann IV is recommended<br />
- Its not based on duelling a bard<br />
- It can get you 1 AA point in an hour and a half<br />
<br />
Heh, I dont really know what is going on yet but its fun hearing all the wild guesses.<br />
<br />
Shaman AE spells:<br />
<br />
Tigirs<br />
Torrent of Poison<br />
Gale of Poison<br />
Poison Storm<br />
Infectious Cloud<br />
<br />
Hmmm, these are all limited in number of targets? How can this work? Isnt there something about a max number of mobs that can be attacking one player at a time? Maybe that can be combined with a player that is good at AE aggroing that wont die in a couple of hits (a bard).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I will try to contact you Crashem to get the details, but I have a few ideas (Not sure if they are right or not tho).<br />
<br />
How much would it improve the exp flow by adding a 60 wiz into the group? Some of the ideas I had, I think it would improve exp speed. Maybe I am on the right track, but I could also be wrong. Reason I bring this up is I typically 3-box it with Shaman, wiz, and either warrior or chanter.<br />
<br />
I would also assume this could be done in just about any zone (But some are better suited for this than others).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Not at all sure what Crashem is doing but if adding a wizard makes you able to kill mobs faster you might run out of mobs or something like that and then you wont get more exp out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">ok, I understand why it can not be posted now. Crashem, what are the chances of making a form letter and sending out emails to those Shaman that request the info.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Just thinking outloud here:<br />
<br />
The only thing we can beat a Wizard on (with regards to AE) is our rate of mana regen.  They have to stop and meditate so that is a limiting factor.<br />
<br />
If shaman's are the King of AE it has to be somehow tied to our insane mana regen.  So you need to duo/triple with people who can keep up with your rate of regen.  That leaves out:<br />
Druids, Clerics, Enchanters, Wizards, Magicians.<br />
Necros have Lich, and Lifetaps so they can keep up.  Plus some good plant-only spells.<br />
Bards don't use mana.<br />
All the melee don't really use mana, but do any of them have AE spells/roles?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">But, as has been pointed out, &quot;proper&quot; AE groups need spells that can hit more than 4 targets at a time. Shamans don't have any such spells. So I'm as confused as you are :)<br />
<br />
Even if a wizard can't regen mana like a shaman, the fact remains that they can hit 60 mobs with a 400 mana spell, and we can hit 4 mobs for the same mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I tried the duel thing last night on E marr. (Till the crash bug got me again and I quit in disgust)<br />
<br />
I could not get More than 4 Waves.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is simply a matter of brute force? I regularly will pull 4-5 mobs in the pit camp for my group to dismantle, With me tossing in Torrent and the wizard with a  couple of rain spells We have little problems destroying the pulls but  a level an hour seems like a really rapid pace. (Of course no bard, and a full group means less chances for torrent and division of XP with my group, but they are my friends and xp isnt as important and a good time with friends)<br />
<br />
If you pulled 4 mobs, with slow and had the bard aggro them with AE and a cantana twist and the shaman Torrenting on the bard You could get all 4 with a single rain. With the massive mana and health regen of the bard combined with the regen of a shaman and Canna 5 then you could keep the torrent pace quite well. But that is not really a trick. Just taking the strengths of a class to an extreme coupled with the ease of the mushrooms.<br />
<br />
In a place that was harder it would not be viable.  So no real King of AE there. Just a place that lets us take the tactic to an extreme.<br />
<br />
(Of course it may be different on a red, rules may allow the rains to hit all targets 3 times then that would make us Absolutly deadly)<br />
<br />
Crashem could you send me a private message? With my connection problems at home I am not getting on EQ much at the moment.<br />

&lt;i&gt;<br />
Fastest AA points I have gotten: <br />
About 4-5 Blue in 10-11 minutes or about 1 Hour an AA point. <br />
Know another method of doing around AA point in 2 and half hours. <br />
In any case, I would say you need to get to 60, 60 is the power level for shammies. 59th shaman is like 1/4 to 1/5 of 60th shammie with his spells.&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
From a thread asking about shaman/bard duo:<br />
&lt;i&gt;<br />
I duo with bards and do amazing xp but not if you are playing both . <br />
&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
What is intresting is the post right after crashem's by DanninSZ:<br />
&lt;i&gt;<br />
I play duo with a bard friend of mine trying to level up on Sullon from time to time.. and we make good xp in fungus grove doing an odd sort of 'ae' group.. lol <br />
<br />
I'll pull 6 or 7 shrooms from a patch with turgur and she just AE dots all the mobs I bring in, after im done slowing them all I stick on curse of the spirits and toss a torpor if needed, it seemed like a strange group.. but was an interesting change of pace <br />
&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
Response to Shaman/Wizard thread<br />
&lt;i&gt;<br />
I agree. I have a new technique for xping involving a couple of different duo combos. I am doing xp faster than ANY other method I know of (including uber AE groups) and most if not all powerleveled method. <br />
&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
And lastly:<br />
&lt;i&gt;<br />
A friend and I duo for an AA point/level every 3 hours of hardcore xping. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Ok I’ll bite.  A few quick thoughts on what the general strategy might be.<br />
<br />
Shaman with Cann 5/Torpor has excellent mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
A Bard has excellent mana seiving capabilities.<br />
<br />
A Bard does have a few songs that do use his mana pool. <br />
Notably the dot Denon’s Desperate Dirge. <br />
<br />
Does any of the following Bard mana sieving songs add the mana to the Bards mana  pool, while removing it from the target?  <br />
Composition of Ervaj <br />
Cassindra's Insipid Ditty<br />
 Denon's Dissension <br />
<br />
If they are just mana drains then sorry for wasting your time  but if one of them does give the bard the sieved mana , then maybe the Bard can duel the shaman to use him as a mana battery for  the above mentioned dot, while twisting in a few more dots. Or possibly also twisting slow so that the only thing the Shaman has to do is pull mobs with epic, Torpor/Cann5 and feed mana to Bard.<br />

<br />
Shaman begins by pulling a small train using slows.<br />
Bring train to bards and let bard AEs grab agro.<br />
Grab a few more slowed mobs and bring to bard.<br />
Use Torpor, regens and bard healing to keep bard alive with occasional heals if needed.<br />
<br />
Bard won't need downtime as AE is not mana related.<br />
Shaman can regain mana on run via Canni.<br />
Only 4 slowed mobs can hit bard at once so keeping hps high should be fairly easy on lower hitting mobs.<br />
Just keep a constant stream of mobs for the bard to AE and the xp should come quickly.  In a zone with a good ZEM, and a plethora of mobs nearby to pull, more bards in the group would make this even better.  And for a little extra oomph, get a bard with an AE weapon or 2.<br />
<br />
Am I even close with this one, Crashem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Answer a few things:<br />
<br />
1) Tailen you are on one of the right tracks but think of what would limit your ae group and maybe you would change how you would do things a bit<br />
<br />
2) Boogaba:  Thanks for posting that link.  It is gratifying to see others are recognizing that shamans are the king of ae.<br />
<br />
3) Radag:  To this unbeliever who said if we are the king why not shaman + shaman + shaman.  Har lets see a group of all wizards, all enchanters, all clerics ae.  I think the all shaman group would do best.<br />
<br />
Finally, it is really difficult to explain in a post what exactly we are doing.  I could post specific groups zone etc, but I am not willing to.   I would rather those who came up with them go benefit from them first.  This is a general method not involving any specific classes etc.  Once you can understand the underlying principles behind them, you can go design your own group.<br />
<br />

<br />
It's true his method has nothing to do with the shaman providing the AE component.  With his method, the shaman is the enabling force in the mini-AE group.  Without a shaman to provide the slows and the necessary healing, his method doesn’t work making the shaman the core component.  It will work with a couple of classes, although one class is particularly well suited to be the damage dealer.  Just because it's not what you thought it might be doesn't invalidate his method.<br />
<br />
Remember - kings don't necessarily fight the battles, they lead them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Slaiyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">One of the reasons it can work so well is because you take out the full group and only need 2 people to do this.  I can see where it will work, just need to get the tactics down which I need to talk to Crashem about.<br />
<br />
I messed around with this yesterday, I had a 60 mage and 60 cleric (rl friends) helping me.  Was able to pull around 8 up to 24 mobs at a time to us and AE.  Worked well, problem was just getting enough mobs to pull.<br />
<br />
I added another shaman and bard to the mix just to see how it worked.  Unfortunately the bard was only 56 and I know they get better dot/dd's so if I had one with all of their spells and level 60 it could be nonstop pulling.<br />
<br />
You don't need a bard like Crashem said, it's just the most efficient means with little to no downtime.  I do not have CannV but the shaman that joined to work on the tactic did and they had a very small amount of downtime.<br />
<br />
Near the end of our methods we mass pulled about 30 or so mobs to the group without slow and then AE'd slow and single targetted the rest while the mage/cleric/bard did the Ae'ing and it was insane.  Worked really well.<br />
<br />
Now just to find a better spot with more mobs to pull, if anyone knows any other good spots than Fungus Grove let me know and I'll try today and see how it goes.  I'm thinking in Maiden's Eye the Umbrous Toiler hill would work well, there seems to be a ample supply of them to further test this.<br />
<br />
I do want to get with you Crashem and talk about some things I've tried and your ideas.  It's been fun enough to take a different look at our class and go out and try some things you didn't think was worth the time before.  This has made exp camps by far more interesting and not the boring old root/dot grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">Well I guess then it is simply a brute force approach. Overpowering the mobs with Torpor and Torrent.<br />
<br />
Well done Crashem, but I don't belive this makes us the kings of AE. Pity, I was hoping for a way to increase the effect of torrent in some manner. I like my 720 Crits on Torrent just fine, and Can keep 2 mobs on me for the best damage with torrent Soloing in chardok all day long, but the king of AE I do not feel.<br />
<br />
Not when I have seen a Supernova with a friend who did over 10K with a single spell. Not when I have Pulled 45 mob trains with my thief, and seen the 2 wizard 1 mage 2 enchanter, 1 cleric wrecking ball of distruction, swipe into the side of my pull.<br />
<br />
It is a very Viable tactic though. And can definitly be weighted to a tremendous amount of xp gain. Especially with a Bard and the continous stream of death that the bard can put out.<br />
<br />
Another thing you could consider is a mage for the mod rods and a monster summoning three critter (I belive they have one of the monster archtypes that has a nasty AE spell proc. At least I noticed it in Capt camp in karnors a couple of years ago when the spells were put in.)<br />

VERY well spoken disseration (thank you again Crash) due to his request, however, I am not able to speak to the fundementals and as I promised I'll honor that request but I will empart this.<br />
<br />
The most important thing Crash said last night:<br />
<br />
<br />
THINK about it and it will come to you.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And heck, blow a blue or two figuring it out.  Personally I had to get some raw facts from him because I can't test them (level) but the theory is sound.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm sorry I can't say more guys but Crash asked me not to.</div></div><hr />

Also the fact I know there must be a ****eload of people bugging him all the time atm makes me feel kinda guilty logging on to ask him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">I don't see the point of this.  I've already done two or three person AE groups in FG.  The reason it works is cause the shrooms are very low melee output mobs.  We didn't try more than 8 at once tho.  Was me and two druids.  It worked fine, but wasn't as fast as I'd have liked.  Perhaps more mobs would do the trick.  I had a hard time finding enough though.  I think to optimize this tactic you might need like the whole zone to yourself.  <br />
Thus Crashem's &quot;secrecy&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Thanks but this was a thing I already knew about and couldn't implement cause FG is camped all the time on my server.  <br />
<br />
I think the &quot;tactics&quot; you have to work out are related to aggro management and clumping of mobs together.  You have to have a non caster keep the aggro somehow.  A melee with a big AE weapon or just an AE that procs something really aggrolicious would do the trick.  A bard would also work.  The trick would be to keep the aggro on someone who can take it and who is not you so you can channel off enuf torpors and also the person with aggro needs to be someone other than the main damage dealer (wizard, mage, druid, whatever).  <br />
<br />
Thinking about it some more, I can safely say that I have a new use for wizards.  Wizard and bard and me makes an AE group in FG.  Only problem would be finding those classes at the same time FG is miraculously uncamped.  <br />
<br />
Then again . . if it IS true that only 4 mobs can beat on someone at once, then this tactic might be viable in other places as well.  Outdoor zones perhaps.  Sebilis.  Chardok.  The trick would be to clump the mobs and keep aggro on one person only.  I guess that's a pretty big trick tho.  But a bard might pull it off.  Also there might be a weapon or three out there that can accomplish it.  Sword of skyfire procs an AE unlimited I believe.  I'm unversed in AE proccing weapons tho.  Perhaps there are others that could be useful?  <br />
<br />
I'd also like to mention that the Poison Wind Censer is a great shaman soloing tool.  Just melee and it procs like crazy.  Self buffed with Epuration and stacked with the other group PR buff we get, you won't take much damage from the AE rains.  But you will dish out a lot of AE damage for free.  Pull 4 shrooms and melee to your heart's content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">Bah, one old way of making a shaman be effective in an AE group in FG is the following. Keep in mind the method works in many zones, but the results vary depending on your mana regeneration and how much damage you take from mobs.<br />
<br />
We used to do this with a 4 shaman group, or shaman+bard+cleric (ae boots) +mage (pets+occasional AEs), shaman+bard+monk+monk, and a variety of other group makeups.<br />
<br />
The role of the shaman, if there's only one shaman, is to pull with slows, and do an occasional heal. The limiting factor is of course your mana regen (you need at least 1000 mana per pull if you use turgur (I recommend tirgirs, saves mana), and pulls are between 1-2 min, so work out the details). The faster you regen mana, the faster you can pull, and as a result the more exp you will get.<br />
<br />
It's simple really, basing on the simple fact that a group standing still is a group wasting time, so you want to have your group engaged at all times. The AE method just add a little bit more, why not keep 8-12+ mobs in camp and taking damage, instead of just one?<br />
<br />
Viola, there ya go. The basics of shaman AE, where the shaman's kept busy with searching for pulls while trying to keep his mana up, and trying not to go out of range so mobs you pull won't give exp when they die. <br />
<br />
This works best when you have a mob base of 40-60+ for a 4-6 person group that spawns every ~15 min, which makes FG sort of ideal for it. However, it's a lot of work, since you need to know exactly what to pull next, make sure to never be out of range, and constently keeping an eye out for your mana.<br />
<br />
With less work but a better group, you can get similar exp in CT or even Ssra, and better loot. Also, you won't be restricted by not having enough mobs to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">If all this involves is a shaman mass slowing, holding aggro if needed, and spot healing than it's no different than a &quot;melee AE group.&quot;<br />
<br />
I got 3 AA yellow in a little less than two hours (pretty good) in Velk's TR by pulling the castle and bugs. The group was a monk, 2 rogues, warrior, cleric and me. I used tigirs on the bugs, malo/slow on the gargs/sentinals/destroyers/rares and we had 2-8 mobs engaged constantly. One med break in that time so the monk could shower.<br />
<br />
But, where a melee AE group really shines is in chardok/seb, when u get 4 60 rogues, cleric, shaman and watch assassinate work its magic. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">The key is for shamans to pull with slows, and then LOSE agro asap so the shaman can regen mana in peace and go for more pulls.<br />
<br />
The key for killing 20-30 mobs at once with such an AE group is having one person gain agro and heal that person while the others AE and/or melee them down. Unless you are in a caster heavey group, killing 20-30 mobs isn't really worth your time, since you are bound to have downtime, and it'll screw up your mob spawns. However, it *is* possible. Personally I'd rather kill ~50ish mobs with 4 people over 15 min instead of spending extra effort to try to kill 30 mobs at once every 8 min.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm not sure what Crashem is doing, maybe he figured out something that improves on this basic tactic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things that limit an AE group (that I can think of):<br />
Mana for the AE casters<br />
Ability to take damage and not die<br />
Ability to find, round up, and collect enough mobs<br />
<br />
Ways the shaman can assist in those issues:<br />
- torpor/regen to assist god-rodding the AE casters mana pool<br />
- slow to reduce the damage output of the mobs<br />
- great pulling skills (good ac, hp, pull with slow)<br />
- amazing mana pool/regen (with Canni 5) for all of the above<br />
<br />
Other things that a shaman can uniquely offer to AE groups:<br />
- damage shield potions for whomever is getting hit<br />
- mana regen and mana pool increasing potions<br />
- instant heal potions (if you farm ice giants) for those fragile int casters<br />
- shaman buffs for the group (HP, dex, agi)<br />
<br />
Other non-unique things a shaman can offer:<br />
- AE rain damage spells (only 4 targets, tho)<br />
- AE rain weapon proc (Poison Wind Censer)<br />
- shaman buffs for the group (regen, the rest)<br />
<br />
Ideal duo AE partner would seem to be either mage (god-rodding) or bard (mana-free dots, mana songs).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I could easily be missing something.  All of this put together does not make the shaman a KING of AE by my definition, tho I would certainly agree that shaman are a mostly overlooked valuable contributor to AE groups.<br />
<br />
If I'm missing something that can possibly be shared via text, perhaps Crashem would deign to get off his superiority/secrecy high horse and share.</div></div><hr />

I originally started using this method to gain faction in Droga for the chardok rings and spirit wracked cord.  It got boring fast (never did get the ring)<br />

The number that can hit you at once is 3 actually...4 is the number of mobs that can be hit by our spells at once.<br />
Works the other way around too...only 3 pets can engage a mob at any instant. Have noticed this often in PLing sessions on alts. Differant mobs handle this in differant ways though...some will run off, some stand around and wait thier turn.<br />

<br />
I conned a very very very uber bard I know (Balu from Magister) to come join me for an experiment.<br />
<br />
I buffed the both of us up and summoned a pet. I then explained what I wanted him to do. Cantana, Hit every mob as I pull it in and swap targets often while playing Ae much AE death and Aggro inducing stuff as he can.<br />
<br />
Then I went and fed shrooms to this noisy mushroom quiesanart for close to 2 hours. I had on average 3 mobs around himm at all times. With up to 8 at once a few times. He could keep 5 on him somehow and pet took 3. Most of the time there were only 4 on him however.<br />
<br />
I dropped torrent when mana was available and Spear dotted when I didnt have anything to pull.  He had a nice 58 point Damage sheild going for most of the fights (thanks Damage sheild potion)<br />
<br />
I got 2 yellows in 2 hours. But some of that was waiting for spawns/smoke breaks. If My second box wasnt crapped out and in the shop I could have had my 56th chanter Supplying Clarity 2 and Gravity flux to speed up the process. (Along with the Little pet o Doom.) If I had clarity and Cannabalazation (2 more AA points!!) the process would have been sped up considerably. More mana means more Torrent to help clean the place faster<br />
<br />
Balu however had a complete blast.  I know he wants to do it again. (grins) As he said being a one man AE group is one hell of alot of fun for him. <br />
<br />
In this manner though I am not the king of AE. The bard is. I am the kingmaker. The power behind the throne.<br />
<br />
That suits me just fine. <br />
<br />
Also I had to cast a total of 5 torpors in the 2 hours time. 4 were for me to help with mana regen. Balu needed one heal all night, damn sick ass bard.<br />
<br />
It is not an exploit in this manner. Just taking advantage of the shrooms Pitiful Damage output. But when you have 5 groups fighting over shrooms you will not make much xp because you can't keep the chum rate going.<br />

<br />
At 60, I was able to solo pull shrooms from their camps - so I'd slap on Turgurs and let them beat on me while I gathered more.  First pull I grabbed about 4.  Wizzie ended about 2 nukes shy of killing them, so I was having to add Torrent/JBB to finish them.  Then we added a mage.  Between the two of them, they could easily kill whatever I pulled, so I went to town.  My best pull was 15 shrooms, but I was almost completely oom, from Turgurs.

Downtime was mana regen for them, and spawns; a couple of times I had to delay pulls for them to med up, even with C3.  With the caster AE grabbing everything they could, and a handfull of others soloing, I was grabbing all I could, as I could.  Ended up with slightly less than one yellow an hour.

I jumped on yesterday morning, and two guild wizzies were on.  One was in a pickup AE group in FG, so I asked the other if he wanted to come up for some xp.  When I told him to load his ae spells, his comment was along the lines of &quot;Oh well, rez effects wear off&quot;...  he fully expected us to have to zone. :)<br />
<br />
At 60, I was able to solo pull shrooms from their camps - so I'd slap on Turgurs and let them beat on me while I gathered more.  First pull I grabbed about 4.  Wizzie ended about 2 nukes shy of killing them, so I was having to add Torrent/JBB to finish them.  Then we added a mage.  Between the two of them, they could easily kill whatever I pulled, so I went to town.  My best pull was 15 shrooms, but I was almost completely oom, from Turgurs.  Both casters were barely getting hit, at worst losing 1/4 hp during the fight.<br />

<br />
The pull slowed mobs and have casters AE is certainly viable, but you're not going to hit a yellow every twenty minutes.  Full-fledged AoE groups hit two yellow an hour if they're good.  For that reason, I assume it's something different.</div></div><hr />

Heh, what might that be?<br />
<br />
If you're talking about canni, I was using it - but having 15 shrooms (even slowed) beating on you, is not conducive to casting or health.  On that one pull, I had to canni once to get a Torpor off on myself - and I was already about 40% hp, from pulling.  At that point, I was more concerned about getting mana to heal the casters, if they needed it, than to keep pulling.</div></div><hr />

But Balu took a good 5 minute Smoke break. There were several times that we just didnt have anything to pull.<br />
<br />
And I was only tossing about 1 torrent per pull. With no clarity, and I dont have Cannabalazation yet.<br />
<br />
We were not really pushing the envelope. I know this. But when like I said you have 45-50 people in Fungus you just don't have enough critters.<br />
<br />
And yes I was Canna'ing like a mad bear.<br />
<br />
there are ways to definitly increase the chum rate. An AE proccing weapon for me for when I can get in and meele.  A mage and his Monster summoning pet that AE procs. Plus the PBAE and God rods.<br />
<br />
The limiting factor isnt the damage it is the number of critters. Please remember I cast torpor on Balu once. We were not pushing our ability at all.<br />
<br />
And that was with 4-8 mobs in camp all the time (Except for smoke breaks and or Lack of Critters<br />

Nerun, I was oom from slowing 15 mobs - pulled right after another, with the slowed ones beating one me, to bring them en masse back to the casters.  As in, target shroom, cast slow (recast if resist), target next shroom, slow, target next shroom, slow, after 6, move to next pod, gather more same method, move to next, gather more.  All the time I'm gathering, the slowed ones are beating on me.  Once I have enough (or can't find anymore), take them back to the wizzie &amp; mage to ae.<br />
<br />
Yes, I could have dropped torpor, and spent a few minute's using canni to get mana back (as I have since I got the spell, as I continue to use it even when FM - I can't &quot;forget&quot; to use it... it's a habit. :( )  However, there were others in the zone, so I was reaching my limit on mobs; there is also the time factor - I didn't want to risk any wearing off mid fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">Let me also say that's 1 AA yellow an hour with reasonable mana conversation plans in effect, IE I can maintain that pace without stop ad infinitum.</div></div><hr />

might as well add FG, ME, Seb to rating. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>ruca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">Let me throw out an idea here.  This relies on the principle that only 3 mobs can engage a PC at one time.<br />
<br />
With a bard and a shaman, than means that no matter how many mobs you have pulled, you will only have 6 attacking you at any given time.<br />
<br />
If the shaman pulls with Turgurs, you have effectively turned a maximum number of 6 mobs (3 on shaman, 3 on bard) into 2 mobs in terms of dmg output.<br />
<br />
So, you have the shaman pull 3 to the bard.  The bard acquires agro on those 3.<br />
<br />
The shaman then pulls more mobs to within the AE range of the bard.  The bard is singing AE songs and AE snare song.  Once the new mobs acquire agro on the bard, they will not move toward him, they will attempt to walk home.  However, the AE snare song effectively turns walking into immobilization.<br />
<br />
This solution appears to scale really well because added mobs do not do any damage.<br />
<br />
Key here is positioning.  A small room would be ideal for making sure all mobs stayed within AE range, but I could see this being done in an outdoor zone, with some practice.<br />
<br />
Also interesting would be the addition of a monk to the group.  He could add a steady stream of mobs to the room while his ability to FD would keep the max number of attacking mobs at 6.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts, plan on testing these out this weekend.<br />
<br />
Hugs!<br />

<br />
The snare!<br />
<br />
/Cackle<br />
<br />
Okay this just got alot more viable for a two man group..<br />
<br />
The max number of mobs on a normal person are 4 I belive. 3 normal and one that is kinda sorta able to hit every now and again. (It is odd) the rest Mill about (Kinda in a drunken manner) but will not come towards the aggro person as long as they do not move.  If they move the server will set up chase. (How you get trains...101)<br />
<br />
By snaring the mobs go below thier walking/milling movement rate and stand still. And can be hit with the AE... Hmmm.<br />
<br />
Okay More testing is needed. I wonder if I can talk Balu into a pit fight in Chardok. Or Howling stones.... I think he could take the beating (Laughs)<br />
<br />
Thanks Ruca, you reminded me that snare will still effect the milling about movement.<br />

I haven't had a chance to grab and use a mage or bard yet, to try my hand at this.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">Well, it looks like some people are using the theories to some good effects which I am glad to hear.  I am still compiling a FAQ on this.  Haven't decided where and how I should host this.  Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Just some points in the meantime:<br />
<br />
1) SLOW AE is the name I have given this technique.<br />
<br />
2) This technique can work in most zones with the right group combo but it doesn't mean that it will be more effective than regular xp in the same zone let alone a different different group combo and zone using regular xp techniques.  If you do the math, you will start to realize some of the zones where this techique is likely to work well.  In any case, my technique has made shamans more flexible.  I guarantee you that before this technique if you were grouped with a wizard/mage, you were just DDin down mobs while looking for a ranger/rogue/whatever to group with.<br />
<br />
3) People have started to use this technique in JUST the zones I have suggested or others have mentioned.  Obviously this is going to cause an overcrowding (if it didn't exist before) in those zones, don't be scared to experiment.  The great thing about this xp method is that it is so flexible.  While certain classes (shaman being the most important) might be more useful, there are ways to make every class useful as long as you keep the basic principles in mind.  After you practice this xp method a bit more and think about it, you will realize you have certain limitations.  The best way to approach this is to think about the limitation you are primarily bumping against and see if you can exceed this limit in some way.  Then do the same with the next, etc.<br />
<br />
4) SLOW AE vs STUN AE:  SLOW AE does not always match up well against STUN AE (ie enchanters).  They both have their advantages and disadvantages and best zones to do it in.  I think SLOW AE matches up well though as I can in my best zones/group combos match or exceed STUN AE group best zones/group combos' xp rate.  For one, I think STUN AE is somewhat limited as the groups are so hard to get together and the zones that can be used are so limited.<br />
<br />
5) Experiment tinker think:  People haven't even mentioned some of the combos zones I have come up with you.  I would like this thread turn into more specific questions and advice etc.<br />
<br />
6) Hey, still looking for the experiences of some of the people I taught this technique too.  This trollie is in uber raid guild so my experimentation time is limited.</div></div><hr />

I tried AEing in a group of 3, two shaman and a bard.  I could manage at least 10 shrooms if I could find them, people on eci at least camp a patch of shrooms, and sit on their butts waiting for more to spawn(silly, I know).

Using this technique you could conceivably kill everything in one AE pull, and then you're left sitting for 20 or 30 mins waiting on repops to begin.
