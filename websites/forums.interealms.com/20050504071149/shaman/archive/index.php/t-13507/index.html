<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just discovered two (the other one is about the new buff box) threads in the developer's corner that I thought y'all might be interested in.   This one is about the slow mitigation:<br />
<br />

<br />
NPC Slow Mitigation<br />
Generally speaking we don't announce new NPC functionality, tricks, spell effects or other things that we think are part of the discovery of a new expansion or zone. However, this functionality isn't working properly right now and in doing so it is causing a bit of confusion. <br />
<br />
With Planes of Power we gave NPCs the ability to mitigate the effect of slow-type spells. This means that some NPCs have the ability to cause slows to be less than 100% effective. This is not a &quot;slow cap&quot;, when it is working properly. The best slow will have the best effect. <br />
<br />
This allows our designers much more freedom to balance encounters when considering the use of slow spells. For Planes of Power they did not have to decide solely between the two extremes of slow taking full effect or just turning it off. The relative power of each slow spell is unchanged, and making NPCs immune to slow spells is not the only option when tuning an encounter. There are some encounters where we would like to see slowing considered a good thing for a group to have, but not to the point where the NPC becomes a wimp after he's slowed. <br />
<br />
In theory this is a great thing. <br />
<br />
However, some time between beta and the release of Planes of Power this new feature stopped working properly. Thanks to everyone that sent in emails and /bug reports for helping us narrow down the problem. <br />
<br />
We are aware of the problem and we're working on getting it fixed. <br />

The date on the message says 5/09/2003, which was three days ago.  Maybe it was fixed awhile ago, and they are just now officialy admitting it?</div></div><hr />

I find it humorous that they dont want their mobs turned into wimps after a slow but have no concern or care that they make a whole class basically wimps when they CANT slow.  <br />
<br />
If that is how they want to balance their encounters they can.  Its their game and they can tool it how they want,  The one thing that I would ask is that they stop balancing our other spells of of slow then.  It was my understanding that they gave us &quot;wimp&quot; heals because of our slow power.  Ok...where is my heal compensation now that the slow isnt as effective?<br />
<br />
I also have a problem with Sony balancing our mana compumtion based of of our ability to canni to gain mana back.  Chanters generally have a larger static mana pool that shaman (more int as oposed to our wis) and have great passsive mana regen spells (best in the game) but their mana costs arent as high....<br />
<br />
/bleh...now Im whining..sorry bout that...</div></div><hr />

 Don't apologize, you're absolutely right - you couldn't be more right. I hate whine police/soe fanboys. It's not whining when you mention a legitimate grievance.<br />

 Uhh.. could they be any more vague?  Tell me what is not working properly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, the message does say that &quot;The relative power of each slow spell is unchanged&quot;... i.e. shamans are going to be able to slow it more than other classes. So we will still be desired for slowing.<br />
<br />
I understand the frustration in seeing our main power limited in some encounters, but not every class is going to be optimal for every encounter. There are AE mobs that you have to fight at long range, how do the rogues feel about that? There are 32k hp mobs that have to be nuked flat quickly, how do the warriors feel about that? I'm not trying to be a jerk, my point is just that in different encounters, different classes will be of different levels of importance.</div></div><hr />

What is says is that SOE designed it that way, but since POP release it hasn't worked<br />
<br />
This is funny to me because I seem to remember SOE saying that it was working as intended.  SO which is it?  Is it working or is it busted?<br />
<br />
Seems to me, as I read it, this is telling us that it is busted.<br />
<br />

<br />
Not as Ive seen it.  Ive seen Turgurs overwritten by Ranger epic slows.  Ive seen Beastlord slows overwrite shaman slows.  I wasnt the shaman, I'll admit that.  I was playing cleric beside the guy that was playing shaman and I can tell you he said things about getting overwritten that would make sailors blush and cry to momma.<br />
<br />
Alan told us its broken.  What he hasn't told us is when it is going to be fixed (as fixed as slow mitigation can be).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thorzion , I agree with you. I think it is broken. I think currently it is a &quot;hard cap&quot;. I.e. Mob X can be slowed 50% - regardless of who is doing the slowing. If that is the case, then shamans, enchanters, bards, rangers, beastlords can all slow about equally well. Since that _appears_ to be the case, then we shamans do have a valid complaint. <br />
<br />
When/if it works the way they said it would (&quot;The relative power of each slow spell is unchanged&quot;), then we are still the best slower and we don't have a complaint.<br />
<br />
In sum, yes, as things are now, we are without our defining ability on mitigated mobs. I think the current problem is primarily caused by a bug (that we should indeed gripe about), but not a fundamental, theoretical nerfing of our class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Im surprised shaman don't seem to care about this.. I guess after all the nerfs, having your primary ability trashed is just ho-hum. To be antagonistic, I'm going to speculate that Sony are nerfs us slow on purpose!!1</div></div><hr />
