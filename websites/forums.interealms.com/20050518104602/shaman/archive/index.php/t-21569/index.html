<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Good day to the fellow community:)<br />
<br />
Ever since I had to reinstall my system, a weird 0.5 sec Lag occurs when trying to cast a spell/mem a spell/ open a backpack or open a menu. Chatting and Moving is absolutely lag free.<br />
<br />
It just looks like the system is freezing for a very short time, then it continues.<br />
<br />
Anyone has ANY clue what might have caused this? I heard from several ppl in the guild who had this same problem, no idea whatsoever:p<br />
<br />
System: win 2k Pro<br />
Athlon XP 2800, Gforce FX 5600 256 mb<br />
512 meg 400 mhz ram<br />
bought a new d-LInk firewall (hardware) and have G -data Intivirus installed. Updated all newest motherboard, grafic and soundboard drivers.<br />
Motherboard is Asus deluxe A7N8x-Deluxe btw..<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From my experiences, this is sometime caused by your anti virus software running in your background...most of them are set up to auto check anytime an application wants to access a folder...so when you command your comp to open a back pack and switch out your SOW booties for some beer, for example, and you get lag, its cause your antivirus is checking to see if EQ really has busisness accessing your EQ file folder....thus a touch of lag.<br />
Either turn off your anti virus program while playing EQ or change some of the programming settings in it by telling it to not bother checking EQ's access; this is usually done by simply adding its folder to a &quot;safe&quot;list.<br />
If that doesnt work...meh I am at a loss :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am having a similar problem - only different. :) <br />
<br />
I'll get a 1-2 second lag hit in LDON when the MOBs spam their aggro message.  This is the only time it happens, but it can be deadly as 2-3 beating on me uunslowed is quite painful.<br />
<br />
Doesn't happen when I talk to NPC's outside LDON (that I can tell), questing, etc.  <br />
<br />
AV software is disabled when I play EQ so that is out. Defrag and Scandisck my HDD almost daily.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />

Faern, you need to turn off your journal log.  There was a thread about it here (http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=9506&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=1)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>claver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also make sure your firewall is off, I hated having to do it but I went around for weeks wondering what was causing this to me. Once I turned off my Firewall it went away.<br />
<br />
I tried doing it with just the AV off and the FW on and reversed it. It only went away for me with the AV and the FW off at the same time.</div></div><hr />

Urm... that's not something I would do with all those virus/trojans going around nowadays.<br />
<br />
I had that problem with Norton's personal firewall and antivirus bundle.  It seemed to slow down the system dramatically, so I removed it and replaced it with ZoneAlarm for a firewall.  I run my AV periodically when I'm not on EQ.<br />
<br />
Turning off logging might work too.  I found my log to be over 100MBs in size.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How do you deal with ZoneAlarm and EQ patching?  Every time EQ patches, ZA thinks it's a new program and puts up a dialog... right in the middle of the time that EQ wants to &quot;own&quot; the screen... the only workaround I could come up with is to run EQ in a window, and I can't live with that, so I killed ZoneAlarm.<br />
<br />
I'm behind a hardware firewall, so I'm not that worried, but it was annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you, Thank you, THANK YOU HELFDANE!<br />
<br />
Your tip worked, I am without any lag again. Thanks so much brother shaman, I'd owe ya a beer:)<br />
<br />
Added all the game folders (EQ Farcry etc) and see, No lag at all anymore.. For all you who have the same problem.. take Helfdane's advice..<br />
<br />
See you all  :cool: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>claver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually I have a firewall on my router which doesn't slow me down at all. Its the firewall that came with my PC's softeware bundle that caused it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ZoneAlarm is alittle annoying.  After patch, ZoneAlarm will pop a window to verify if the EQ executable has changed.  At this time, I just use the task manager to kill EQ, click OK for ZA and then re-run EQ with no issues.<br />

Everfrost is plaqued with this 0.5 second lag.  Its good that the ldon dungeons in Everfrost are not.</div></div><hr />

there is no going back to eq for me, besides boot camp starts in 2 months =)</div></div><hr />

Weissblau, you can tell Zone Alarm that EQ changes frequently, and then it will not ask you to check the box again.<br />
<br />
Right click on the zone alarm icon in the task bar.<br />
select &quot;restore zone alram pro control center&quot;<br />
select the program controll tab<br />
scroll the list until you find EQGAME.EXE (I'm at work so I cant be sure but I think I'm right)<br />
right click it and select the &quot;changes frequently&quot; option<br />
<br />
Then so long as you give EQ access at least once it wont ask you after each patch. <br />
<br />
I also do the same for the patcher files. Again I can't remember what they are called but I think it's _everquest.exe or something.<br />
<br />
Zone alram is a great little firewall for gaming it blocks most crap, but is simple enough to get working with games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That only works in Zone Alarm Pro, not the normal (free) version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ack, sorry about that.<br />
<br />
I guess I did actually get some benefit from buying the software then :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually, the problem I had was the only thing keeping me from buying the Pro version.  I believe in paying for the registered versions of software that I use regularly, keeps 'em in business.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it's not a good month to spend the $$$ so I'll have to wait until July.</div></div><hr />
