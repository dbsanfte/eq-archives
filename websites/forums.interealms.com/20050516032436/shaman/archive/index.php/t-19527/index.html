Well, that's certainly no way to do business.  There is a right way and a wrong way to be humorous with your customer.  To act as if they don't exist is NOT a good way.  I'm not very impressed with him at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To do that job you have to have a sence of humor or it would drive you insane. Listening to everyone who thinks thier ideas and suggestions absolutly must be put into the game or they will quit. And if you're not one of those, you're one of the people who make snide comments and remarks about everything from the company he works for, to what type of tie the guy is wearing.<br />
<br />
Get over yourselves(this is directed at those who think the world is ending because of this).<br />
<br />
I am certain hes aware of the well thought out suggestions that we as the shaman community are supporting. If/when its neccisary I'm sure he'll post or say something. Untill then, insulting him is not a very productive course of action, is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He was definetly joking.  He's really a nice guy once you get a chance to talk with him and not just read his posts.<br />
<br />
And yes, he's addressed the rangers on The Glade if I'm not mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Im sure his remark was made in jest. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Was irony. Sarkasm is used to be evil towards someone and put him down in a funny way. Irony is the right word. And Brenlo is already aware of Shamans and every other class. I think we should relax a bit. Its a game after all  :cool: peace besides speaking about a specific class there was way out of topic. Its like going to a medical conference and start speaking officially infront of everyone about buildings and engineering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if there is one thing anyone should know about communicating on the internet it is that things like irony and sarcasm are much more difficult to pull of successfully than in real life. There is a very high probability that people will misunderstand you.<br />
<br />
Yes, EQ is a game. But for Brenlo its also a job and it seems rather unprofessional that the first official comment we get from him after the heated debates here is something like that. Until he follows it up with some concrete facts that illustrates that he actually does know what a shaman is I am not impressed. He doesnt have to agree with me he just has to prove that he knows what he is talking about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My guess is the guy knows that there is a big problem with Shaman and he as not gotten much feedback from his colleagues at SoE on what can be done about it.  He probably feels pretty helpless and is trying to stall with a bit of humor.<br />

To me it was the same thing as a nervous laugh.</div></div><hr />

um ... he could be a starwars geek and only play SWG ... because its SoE game, wich would explain why he is so clueless about EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;Brenlo&gt; What's a Ranger?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm absolutely not happy with SoE about the actual &quot;vision&quot; of the shaman.<br />
Healing, DD, Pet miss-a-ton, Dots, what you want who was clearly explained by Chutoi...<br />
<br />
But this answer from Brenlo made me chuckle :p.<br />
<br />
Come on guys... with all the ... ahem ... cries we made about our balance, if Brenlo don't know what's a shaman so we have a winner for the Darwin's Awards :D.<br />
<br />
A stupid shaman noob is more able to upset me A LOT (hey, I never talked about Turtlenoob) with his comments than Brenlo and his sense of humor ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I happen to be responsible for complains handling in my RL job.<br />
No matter how idiot the statement made by our customer may be I always have to reply to them.<br />
The reply can be simple or it can be complex but a reply has to be made.<br />
<br />
Now if a customer writes to me that he is upset that he has to install the OS to the new computer he just got (yes we sell computers) and that he thinks we should pre-install it, I can tell him why we don't do that at this moment, I can tell him he has a good point and we will look into it or I can tell him we take his suggestion under advicement.<br />
<br />
BUT I am sure that if I reply &quot;What is a computer&quot; I find myself unemployed within the next few minutes.<br />
<br />
I think Brenlo needs to be reminded that he is the PR guy for SoE and that like it or not we are also customers he should care about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">BUT I am sure that if I reply &quot;What is a computer&quot; I find myself unemployed within the next few minutes. <br />
Amen.<br />
<br />
I enjoy a good joke.  Humour is the presure valve of the office monkey (I'm an office monkey as well).  That said, being a PR guy, a guy who has objectives set on communicating corporate information to the customers who pay for the seat he parks his butt in, he should have the common sense to be sensitive to the community he suppossedly has his finger on the pulse of.  His job is to be a laison, but both he and his two most recent predesessors have shown no knowledge of what the community wants or is like.<br />
<br />
One reason I like WoW is the community liason type person posts bi-weekly updates (more during eventfull weeks) and seems to have a clue about the game and what the players want.  She tells people that she will forward some ideas and shoots down others, but she never says &quot;what is a shaman&quot;.  I hope I get accepted for beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Plain and simple anyone that took that seriously and got up in arms about it is a moron.  <br />
<br />
Have you folks read anything else he's posted?  He says stuff like that a lot and to be honest if I were him I'd be more of a jag off.  There have been so many jag shaman lately that it's giving us a bad name.  There are issues that need to be addressed and some are being proactive towards getting those fixed.  Others are just a bunch of sissies threatening to hold their breath till they get what they want.<br />
<br />
Personnally if I were him I'd have responded differently:<br />
Moron_001 &quot;Gorgos when are you coming to the Sham Cruci?&quot;<br />
Gorgos &quot;After&quot;<br />
Moron_001 &quot;After what?&quot;<br />
Gorgos &quot;After after&quot;<br />
<br />
If you recognize this you should be as embarrassed as I am for using it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Gorgos, <br />
<br />
What you're failing to realize is that even though we play a &quot;game&quot; it's still a business.  And part of being in a business is to act professional regardless of the situation.  Remarks like that have NO business coming out of the mouth of the PR rep to their customers.  Period.  For shaman or any other class for that matter. <br />
<br />
He clearly has no clue what it means to be a PR rep or professional and it shows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">So, he makes one comment and he doesn't know how to do his job?<br />
<br />
Big assumption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Gorgos, <br />
<br />
When you are working as the public face for a compagny and people complain to you, you have to stay polite and answer them.<br />
That is something else then that you have to agree with them.<br />
<br />
I would actually be happy IF a dev decided to post here why they do not make changes to our class and that dev can support his claims with facts.<br />
I would also be happy if no dev ever posts here but we get a general statement from brenlo on the SoE board stating SoE will look into the shaman issue and we see results a few weeks later.<br />
And I would even be happy if no reaction at all was made but they would just give us the bone we have been asking for.<br />
<br />
But atm the only reaction we got from SoE is Brenlo making fun of us, both on the newby Zone and in the chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">So, he makes one comment and he doesn't know how to do his job?<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
And your assumption is that my comment(s) were based off one comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I think we need more made up conversations, then they will come. Nothing wins an argument more than a conversation that is posted as a log but has noob_001 or idiotic_buttocked_cleric_002 as the name. I much prefer to read these conversations than look at screenshots because I find them to be so incredibly accurate.<br />
<br />
I say forget Brenlo and the issues and just post made up conversations! If we just up the percentage of posts with such conversations in them by about 10 percent (to ~85%) I am sure Brenlo and his group will come running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I smell sig material!  Right up there with &quot;Classes are not all that out of balance&quot; and &quot;Looks like an emulator to me&quot;!<br />
<br />
Edit: I agree his response is unprofessional.  When you represent your company (yes, I have done it, for 10 years), you shouldn't act flippant about the concerns of your paying customers.  Very bad form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">It's all about professionalism.<br />
<br />
Like it or not, Brenlo is a paid representative of a major corporation. His job is to interact with us, their customer base. Certainly, EQ is just a game, but it's a game we pay for. We deserve better customer service than a flip reply.<br />
<br />
Brenlo was offered a polite invitation to stop by the shaman boards. He could have responded any number of ways. He could have simply ignored the invitation, or he could have graciously accepted (or declined) it. I think he made a poor choice in the way he answered. It's hardly the end of the world, but SOE needs to work on customer service and this seems like a good place to start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I agree with the folks saying that this is his job and should handle questions like this more professionally.<br />
<br />
To the folks who are saying 'Lighten up, it's just a joke' my response is, I find humor in most anything but this isn't funny. If Brenlo had at anytime addressed our concerns by saying anything more than 'we're taking a look at this', then I could accept and see humor in this comment.<br />
<br />
The fact is that he hasn't even, to my knowledge, acknowledged that our community took the time and effort to identify some of our disatisfactions. Ignoring us is one thing but making a joke on top of it is insulting. I'm of the opinion that this guy is a jack***.<br />
<br />
At the very least he could say that he thinks that we are fine and that there will be no changes to address our issues. At least then we'd know.<br />
<br />
UMP!</div></div><hr />

Come on, if sony doesn't care, why should you. And if you do care, stop paying them. Its perty simple. I dont see anything rude about his comment. Did you see anything after that? Maybe it was out of context? Who knows, you guys didn't. You guys sound like the same people who post on /. without reading the articles. His job is not to come wipe your bottom, and think you guys need to remember that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Making light of your customers concerns is a hundred times worse than ignoring them.

Granted, SOE/Verant has had the most god aweful public relations I have ever witnessed, but at least they haven't killed anyone with their product, though some have killed themselves with it thats a different story.  <br />

I myself tend to use sarcasm quite a lot guess that says it all about me :)<br />
BUT<br />
I know when and when not to use sarcasm which seems to escape Brenlo.<br />
1. This man is the CUSTOMER RELATIONS man for EQ.<br />
2. If he doesnt know that Shaman class has a percieved problem then he is 10 times worse than i originally thought so.<br />

I dont WANT a new dd..(Although it would be nice)<br />
I dont WANT a HoT group spell...(Although it would be nice)<br />

If he said either of these things we would still be having a conversation about how much he sucks at his job. Face it people who play EQ do not like anything. Period. <br />

If he said &quot;Yes we are aware there is a problem with Shaman and we're looking into ways to improve the class&quot; we would all cry out. Thats just sony blowing smoke up my big troll butt. If he said we were fine, we would all cry out he is blind.

Yes, there are &quot;some&quot; things a video game company does differently, but in the end both are required to do one thing, treat the customer with a certain level of respect.  And it doesn't matter if your target audience is 12-years old or 100-years old.<br />

Got my Beastlord up to 19 last night.  One good thing about the Shaman I made, he's great for powerleveling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If others havent checked their gear, Berz get the same LDoN armor as us and have been grouped as &quot;A pure DPS class&quot;.  And from folks that have posted making &quot;suggestions&quot; from Beta (still under the NDA) they say they arent considered tanks at all.  I have a bad feeling SOE is going to butcher the class and make it way way too powerful... one more reason why Rogues are going to flip :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, that's funny, I have to admit... It's also unprofessional and inappropriate.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a Brenlo?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's funnier, and entirely appropriate!</div></div><hr />
