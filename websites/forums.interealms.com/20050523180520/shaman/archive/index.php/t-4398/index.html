<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Starting to get into focus items, and I really like the idea of extended affliction.  Even if they nerf it back to dots, it would work wonders with bane.  However, not many items to choose from.  Bone Clasped girdle too expensive for my taste, and other stuff nodrop I realistically won't see in a while.  <br />
<br />
This wristguard seems doable though.  Was reading Allakhazam's, but the quest seems rather confusing, and I was wondering if anyone could help break it down in easy steps.  <br />
<br />
For example, the way my faction is, don't think I can ever manage getting to dubious with both dwarves and giants.  Or do I have to do the quest in parts and alternate between factions during the progression of the quest?  (god that would suck :( )<br />
<br />
It also says that you could alternately create a troll mule worshipping rallos zek so he'll start out non-kos to both dwarves and giants.  Now how does this work since most of the stuff needed in quest is nodrop?  Do I have to ask a friend to create a mule, tag along and loot the stuff I kill to continue quest by himself, and then basically loot the dwarf at the end?<br />
<br />
Another question, I promise it's the last :)  Is this quest soloable?  (well me + mule)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">check out the quest forum, detailed there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rustyspear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was a good post on this on the necro boards but i'll try to lay down all the info to do this.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, most people are kos to giants so, u'll need to make a warrior that worships rallo zek.  I personally did this with a troll warrior and had no problems running around in kael to get the MQ done.  To make this even more effecient, it helps to have a friend that can cast lev, invis, and sow.  The invis part is a requirement that will be discussed later<br />
<br />
First requirement, mule that worships rallo zek and gets ported to velious.  <br />
<br />
Go to crystal cavern with both your main and your mule.  Park the mule somewhere safe and lay waste to orcs until the bottle of acid drops.  I believe its called korsic acid or something like that.  Log in the mule and loot the bottle.  An alternative to this is to kill the queen and loot the sceptre she drops.  Either way, u'll probably want to invis and lev down to the coldain city and pull orcs to there until a bottle drops.<br />
<br />
Once u have the bottle or spectre, run to thurg, and find the npc that is mentioned in other walk throughs.  To find here, u go to thurg and left at the &quot;T&quot; and go past the bank, contiue straight pass the next &quot;intersection&quot; and open the first door on your left.  You'll see her and can turn in the sceptre or bottle even if u cant fit through the door.  You'll recieve an orb thingy.  Helps to bind in thurg.  <br />
<br />
Time to hunt down a blood wolf harness.  Good news, its droppable and comes off the named dire wolf.  Something like Blood Dire Wolf.  Hand the harness to the mule<br />
<br />
Time to go Kael.  In kael, u want to go the tormax side of kael.  Under the bridge to the tormax area is a giant wolf trainer.  Not completely sure of the again, but the word &quot;trainer&quot; is in his title.<br />
Hand in the orb thingy from the chick from thurg, and then hand in the blood wolf harness next.  You'll get the blood wolf harness and a harness of control.  Once u have that, u can pick a fight with a giant and get a free TL back to your bind (thurg) with everything on u.<br />
<br />
Back to GD, invis and park the mule behind where the broodmother spawns.  Becareful and make sure that none of the wurms break invis.  This can be a pain if one does.<br />
<br />
Seeing how everyone and there mother wants to do this quest.  U can log in the mule and check to see when the broodmother is up.  When she is, hand in the harness of control.  U have 4mins to your main in and get to the coldain mines which are in the south east part of the zone.  Korf Battlehammer-something, i dont recall the last name, will be outside where the entrance to the mines are.  Keep him targeted, when the broodmother arrives snare/root him.  He has around 5k hps and the broodmother will become his pet.  He tries to run away and make sure kill him.  When he is dead, he drops the wristguard and broodmother pops.  <br />
<br />
Tada, quest done.  Look at other guides to fill in the holes, like npc names and names of exact items.  Anywho this is the way i did.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kill the stuff with your main (theres only 2 things you gotta kill), loot with your ogre mule.  Do the appropriate hand ins with your mule until you have the giant control harness.  Park your shaman at the fight spot in GD, send mule in (with invis) to the brood mother and hand in the harness.  Takes her like 10 minutes to get to the spot so you've got plenty of time.  Good luck, the bracer rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks, much clearer now.  Looks like it's entirely doable solo although I tend to crash when I camp in velious, but having a friendi mule a troll would do it too.  <br />
<br />
Looks like it might even be a good opportunity to hook a newbie up with extra pp and pay him something like 1k after he's done turning in piece to broodmother :D<br />
<br />
And how hard is the Broodmother to find btw?  And how long does she despawn for when someone just finished his quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did this quest about a year ago for my druid friend who wanted the bracer.  At that time of course, there were no focus effects, but it was a kick ass druid bracer anyway.  <br />
<br />
We did the mule route.  I made a troll warrior worshipping zek and had him pick me up and cart me around to get karsinic acid and then to thurg to turn it in, then to the hunter camp to get the final belt.  Then I just camped the troll out next to the broodmother spawn spot and logged it in later when the broodmom was up.  Handed in belt, logged off, and helped with the kill with my shaman.  Grats druid on bracer, huzzah!  It pays to help out your friends.  After all he was the one who scored me a totemic helm back in the day.</div></div><hr />
