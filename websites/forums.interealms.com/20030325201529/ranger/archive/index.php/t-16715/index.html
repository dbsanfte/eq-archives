<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Danzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here the thing...I'm sitting at 204 in fletching and am looking to increase my skill as high as  I can..would perfer to get it to 250 evetually.  As it stands I've now combined a total of 200 Mithril arrows with not a single skill up...Is this normal???  I plan on sticking with Mithril arrows as I took the time to get my smithing up to where I now have all the components I need and I dont' mind the run from Fel to Kel.  Just wondering if it really takes that many attempts with out even a skill raise?<br />
<br />
Any advice from those of you who've GM'd this skill would be appericated.  Anyone who's past this point if you have your combine/to skill raise ratio that would help too, as I'm getting rather frustrated that its not going up.  If this stays like this then its going to take well over 30kp to get to 250...I've already invested 6kp with no skill raise, but would like to put the plat to better use if anyone has any suggestions...thanks for the help.<br />

Fletching is going to suck, no matter which route you choose for skilling up.  The rate of skill increases was recently decreased on fletching (and pottery) and experiences like yours seem to be the rule rather than the exception these days.  Just try and keep the stat you use as high as possible when you fletch (one of DEX/INT/WIS), there isn't anything else you can do to influence the rate of skill increases apart from that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>daktarien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I'm not a GM yet but I'm getting there.<br />
I had a similar experience when I tried mithril arrows for the first time around skill 205.   I had a high failure rate and rather few skillups.  Roughly 2 skiillups in 500 combines.  <br />
<br />
 I gave it another try recently (skill aproaching 240) and had much better luck with success and skillups.   This time around I got 3 skillups in 200 combines.   <br />
<br />
Here's what I did:<br />
I went from 207 to 215 on Darkwood bows <br />
215 to 238 mostly on nightmarewood compound bows (pretty strange huh?)<br />
Right now I'm focusing on doing mithril until 250.<br />
<br />
Also it seems to have a very helpful effect if you max your dex before doing combines.  But you probably new that.  =)<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Don't know if this will help at all but I got my smithing up to 219 from 102 in one session when I had KEI. This is on my mule though, my main is stuck at 235 for like forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Danzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dak,<br />
<br />
Just curious what was your success rate from 215-238 on your nightmare bow combines...that is if you can recall.<br />
<br />
BTW another 8k and roughly 350 more combines and its now sitting at 213...so it seems what you all said is correct...going to be a grueling road...was kinda hoping I was doing something wrong...hehe and aye my dex is always maxed out when doing combines.  <br />
Thanks for the welcome and advice all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Danzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just an update for those of you pursuing fletching post 202...My skill now sits at 220...I've done nearly 1150 mithril arrow combines and about 45 darkwood bow combines.  I've spent in the area of 27kp after 202.  Also the it takes me roughly 4hrs running back and forth from kel to fel to make 300combineable arrow attempts...<br />
<br />
This is how I've raised my skill cause any more its just mind numbing...litterly you start to see double and you hands begin to go numb with all the clicking you do in that 4hr time period...getting to 250 no matter what route you choose is going to be a painful experiance...I know cause it already is, however I think the reward is in and amoung its self worth it.   Yeah your not going to have people asking you everyday to help with combine attempts but so be it each has his/her own reason...stick with it and you'll eventually get there.<br />
<br />
A good semi quick way to make 1kp in 3-4hrs is soloing giants in RM  yeah can be grueling as well but to me thats better time spent than farming acrylia if your a wood elf.  <br />
I spend roughly 5.5kp on every 300combines on mithril arrows and now have so many fricken arrows its not funny...but I give them away cause I can't just see destroying them. and selling them back to a vendor is all but pointless.<br />
<br />
Based off my experiance I'm getting about 7-9 skill ups per every 300-400combines of mithril arrows.  Slow yes, painful very, rewarding not currently, seeing a skill increase justifiying, boring extremely.  Just a bit of my experiance and some pieces of info for any who are pursuing this as I am...Don't forget that theres a game out there for you to play too...<br />
<br />
Best of luck to all who are continueing this as I am and soon you will see a post from me that states I am 250...Good luck and stick with it...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Too bad fletching is only used for the new bows now, and occasionally a few 10+4 dmg arrows or 11+4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaeathorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dang, I love this site. :)<br />
<br />
This thread has answered my question of why I have made some 300 arrows (ceramic vanes, trivial 202) and my skill has not gone up ONCE from 171.<br />
<br />
Now the question is... where in the heck does one come up with 27K to throw away fletching??  Not to mention the brewing and smithing that comes with the Wood Elf cultural for making the Tunare bows and arrows.<br />
<br />
Besides the usual &quot;buy low, sell high in bazaar&quot; answer, or the &quot;go solo in RM for weeks on end hunting giants&quot;; realistically, where does one find the financing for skillups?<br />
<br />
I have dropped several Kpp going from 86 to 171, but I just can't comprehend having 27Kpp!  My max was 3K that I saved over a several week period so I could buy the Chitin Hand Wraps for haste.  It killed me to drop that much plat on a single item.<br />
<br />
Anyway, any help would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Danzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gaeathorn, <br />
The 27kp I mention in my post is a total that I've spent...not all in one sitting but over several days/weeks of hunting, xping and saving.   I've also had a few people help with donations with the promise of a nice bow once I get the skill.  Being in a guild helps as there are always someone whos willing to help but time my friend is my best answer.  The amount of plat that has been given to me is trival to the amount of self control and saving I've done.  Another great hunting ground is OS.  Lots of gems drop here which you can easily turn around and sell for anywhere from 35plat-700plat.  All depends on what the value of these gems are on your server...Currently on mine (Emarr) Blue Diamonds can be sold for about 700plat if your patient.  Of that 27kp I think I've had about 5.5kp of that given to me.<br />
<br />
Given your current lvl OS may still be out of reach yet but find your self a druid friend or wizzy or necro who's willing to throw a few k your way while there farming giants in RM...If not then make your self one and earn it your self.  I typically do 300 arrows in one sitting which costs me roughly 4kp-6kp can't recall exactly off the top of my head, but this next go I plan on doing a massive spending/combine ratio.  I'm saving up to about 15kp in hopes to max it out so we'll see.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and stay tuned for future updates...my days off are coming up thus here in a few days you'll see an update and more stats of my progress.<br />

<br />
Thanks for your reply.  From what I can glean from these and other posts on EQ Traders forum, I am looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 1Kpp per skillup point.  wow.<br />
<br />
Ok... I have set my mind that I WILL reach the GM status of 250, as well as have the ability to make any/all of the wood elf cultural items.  lol... I want some of that cultural ranger garb for myself and the druid garb for my up and coming druid. ;)<br />
<br />
That being said, looks like I am headed to RM to do the giants, getting a guild group together to wipe out the Crystal Caverns (excellent loot drops in the 2 other times I have been there), and getting my bazaar mule back online.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to you all for making this forum THE place for a ranger to visit and share valuable information.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Danzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok all just a small update on some stats I took notice of.  In my last 600 combines I went from 220 in fletching to 234.  When broken down..I was getting about one skill up every 42.85 attempts which converts to about 1714plat per skill up.  For every 300 attempts including failed combines it was costing me roughtly 5000plat making Mithril Champion Arrows.  I still have another 300 combines ahead of me until I start saving my plat again...hoping for at least a skill of 242 as at 242 in fletching with a geerlock you effectively have your skill maxed out...thus getting to 250 is well a personel achievement that not many will complete.  I will get it...and now its even closer...sticking with it and I'll keep my updates here.<br />
