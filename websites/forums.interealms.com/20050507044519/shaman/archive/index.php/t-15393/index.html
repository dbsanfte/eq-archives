<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i have yet to find a good one, the problem is the path is so windy its hard to etch it out on a map.<br />
<br />
I think EQmaps.com had a decent one, albiet a lil confusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From a post here when chardok b first opened, I've only been there 2-3 times, so I honesty don't remember myself:<br />
<br />
Map of Chardok (http://amazon.uptimenet.com/guides/Newchardok_3.jpg) <br />
<br />
In the center of the map, where the figure 8 shaped pool is, the entrance is in the little cubby, just to the right of the top-right corner of the legend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll give u a description you can't really mess up. <br />
Go from entrance to the lev tunnel.  Then go down there, take your second left turn, where to make a right turn would put you at bridgekeeper spawn.  Go down till it forks and make a right, then an immediate left.  Then make your next right, and next immediate left.  You will see a house with mobs around and in it.  Once you kill the chokidai dogs, you can simply invis everyone around back and left of the house, along the water to the last tunnel on the right, then click the stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it's easier to jump down from the BK spawn, there's a big pit on the left after you go past him.  It'll drop you in front of the bank, in sight of the waterfall (the entrance is behind the waterfall).<br />
<br />
Alternatively, go up to the BK spawn and go right toward the graveyard area.  If you jump in the water, you can swim right down through the waterfall, and avoid all the mobs at the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would rather not fight my way down due to faction and time... how are you heading down? invis and ITU potions? a partner that pacifies? fighting?<br />
<br />
All suggestions welcome as I have convinced some friends to go.<br />
<br />
also can anyone link any gear that dropped? Might help me to convince a full group to go.<br />
<br />
Tankee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">any dogs in the way will probably see thru both invis and ITU.  Just take a group and go, fight down, the faction you get from hunting in the new zone will certainly make up for a few snarks you have to whack on the way there.  Also, you're a dweeb for mentioning faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why is he a dweeb for mentioning faction?  That faction is not easy to raise, no matter where he decides to hunt.   You're a jackass for saying faction don't matter.<br />
<br />
Always easier to lower faction than raise faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">easiest way i go is head threw threw castle ent between zone in and zone out tunnels, when u get to first bridge jump off to the left on rocks til you reach bottom.  you will be aggro as there are undead and living mobs on the way but 99 percent of the time they cant run down to the bottom of pit.  once down in pit either get invis real quik and get behind the little rock there(may need shrink) or kill the slaves as they aggro when you sit sometimes.  camp to clear aggro.<br />
<br />
come back in and with invis run out of the cubby your in, go right down the tunnel to a T intersection, take left and immediate right(dizok cpt room door on your right) run up the ramp to the bridge keeper spawn point take a right turn and fall into the area down below which is bank area, look left for the waterfall and go threw that and hit the switch.<br />
<br />
depending on luck and mobs up, at 65 i did this with no aggro besides the aggro at castle, but camped out for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">OK, we zoned in and invis'd up, the group pulling entrance trained us so we got to kill about 12 mobs right off the bat. We've spent hours and hours factioning, so dweeb or not every kill hurts (still KoS too /sigh). Anyways, I pulled the skellies only from the gate area and we invised through to the bridge, killed a few more skellies there, invis/lev jump down. A group was camped in the pit so was easy. We were able to invis to the bridgekeeper then. Unfortunately there were see invis mobs between us and the waterfall and we had a really nice fight there with about 9 mobs including the BK. Cleared to the drop down and did so, cleared the 2 at the bottom and ran in. It was our first time there so we were very slow and looking at maps etc. Took us about an hour and a half. I'd say we fought half the mobs we passed and invis'd past several chunks.<br />
<br />
Everything &quot;named&quot; mitigated slow, almost everything resisted slow 1-2x. I got my first ever resists after malo off a non-boss mob., epic stuck everytime. It's challenging, mobs are cool and loot is good if you have a 65 pally to pacify pull... even with him there were adds and several unmezzable to a 55 chanter.</div></div><hr />
