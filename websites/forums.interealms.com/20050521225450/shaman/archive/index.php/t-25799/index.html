<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had an incredible EQ experience this weekend, one of those great fights which reminds me why I love EQ so much.<br />
<br />
A warrior in a big guild sent me a tell out of the blue asking me if I wanted to do the Weaponry trial - I said sure. The group turned out to be a pick up group!<br />
<br />
Group make up - warrior, SK, rogue, rogue, mage, shaman (ONLY HEALER, NO PRESSURE)<br />
<br />
Everyone got conviction/KEI/haste. We invised to ODI, then fought our way to the Body trial. It was single pulls all the way to the trial and I did okay as main healer.<br />
<br />
I buffed everyone with typical shaman buffs + regen + FA. I would have really appreciated Champion.<br />
<br />
The trial has a 15 minute trial with no boss mob at the end. When you enter the main room, there are 4 mobs lying on the floor - spaced around the room.<br />
<br />
Mobs:<br />
<br />
Golem is weak to blunts. <br />
Bazu is weak to slashing. <br />
Dragorn is weak to piercing. <br />
Lightning is weak to nuking. <br />
All are susceptible to special attacks like backstab. <br />
The correct weapon typically does 4x normal damage.<br />
(taken from the Safehouse, just to be sure I was remembering correctly)<br />
<br />
When the trial started, one mob activated (the other 3 were still on the floor). We ran to the active mob (the order of mob activation appears to be random) and the melee types equipped the correct weapon. I did malos/slow and healed (wish I had had Spiritual Serenity at the time). When the mob died, the next mob activated.<br />
<br />
I did pull out my trusty Bone of Bertox. for the blunt mob and a few 800 hits definitely made me happy. I didn't melee much, this was a fight that definitely gave my mana pool a work out.<br />
<br />
The mage nuked like crazy on the Lightning mob, but I didn't find him particularly easy to hit with nukes (even after malos), definitely no 4x nuke hits. The Lightning mob was the second to last mob and I was already a little hurting for mana, so I stuck mostly to healing.<br />
<br />
I don't recall any big AEs to worry about.<br />
<br />
The final mob was weak to piercing. I had saved Ancestral Aid and 1.5 heal for this fight. I hit Spiritual Channeling to get a little extra mana - the countdown kept going: 1 minute, 30 seconds...all the melee hit their disciplines, my heart was pounding, it was so tense...<br />
<br />
I saw the failure message as the mob died...immediately followed by the win message! We won the fight on THE LAST second, it could not have been closer. <br />
<br />
Here is what dropped (went to the mage) - <br />
Painbringer's Velvet Pelisse (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70605)<br />
<br />
It was pretty much the most fun I had had in EQ in a looong time. Although we were a pick up group (one member was a guildmate), we all sat around for at least 10 minutes, complimenting each other and commenting on how much fun the fight was. <br />
<br />
Weaponry is a fun trial where the shaman class can really shine!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Weaponry is fun for sure. Used to be a joke to heal because the mobs where completely slowable. I've done it several times now but still haven't gotten the silly cloak to drop yet.<br />
<br />
Some tips on the fight.<br />
<br />
Don't save epic. It's 6 minute reuse now so you can actually get 3 casts off. 1 right when you start, 1 6 minutes later and a 3rd 6 minutes later. It makes your healing easier and adds a bit of dps theoretically from the crit effect.<br />
<br />
I'd use Spiritual channeling earlier. If you use it on the next to last mob you can spend more mana earlier. Pop spiritual channeling and then with cann v and natural regen have a good amount of mana back when spiritual channeling wears off. Can allow you to do a bit more dps instead of having to hold back for mana to heal as much.<br />
<br />
Don't forget pets. They don't do great dps but any helps. Same goes for the sk too if he didn't have his up.<br />
<br />
The lightning guy doesn't take extra dmg from nukes like the other guys do from melee but he does have about 1/5 the hps on the other guys so nukers can kill him faster. Since you need to do more healing now shaman are definitely best to use dots for dps rather than nukes.<br />
<br />
I don't know if or when the rogues used thier furious backstab disc but if they have it they should use it on the spell guy. Special attacks like backstab aren't effected by the weapon bonuses. So you get the most benifit from it on the lowest hps mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did have a pet up, forgot and did puppies on the final fight!<br />
<br />
I should have used Spiritual Channeling earlier - but I honestly still FORGET about that AA sometimes. I was running out of mana and I was like DUHHHHH.<br />
<br />
I saved the 1.5 because the warrior asked me to click it for the piercer mob and I wanted to be sure it would be up - just weird luck that the piercer mob was our last one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Besides being weak to the appropriate weapon types, each mob is heavily resistant to the other types, reducing damage from them by 60-70%.  They all take normal unmodified damage from non-melee attacks like nukes, dots, backstab, kick, frenzy.  Their hp are so high, though, that spending mana on magical attacks isn't close to as effective as the appropriate melee damage.  Magicians, for example, will be 400ish dps on any of the four mobs as long as thier mana holds out, just like always.  But melee with the right weapons will be pushing 1200dps (warrior base 250 with good gear/aa, multiplied by about 4.5), and will go the whole trial.  But with the wrong weapon type, melee will only be like 100dps, or less.<br />
<br />
The lightning guy (name is Steelshock) isn't weak to nukes.  His special deal is not having any weapon weaknesses, so melee sucks.  Instead he has much lower hp than the other three.  Magic in this situation will comparatively deal way more damage than on the other mobs.  I've been told he was recently updated to be weak to H2H, I don't know the truth of that.  If you happen to have a really really top-of-the-line rogue, he'll still outdamage a shaman on this mob just with Backstab and procs.<br />
<br />
Melee, even rogues who will flip out their dagger for backstabbing, should be wielding high-proc weapons for Steelshock.  Rangers and Beastlords have a couple proprietary weapons like the Howling Stones dagger.  All the other dual wielding classes can use Dedgerex and Ethereal Destroyer.  With Weapon Affinity 5 those two run 60ish dps on procs alone, plus crits and any proc augs.  Even like that, though, normal melee dps is completely owned by anyone who can nuke at all.  If you have a warrior, this mob is where he should use a defensive or evasive disc, so that whoever's healing him can nuke instead.<br />
<br />
Champion does indeed change things a lot in Trial of Weaponry.  The +10% melee mod is ins8ne in the brain, ins8ne in the membrane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grendo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rangers and Zerkers for teh win.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Berserkers? are you kidding?  They deal zippo damage to spellguy, and it's more rare than Rare McRareson of Raresville to find one with a decent piercer.  Rogues -own- berserkers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have my weapon skills maxed too, 1HB, 2HB, and piercing, from the old LoY days when I was camping the charm in Togrins Mine that got better as your weapon skills got higher. Never did get that charm, at some point during the weeks I was trying to get it, SOE decided to give everyone a freebee with that flags one. Still a little bitter, actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rangers are decent if they have a good weapon collection. They can load 3-4 nukes and a couple DoTs for the spell mob, in addition to meleeing with proc weapons.<br />
<br />
If you're highend there are some good choices in each category. chailak fang/dagger of distraction for piercing, demerix/quarm for blunts, etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">demerix/quarm great, but hard to come by.  Like everyone can get Despair &amp; Jagged Onyx Staff, though, or the Arcana 2hb for knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've been told he was recently updated to be weak to H2H, I don't know the truth of that.<br />
<br />
I did weaponry just a week ago, perhaps less I think, and we had a beast go in, and he used H2H and got less DPS than with his better weapons (1hbs).  They likely havent fixed that yet. /shrug<br />
<br />
I've found if you are the only healer in the trial, even now, it's pretty cake keeping a well geared tank up.  I usually keep Serenity always up on the tank, and use Daluda's Mending to patch as needed.  Yes, I do have Yoppa's mending, but I also have qvic gloves for 25% mana pres on daluda's... nice to make use of that effect here.<br />
<br />
I always open up the trial with Ancestral Aid, and if i'm lucky, get a quick click of it at the end also.  Use epic twice per trial, cani5 if needed, and pained memory anytime I can heh.  As for using spiritual channelling...  If you have a warrior and a paladin in the group (i've been fortunate enough to have them both), make the warrior blow evasive on Steelshock, toss a HoT on him, and the pally takes over healing the warrior. Why? Cause the pally has crap DPS on steelshock anyways, your dot dps/nukes will own his on steelshock.<br />
THIS is when you blow SC. Pop SC, Serenity yourself, malos, slow, then I usually land BoYoppa, Bane (no sisslak yet, or i''d use it also), BoSaryrn, then start chaining the Yoppa's Rain, replace dots as needed, plus caniing if needed and keeping yourself up. if you got a good warrior (im spoiled) you can run all that and the mob wont even blink at ya.  finish steelshock off, and if you can (and have a TA/Epic), melee on the Golem and Dragorn for some added dps.<br />
<br />
Last time I went through, I had myself, warrior, rogue, pally, sk, and a  necro.  Necro never once fed me.. did mindwrack which helped a ton, still ran oom at the end heh, had like 300mana left :D  We won the trial and had around 1min30sec left roughly. We just had the 2 min warning when the mob was at like 20% or so.  Yay me on the back :)  Only took a good 14 weaponry trials or so for the back heh <br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grendo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Berserkers? are you kidding?  They deal zippo damage to spellguy, and it's more rare than Rare McRareson of Raresville to find one with a decent piercer.  Rogues -own- berserkers.<br />
<br />
Survey says, wrong. Sorta. ;)<br />
<br />
Frenzy is not mitigated (like backstab) on ANY of the mobs. Neither is crits, which berserkers get a specific crit disc for said mob. Add a simple proc to any of our normal weapons, and we arent holding the group back on Spellshock. In addition, Blood pact grants us a proc that is great against him.<br />
<br />
Whatever we still lack on Spellshock, we make up for on the other three forms. Warcry is a very significant boost, and Vengeful Fury, or Untamed Rage is huge on any of the three mobs.<br />
<br />
When OOW first came out (the trial has been greatly toned down since the patch several weeks ago) the best piercer I had was a velium gemmed (hi droppable piercer) and had no problems. With innate triples (rare quads) + flurries the damage output on these mobs is significant. Of course, all of my weapon types are much higher now, but thats not the point.<br />
<br />
Rogues own everyone, generally speaking. Thank you Capt. Obvious. But they arent easy to come by...at least good ones. Since *good* rogues are so hard to come by after raids, our normal weaponry trial group doesnt use one. Sure they make it even easier...if theyre good, but definently not necessary. The pre-nerf ideal of &quot;omgz no rogue, guess we have to do destruction!!11one&quot; is entirely close-minded. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Frenzy is not mitigated, sure.  But how much dps is Frenzy?  Last I checked, it still doesn't scale with weapon damage like Backstab.  It's more like a better Kick.  And I'd really like to see the parse on Steelshock that shows you keeping up with a dualwielding class.  You get two procs, they get four, and I've yet to see a 2h with procs like Conflagaration or Time Snap.<br />
<br />
Like, Berserkers are melee, sure.  And they're much better than monks here.  And we've won here with two knights and a beastlord.  But the stars in weaponry are really clear: ranger, rogue, bard, Spell:Champion.  Using anyone who's good is the aim, but I don't /who all ber when making weaponry groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Did weaponry with SK as main tank. He poped 2 of his discs &amp; self healed for almost the full Lightning fight. they have 2 discs that heal for a % of the damage they do to the mob. Cleric loaded up nukes &amp; we pwned him. <br />
<br />
Group makup was <br />
shaman, cleric, bard, SK, ranger, Rogue<br />
<br />
FYI dots land for full on all mobs. I kept Curse &amp; bane up on all melee mobs plus melee for xtra dps. Carefull not to over do it as tank is DPS`ing not trying to generate a truck load of aggro</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to nitpick a little:<br />
<br />
1. Offhand doesn't proc as much as mainhand(so a dual wielding melee won't proc nowhere close to twice as much as a melee using a 2H weapon)<br />
<br />
2. Champion isn't bad, but not as great as you make it out to be<br />
<br />
3. The real winner are all sorts of AC debuffs. Crippling Spasm will greatly outdo Champion for instance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Weaponry is the only trial that I'm missing still.  I haven't honestly tried it in prob closer to six months.. basically I did it twice before they changed the trial and haven't been back since.  I've been meaning to do it, being the only healer, but now I think that I def will do it sometime soon, especially if Glori can heal for it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">:\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">TY for the write up guys.  I have a group of friends I hunt with regularly.  Weapory is the only trial we haven't beaten yet.  I think I may give it a try again now with the above info! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Have had success with Sk as offtank in this trial.<br />
<br />
Only pure caster I have had in group has been mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">offtank? offtanking what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Did this today second try (first try ranger died to enrage on the 3rd mob, d'oh).<br />
<br />
Group make up was:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Shaman<br />
SK<br />
Ranger<br />
Bard<br />
<br />
I meleed on the blunt and piercing mobs and saved my mana for the magic damage mob and the slashing mob. I managed to stack up saryrn, yoppa, Bane, wunshi, ultor on them both but got aggro on the magic one towards the end of its life. I always chained  Saryrn and Yoppa rains on the magic only mob.<br />
<br />
The melees used their best wepons of each type for each specific mob. On the magic mob they used their highest procing ones (the ranger with two weapons procing http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=659&amp;source=Live).<br />
<br />
The warrior had bard DS+shaman potion DS+ranger DS and all the mobs had reverse cleric DS on them. <br />
<br />
We won with approx. 2 minutes to spare i reckon. Fun trial :)</div></div><hr />
