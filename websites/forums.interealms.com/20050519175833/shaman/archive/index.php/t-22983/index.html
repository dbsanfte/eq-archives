<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i decided since i make most of the groups, i should get the leadership AA's. So how good are some of them? A few look interesting, like group health increase and regen and attack.<br />
<br />
What are the actual numbers behind those 3,which one did you get first?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Badasc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Health of Target's Target is the best one by far IMO.  After that, Delegate Main Assist is very good, especially for chanters.  I like spell awareness too, but that isn't such a big deal except for on raids.  After that, I'd go for health enhancement and offense enhancement, but it doesn't make as much of a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HoTT is far and away the best imo. HE is good, and Find Path to PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got delegate main assist and target health percent right off - I like the MA target ringy thingy, and I like to have the next mob targeted, but watch the first mob's health, so I can pull at the right time (when the situation allows it).<br />
<br />
Then I got health enhancement three and then health regeneration three.<br />
<br />
Now I'm saving for health of target's target. Then either attack or mana enhancement, not sure which.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't worked on leadership AAs at all.  How much does it take away from AA exp when you're working on it?  I'd rather get normal AAs than leadership AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good advice here.<br />
<br />
Delegate MA is great.  You get the nice, bright targetting ring which really helps the clueless.<br />
<br />
NPC health is just another &quot;get a clue&quot; leadership ability.<br />
<br />
HE 3 adds a total of about 150 hit points or so.  Every little bit counts right?<br />
<br />
OE 2 adds 11 to the attack rating. Not sure what OE 5 will add, but again, every little bit counts.<br />
<br />
HoTT has its ardent supporters and haters. Personally I love it. It's another tool allowing me to control the flow of battle.  However, not everybody gets this AA so IMO it loses efficacy if you are the only one with it.<br />
<br />
The Mana enhancement does not increase MR but merely the size of the mana pool. This is one you can save for last.<br />
<br />
Delegate Mark NPC. I see some people with this one - I, myself have been given this ability, but I never use it.  In a group, with multiple mezzed, I simply &quot;Hail&quot; the next MOB I want people to engage.<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness.  Yes it's a lot of spam. But, I think it is invaluable again in the &quot;get a clue&quot; category. NO excuse for missing the gating MOB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Achzizra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HoTT is absolutely wonderful. No more wondering who has aggro. Got that one first off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">HoTT is the way to go for your first skill. It's the only really usefull one. Btw, I hate those huge target rings that come with some leader skills with a passion, because they make it very difficult for you to tell which mob you have selected based on your targeting ring when mobs are close together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HoTT has its ardent supporters and haters. Personally I love it. It's another tool allowing me to control the flow of battle.  However, not everybody gets this AA so IMO it loses efficacy if you are the only one with it.<br />
<br />
Then they are not using it properly. If the group leader has the skill, everyone in the group can click &quot;L&quot; and make a hotkey for the skill. Then they just press it and the secondary targeting box pops up. If the leader doesnt have the skill, then the hotkey stays greyed out. If the group goes to less than 3 people, it greys out as well. The other people in the group dont need the leader AA skill to use it.<br />
<br />
There is a similar skill in the raid leader AAs as well. In that case if the raid leader has the skill, there is another hotkey you can make which will allow everyone on the raid to pull up a HoTT box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I will definately concur with the usefulness of HoTT. Spell awareness is also nice and I don't think it induces any more spam because it tacks the name on the end of the soanso is casting a spell message that appears anyways. Its really great for stunning cheal mobs in ldons, thats for sure. <br />
<br />
I give the mark ability to the chanter and they can mark mobs they are mezzing which I also find useful. If charming I leave a permanent mark on the charmed pet which is invaluable when charm breaks with 3-4 mobs in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">HoTT is THE best leader AA bar none.  I would pay 3x the points for that ability.  Once you get used to it you won't know how you lived without it.  Its amazing how many people don't have HoTT but will buy Spam Awareness, Mana Enhancement, or Mark NPC.<br />
<br />
-G</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Health of Target's Target  is very powerful.  The fact that it tells you the health of target's target is a nice bonus, but the hugely useful piece is:  you know who has aggro.  If I've got aggro from slowing, everyone sees it:  when the tank gets it back, everyone sees it.  We're not guessing, we know.  This is hugely useful information.  <br />
<br />
I love Spell Awareness, though some people who group with me hate it for the spam.  I argue that the basic amount of spam has not changed:  you always saw a message that says MobX begins to cast a spell.  But now you get a useful message:  MobX begins to cast a spell &lt;Complete Heal&gt;.  After I listened to the complaints about spam for a while, I learned to say:  If you don't want to know this information, filter it out or learn to ignore it.  But it is a great advantage to many of us to know what spells are being cast by other players and by mobs.<br />
<br />
Delegate Main Assist  is quite helpful for the targetting impaired, who are many.<br />
<br />
Health Enhancement  gives 100 hp, that's not a lot but I got it, and I think it's worth getting.<br />
<br />
ATK Enhancement  adds I think 30 ATK when you have all of it, that's a lot of aa for not a lot of benefit, but melees love ATK.  It's the one I'm working on now.<br />
<br />
Mana Enhancement  gives 100 mana, again not a lot but I think it's worth getting.  I've bought one level so far, 30 extra mana.<br />
<br />
Health Regen  will add a little bit of hp regen, but I haven't put any aa into it yet.<br />
<br />
Inspect Buffs  looked to be a very useful leader skill for those of us who do a lot of buffing, and are always getting tells from people who say &quot;I need focus&quot; 10 minutes after you just cast focus on them.  I figured it would be very nice to be able to use this and say, &quot;Yah you need focus all right, because Fo7 is up in your buff bar right now and has 109 minutes till it needs to be refreshed.&quot;  But now that everyone can inspect their own buffs and timers, these leader aa points are now a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">HoTT is a great ability and I find it really handy. As a guild it was the second raid ability we got. First was delegate MA.<br />
<br />
I went for those early on and I tended to go after the leader aa's that added new things rather than just more mana, more hps or more attack. <br />
<br />
Spell awareness is nice and I really don't see it adding much spam since it's pretty much just the name of the spell on the end of the regular spell casting msg. Pretty handy imo.<br />
<br />
inspect buffs is nice but did loose some now that anyone can check buff times. Still like it tho.<br />
<br />
Personally I just finished mark nps and really like it. Fairly rescently started doing time and being able to mark which mobs I slowed and remember if it was balance or turgurs is really handy.<br />
<br />
I have done the health enhancement and am working on mana now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is the attack provided by melee enhancement affected by multipliers?  I know that on my ranger, for every 10 atk I added, once my multipliers were added in, it equated to a lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Health of Target's Target: is a 'cant live without' AA now ... its great in groups, its great on raids (even if just to see how much aggro bounce there is!!) ...<br />
<br />
Health Enchancement: Level 3 adds 100 HPs (and is modded by ND3 and other HP mod AAs, hence why some report +100HPs, others closer to +150HPs) ...<br />
<br />
Delagate Main Assist:  For the assist impaired (there are many) ...<br />
<br />
Mark NPC:  Great for pulling Shammies if ya wanna Mark which to Mez, which to tank, etc ...<br />
<br />
Offensive Enchancement:  Great for the Melee in the Group, with OE3 + Bhily + PE, I tell the Mellee to Rack off if they ask for FA  :p <br />
<br />
The rest is mainly eye Candy and wow factor, but casters seems to like the extra 100Mana ....<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Health Enchancement is not modded by ND3 etc. <br />
It's 100hp for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, I just got the message today that I had maxxed my leadership points, and had to spend some before I earned any more, so I got HoTT. LOVE IT! Working that spell awareness stuff next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My purchase order I think I did:<br />
1.  HOTT first.  Enough other people mentioned how good it is above that I don't need to go on.  Should be the first Raid Leader AA bought as well.<br />
2.  Delegate Main assist.  I love the target ring.  I don't have an assist hotkey (too many other hotkeys already on main page).  Makes it easy to know if I'm on the wrong mob.<br />
3.  Mark npc 1.  I got this for helping on some strategic pulls.  It's good for marking the charmed pet in an xp group and places like Tipt.  I like additional clickies and abilities so that's why I got this so early.  It's useful for targetting named mobs so you can see them when they are far away (like in KT for wandering named cragbeasts and hynids).<br />
4.  Spellspam.  I like knowing what spells people casting.  It lets you see what spells npcs are casting at you too.  Some people h8 it and think it's too much spam.  I don't think so, as you already have the &quot;soandso casts a spell&quot; spam.  Instead, it's &quot;soandso casts XXX&quot;.  It's no more spam than you already had, it's just different more informative spam.<br />
5.  NPC Health.  It's pretty marginal in it's use.  It's also only 2 points, so I got it out of the way already.<br />
6.  Health 1 2 3.  Can never have enough HPs.  It's not a huge amounts of HPs, but its some.<br />
7.  Attack 1 2 3 4 5.  I had to pick between regen, mana, and attack tree next.  I never go oom, and neither do my group members even on raids.  Regen is pretty insignificant when mobs are hitting you for 1k a pop.  Increasing attack is always useful, especially for my fairly melee heavy groups and guild raids.<br />
8.  Delegate Mark NPC.  It was 4 points to get it out of the way.  I use mark NPC a lot to direct the main assist at times.  I also party with other people that have leader AAs and if they want to be able to mark things, they can too.<br />
9.  This is as far as I've gone so far.  I'm working on bigger mana pool next.  After that will be regen.  After that probably Mark npc 2 and 3.  Lastly Inspect buffs*.<br />
<br />
* Inspect buffs is so very far down on my list because you can see your own buff durations now.  If you couldn't see how long your buffs were going to last, I'd probably get it at #8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got Health Enhancement 3 and quit after that.  There's too many regular AA skills that I would rather get before more leadership skills.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, almost always when I am in an exp group or on an LDoN mission, someone else has more skills, and mine are not needed.  If I am on a raid, our raid leader has HoTT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">HoTT is by far the best leadership aa followed by Delegate main assist, HP enhancement and spell awareness.<br />
<br />
HoTT is definitelly a &quot;can't live without it&quot; aa once you get used to it especially on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Halamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">HoTT &gt;&gt;&gt; any other aa (lesson i learn the hard way :P ) <br />
<br />
Reason is for healer /2ndary healer /pally /sk = meant live or dead for debuffer or cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What's kind of funny is, after having lived with HOTT now for about 2? months, what I really want is HOTTT (Health of Target's Target's Target).  When I'm healing the main tank, and he's beating on a mob, I wanna know if he's got aggro, or if the mob has switched to someone else.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">What's kind of funny is, after having lived with HOTT now for about 2? months, what I really want is HOTTT (Health of Target's Target's Target).

<br />
Yes!!!!<br />
<br />
I want to know if I need to quicky assist and then assist again to get a new target.  While HoTT works great (in a raid situation) when you *know* the mob is still on a particular target, that HoTTT would rock :)<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten my group leadership HoTT because I mostly raid and the raid leaders have HoTT anyway, so it's sort of a waste.  However, I could see where in say, GoD, HoTT would be very useful in a group so a healer can start a heal as soon as he sees a particular group member get aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I got <br />
1) HoTT - Won't group in Gates if the leader doesn't have this, as i know when someone steals agro from the MT, and who gets it..<br />
<br />
2) NPC health - 2 AA's, and it works w/ mark npc<br />
<br />
3) Mark NPC - had an idea that didn't pan out too well, i don't use this too often becuase, though it's useful for charmed pets<br />
<br />
4) HE 1-3 everyone loves HP's, get this get happiness<br />
<br />
5) Inspect buffs 1-2 gotta know when FA is fading, and how much time's left on mgb buffs(can now check the latter easily, grrr)<br />
<br />
6) OE1-3 atk is similar to hps, but people won't like it as much, and level 4 is more LAA than SE.<br />
<br />
7) Spell awareness<br />
<br />
future) OE 4-5 then make all of them green beucase it's fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hail,<br />
<br />
Mark NPC 0 / 3  3 <br />
NPC Health 1 / 1  - <br />
Delegate Main Assist 0 / 1  4 <br />
Delegate Mark NPC 0 / 1  4 <br />
Inspect Buffs 1 / 2  4 <br />
Spell Awareness 1 / 1  - <br />
Offense Enhancement 1 / 5  5 <br />
Mana Enhancement 0 / 3  4 <br />
Health Enhancement 1 / 3  6 <br />
Health Regeneration 0 / 3  4 <br />
Find Path to PC 1 / 1  - <br />
Health of Target's Target 1 / 1  <br />
<br />
That's where I'm at right now.  Next up will be DMA for me, then Health Enhancement.  If I had to do it over I would skip NPC health and Inspect Buffs (the new freebie self-buff inspect ability wasn't IG when I bought IB1).  Personally, I want additional abilities that I can't get anywhere else before grabbing an extra 100hp.  An extra 100hp would be great, but not having to go back through 3 hallways in an LDoN to snag the lost player that went AFK for too long is more valuable (LOVE Find Path to PC :) ) to me.<br />
<br />
HoTT is without a doubt the best ability there is.  I personally think Spell Awareness is the next best, because it allows you to see what the mobs are casting, and you can also see proc effects.  When you are pulling, this can be VERY useful.  When fighting caster mobs (especially healers) it helps you choose your moment to slam/nuke/stun/etc.  Even if you can't do any of those, the rest of your group can.  Can save you tons of headaches with mobs that gate.  This ability can also be the difference between a mob CH'ing 3 times or not at all. <br />
<br />
I'd recommend you get HoTT first, and then let your playstyle determine any other abilities.  Stay disciplined to get those 7 points for HoTT! Once you have 4 or 5 banked it gets very tempting to snag something for 4 or 5 points instead of staying the course for HoTT. :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">HoTT is the best.  Sweet having it on raids and seeing all the overaggroing losers pop up and get vaporized.  Also nice to see your own name up there after a slow bounce and knowing a world of hurt is incoming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I got HoTT, then Spell Awareness.  I'll likely go for HP next, then ATK.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Inspect Buffs  looked to be a very useful leader skill for those of us who do a lot of buffing, and are always getting tells from people who say &quot;I need focus&quot; 10 minutes after you just cast focus on them.

<br />
<br />
I thought they might be a waste, too right before the patch where the buff timers went in and was wondering if there would be a refund for the aa spent. However, I was reminded by another shaman that detrimental spells show when you inspect and that's still worth the points in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">HoTT has unlimited range! Also, it's handy for pulling so you know exactly when the agro starts -- including pet-pulling, if you're into that, it's great knowing exactly when to smack /pet hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I have:<br />
<br />
Delegate Main Assist - Like it a lot.  In situations where things don't go exactly as planned its a lot easier to see which mob is first on our hit list.<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness - This one is my personal favorite.  Is that priest mob CH'ing or is it just GH?  No guesswork involved.  Is he gating or rooting?  Now you know.<br />
<br />
HoTT - Have it.  It's ok.  It certainly has it's uses but I'm not as in love with it as everyone else is.  It was not my first AA for sure.<br />
<br />
IB2 - Have it, still love it even with the new self buff inspect.  Not as useful in a group where the members stay the same for hours, since most of your buffs are group and you know when they are gonna wear.  However, in groups where the members change often, it's very helpful.  Also shows detrimentals for the quick RC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">HoTT, I can't live without it any more.<br />
<br />
I have HE2 and working on HE3 now.  The extra HP is nice.  Planning on working on mana enhancement next.<br />
<br />
I got the percentage health in the mob name thing, it's pretty much useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">IB2 - Have it, still love it even with the new self buff inspect.

<br />
My philosophy is that if someone can't be bothered to get off their ass and send me a tell for a buff, then I sure as hell am not going to bother to inspect them, especially after I've been spamming the raid channel with 'sent tells for focus/diaku/stam' for the last five minutes.<br />
<br />
HoTT is handy though; I have it, Heath3 and DMA.</div></div><hr />
