<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive noticed that my alchemy will go up quicker when im making potions that are more closer to trivial level.<br />
<br />
Ie. Shrinks trivialize at 70, from 60 to 65 will go up alot slower then from 65 to 70</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gexo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have also noticed it seems if you stay within maybe 20 points your skill does go up faster than if you make something way above your skill lvl.<br />
<br />
Cant say for sure..but i have noticed that it seems that way in the tradeskills.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What I think I have observed... all subjective, of course... is that skill goes up faster if you're within a zone of about 30 points below trivial to 5 points below trivial, then it slows down dramatically.<br />
<br />
If someone wants to try this, I suggest buying fresh fish and batwings in FP - both available on vendors - and combining in a spit or oven to make fishrolls, then examining the log to see where the skill point increases occurred.  Fishrolls trivialize at like 135 or so.  Unfortunately, this is a long slow boring haul and would have to be done multiple times with identical characters/buffs to be valid as a test.  Sounds like a lot of work to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One rumor is that skill increases are more likely after a successful combine than an unsuccessful combine. As you are more likely to be successful if you are trying to make a potion that has trivial level 10 above your current skill than a potion that has trivial level 30 above your current skill, then you would be more likely to get a skill increase with the lower triv potion.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is true, but it does seem to be the conventional wisdom.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gexo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Skill points in all tradeskills and even stuff like swimmming and weapons skills...for the most part go up in multiples of threes for some reason. So what i usally do is do a whole bunch at once to get the skill increases.<br />
<br />
Might not be three back to back but fairly close to eack other anyways.<br />
