<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tasc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just wondering where might be some good places to duo 65monk and a 59 shaman.  I have done pod and pon  but the exp isnt that great.  Im mainly looking for the shaman exp, but some pp and loot is always a plus. The monk has around 3700hp unbuffed , shaman has just under 2k hp unbuffed, epic and malo,torpor for when he gets 60.  <br />
Griegs End was decent exp for the shaman until he hit 59, also been doing parts of droga lately.  Ive read here of some soloing WW dragons.. how hard would that be with this duo? what about slime boots camp?<br />
<br />
Most info i see on duo is for SK/shaman.  Im just looking for a few new ideas.<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the same places SK/Shaman can go, are going to be the same for monk/shaman in my opinion. Just got to be a little more careful with slow/poison dot agro (as I'm sure you already are aware). I duo with a SK sometimes in HoH, don't know if you're keyed for that....you wont find any better xp than there I wouldn't think at your level. Snare is a huge help though in getting them slowed before a mob gets to camp, as they are around level 61-62 so some resists will happen. At least with the monk you can split, as without any kind of pacify/fd or anything, it's almost impossible to single pull.<br />
<br />
If no key for HoH, I'd stick with Droga, nice loot there, and I hear a lot soloing it at 65, so you should be fine (I've only grouped there, pretty easy with full group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tasc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i went back to PoN, PoD duoing and i would get about a % every 3 kills.  Im not real sure on the time it took to kill those 3 for the 1%.  where would you recommend for % exp / per time taken to kill the mob?<br />
would going somewhere like velks where the monk could kill easy LB mobs to him and DB to the shaman be more effecient?<br />
<br />
I havent tried any 2nd tier planar mobs.  will the shaman be able to keep up on heals enough to make killing them worth while? in 1st tiers i could pull constant trash mobs with little if any down time. Most fights lasted about long enough to get mob debuffed , slowed and epic on and be nearly running out or just running out when the mob dies.<br />
I just have been feeling like ill spend a couple hours killing a few dozen mobs for just 5% or so exp when maybe i could have killed a 100 or so easier mobs in the same time for maybe more exp.<br />
Oh.. shamans the alt so he doesnt have any flags as of yet. and not 62 so cant do HoH yet.<br />
and lvl 59 realy does suck.. i almost forgot about how sucky it was on the monk way back when</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you wont get any xp in tier 1 I'm afraid. Best bet is to go tier 2, pov golems maybe. I can heal just fine in hoh when i duo with the SK, so you should be fine in a tier 2 spot. I assume you have Kragg's, if not, don't bother trying it until you get it, as you won't be able to heal enough.</div></div><hr />

Where an SK and SHM can duo, isn't the same as where an Monk and SHM can duo. <br />
<br />
I was in the same boat as the above poster. 65 monk fairly well equiped, and a 59 shaman bot. I tried PoS desert and PoV golems, with no luck. It worked about 70 percent of the time, but the 30 percent of the time either resulted in my monk dieing, or my shaman dieing. <br />
<br />
The problem is that monks don't mitigate any damage, and have no way to generate enough agro to keep the shaman from dieing. <br />
<br />
I would stick with PoN or PoD, it'll be slow, but constant and with little or no deaths.<br />
<br />
Avoind PoI mobs there seemed to hit to hard for the amount of exp they gave. <br />
I never tried PoJ, beyond camping there one time in the great hall and that didn't seem very productive.</div></div><hr />
