<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your transmission is breaking up...uh, you mean you CAN'T view them/open magelo on the Mac? Or you can browse on the Mac fine but when you try to do anything with IE it craps out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>touk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i can browse NP but when it comes to magleo it downloads to my desk top and when i open it its all just text and the site itself wont open period on my PC i have no probs so i figure it Mac missing something any ideas would be great.

<br />
now now we should not flame this poor idividual, we should give him our sympathy for having to use a mac. My heart goes out to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beoldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can't view Magelo profiles with either Safari or IE 5.x on my Mac.  On Windows, however, Phoenix (now Mozilla Firebird) does work with Magelo.  Therefore, I'd suggest trying the following (I haven't tried any of these yet, so no first-hand solutions):<br />
<br />
1. Upgrade to the latest edition of IE for OS X.<br />
2. Try Chimera/Camino or another Mozilla based browser for OS X.<br />
<br />
* Opera won't read Magelo profiles on Windows, so I wouldn't bother trying the OS X verison.<br />
<br />
Technical stuffs:<br />
I've found that Magelo sends profile pages with Content-type: application/gzip.  I'm not sure why, but since the pages are html, it should probably be &quot;text/html&quot;.  Most browsers won't display &quot;application/gzip&quot; type documents and will try to download them or ask what to do with them, since there's usually no default action associated with that content type.  IE tends to cover for strange code/website behavior, which might be it works.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
