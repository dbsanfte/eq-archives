<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night, I handed in my black dire pelt to the correct Spirit Sentinel in the Emerald Jungle, and he ate it, saying something along the lines of &quot;I will not help people like you&quot;. :eek: <br />
<br />
Turns out I hadn't given him the gem from the last part of the quest yet (which would explain why he wasn't answering my hails ... at which point I wouldn't have continued except I'd remembered reading here about someone else who hadn't managed to get a response and the quest worked for them). <br />
<br />
Anyway, the point of this post (except to smack myself in the head a few more times) is that I petitioned on the off chance that a guide/gm might be able to help. Trouble is I had to log off soon afterwards befor I got a response. <br />
<br />
Do petitions stay in a queue after you log out? Or do you need to repetition when you log back in?<br />
<br />
Also, something which occoured to me (when I thought that the pelt might have just dropped back into my inventory, which it hadn't) - is there a way to cancel a petition?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any response,<br />
<br />
Shaben the stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GMs are just going to tell you to do that part of the quest again, even if petitions stay in queue you won't get any help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quest items only come back to you when you hand the Wrong item to a NPC.  You handed the right one, but didn't have the faction to complete the quest.  You'll have to start from the point that your epic quest was interrupted and do it from there...  (including killing Back Dire again).  GM's won't help you by giving you the pelt back, mark my words.....  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And as we all really are not busy atm ;), it is /deletepetition to clear petition from queue and i think(?) you have to repetition after logoff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had to kill Black Dire twice for a similar reason... except I'm more of a dumbass, because I turned in the pelt before even starting the epic quest.  I just wanted free sow boots at level 24...  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/viewpetition (/viewp)<br />
/deletepetition (/deletep)<br />
<br />
Petition stays in queue if you log to another character, but whether it gets acted upon is another matter. Petition leaves queue if you exit the game.<br />
<br />
Just go get Black Dire's pelt again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, thanks for the info guys. (And thanks for making me feel better Xanden!)<br />
<br />
What you're saying about my chances with the petition are about what I figured - I was just clutching at straws. I don't think I'll bother petitioning again seeing as I guess the GMs and guides will be very busy for a while ...<br />
<br />
/em goes off to persuade people that something furry, black and dire needs to be killed again<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i did the same thing after switching servers, from tm to TT. when the spirit ate my pelt i petitioned every time i logged on and while i was OFF line, zam the fashion gnome had returned my pelt to me, whent and did the gem thing, gave him the gem, then the pelt and got my boots. so dont say that you wont get help , gm's can still be useful</div></div><hr />
