According to Kytherea:<br />
<br />
&quot;The shaman AA Call of the Ancients has had its description changes to reflect the fact that the summoned ward casts healing spells, not endurance regen spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
&quot;The AA point refund for Call of the Ancients will be in the upcoming update on Aug 11 2004&quot;<br />
<br />
Yay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">clerics get a healing ward.. we should get endurance ward<br />
<br />
kinda a slap in the face for zerkers.. considering they dont have any way of regening endurance faster and have been lobbying for CotA to be changed to endurance /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm happy that they have finally gotten off of the fence on this one.  I personally hoped for the other direction but oh well.<br />
<br />
I think the entire melee revamp from last year(?) was a 'great idea gone horribly wrong'.  All the talk about 'openings' and being able to do a ton of stuff to the mob like cripple it, etc....instead they just moved /disc to END based and called it a night.<br />
<br />
Curious to see what people are going to buy with their refunded AAs...how many will repurchase it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm going to buy SCS 3 :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">when they were talking about all those openings and the importance of endurance, that was actually really exciting.  game actually looked like it was going to be taking a change for the better.  or at least, it looked like it was finally taking on a more innovative approach to redesigning content.<br />
<br />
soe really should stick with that approach.</div></div><hr />
