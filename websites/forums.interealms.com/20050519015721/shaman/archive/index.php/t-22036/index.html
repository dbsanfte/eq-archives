question:  if a mouse has been going into a room every day for months to eat cheese (that just magically appears), but one day notices that there is less cheese, then realizes that the amount of cheese has been slowly getting smaller every day, what should he do?  A) complain really loudly and expect that because he complained the cheese will come back.  B) look for cheese somewhere else.  C)  keep showing up for the cheese because eventually there will be more cheese there.

<br />
You know, you are right!  Complaining never solves anything.  We can take our abilities and go do other things!  Since our main cheese (slow) isnt as usefull anymore, we'll just do other things!<br />
<br />
Like heal!  oh wait...although we have gotten a nice upgrade to our HoT's, our &quot;big&quot; heals are too small to have a noticible impact except in downtime, of which in the &quot;new EQ&quot; there isnt any, because all new content is centered around 30-45 sec fights.<br />
<br />
Well, lets NUKE then!  Well, except that our nukes are some of the most inefficient of any class AND the smallest of the priest classes AND the INT casters.  Coupled with the fact that the cast time on our inefficient nukes is far to long for the damage that it does.  We have rains, but those are hard coded to resist 20% of the time anyway but still our most damaging form of nuke spells.<br />
<br />
Well, at least we can still buff right?  Well, Our buffs are worthless to anyone that is max cap or close, and the one spell that we have that melee seem to like still (FA) is short duration, long recst heavy mana cost.  <br />
<br />
But I can go solo!  yeah..well...only in older content or content where the exp gain per mob is worse than I would get grouping.  Old TRIVIAL content though I can solo like a champ.  It takes awhile, and the reward isnt as good as it once was, but I can say that I did it,<br />
<br />
So tell me kitty....which option is the best?  I say trying to get issues fixed, what you call complaining, is the best choice.  Feel free to take your cheese and go though.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is so fine for situations where the world has changed and you can't do a thing to roll back the clock to where things were before.<br />
<br />
It is less than optimal, though, where the possibility exists for negotiation.<br />
<br />
In the story there is no one for the mice to negotiate with, the cheese just appears or does not.  Lots of situations like that in the world:  culture / economics are the way they are, nothing you can do to change that.<br />
<br />
In many situations there is  someone to negotiate with.  Within a marriage, in an office, in a city council, in a classroom, on a sports team.  The solution there may not need to be to find a new place to get cheese; it may be to negotiate about how to arrange the whole cheese distribution process.<br />
<br />
Are we (1) in a situation where SoE will put cheese in certain places, it's no use complaining that they are not putting it where we used to find it?<br />
<br />
Or are we (2) in a situation where we can negotiate with them about how the cheese distribution is going to work?</div></div><hr />

E.) Alter his diet to include whatever amount of cheese he sees, plus any other morsels out there that his little mouse brain deems worthy of his attention.<br />

Does this post about mice somehow stem from the fact that you're a &quot;kittyshaman&quot;? <br />

Please tell me you are not going to quote us Tony Robbins to motivate us to strive harder to succeed.  If I have a positive attitude, Tnargs will heal for 3k and slow won't be mitigated!<br />

Not only is your argument erroneous, Kitty, but you are a MOUSE KILLER :shock:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well this thread has been good for a laugh. Yes, kitty some here and on the SoE boards are just complaining the class is broken. But if you take a closer look you will see there are alot more sitting there saying this is broken, and I think we can fix it this way. <br />
<br />
So to use your own analogy, just ignore the mice sitting there complaining the cheese is gone. And notice the ones with the running shoes on looking for which direction to move in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I read that book last year.  <br />
It doesn't apply to our current situation at all.  That book urges people who've lost their jobs to get out and explore other career opportunities, go back to school, or try something completely different. <br />
<br />
Based on that advice, and applying it to EQ I should:<br />
1) Switch classes to a beastlord or<br />
2) Quit EQ in favor of a new game with &quot;tastier cheese.&quot;<br />
<br />
Either one is a perfectly acceptable solution to my dillemma, but this is an EQ SHAMAN board, and I play an EQ SHAMAN, so neither is acceptable.</div></div><hr />

I didn't realize EQ was a free hand-out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Now, an EQ-playing mouse would have a lot of options other than just to complain or to move on - just consider some of these:<br />
<br />
1) The mouse could sell the cheese on Ebay or Player Auctions<br />
<br />
2) The mouse could organize other mice into a cheese-raiding guilds and go after mazes too tough to solo.<br />
<br />
3) The mouse could start up a Mouse msg brd forum, post messages complaining about how cheese has been nerfed, and wait for the developers to patch the cheese into balance.<br />
<br />
4) The mouse could find other mice, tell them about the cheese, and then strike a deal with a cat that he'll provide an endless source of cheese-KSing mice to eat if the cat gives the mouse $2 a mouse, which the mouse would then use to buy cheese. Of course, this assumes that mice and cats can communicate, that cats have money, and that stores would sell cheese to mice with money. But, hey, it's a hypothetical story.<br />
<br />
5) The mouse could apply to the Purinia-mouse-chow beta program and get free mouse chow while waiting years and years for Purinia to perfect their mouse chow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is irrelevant for one big reason:<br />
<br />
Everquest players pay for the cheese.  Add up three years of subscriptions and all expansions for two accounts and tell me what number you come up with.  Sony owes me something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sumdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Not a good comparison at all. First off, we pay for our cheese, and if I don't recieve enough cheese, eventually I'll find a different dairy product. <br />
