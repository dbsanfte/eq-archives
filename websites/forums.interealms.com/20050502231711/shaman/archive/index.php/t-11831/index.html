<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got this from another EQ message board, I thought it was pretty funny.<br />
<br />
US: Ok, putting together a group for an Iraq raid...who's in? <br />
UK: Of course I'm in. <br />
Turkey: Only if someone makes me new armor. Last Iraq raid I lost money on. <br />
US: *sigh* Ok, I can't make your cultural armor, but I'll help pay for it. How much you need? <br />
Turkey: 100k plat. <br />
US: ***?! Are you smithing the armor out of platinum, ya tard? No frikking way. 30k plat,and that's all I'm offering. <br />
Turkey: Sweet. Ok, I'm in. <br />
Spain: I frikking hate Iraq. They were spawn campin us for frikking EVER, man -- long time ago, but we're still pissed off about it. Meet you at Turkish zone line. <br />
US: Cool, thx. <br />
Italy: Me 2. <br />
Chile: I'm in. <br />
US: Ok, so far, got US, UK, Turks, Spain, Italy, Chile. <br />
Bulgaria: Umm, got room for some lowbies? Thought maybe we could leech some raid xp ... <br />
US: Yeah, sure. Why not. Just don't attack anything. Make sure to set up a /assist US hotkey, ok? <br />
France: Hey all, what's up? <br />
US: Putting together a raid, hitting Iraq. <br />
France: No frikking way, dood. Look, I'm part of Alliance leadership, and I say no way do we go inthere. I'm using Alliance veto. <br />
US: ***? Alliance Veto? <br />
France: Yeah, it's in the guild charter. Me, Germany, <br />
US, Russia, and China can all cancel any guild raid event. <br />
Bulgaria: Hey, me and the other Eastern Europeans wanna go ... <br />
France: ****, n00b. Your guild got no say in this. <br />
Bulgaria: ,,!,, <br />
Germany: I don't really want to go either. <br />
US: ... <br />
France: Yeah, we veto. No guildies go to Iraq. <br />
US: What about you, Russia. <br />
Russia: Well, if everyone else goes, it's ok, but if France and Germany say no, then that's cool. <br />
US: Jeebus. Dood, show some balls. You used to lovegoing on raids. <br />
Russia: Yeah, but that Afghanistan raid a while back was a disaster. Total group wipe-out. <br />
US: Yeah, but you were in different alliance, man. This is different. Besides, we pwn3d last time wewent on Iraq raid. <br />
France: Doesn't matter. I say no. <br />
Spain: .tell US doesn't matter if France doesn't go anyway, he just feigns death anytime he sees combat. He's a bu77munch. Lives next door to me. <br />
Spain: Oops. MT. <br />
France: Oh yeah? Well you skipped that WWII raidcompletely. <br />
Spain: Only cuz I'd just come back from dueling, was too tired to raid. Besides, you died in first wave, spent the rest of the raid licking dirt and whining. <br />
France: ..!.. <br />
US: Guys, c'mon. I'm trying to put this thing together, here... look, I don't care what France says. I'm going, and anyone who wants to come with me can. China, you in? <br />
China: *shrug* Don't feel like it. <br />
US: Ok... <br />
North Korea has challenged you to a duel! Type /duel <br />
accept to accept or /duel decline to decline the challenge. <br />
US: /duel decline <br />
North Korea tells you: &quot;Dood u r teh suq. I will r0xxorz u&quot; <br />
You tell North Korea: No thanks, guy. Trying to get a raid going. <br />
North Korea tells you: &quot;Ur just scaerd of teh pwnage&quot; <br />
You tell North Korea: Riiiigh. ****, okay? I'm busy. <br />
North Korea taunts you. <br />
/ignore North Korea. <br />
US: How come you're not coming, Germany? <br />
Germany: I'm just not into the violence anymore. <br />
You tell Germany: Bullsh1t, you're just waiting for us to go into Iraq so you can gank France again. <br />
Germany tells you: Ooops. *blush* busted!! <br />
You tell Germany: Dude, why bother? He's green to you. <br />
Germany tells you: It's just satisfying, I guess. It shuts him up for a while, anyway. <br />
France: I'm telling you, if anyone goes, then it'll break the Alliance. <br />
Spain tells you: Whoop-de-sh1t, this Alliance sucks. Let's go anyways. <br />
US: France, *** is ur problem? <br />
France: I want to send scouts in first. Let them seeif any named are up. <br />
US: Ok, how long it gonna take them? <br />
France: Couple weeks, maybe. Months, possibly. <br />
US: MONTHS? ***???! Dude, I don't want to wait that long. I'll give your scouts a week, at most. We'll reschedule then. <br />
France: I may veto anyway. <br />
US: Yeah, whatever. <br />
/tell Spain Yeah, may have to. He's a dipsh1t. <br />
Bulgaria tells you: If you go, let me know. Me and my lowbie buddies are in. <br />
You tell Bulgaria: Cool, thx. Are you someone's alt? <br />
Bulgaria tells you: Some of us were Russia's buff toons, but we're soloing now. <br />
US: Ok, meet again next week. We'll take things from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Already been posted, twice i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>chug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">!!!<br />
<br />
needed that, thanks much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That was enjoyable :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OMG that was great. I shared that with everyone in the office. They loved it and they don't even play EQ, too funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kargen Krimsonwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I know this is supposed to be fun, comparing EQ to War isnt funny. War is a devistating thing and should only be used when the threat is extreme. As for me, I plan on joining the military to serve my country, to protect the rights and freedoms that we have been given. Many fear of a large scale attack on the U.S. and I for one will not hide from it and pretend it isnt there. I will risk my life for my country and will be willing to die to protect the freedoms of my family, my friends, and you all. If France and Germany dont want to go to war with us, then they should respect that we arent only protecting ourselves, but them also. The threat of attack from Iraq could happen to anyone and we refuse to live in fear.</div></div><hr />

I hate scrolling down to read what I was going to post...  Darn you litgruv...<br />
<br />
ahh well, /fluff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Based on my experience of EQ it would be more like:<br />
<br />
Iran says: 'Camp check pls'.<br />
USA says: 'Iraq camp taken'<br />
Hans Blix says: 'looking for weapons of mass destruction drops'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Last site i saw this one turned into a big debate on whether this is appropiate. Hopefully that doesnt happen here. This isnt war and no one is getting hurt its a joke. Topic is labled quite clearly dont find it funny dont read it. <br />
<br />
      Now lol ive read that before and still got a kick out of rereading it.</div></div><hr />
