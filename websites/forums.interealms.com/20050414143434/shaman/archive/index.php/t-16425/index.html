<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically a few days ago i started to notice that browsing interent extra my refresh rate has gone to ****. By that i mean when scrolling down web pages it takes time to refresh the next area of the webpage so its all jump (inc on message boards). Also while typing the buffer seems to have gone to ****, i can type about 6 words and not see anything on the screen for a few seconds which is annoying. <br />
<br />
Anyone got an idea whats going on? (tried boot disk)<br />
<br />
PS I know jack**** about PCs so make it as simple as possible. Runnig 98SE, 700 AMD Duron, 320mb RAM, Geforce 2.</div></div><hr />

Here's the basic process with Windows to work through it.<br />
<br />
1. &gt;windows update (http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/): make sure your computer has all the security patches, critical updates, and service packs installed. The recent rpc worms that hit MS rpc venerabilties will make your workstation freak and run really slow.<br />
<br />
2. &gt;control panel &gt; add / remove programs : go through here and uninstall anything you dont need.<br />
<br />
3. &gt;start &gt; run &gt; msconfig: from here you can go to the startup tab and see most every single program that is starting up in your computer. Work you way through all of them and turn off things that you know you dont need.<br />
<br />
4. &gt;start &gt; programs &gt; accessories &gt; system tools &gt; disk cleanup : use this to clear out various temp files that windows is constantly looking at when opening programs and windows.<br />
<br />
5. &gt;virus scanning: make sure your virus software is up to date and that you've done a recent scan. Its normally not the cause for this sort of thing, but is listed here as a good idea.<br />
<br />
6. &gt;disk work: if you are still having issues after all of this then try giving your disks a scrubbin. Hit up &gt;start&gt;programs&gt;accessories&gt;system tools&gt;disk defragmenter. Analyze your disks and see if you need a defragmentation. Fragmentation is when you have one file broken up into pieces and spread on your hard drive. The optimal hard drive has all of its files all next to each other with no fragmentation. Fragmentation of the right files can cause some ardous loading times and hangs.<br />
<br />
7. &gt;control panel &gt; display: turn off active desktop. Sometimes you can consume a lot of ram with the right pictures or html that you can embed with active desktop (aka web content enabled on your desktop). Turn that off if you want to free up some more ram.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Thats most of the big stuff, if you are still lookin slow after this then you need to reinstall windows or upgrade your computer. Have fun.</div></div><hr />
