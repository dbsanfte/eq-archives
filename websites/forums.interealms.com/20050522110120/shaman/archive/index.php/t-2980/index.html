<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a Cazic troll and want to go to CS to get some baking supplies and maybe do a quest or two. Do I need to do any faction work before entering the zone, and if so, how much? I know I need to kill some ulthorks to get faction up. Will messing up ulthork faction be a bad thing?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you shouldn't need any faction work.<br />
<br />
in cobalt scar there are 2 factions. <br />
<br />
1. CoV- this is wyverns. they are 45-48 and are annoying. they are by the port in so you should port in invisibly. the druid/wiz port is on the top of the cliff (the entire zone is a cliff with shore at the bottom).<br />
<br />
2. Othmir - this is the opposite of ulthork faction. i'm 90% sure they will sell/talk to you at first until you start murdering their little otter families, which i find so much fun to do. they live below the cliff on the shoreline. most of them will usually be dead, but the ones you want to buy from should be at the farthest camp to your right when you zone in. there are no wyverns or otherwise kos mobs by these othmir camps<br />
<br />
when you zone in you should have invis and lev on. run ahead and to the right a bit, you'll run right off the cliff, and float down to the shore. then you'll see little otter dudes. proceede to buy whatever you need.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you REALLY wanna be safe you can work your cov faction to dubious in the arena in kael, but it's really not worth the time unless you want to start hunting wyverns or are farming in hot at some point.<br />
<br />
hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">People sometimes pull or train drakes or wyverns over the portal area, and if a drake spell hits you, it becomes KOS to you, so definitely get invis before going and then hustle outta there straight ahead, watching for wyverns(and don't fall over the cliff! :) there's a ramp if you head right).</div></div><hr />
