<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I now seem to be a cleric who can cast sow.  Is anybody else running into this same problem?<br />
<br />
I'm getting to the point where I will not join a group unless it has a cleric.  Shaman healing spells are not as mana efficient as clerics I wouldn't think and there are so many more things I can do.  I can debuff and slow the mobs.  Buff and speed up our tanks.<br />
<br />
Please tell me at later levels, I'm only 31 right now, that players will get the hint that we are more than clerics who can cast sow.  I seem to be at that level where it is tough to solo and I am not twinked with massive armor class.  My defense is maxed for my level fortunatly.   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes and no. People still say things like &quot;we can take on such-and-such MOB now that we have a healer [my Shaman] in the group&quot;. In a small experience group, it gets easier later due to much improved slow and regeneration spells. Actually, Clerics can get pretty bored in small experience groups when there's a Shaman present. But you can't keep a Warrior alive against a hard-hitting MOB.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend that in a normal group (i.e., you're not fear kiting or something) of more than 3 characters, you make it clear that you will need someone else who can heal. It might just be a Paladin saving their mana for between fights, but at least it's something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At lower levels shaman and druids can keep up with the healing power of a cleric, at level 34 and 39 clerics get Celestial Healing and Complete Healing, you'll start to see them moving away in terms of healing ability.<br />
<br />
There will be certain places where you can do without a cleric throughout your shaman career but in order to push their abilities a wise group will find a cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get use to it.<br />
<br />
In the 30's the tanks don't have that many hit points and you should always keep the heal spell memed for the most part.  You are a back up healer for when things get critical.  But when you turned 29 and got the 300pt heal you are not healing quite as good as a cleric but your a very close backup.<br />
<br />
Expect that you will be healing from now till you hit 39 when you get the next slow.  Then you will be slowing and healing at the same time when you don't have a cleric around.  It gets better when you don't have an enchanter around to mezz and you have to do that too... Just remember it does get better and everyone knows that we aren't the main healers, we are only a stop gap from things getting completely out of control.<br />
<br />
Just remember due to this fact that we can do a lot of things, it does make us wanted in a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should feel extremely lucky that shaman are now wanted in groups prior 34.<br />
<br />
I soloed from 24-34 simply because my healing sucked, and my slow sucked.  The clerics out distance us by a land slide healing, and grouping was impossible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Umm, as far as a group is concerned, at L 31 you ARE a cleric with SoW... and quickness, too, if they don't have an enchanter, but no rez and weak hp buffs. <br />
<br />
At L 31 by far the best things you bring to a group are your buffs and your heals. Your damage output hasn't changed since L 24, except for your melee getting even worse.  A cleric your level is using Greater Heal, same as you are, with perhaps a tiny bonus for being a cleric? If you don't like solo'ing (which isn't easy for an untwinked L 31 shaman), then grouping is the way to go. And what you're going to do in those groups is heal. That's just the way it is. What else are you going to do? Use the L 24 dot on a mob that's going to die in under 30 seconds in a big group? Use an inefficient L 24 nuke? Use 110 mana slowing a mob so that it does 45% less damage - which would take less mana to heal? <br />
<br />
A lot of what a shaman can do at L 31 just isn't that good for a group. SoW, Regen, Quickness, and GREATER HEALING are. So use them. No, it's not fun to play the cleric role as a shaman. If that's what you wanted to do you'd be a cleric. But there are stages in your shaman development where it's the most efficient thing you can do, and you're smack dab in the middle of the biggest one. <br />

The healing abilities Sub 50 for shamans were never in question. This fix had no baring on sub 50 crowds. <br />

I know I am talking about high level groups, but the bottom line is more DPS means less healing :D  I felt the same way when i was xp'ing in OT from lvl 30  and up.  The faster you kill mobs the less they can hit back ;)  So instead of a cleric, put a rogue or even another hybrid healer wit dmg output in the clerics place.<br />

<br />
i always make it clear in exp groups (after 39) that i am a shaman, not a healer; if i have to be the primary healer downtime goes WAY up because well i can't CH or even SH. i also refuse to join a group when the /ooc is &quot;group looking for sower&quot;, if a group can't tell the difference between a druid, shaman, ranger, and BL, they don't deserve any of the four.<br />
<br />
but, by far the best way i have discovered to avoid being misused is to NOT BE in the &quot;top 40&quot; of exp zones (loio, overthere, DL, KC). people with enough sense to be in one of the other hundred zones usually also appreciate each class for what they can do. You do find some unconventional group roles this way as it is often difficult to find exactly the class you need, but it's more fun being a healer-rooter-tank in katta or guk because there's no cleric around than it is to be a healer/buff whore in dreadlands because some idiot thinks &quot;all priest classes are the same&quot;.</div></div><hr />

He can easily keep a level 60 warrior, 2 rogue, wizard,  and enchanter healed without any mana problems.  I wouldn't think of doing the same.  <br />

Shamans are now by far, the most inferior healers at the high levels.  And I'm not too concerned about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have found healing in the 40's an exercise in frustration.  It seems whenever i get a tell for a group nowadays it is because their cleric has just logged and they want a healer.<br />
<br />
Greater heal just doesn't cut it in KC.  I'm sure it will get better when I hit 51 but until that I'm asking if they have a cleric in the group.  I get more xp soloing giants in FV or even Oowomp and Gornit than I do in a group where I'm expected to be main healer.<br />
240 mana to slow(malise &amp; 1 togor) plus add chain casting GH and then trying to canni between pulls I find incredibly frustrating.  That's not counting the times I get resists on malise and say F it I'll just heal then.  I assume resists are just the nature of the shaman class though.<br />
<br />
I know the majority of you are in the 50+ game but how did you respond when you got asked to a group as a main healer in the 40's?  I'm not saying it can't be done.  I've done it.  I just find it inefficient and I could get much better xp duoing with a druid friend hate kiting or even soloing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hehe. Back in the day pre-kunark, it was not uncommon for the hard camps at the time to just have a shaman or shaman and druid or two shaman in them as the only healers. And yes, that was with greater heal as their best heal. I was frequently the only healer in groups even up through level 45. It sure wasn't easy, but you should fill the role that is best suited for you at the time. After you get a few more levels under your belt, it wont be quite such a strain on your mana, and you can feel more comfortable doing other things as well. Good luck.</div></div><hr />

One of the reasons I love being a shaman is my flexibility.  Need healing?  I can heal.  Need slowing?  I can slow.  Need damage?  I got some of that too.  <br />
<br />
You won't always have a textbook &quot;perfect&quot; group with a cleric, chanter, warrior, etc.   If you refuse to join any group that needs you to heal you really are limiting yourself.  This is especially true at your level where your ability to heal rivals any other class.  Get used to being asked, expected... required to fill many roles in a group.   Often that role is as a healer.   :)<br />

True.. the changes may help them more.. it doesnt make them a better healer then us(assuming you have torpor). Im 100% confident of keeping an entire 6 man group healed in sebilis at any camp, up to and including shroom king(done this.. it wasnt really a challenge either). Noone died, or came close. This was in addition to keeping group focus/sta/agi on the group.. malo/slowing all mobs etc. <br />
<br />
Saying a 60th druid can keep a group healed in sebilis isnt really saying much.. its sebilis.. it was challenging at 50.. it isnt challenging at all for a 55+ group =p</div></div><hr />

You'd try that with just chloroblast? Even with healing gift/adept (which most shamans don't get, but obviously from your sig, you did), I don't think a shaman could effectively be the only healer in ANY sebilis camp (except maybe the zone in), without serious mitigating circumstances...like an epic SK as MT (for the lifetaps), a necro with zefveer's, or something like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had no problem doing that even at lvl 56 or so... just keep regrowth up for everyone, slow the mobs, and heal as necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't understand how all of you are able to effectively keep healed an entire group. My problem is that generally the bigger the group (and therefore the greater the damage output), the less efficient Turgur's Insects is as MOBs are dying in under 30 seconds. Just to regain the mana from slow and root takes almost the entire fight, and what is left goes to Regrowth, Celerity (on multiple melees!), and the host of other buffs that are needed. Not to mention the huge amount of mana, hit points, and med time that I lose to crowd control. There's really no mana left over for heals, unless people want to sit and watch me med between fights.<br />
<br />
In a full group with 2+ melees, I want one of the members to be a Cleric.</div></div><hr />

It kind of all depends on who you are, what you have, and what you're trying to kill.<br />

Not that I would dissaude anyone from grouping enchanters and clerics, because they make the tougher camps possible. Sitting at the zone-in ganking frogs is only fun for so long :)</div></div><hr />

Yes, I would be confident healing an entire group in sebilis at any camp except king or juggs.  With no outside mana regen (c2/kei, potg, bardsong).  With any melee class (ranger, war, sk, monk etc) tanking.  Using just chloroblast.  I use chloroblast almost exclusively to heal exp groups, which is why I got one level of healing gift.  It's pretty fun.  In the sig, that's a crit Superior Heal.  <br />
<br />
Sebilis is easy.  Granted, I am not talking level 51 and 52 people in my group.  I am used to grouping with only 55+.  I have duo'd/trio'd about every camp in seb (except juggs/king) with myself as main healer.  You hardly have to heal at all if you keep up regen and slow the mobs.  Especially with a monk tanking, they can just mend and kill stuff while you pull.</div></div><hr />

The last group I had in Sebilis was a 3 person group, Rogue (me), Wizard and Druid.  Had we replaced the druid with a shaman, I'm sure we could have pulled more then just all of guard and upper zone out and the 2 hallways.  <br />

Do shamans suck? HELL NO. I always get one in my party because i enjoy the slows they help with healing and meleles love ya buffs no reason for u not to be in a party as a BACKUP HEALER. IF no clerics are around i would not trust to have a shaman healing me if i was a tank in KC or a dungeon where trains are nasty. DL may be ok for that.<br />
<br />
My point is the shaman as well as the druis is and always will be a BACKUP healer. The healing penalty was removed to help you solo and be a better backup healer but u are still a BACKUP healer. U can keep a grp alive under certain circumstances in certain zones but u are no cleric. You are a great to have in a party and i respect shamans for their abilities.<br />

Before the flames begin this refers to those on this board that say they can replace a cleric no problem and that no clerics are needed except CT well we are needed in many many other zones and the one post back there with the quotes from the cleric boards sayign how ppl are gonna stop playign their clerics cause of that.

Ahem, Back in the day when I was 55-59 and hunting often in Sebilis with groups, I was only healer a few times.  It worked, it was very stressful, but it worked.  I had a fungi at 56 tho, so that was helping things.  This was almost two years ago keep in mind.  <br />
My USUAL group setup for healing was me and a druid.  No cleric, no enchanter.  I'd just have to make do with the added druid heals and hope the weakly equipped monk didn't pull too many mobs that I couldn't slow in time to keep myself from having to heal the weakly equipped melees overmuch as to cause downtime.  <br />

Two things:<br />
<br />
A) Clerics get 96% rezz, 90% is for the pre-56 crowd and in a dungeon like Sebilis - ie, a very social environment - you're a certain kind of somebody to charge like that if you're not busy. People will remember that when your tank goes down because you fell asleep of boredom/were making a new high score in gems and need your corpse dragged/summoned out.<br />
<br />
B) Paladins can rezz with 6% less efficiency which unless you're in a hell level is nothing. Also, I can't think of a single Paladin I know who charges for their rezz. It's a service and just a part of our abilities. So no, you don't 'need' a Cleric for rezzes. <br />
<br />
And hey, that Shaman they took instead of the embittered low-level Cleric with a 90% rezz was an efficient healer because of their slows, debuffs and mana regen abilities. Not to mention they actually contributed viable damage.<br />
<br />
Before you go posting to a Class webboard flaunting your ignorance at least do some basic research. If you do have a 96% rezz it's pretty disturbing you're that ignorant of what another class can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please tell me what I'm doing wrong. I am a Level 58 Shaman. Let's imagine that my group also includes a Monk, Warrior, Rogue, Magician, and Necromancer (I don't normally play with a Rogue, but I threw them in to replace the Cleric). I keep Regrowth on myself, the main tank, and the Necromancer. I give Celerity to the Monk, Warrior, and Rogue. I cast Turgur's Insects and Root on everything that we fight. We're killing a MOB every 30-45 seconds. For argument's sake, we get an add every 5 minutes, which takes off 400 hit points from me and requires two Roots before it's under control.<br />
<br />
Where do I possibly find the mana to cast Chloroblast? I didn't even factor in time for refreshing buffs, so I'll just assume that everyone takes a bathroom break every 75 minutes and I just go in the bucket under my desk so I can continue to cannidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I have solod several seb camps, and duod more of them.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't dream of trying it without torpor. Chloroblast just SUCKS. I suppose with a very slow pull rate at Guard or the Ikkie jail, it is feasible, but at Disco or Chef, I wouldn't even consider it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Dia Shan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Only time ive any heal but Torpor memmed, is when I am raiding and chain casting Cblast on the MT.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would have liked the 10% healing penalty lifted long ago, when i would have found it more usefull in exp pickup groups.<br />
<br />
The beauty of our class is that we can fill many roles, the 10% more heal makes us fill the role of a healer more efficiantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">House, you asked and I will answer.  Taking your hypothetical group: 58 shaman, necro, warrior, rogue, mage, and monk.<br />
<br />
First, you need to buy a copy of group regrowth.  That's the easy part since I saw like 4 copies for sale in bazaar for under 2k last I looked.  This way you can cast the spell once for 600 mana and be done with casting it for 20 minutes.  It is the most efficient healing spell shamans get and it is imperative that you mem it.  <br />
<br />
Second, use the necromancer's dark abilities to their very flexible maximum.  Your group regrowth hits him, saving him mana, therefore he should save you mana by contributing with the healing.  Even low 50's necros have heal over time spells they can break out that are actually quite efficient mana wise, and their lifetaps counteract the damage the heals do to the necromancer . . . not to mention the dot lifetaps they possess.  <br />
A necromancer is a very decent backup healer whose damage dealing capacity is only slightly lessened by this role.  <br />
<br />
Third, be sure to slow the mobs as soon as they get to camp.  Follow up with a fast root on the mob.  Warn the melees (read: rogue) that the mob will be rooted so maintain max distance for melee if not the MA.  <br />
<br />
Fourth, don't epic dot anything in such a group.  It's a waste of time that could be used in meditation or cannidancing.  <br />
<br />
Fifth, get a fungi or iksar regen bp and wear it.  I'm sorry if you're poor, but hunting in a place like seb will fix your poverty at least to the point of being able to afford a iksar bp.  <br />
<br />
Sixth, stay on top of things and wear ac gear to minimize hps lost thru mob aggro.  Keep your wis pool over 150 and you should be fine otherwise.  <br />
<br />
Seventh, establish a &quot;lower limit&quot; for your mana pool beyond which you need to call a med break.  For me this limit is 30%, since an overpull with complications at that level might be enuf to get someone killed.  I strive to keep my mana above 60% tho, and for the most part this has served to maximize my mana regen capacities.  <br />
<br />
That's only SOME of the things you can do to make it as the only healer in such a group.  Given time, thought, and imagination you should be able to think of many more.  <br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">It's not your job to do everything. If people want you to do everything you try and do the best you can. When you run out of mana you stop and they can wait. They don't like it... they can get someone to replace you.<br />
<br />
And the problem with that group is definately the Necro. Necros are MACHINES. A lot of the time I'd rather have a Necro healing than a Cleric because when they do it they help kill stuff.<br />
<br />
I remember joining a group once, noticing they had no healer and saying &quot;Errr... so I'm main healer then?&quot; to which the Necro replied &quot;We haven't had a healer for the last 5 hours. I just want you for the regen.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Ok, Landragoran, thanks for all your suggestions. I realize what my problem is, which is that I've never bought or traded for any gear or spells, and don't plan to (I know it's stupid, but that's just the way I play), and therefore I'm way behind where other Shaman are at my level. My AC is as good as I've been able to get it (870 unbuffed), my Wisdom is 118, and I don't have epic, JBB, any hp/mana regen items, or Group Regrowth (I've been trying for a while to convince people to go to the zone where it drops).<br />
<br />
The only things I don't understand are your suggestions that the Necromancer play backup healer and that I occasionally call med breaks. Those things are obvious but I thought the point was that I should be able to be the sole healer with no med breaks necessary. If the group ever has to stop killing things (other than after extraordinary circumstances like a large number of adds) then my feeling is that something is wrong with the makeup of the group.<br />
<br />
Sorry to sound whiny, as I'm sure what you suggested works for you. It's just that every time I'm put in the position of being the only healer for a 6-person group, while also having to slow, haste, buff, and handle crowd control (probably the biggest drain of them all, due to the lost HPs), I very quickly run out of mana unless I continuously make everyone take med breaks. Oh yeah, and often I'm the only snarer in the group as well, so that's a whole med/cannidance tick I'm losing with every MOB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">118 wis is pretty low for doing that much stuff, but Land has some good suggestions.  At 118 wis you only have like 1400 straight mana.  I can understand why you might have some trouble.  The last thing I thought I would be saying was to think of maybe camping yourself a few items to increase your mana pool a bit.   First thing I would do is take your group to traks teeth and do the forager cycle and nab yourself an iksar cp.  I can understand your playstyle.  I think many of us would be happy to give suggestions for camps you can do to help yourself, rather than buying if that is your preference.  :)<br />
<br />
For the time being, utilize the talents of your groupmates!  Speak with your necro, have them help you on backup heals.   Make that necro do some crowd control, they have mez!   Necros and rogues can snare!  There's no shame in occassional med breaks.  While mobs are being pulled, ask the monk to bandage you while you canni.   Take advantage of your necro friend, they really are fantastic class when played well, much like shaman and bards.<br />
<br />
There is no shame in asking for help improving your gear either.  If you and your friends can all do it together, then it helps all of you!  You with spells and more mana helps them do more.<br />
<br />
I don't think you are being whiny, your situation just isnt necessarily comparable to the &quot;average&quot; shaman.  Good luck to you House.  If you can't do it all, then know how to utilize your friends and groupmates skills to complement your strengths and weaknesses.  I don't think your issue has a lot to do with the healing penalty being removed, it seems that new feature could only be a boon to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hmm yah I didn't realize you played under such strict and self imposed limits.   Your gear obviously sucks.  Your spell selection must too.  You're not hunting in the right places to make your theory work for you, and you lack the tools anyway.  118 wis is far too low for your level.  Your fizzle rate must be absurd, and the mana pool is too small to withstand any sort of crunch.  <br />
<br />
I'd say make some friends really fast who care about hunting equipment and spells and make that a priority or you're gonna find yourself as the gimpiest lvl 60 shaman the server has ever known!  But perhaps I'm being overbearing, it's your right to play whatever way you choose.  <br />
GL on however you decide to go about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Thanks for the encouragement, Henora. I know it probably sounded as though I was frustrated with the game, when actually my Shaman just gets more and more enjoyable (with crowd control easily being my favorite aspect of the class). I've been trying to religiously follow the advice that I'd seen repeated before on this board (and which made sense to me): get to Level 60 and then worry about everything else. Perhaps this has been the wrong approach. I was fortunate enough to loot Cannibalize III a while back while hunting in Skyfire, and I'm hoping it, Turgur's, Regrowth, and Root will get me to Level 60 all on their own :-) Only eight more yellow bubbles to go, and then it's time to drop every plat I've ever made into Alchemy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">House - get a friend with Tracking to go to Trakanon's Teeth with you and do the Forager cycle until you get Crusader Zoglic. He drops the Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate. It should be easily doable even with your below average gear and low wisdom. The +5 HP/Tick will be of great assistance to you, and this way you can get it within the limitations you have placed on yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">In the 30's the tanks don't have that many hit points and you should always keep the heal spell memed for the most part.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">You'd try that with just chloroblast? Even with healing gift/adept (which most shamans don't get, but obviously from your sig, you did), I don't think a shaman could effectively be the only healer in ANY sebilis camp (except maybe the zone in), without serious mitigating circumstances...like an epic SK as MT (for the lifetaps), a necro with zefveer's, or something like that.<br />
<br />
I am perfectly comfortable being main healer in any OS camp (barring King/reets/jugs) with a guild group of 60s.  My favorite camp is the disco area, just sit under the red ball and pull everything.  <br />
<br />
On my birthday last week, I played all day and had a group that randomly rotated guildies in and out all day, we never had an enchanter and had a cleric only briefly.  Any guildie that needed a group was welcome.  At one point, we had two necros, 2 rogues a warrior and me, no one ever really NEEDED a heal, stuff just died too quickly.  No one died, all day, no one even came CLOSE to dying.   It was mindless, fast paced, extremely fun ghetto group experience and I had a blast.<br />
<br />
I find OS a welcome break from tough dungeons like CT (where I would feel very uncomfortable without a cleric).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">CT is much faster exp, but deadly and people need to be on the ball in a serious way.  Like Glori said, OS is relaxing almost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Originally posted by Gardeltron <br />
Shamans are now by far, the most inferior healers at the high levels.  And I'm not too concerned about it. <br />
<br />
Nonono,<br />
<br />
Unless a situation calls for CH, imho shammies are the best healers bar none at 60.  I've (all too) frequently ended up being primary healer for a full group in planar zones and ST whilst also still fullfilling my buff/debuff roles.<br />
<br />
Torpor is amazingly efficient so we always have that to fall back on (I avoid torporing the melees unless I'm running out of mana), not to mention we can get mana back far far faster than druids/clerics could hope to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">also, as you group with higher level people, you'll notice it very much how gear, levels and axp affects the damage you take. my lil guild of friends has been doing juggs lately with a group for example, where it's either a 5k hp warrior or 4k hp monk tanking. both have 1400+ ac and 60+ axp points. just the other day we had a semi-wipe (cleric died and had to drag a new one down), so the warrior, a ranger, bard, and my rogue killed a jugg and two reets without healing at all.<br />
<br />
so when you're in NG or disco, people with this kind of equipment barely take damage, and some mobs die so fast that it's pointless to slow/root them. anything below a krup isn't worth it at all, maybe boks in your case. you said yourself some mobs die in 30 seconds :) bards can also slow a bit, as well as providing insane regen.<br />
<br />
my advice is to get higher level tanks/players with better equipment in your group....it'll show. and get some dps in the form of rogues, they really shine in sebilis. and if you're lacking some spells / equipment don't be afraid to bring a second shaman or druid, if you can't find that cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that one mistake many shamans make is trying to do it all. And when they are the healer for the group they STILL try to do it all. The main tip I'd give you for that group is to let the necro do more. Necros can do way more than just dish out damage in an exp group. As already mentioned, they can help significantly with healing, especially if you're already slowing and casting regen. Also, they can mez. It's called Screaming Terror, and they get it sometime in the L 29-34 range. It's a three tick mez, which is all that a bard's mez lasts for, and a bard can mez just fine in Sebilis. If you've only got an occasional add that needs to be controlled, your puller is doing very well and a necro worth his salt should be able to handle that much CC while still asleep. ;) <br />
<br />
Most of the rest of that group doesn't have a lot in the way of abilities to help with healing or CC, but the pets could even be used to tank slowed mobs if needed (and they wouldn't need healing unless they had to do it multiple pulls in a row). With the DPS that group would have, mobs wouldn't last long. <br />
<br />
Also... why are you casting root on every mob you fight? If the warrior can't hold aggro, then either he needs to taunt better or your other groupmembers need to learn to control their own aggro better. Root simply should not be needed for aggro control. If it's to stop runners, that's another job the necro should be doing. He has darkness dot's with snare, and he can prevent runners better than you can. What's the root for? <br />
<br />
As has been said, you're severely limited in what you can do by your self-imposed restrictions. But if you're going to play that way, you need to make some effort to get the things you need. You can get an iksar regen bp by camping it (with a tracker's help). You can get a lot of gear that'll raise your wisdom higher than 118 in solo camps, if that's what you want to do. <br />
