<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting, not that i think ill get to see them much, since its impossible to raid with spell effects turned on, atleast on my system.<br />
<br />
They would be nifty for small groups and solo situations though.<br />
<br />
When i take screenshots for guild wepage updates i usually do so with full effects wich can be quite an experience sometimes and i have come to the following conclusion:<br />
<br />
Spell effects are like drugs, everything seems to go in slow motion, its colors everywhere and if youre not careful you might black-out. They are very enticing in the beginning but after awhile you realise its bad for you and you quit using them...<br />
<br />
Yesterday when i took screenshots of Cursed Cycle in Ssra i crashed due to spell-effect induced lag. When i came back on they had slain Cursed and just split the loot... :(<br />
<br />
Now if they could fix my 2hb animation instead... i did not learn to survive on the tundra by trying to STAB bears with a hammer.</div></div><hr />

Look closer.  Not only do you try to stab, but you never actually connect either.  My wife still laughs at the fights we have.  Bunch of people standing around one poor sucker mob swinging weapons at it, but no weapons ever visually touch the mob.<br />
<br />
It's a 3D game that has to tell me about my hits and misses because the engine is incapable of accurately showing it.  One day we'll get there... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Those seem pretty neat. I like the roots and invoke lightning. It would be nice if canni was changed. Just sick of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm just happy now that lightning spells would actually LOOK like bolts of lightning, rather than a bunch of red sparks.<br />
<br />
You'd think it'd take them sooner than 5 years to come up with good spell animations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow, cool, more spell effects that no one will ever see because the graphics already bog down like a Ferrari in three feet of water.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Unless there is a totally new graphics engine with these and not just new effects nobody is really going to care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I really dont know why they change them, as most people have them turned off anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And shouldnt the resist fire, put an aura of cold around you?  Putting fire around you, would seem like an opposite effect.</div></div><hr />

You do know they've announced they're working on a totally new graphics engine, right? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So it looks like they ripped off DAoC and Planetside ... copy-cats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Was anybody else amused by the screenshot of the druid casting superior camoflague?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if they actually wrote particle effects that didn't lag me down, and could be toned down so I could see through them, I'd be all for these.<br />
<br />
Maybe we'll get a new engine that can actually handle them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How about they keep their spell effects and give me Bash instead?  no?  ok ill go back to watching frogs bash stuff then =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I probably have a ghetto system with only a athlon 2100+ (overcklocked as far as it'd go), 512mb ram, a geforce 4200ti card. But I can't have particle effects on ever.<br />
<br />
And I can dance around in bazaar with clip plane out at full and all luclin models on. But particle effects just kills me.<br />
<br />
Maybe in the new engine they remove the line &quot;pause random(2000)ms&quot; from the particle effect code?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You do know they've announced they're working on a totally new graphics engine, right? :)<br />
I see the same models and the same textures, and probably the same animations. That doesn't sound like a built-from-the-ground-up graphics engine. You'll forgive me if I'm skeptical about the &quot;new&quot; technology and see it as being &quot;rehashed&quot; instead.</div></div><hr />

Not very subtle is it?  Large, brightly glowing discs circling you..... Hmmm, where did that druid go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm sure canni will still look like troll farts<br />

man you have a vivid imagination :)</div></div><hr />

This spell particle upgrade is not the graphics engine upgrade.  Obviously only time will tell, but the screenshot they had in the computer game magazine they were giving out at the Chicago FF was pretty impressive.  Apparently the main issue is how many of the old zones to convert, and when, since obviously updating the models for every zone in the game would be a massive undertaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oooh, they added more pics, cannabalize is now pictured!  The picture for Frost Strike is incredibly beautiful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">shouldn't the canni animation wrap the shaman in a large bun and then a giant mouth takes a bite of it?  Anyway, nice effects--too bad i always have spell effects off so i can see the action instead of sparkly glitter around the entire screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow, they look spectacular... if they actually go live, and can manage to pull it off so they don't lag me to hell, and as long as they still have an opacity adjustment.... I'll use them for sure.<br />
<br />
Gate looks awesome - like you're stepping through a portal of light :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If you turn it down to about 25% opacity, it isn't that intrusive until some pally runs in front of you and hits the blue beam from outer space.  Then you get to spend the next 10 seconds praying that slow wasn't resisted while your computer laughs at you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I usually group with a SK and their group hp/mana spell makes everyone send out a blue beam of particles that not only clogs the screen with particles but slows FPS down to minimal values.  This was at the lowest still-visible opacity.  Also, I am ALWAYS casting something--usually canni4.  That and the beastlord warder of my other friend makes for an unplayable, but pretty, glitter filled, game.<br />
<br />
The new particles look to be more of the same problem :), but are nice looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Looks nice, won't work. Like a strike in a modelling agency.<br />
<br />
Nice thought however!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Grrrr, I can't see those screenshots since my work blocks casters realm.  Are they available on any other sites? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">One day perhaps you will just turn on spell effects, look at em, say &quot;Purty&quot;, then turn em back off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Haha, actually I'm playing alot of adventures lately so I am able to play with effects on and not get bogged down :)  The only thing that bogs my computer down lately is leaving my bazaar trader up for 2 or 3 days and then trying to play a normal gaming session after that without rebooting, it's scary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">not bad at all, the lightning looks very cool and the root as well. Canni looks .. interesting .. yellow with some floaty bones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I wish there was a client display option that allowed for up to N spell effects... i.e. the first spell effect gets displayed, the second, the third... but if you have it set to 3 spell effects, none of the others do.  This would alleviate the problem I have on raids where we have 50 people casting all at once, but still let me see the spell effects in groups.<br />
<br />
EDIT: ooh, even better - automatic spell effect throttling based on frame rate.  Frame rate gets low, reduce spell effects.  I like that idea a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yeah, cannibalize will create a knee-high copy of you, who them takes a bite off of your... backside and then dissapears into the air.. <br />
<br />
Ah well, just more lag to the game, which will be turned off by most anyway. Imagine in the heat of the fight the wizard use that AoE snare - heck, what a mess.. Next thing it's just that wizard and bunch of LD people...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Now if they'd just fix bearform!  :p<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Bad Glori, steal bandwidth from caster's realm! Do you want even MORE ads from them? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">So it looks like they ripped off DAoC and Planetside ... copy-cats<br />
<br />
Give them a break-- they were one of the MMORPG pioneers (a mud with cool 3D graphics!)-- everyone copied THEM.  Let them do whatever they want :)<br />
<br />
The only thing they copied was a particular MUD type.<br />
<br />
Of course, Ultima Online was one of the very first, but they're totally different beasts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I'd be much more disappointed if they REFUSED to learn anything from DAOC and other games.  <br />
<br />
DAOC took a lot of concepts from EQ, I'm sure.  And both of them read on D&amp;D, which is based on Tolkien, and MUDs, which have various inspirations.<br />
<br />
Everything is a rehash if you look at it closely enough.  You have to look at the sum of all the parts to judge it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">So it looks like they ripped off DAoC and Planetside ... copy-cats<br />
I'm going to guess that was some sort of lame attempt at humor. I really don't see how those spell effects could be preceived as being ripped from DAoC...and I have absolutely no idea how you could claim they were inspired by PlanetSide in any way at all.<br />
<br />
-Tok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I'm just slightly curious about whether, if they did 'rip them off' of PS, Sony are going to sue themselves for content copyright  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
As Grammar and a few others did point out, enough people have copied EQ since it launched, they're always going to do the same if they see something good. I didn't see anyone yelling 'rip off' when they launched a target ring only a month or so after Horizons went public beta  ;) <br />
<br />
Horses for courses, let the masses enjoy. For the most part they'll just be occasional eye candy, but that's no bad thing if you're bored or testing a new graphics card..  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Goto the planetside website and look at the particle effects .. especially lightening .. <br />
<br />
When a pally would cast a buff on you in DAoC your PC would be wrapped in the golden armor effect - <br />
<br />
?? .. no joks here ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I run with them on all the time. its just plain cool. The only time i turn off effects is in a raid.<br />
<br />
Im kinda excited about them.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw to the dude above comment about ripping off Planetside...<br />
<br />
You do know who makes planetside right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I played Planetside, and I STILL don't see how they're ripping off PS...<br />
*shrugs*<br />
Maybe the first PS expansion introduced something after I quit :)</div></div><hr />
