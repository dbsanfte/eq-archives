<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">most people say to do AA points - wait till 60 then go get em -<br />
but at 51, with fairly high end gear, i'm able to solo 1 AA every 7-8 hrs<br />
<br />
my eventual goal is to get Can V, so how do the times to solo AA stack up at 60?  Seems that its easier to do em at 51, since there's much less competition for mobs since there's many, many places with easy mobs blue to 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most people 60 solo or grouped are happy at 1 yellow of AA an hour, so that works out at 5 hours per AA point.  <br />
<br />
AE groups / very good well equiped duo you can half that. And of course the more AA you have your likely to level faster due to improved skills / better at killing the same mobs / developing new tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would suggest that you at least level to 52 and get regrowth.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Solo:<br />
Depending on how hard I work it takes me between 90 minutes and 3 hours for 1 aa points (asuming I have C3)<br />
<br />
PL'ed by my Mage and Chanter:<br />
About 1 hour per AA point but This is more like a stress job then playing a game.<br />
<br />
And as far as a shaman goes VL (or even Sebelis) is a much much beter place to solo then FG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stygiana, what camp do you take in VL?<br />
<br />
Juujuu, how the hell do you go thru an aa point in an hour and a half?  The best spot I've found so far is the dead guards in Katta.  And thats at about 1 yellow an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>fandain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">most say get to 60 first not because of the time needed to get aa, but because lvl 60 &gt; aa skills, after 60 all u have left is aa, so enough time for that, and also for c5 u need to be lvl 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i wonder how anyone can even find enough mobs up in velk's to get any kinds of xp :P that's the good thing about FG...at least on fennin, people respect it when you're camping a patch (except  ae groups), so you don't waste time walking around finding mobs etc. teaming with a melee partner is really nice there.<br />
<br />
btw, 7-8 hours per axp point is damn slow. get 60 asap :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Takes me about 3.5 hrs for a point in FG, no C3, but I do have affliction efficency, extended afflciton, mana preservation, spell haste focus items, FT 10 and a good amount of AA points.  Im not really sure u can do much better in a pure solo. non-powerleveing enviornment, cuz thats non-stop fighting.  Mabye with a few more AA, 5 more FT and C3 u could cut that down to 3 hrs, but thats about it.<br />
<br />
Im really intrigued how some of u can powerlv a point in 1 to 2 hrs, I have access to any number of different chars and would love to know ure secret heh.</div></div><hr />

If I've got to exp, I'd rather do it hardcore in CT for a few hours than solo hardcore for 5 to get the same result.  Sides, in CT I can get some nice lewt possibly in addition to the points.

<br />
Please, for the love of all that is good in this world, do not solo in velks.  It is impossible for groups to get any kind of decent exp in this zone, b/c of all the level 60 melees soloing for AA here.  They take ALL THE FREAKING SPIDERS.  Thanks to the shortage of spiders, lots of bickering and kill-stealing ensues, and the place basically ends up exactly like lake of ill omen (except people die from falling more often).  I know you're saying &quot;just stop going there if it bothers you so much,&quot; and I assure you :  I do not go to velks on purpose.  I usually get shanghai'd by my monk friend :o<br />
<br />
seriously, one of my biggest pet peeves.  Velks would be a really nice zone if it wasnt overcamped by soloers 24/7.<br />
<br />
sorry but i am not too familiar with the benefits of soloing in FG. is it because of the low MR? <br />
<br />
FG is a great place to solo as long as you're fighting small mushrooms.  These things are great to solo because they are pathetic.  They are even more pathetic than velks spiders.  They don't even ATTACK YOU.   All they do is cast on you.  First, they try to slow you.  They stand there and chain cast slow for minutes at a time.  It never sticks, and even if it does, I DONT CARE.   Occasionally they will get their stun spell off, which damages you a little bit.  This is annoying when you screw up and have to fight 4 at once.  They all cast stun at the same time and one of them is sure to land it.  The most annoying thing they do, though, is proc a mushroom-illusion spell (with 200dd and I think stun).  It's really funny the first few times (especially when it happens to your friends), but the novelty wears off after about the 380th time.<br />
<br />
Anyways, mushrooms are good b/c they have absolutely crap for damage output.  The bad part is that they have 8kish HP, which is sort of a lot.  Another good thing about FG is that there are always level 60's of various classes.  Want aego and kei?  you can get it.  Another bad thing about FG is that it is fugging ugly and boring as hell.  When I was 4 blue in to 59, I came here with my shaman and playing my friend's 60sk.  I stayed here for 44 hours straight and finished out 59 to ding 60.  I will never, ever, ever go back to FG.  Ever.  I am so sick of small mushrooms that I can't even eat mushrooms in real life.<br />
<br />
/rant off - it's been a long night :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another great thing if your dou boxing is that you've got basically no wandering mobs to aggro you or your &quot;pet&quot; but still have a pretty good supply of mobs to kill. It's very handy when you want to park an enchanterto log in ever so often and c2 or c3 you for example.</div></div><hr />

CT is an amazing zone, and one of the few exp camps where you actually risk death by something other than an LD or spawn on your puller. However, there we 80 people in CT on Fennin over the weekend, like 15 LFG at the zoneline along with the group pulling the CY. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">But CT can support more people than just about any other zone I've run into. Get this: <br />
<br />
Planks / Sewers: one group<br />
Slime Tunnel / Pools: one group<br />

CY: one group<br />
maze right: one group<br />

TR CY: one group<br />
mud temple: one group<br />
4c corners: one to two groups<br />

The zone is just packed with mobs, and the camps are relatively distinct and divide rather naturally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Man I can't imagine soloing an AA point any faster then 5 hours. It's pretty slow. I think a good group in CT is faster then soloing in FG imo. Maybe I'm doing something wrong heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I solo a lot but I like to farm at the same time too.  Mindless exp grindage is unappealing to me, and I like to be able to loot a decent item every now and then to make my efforts worth my while.<br />
<br />
So I've been soloing in PoM and SS as of late.  All mobs I fight generally have 10-20k hp and hit for 120-165.  Wyverns in SS give me something like 1% aa or less and mobs in PoM something like 1.5% aa (AiW4 + archers = level 55+ mobs).  So if I'm lucky, and I work real hard, I can make an aa in a day.  If I'm more relaxed about it, 2 days.<br />
<br />
Guess I been soloing mobs with too many hp's tho, so my aa could go a little faster.  FG is ok he times I tried.  Shrooms have low mr and low hp, pretty laughable.  Lotuses are fun if you have torpor, and drop pretty good exp too.  Think 3 banes 1 epic and hasted pet, lotus is dead.  But they're also more risky.  Stick to the shrooms for pure exp :D<br />
<br />
But if there's one thing I like about SS and PoM is that I can use my horse, a horse changes our solo capabilities pretty drastically.  Add kei + horse = MACHINE :)  Anyways, if ya wanna use horse, Maidens is pretty cool (those little black alien thingies), Grey is not bad either.  In the Grey, you basically have all the farmers around temple, but plenty of mobs otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kudadan_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The key to soloing in FG is never stop fighting. I don't have epic/jbb/cann5 and I'm still able to keep 3-4 shrooms dying at once. But like someone else said, you have to have the patch all to yourself, and it needs to be one of the larger ones. Solo I can keep any patch in FG clear, except for the one by the pool surrounded by dregs. I pull with turgurs, pox/bane/pet, refresh bane, shroom dies just as pox fades, but that's with extended affliction 3. Like everyone else, that brings in about 1 point every 5 hrs or so. With epic/etc you could probably go a little faster, but you'll be limited by the spawn rate. The upside is it's incredibly easy, the downside is it's incredibly boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Same here Blackdust, only thing &gt; soloing FG is 1group in CT</div></div><hr />

With some other items I think I could cut that time down a bit.<br />
<br />
I solo some of the larger patches in FG and run out of shrooms most of the time.</div></div><hr />

 In VL the best way to solo is not doing spiders, there simply are not enough of them (unless you are with 3-4 players in the zone)<br />
But Village(or upper dogs) and the Pit Dogs are great xp solo.<br />
<br />
Some other very good xp spots: AR, the deep (zone in), Katta, Chardok. All have benefits and all can only support a few solo players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Bah, I make about a point a week, if I'm lucky.  Who wants to log me in while I'm at work and help me get MGB so I quit feeling so guilty about not getting it?<br />

There are so many other good things, ND3, CS3, QB, SCM, SCR!<br />
no time for MGB!!  :D<br />
<br />
I can't seem to get anyone to log me in and PL my AA either.   I make about 1 point a week too.  Have 39, been working on them since January.   In a good CT group 3-4hours per AA.   PoM in a duo was like sucky 6 hours per AA.  I hate soloing but I can do a little more than 1 yellow per hour if I am not being too lazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I want to be strong, Henora...but then stuff happens like our recent AoW fight where we wiped the first time and had 25 minutes to get ready for round 2 and no MGB shaman present....I really wished I had it...<br />
<br />
I was trying to save 6 points for QB2 but after getting a spell haste III item (4.5 sec torpor with SHIII + QB1) I was weak and spent two points into natural durability.  I currently only have 30 points (that 4.5 weeks training in LA really hurt me, when I left we were tied!)<br />
<br />
God, I want so much stuff!  I want QB2, ND 2-3, SCM 1-3, SCR 1-3, SCRM, MGB, CS 1-3, channeling....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Soupy: &quot;But CT can support more people than just about any other zone.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are probably right, really. Great zone by design.<br />
<br />
Soupy:<br />
<br />
Planks / Sewers: one group <br />
Slime Tunnel / Pools: one group <br />
Fish pool: one group <br />
CY: one group <br />
maze right: one group <br />
maze pyramid: one group <br />
LTR: one group <br />
UTR: one uber group <br />
TR CY: one group <br />
mud temple: one group <br />
4c corners: one to two groups <br />
4c temple: one group <br />
<br />
This seems a touch generous. If a second group tried to share 4 corners I'd kill them. TR CY is usually pulled by LTR, and right maze by CY/zone. I've never seen anyone camp just the 4c temple, tho that used to be the camp pre revamp. I'm also not sure how the mud temple breaks down, if it's pulled by nearby camps or not, but I know I've never seen it called in my CT time. I miss pulling :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I found it breaks down to more like this:<br />
<br />
Sewers (planks): one group <br />
Pools: one group <br />
CY/zonein/maze front: one group <br />
maze pyramid: one group<br />
LTR: one group <br />
UTR: one uber group <br />
4c corners: one group<br />
<br />
And even then, UTR is rarely if ever camped.<br />
<br />
In the wee hours, it usually ends up being 6 people in the sewers and 1-2 LFG :)</div></div><hr />

What are you soloing down there? Only thing that seems reasonable for soloing would be the mines but they don't seem easily single pullable.<br />

Give me an AA ability that increases Tugur's Insects to 80%, extends our dots without the need for specific equipment by 10 ticks, they you'll see me exping again like a madman, but otherwise, I'm goofing off till PoP so I can level 70 asap (my own opinion that level limits will be raised and not basing it on hersey or rumor).<br />

I cant see it possible to solo for 1 aa in 1 hour to 90 minutes anywhere. It would require you to have &gt;200 dps, and thats just about impossible, even if you pull mulitple mobs. <br />
<br />
Unless ofcourse the mob are VERY low hp.<br />

We agree in general but not about specifics... really off-topic to be talking about CT camp dividing lines, but oh well. Your version:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sewers (planks): one group <br />
Pools: one group<br />
CY/zonein/maze front: one group <br />
maze pyramid: one group <br />
LTR: one group <br />
UTR: one uber group <br />
4c corners: one group <br />
<br />
<br />
You're missing the pirahna pool outside the pools camp. Silverfang drops a sweet club here.<br />
<br />
Also ... it's a VERY rare group that can do all four corners in 4c PLUS the temple. I don't think I've ever seen it happen on my server, and like 80% of us are level 60. <br />
<br />
Also, any CY / Zone-in group that's touching the maze isn't really being too kind. There are mobs on the ledges above CY and there are mobs on the way to the pools camp. You don't need to touch maze, which can easily support two groups. Lots of named in there too.<br />
<br />
Anyways, as far as CT goes I think that the very best XP is in the tunnel/pools camp. All melee mobs (except for the occasional ritualist) and all slimes. No surprises... fast spawns, lots of mobs. Great xp ... and far less boring than those velks spiders... which hit like greenies in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">theres a exp cap .. so it doesnt matter what you kill .. just how many <br />
<br />
about 100 shrooms = 1 aa (fungus grove)<br />
about 100 spiders = 1 aa (velks)<br />
about 100 snakes  =1 aa (ssra)<br />
about 100 mobs in pog = 1 aa (yard trash west of river)<br />
about 100 lizards in CT = 1 aa (thing about ct is group exp bonus is huge)<br />
<br />
so just look for the mobs with the least hps&amp;dps and SOLO <br />

any way .... back to question .. its about the same Jagara .. but charcter level &gt; aa skill<br />

If i'm really grinding and there's enough spawns open, can get a point in a little under 4 hours solo in FG.  What a pain in the ass though.  Am i the only one that can't tolerate more then an hour of soloing at a time anymore?</div></div><hr />

It's quite possible to get 1 AA pt in an hour in FG.  Each shroom is usually but not always 1% of an AA pt.  It's getting the decent sized shroom camps that's a pain.  I just got MC 2 yesterday and I'm no real rush to get more AA pts since I think they are all a joke really.  Nice yes, absolutley mandatory to have to do our job as a shaman? Not one bit!  Give me an AA ability that increases Tugur's Insects to 80%, extends our dots without the need for specific equipment by 10 ticks, they you'll see me exping again like a madman, but otherwise, I'm goofing off till PoP so I can level 70 asap (my own opinion that level limits will be raised and not basing it on hersey or rumor).<br />

1AA an hour in FG soloing shrooms? I don't think so... You sure you don't mean 1 yellow of AA in an hour?<br />
<br />
I'd have to see that to believe it.<br />
<br />
I can do about an AA in 4 hours there soloing... but one hour? NOT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Having just found this camp (I knew about it but didn't know the Dead Guards gave positive faction hits), anyone know how fast an aa point is garnered by killing the dead guards in Katta?  I seem to get 1% aa every two kills at 90% going to aa. (only a full yellow in 60 atm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">soloing the 2 ddor pop in CT gives approx 1/2 a blue each kill. (a bit less). So 50/60 kills would be an AA there, not 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">There isnt any cap on exp(Atleast not for 60 exp grinding). Have gotten like 2 yellows in one kill at lower levels.<br />
<br />
Anyway, mobs give different exp depending on their level. Their hp usually climbes faster than the exp you get, so best thing is to find low level blues, ie 45. Also have to factor in the zone modifier(ZEM) for the zone.<br />
<br />
Not sure about CT, but do think it has a ZEM. Mobs there are are very high level and not to bad resists. Just about all lizards are level 53 or higher.<br />

Here's the spoiler. Kill the caster snakes at cursed spawn point. Good work. :o0D&lt;~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">if I had as many shrooms as I could handle(very rarely do), I could do an aa pt in around 4 hrs.  Most of the time it would be 5 hrs though from waiting on spawns, etc.  ME would be much faster at the toilers, but way to many quaders taking them down for it to be effective.  Could probably duo in CT for an aa pt in maybe 3 to 3.5 hrs(just a guess)</div></div><hr />
