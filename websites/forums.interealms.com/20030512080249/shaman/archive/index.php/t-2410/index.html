<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is this fool's spawn time.. does he have any particular place holders?  I was told pretty much to clear the floor that the room with the big dining room table is on (where the odd mole spawns.. not sure if that's called the 3rd or 4th floor).  But haven't seen him spawn at all.. Was also told that he wanders and after he reaches a particular desination, he despawns.  Does anyone have any helpful info about this?<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For one, petition. Make sure there's no reports that this might be broken. When SOO many quests broken, I wouldn't put it past VI to have broken this guy's spawn too.<br />
<br />
Then, if that checks out. 86 everything. There are two spawn locations he spawns at ( and only two ). One is on the large set up stairs leading down from the dinning room hall.<br />
Other is in the room with the two sets of half stairs.<br />
I would just kill everything ( in your boredom ) until you've placed the two spawns yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I spent 45+ hours on this camp before looting/buying all the skulls and more that I needed.  You need to kill the roamer on the main stair between 3rd and 4th floors and every skelly that roams into the 2 staircase room on the 3rd floor.  I killed the roamer at the top of the 4th floor that wandered into the dining hall as well, but I do not think that this is a PH.<br />
<br />
I would guess that there are 3 or 4 PH's and if I remember right the spawn time is about once every 15 min or so.  This camp IS ridiculous and I /bugged and /feedbacked it daily.  Gud Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ehehehe....how lucky am I...<br />
<br />
Kurns is in my backyard so I poke my head in it once and a while. First time I did, he was up, one skull.<br />
<br />
Second time I went in, killed a bit, got him to pop, lore skull :D<br />
<br />
Third time I went in, some poor 30's shammy had like 7 non lore skulls...all he needed was teh lore....bought the extras offa him and completed the quest. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Naagruz has it spot on.  The wanderers in the two areas mentioned (not the dining room) are placeholders for the Crusader.  Back in the day, when all this was new, it took us a while to figure out the Crusader could spawn in more than one place.  I spent *way* too much time camping the stairs for that skinny bugger before I got fed and started a wholesale slaughter of those floors... and the Fine Steel Mace he drops is (was?  might've changed) better weapon than the cudgel you get at that step :/<br />
<br />
Heh heh, they add a decent end reward and suddenly a whole new generation of iksar shammies learn to hate the Crusader ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bleargh!  I'm not new generation I just don't care for questing.. Gorm was created on April 27th 2000! ;) Hehe he was originally created 4 days earlier than that.. cept I made him female!  Wasn't paying too much attention to it until I started getting whistles.<br />
<br />
A guildy had to persuade me to start it up hehe... I finished the 1st part of the cudgel long long ago but quit shortly after that :)</div></div><hr />

/sigh.. Was there most of the afternoon and was offering a 1kpp bounty on the lore skull.. so several lowbies were in the tower.. as was myself and a friend of mine (59 monk).  We flattened the entire tower.. and not 1 freakin pop.  I petitioned about it.. all the guide had to say.. was that I had a stroke of bad luck.. /rude</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Eventually found one.. not in Kurns.. had to auction that I wanted the lore skull and was paying 1k for it :)  Took all of 10 minutes to find a seller hehe.. Still need 1 non lore though.. bleargh.. but that shouldn't take long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had about 12 regular skulls before I found the Lore one :/<br />
<br />
I think I have spent less time on Ragefire camps.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I so, SO hated doing this part.  It boggles the mind on how and why verant made this part of the quest so very pointless.  i got about 10 skulls, and the lore one on my last try.  my advice is to buckle down, bring some ingredients for various tradeskills to practice and try to sit through the pain.  it's actually funny once your done because the next cudgel's skulls is done in all about 5 minutes :).  <br />
<br />
for those of you attempting this we all feel your pain, verant definately shows it's stupidity in making THIS step of all the steps to be this incredibly annoying.  good luck to all my iksar brethren.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bought all the skulls in game hehe.. got that part and the part w/ the goblin heads completed.. now I have to wait for the neverspawning overseer in Nurga to pop up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I camped this forever..(Took shorter time to get up to cudgel six than to finish JUST this one step)<br />
<br />
Crusader spawns on the stairs up to the dining-room area, and the stairs up to the 'barracks' area, all on the 3rd and 4th floors.<br />
<br />
I made a pet, parked it on the stairs up to the dining room.  Then I ran in circles down the stairs, past the barracks stairs, down the back stairs down to the second floor, then back up the stairs and around to the back room on the 4th floor, aggroing every skelly in the place (use a fast weapon to poke em if they don't get the point).  Then me an doggie would melee em for fun and profit (gave 14 stacks of bone chips to a monky friend working on Cabilis faction..he loved it!).  Sometimes I'd run around the barracks and pick up a few as well.<br />
<br />
Crusader and his PH's are on an 18 minute spawn.  I also suggest (as other's have) that you /auction for the skulls every few minutes, and buff any newbies who come along.  After a week or so of camping for the lore skull, finally a lvl 12 necro I had buffed and healed a few days earlier sent me a tell while I was on a raid that he had looted the skull and was holding it for me..:)<br />
<br />
Good luck!  <br />

(still waiting to get together a s.wing group for cudgel 7..have 3 cudgel 8 parts already)</div></div><hr />
