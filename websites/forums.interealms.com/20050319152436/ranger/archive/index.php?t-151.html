<br />
So you can solo an even con or a yellow. Well so what, who cares. Now I will say this at 22 I did solo a yellow mammoth, just to see if I could, but the down time was a pain. Lessons learned. (1 yellow = downtime. Gain about ¾ a blue.) Your mileage may vary. With that thought, how could I have better spent my time? Blues! I could have spent the time killing blues non-stop and gained maybe 2 blues instead. This is the secret to leveling. Plain and simple. Find the easiest blues for you to kill and kill them till they turn green. That’s it! It’s that simple…<br />
<br />
This is a solo guide and only covers what I did and is by no means the easiest way to level. I must say that you should group as often as you can and work on your group and social skills as well. Above all have fun.<br />
<br />
Levels 1-5 Not even going to cover this. If ya can’t get to 6 throw the game away.<br />
<br />
6-9<br />
Blackburow<br />
Stay outside and solo the spawns here. Two spawn spots out front of entrance. These are easy for a Ranger. There are also the watcher spawns, 2 groups of 3 gnolls that spawn near the shed in front of the BB entrance.<br />
<br />
9-14 Get spells and head to Everfrost<br />
Everfrost<br />
When you pass through BB and zone into Everfrost follow the right wall till you run into a guard named Bandl. He will become one of your best friends here. Head straight out and kill everything that cons blue.<br />
<br />
14 – 17<br />
North Karana<br />
As you pass into the Karana's from Q-Hills again hang a right stay on the hill as high as you can there is a nasty Necro who spawns around here now will kill a Ranger before you realized you were attacked. As soon as you hit the water turn left and follow the river till you zone. Stay as close to the water as possible, to date I have never had any encounters here. As soon as you zone continue to follow the river. You will soon see the Wizard spires and the stone bridge that leads to South Karana. The bridge is a safe place to sit and med. Now follow the path past the spires and there will be a hill to the right. You can see a great deal from here. Hunt and kill beetles great exp and easy to kill. Leave the Griffons alone unless you have a death wish. They are a serious undercon.<br />
<br />
17-22<br />
Paludal Caverns<br />
What Can I say this place rocks for exp. Why there aren’t more people here is beyond me. In 1 day I went from 17 to 20 in a group. If you cant find a group then try and find some friends to bring with you. You can bind in Shadow Haven, and buy and sell all you need there. Yelloweyes spawns here at the entrance and sometimes drops a Perfect Owlbear Pelt, which you can sell for 50plat easy. You have to be careful here though when pulling as these bandits can backstab for 110. When time comes that you do have to solo you can kill Yelloweyes the shroom at the entrance. If you follow the right wall around the camp there is another shroom here that you can kill.<br />
<br />
22-30<br />
Marus Seru<br />
Get in a good group here and the exp will roll in. Only 2 things will agro on you in this zone Lightcrawlers and Zelniaks. Lightcrawlers move faster than sow and can stun you so be careful with them. Stonegrabbers will be your main source of exp here. I never messes with the rockhoppers here as the hit way to hard and have too many hps. You can attack 1 and before you know it 10 more are on you.<br />
<br />
30-33<br />
Everfrost<br />
Kill Mammoths. Even though I hate this zone. This has to be the worst zone for kill stealing I have ever seen. I only stayed here for these levels for the plat. Loot here is good. Learn to use you tracking skill here and remember to “/tracksort distance” so you can track the closest mammoth.<br />
<br />
32-35<br />
Marus Seru and Dawnshroud Peaks<br />
I switched between the 2, as killing Stonegrabbers tends to get quite boring. On the Dawnshroud Peaks side at the zone to Sanctus Seru you can single pull Zelniaks to the city entrance and fear kite them with no interference, and no need to worry bout adds, as they will not help each other. You can also kill the Lightcrawlers here but be warned they can blind you and during that time you will take massive amounts of damage. You can also go to the Neitherbain Lair side and kill the shrooms there. When I dinged 35 I also started killing Tamok Tribesman near the zone to Maidens eye.<br />
<br />
35-44<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks and Yeti caves in Dreadlands<br />
Kill Zelniaks, shrooms, and Tomak. Fear kiting will be your main exp generator here but gets quiet boring to the point where I could not stand it. When I was high enough I switched to the yeti caves in DL.<br />
<br />
44-<br />
Lake of Ill Omen<br />
I tried the bloodgill goblins at 44 but the down time was way too long. I was getting ready to leave the area when I checked track and spot deepwater barracuda. Kill deepwater barracuda. Keeping them feared is a must, as they will make short work of you in no time flat. Move away from the spawn site as soon as you kill one. They re-spawn in less than 30 seconds and you don’t want that surprise bloodgill barracuda on your butt. Stay away from the bloodgill barracuda. They will spawn randomly and replace your deepwater spawn so be sure of your target. I found out the hard way. They resist way too much and hit hard and fast. They can bash which will stun you and they seem to have triple attack. Just move to another deepwater spawn and you should be fine or do what I did and log on your main and kill the damn thing. You should have at least 10 fish scales before you start. The deepwater barracuda drop plenty of them once you get started. I have had as many as 6 drop off 1 kill.<br />
<br />
I am currently level 45 and still killing the deepwater barracuda. I tried the bloodgill goblins again at 45 but still quite a bit of down time. The fish give exp just as good and they spawn  much faster. I will try the goblins again at 46 to see how that works.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer:<br />
This is just what has worked for me and is by no means the only place to hunt. I also tried underbunks but the down time was way too long. So feel free to try new things, and above all be safe and have fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 53 and get about 6blues in 4hours here.  Of course, I have 60% self haste with swiftwind and eyepatch of plunder so your mileage may vary.  I'm trying to get a dark cloak of the sky but it's going to be difficult with the drop rates in PoA and the number of rangers in my guild.  90%self haste would make short work of rockhoppers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eyepatch is spell haste, not item haste isn't it? Thought the Eyepatch was a clickable effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celedor</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm didn't consider that :) Item haste cannot be stacked, but item haste can ofcourse be combined with spell haste... So ok then, guess you have 60% self haste! That's pretty darn nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trelad</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, eye patch of the plunder is right click 19 or 20% haste and stacks with epic haste.  I want it so badly, hehe.  Swiftwind it nice now without.  hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortec</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would just like to add something. If we're talking about getting lots of xp in shortest amount of time, then add Paludal Caverns to the list. <br />
Go at 6. (things con even/yellow then). You can stay there until 24. Now, loot is horrible. Xp is thu the roof! As stated from VI, more xp for dungeon fighting before level 30. <br />
You want xp fast at lower levels, head indoors. (sad but true)<br />
<br />
just my 2cp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kishin</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can make some decent cash questing and killing pandas in stonebrunt.<br />
+:<br />
empty zone (no competition)<br />
easy quests (bleah sash, yay wofs)<br />
animals everywhere! (fear adds w/o snare and they'll be out of aggro before fear breaks)<br />
pandas drop some good stuff<br />
easy fearkiting from 32-38<br />
nothing sees invis<br />
-:<br />
empty zone (no help if you get crapped on)<br />
just one zoneline, not close to where you should be hunting<br />
no guards to save you<br />
indifferent merchants (use sneak)<br />
soloing is really boring after 5 or so levels<br />
bit of a walk for fletching supplies<br />
<br />
this is a highly overlooked zone.  for a great fearing spot with few adds, go up the stream until there's a kobold camp in the mountainside to your left. head east (towards the zone wall).  sit on the little hill and pull mobs off the wall (yay bad pathing!) with an arrow or spell.  snare, fear, kill. repeat.  get into trouble? snare, snare, flee, camo, run, run, camp.  very easy.</div></div><hr />
