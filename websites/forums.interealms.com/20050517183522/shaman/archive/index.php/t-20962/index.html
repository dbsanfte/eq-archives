<br />
imho, the winning post on this thread is Kurley's on page 6.  It easily surpasses the imfamous &quot;page 8&quot; debacle in laugh factor.<br />
<br />
If this has already been posted feel free to delete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's great, some people are just.....stupid.<br />
<br />
I used to have a friend in the guild, went by Yendys Grimcharm.  Transfered there last summer...didn't see him on the roster.<br />
<br />
Oh well, was a good laugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OMG, too funny....made my day..thanks for sharing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jump right to the fun: http://www.fnfguild.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1649&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=86</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah he went about it the wrong way, however, the guilds reaction to him from the very start was a bit messed up.<br />
&quot;Tsuszhana = Zsuzsana? his name is on our roster, you could have looked there&quot;<br />
Although its true he could have looked there I can't help thinking that statement is fuelled with attitude. Unfortunately Ragz literally lost his rag, and took on a defensive position and some of his &quot;insecurities&quot; came out. Other people just then pounced on him like children which only served to worsen the situation.  <br />
<br />
Its for the best he did not get accepted, as his ability for dealing with conflicts would have been incredibly bad.  He would have needed a tolerant and more adult orientated guild, assuming he could deal with acting like an adult with them.<br />
<br />
It was humorous to an extent but it deteriotated to a child-child match with a complete gangup over one person in an attempt to boost their identities and egos. I feel sorry for the guy, but hope he can learn and be sufficiently self aware as to what the  problem was. His reputation on that server has been severely slaughtered. I don't think he deserved it as intense as it got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kurley said:<br />
...simple words are as useless as perky tits on a nun...<br />
<br />
This is where I lost it.  There was also a link on about page 8 to another one of Kurleys slaughters of another person....priceless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow what an idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh I agree the Perky tits on a nun comment killed me too :)<br />
<br />
I would dissagree that it was a bunch of ubers trying to fuel their self egos though.  I think the guy was a way way over agressive jag off and deserved a good ripping into.  It's 100% obvious that he's 12-15 and gets to feel he's important by &quot;own&quot;ing these people.<br />
<br />
What's up with the !!!!////77  and stuff? I mean I get the joke with !!11!! like you took your finger off the shift but what kind of moron accidently hits the &quot;7&quot; and &quot;/&quot; while trying to jam on 15 exclamation points?<br />
<br />
Heh and the &quot;YOU GUys just suCK&quot; kind of typing reminds me of a ransom letter every time I see it &quot;GO tOo TeH paRK weITH $50,ooO IN SmALL BeELZ or DA DoOOooGIE DIEZ!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Jeez I'm just down to the first couple posts he made and already I can't believe the guy!  I can't wait to see how it gets worse!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">haha, whats funnier than this moron is the fact that &quot;page 8&quot; is now its own seperate entity :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Classic.<br />
<br />
This guy is a solid reason for birth control.  I think it's way better than page 8.  Of course, it pretty much died after page 7 with all the fanboy and visitor posts.  Kurley's post was one of the better flames I've read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zanja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Nothing is better than the &quot;page 8&quot;<br />

But this is up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">thanks for linking Jinheim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wow, apparently my guild has hit the big time! We just got a cross-server app. from none other than Ragz Deslicer, &quot;one of the best pallies in the game.&quot;<br />

Sadly, he was pre-denied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thanks for the link, but it was definitely no page 8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">And we all have to thank Witherweaver here for this<br />
<br />
I'd ban you but you're making quite a fool of yourself, and I don't want to deny my guildmates the ability to read this. <br />
<br />
Thank you Witherweaver for letting us all bask in the glory of the holy ignoramus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Definitely ranks up there with Page 8, that's great. I cross linked it to my guild's private forums, and they got a real kick out of it. I do believe Ragz is gonna go down in history. If one has been page eighted, will we soon be calling folks Ragz? Hmm ... :p<br />

Ok, I do not know the &quot;Page 8&quot; reference, and if it is better than the thread posted above, I gotta see it.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have a link to it?  I'm dying here.  Help a shammie out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yes, what is page 8?  Please share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I don't recall all the gorey details, so I won't try and summarize it in case someone can locate the link.  It's a kind of post that is actually a somewhat entertaining story up until the surprise ending, on page 8.  It's a much better read if you can get it fresh, without spoilers...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Light above, someone dug the link up here in the last month or so, I thought. I can't for the life of me find it on these boards. Anybody got it bookmarked? Page 8 is the classic of all ****-ups and an incredibly long flame-fest. It just cannot, cannot get better than Page 8. It just can't. I'll keep looking and see if I can't find it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You can find the &quot;page 8&quot; thread in the following ZIP file:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The applicant's posts are more entertaining than Kurley's, really.  Kurley's &quot;flame&quot; looked like a response he already had ready to post for the next time someone said something stupid on the board.<br />
<br />
And I have yet to figure out why people keep posting that they have &quot;owned&quot; people when all they really do is essentially call someone a poo-head.  Maybe its a difference of definition, but to me, owning someone is like the &quot;Sherlock-F***ing-Holmes&quot; post from Page 8.</div></div><hr />

Another good example, a fresh servertranfer (on his 5th server nonetheless) ripping into the recently retired raidleader of the number one guild on the server as a newb.  In his &quot;I need a guild&quot; post.  At least he saves himself a lot of probationary periods that way.</div></div><hr />
