I spent the entire night going through all the books and learning about the history of certain races and events in Norath’s past. I found it very interesting and mesmerizing.<br />
<br />
My favourite was the story of how the Frogloks came into being. I was so sad reading how these once noble, selfless and brave warriors came to the defense of the captured Mithaniel Marr and how they fought against insurmountable odds at the cost of thier lives.<br />
My second favourite, was the story of the Unkempt Druids.<br />
<br />
If you have not taken the time to read the stories, I would suggest making the time, as your opinion about some of these creatures may change and your eyes open to the fantastic and mysterious past of Norath.<br />
<br />
Did you know that Ogres were not always fat, slobbering, bum itching simpletons?<br />

I truly enjoy the lore and storyline of the game I'm playing so this was a real treat for me. Kudos VI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taylia</div><div class="date">11-01-2002, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prior to Planes of Power, I enjoyed reading the lore of EverQuest.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed reading about the fabled Elldar forest, the first home of the Elves, and how the wrathful gods burned down the forest, which is now the southern desert of Ro and how the Elves fled to their present home in the Faydark. The Druid rings are all that remains of these forgotten ancestors of the Elves. <br />
<br />
Another of my favourites prior to PoP, was the story of the beginnings of Necromancy among the Erudites and the ensuing epic battle against the outcast Heretics. The history of Necromancy spanned from Qyenos to an ancient place in the snowy coverings of Everfrost.<br />
<br />
If you look for it, there is a whole epic story that can be gleaned from various places in the world of Everquest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunaden</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Read the ones on Meldrath the Malignant and Meldrath the Marvelous, who once shared the same heart.  And begininngs of the mines of Malfunction and the Plane of Innovation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iamfyl</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, Read them all. Very enjoyable to read. <br />
FYI: There are a few on NPC not in the liburary. <br />
<br />
I went and killed Meldrath the Malignant just for kicks after reading what he did to his brother.</div></div><hr />
