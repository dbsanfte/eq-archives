<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know why I never twigged to this while this seed was being planted, but then again that is the nature of viral marketing.<br />
<br />
Frogloks, mere coincidence that beginning maybe as long as 6 months ago sooooo many people suddenly wanted to be Frogloks, froglok this, Froak that, new aa to chanters here, seeds there.<br />
<br />
I dont have the time or inclination but I would be very interested to see where this virus started, I imagine Sony employs one of the less scrupulous marketing firms to tout thier wares.<br />
<br />
I see many young advertising exec hopefulls, trolling the eq boards dropping hints here, hints there. Measuring the response, and then marketing to your innocence.<br />
<br />
*Chuckle* I have nothing against viral marketing per-se, other than it's nasty when targetted at children. But I do find the fact that the Crucible took the bait, hook liine and sinker quite entertaining.<br />
<br />
Beware the virus, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ummm - I wanted Froglok to be the Kunark expansion race.  I'm pretty sure that was more than 6 months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When I heard that froglok was the next playable race in the upcoming expansion, it didnt really matter to me because I wasnt going to 'jump' up and make one. <br />
<br />
Then recently I decided I wanted to make a wizard, because I've never had a character who could port in all the years I've been playing. After checking the various races, I found I like froglok the best of wizard choices. I dont like evil characters because faction work is worse than exp grind to me, and I wont make another nightblind character (already have a 61 barbarian and a 46 human). That left me with gnome, high elf, or froglok as a choice. Frogloks have the lowest intelligence of those, but really how hard is intelligence to raise when you consider the other advantages (high swimming, longer breathing underwater, ultravision).<br />
<br />
So, I guess I'll be one of a horde of newbie frogs come live day. Dont worry, though, he wont have a name like Kermiiittt or Frooaak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there is such a thing as looking TOO deep into something ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That login prompt thing was horrible too.  I finally just pre-ordered the damn thing to get it off my screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nah not lookign to deep into something, I just watched a documentry about viral marketing the other day so for me it was 'topical'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One of the best documentaries I've seen in a good while came out and was later repeated on PBS a few months back.<br />
<br />
It was about &quot;cool chasers,&quot; people who try to both figure out what might sell as cool and design it to sell it back to people who think that by buying products crafted for &quot;coolness,&quot; they themselves will somehow be &quot;cool&quot; or have the benefits of fitting in with a &quot;cool&quot; lifestyle.<br />
<br />
It showed how a band, Korn, was marketed as rebellious and &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;outsider chic&quot; when in fact it was guided from early stages through MTV marketing plans to its heights; it was reminiscent of the &quot;corporate rock&quot; of 70's bands like Journey and Foreigner.<br />
<br />
It's very interesting to see those people I work around who are uneducated devoting a staggering percentage of their paychecks and their emotional and even sexual energy to every ramification of whatever new trend comes along, thinking it's somehow rebellious or, most perversely of all, &quot;genuine&quot; or whatever, when in fact it's merely prefab pop culture dreamed up by Madison Avenue suits and spooned out to dullards like oatmeal slop slamming onto a tin cafeteria tray.<br />
<br />
Seriously, every star that gets a tattoo is huge news, and god forbid J-Lo wears a new belt buckle -- suddenly everyone HAS to have it or they completely suck and are totally laughable.  Of course, next year that belt buckle sucks and you suck for wearing it -- even if it actually is not a bad belt buckle.<br />
<br />
A marketer in that special noted something along the lines of -- the guy who says, No way, I never buy into advertising and all that...I'm a total individual and I'm not suckered in by that stuff, I just brush it off -- is ALWAYS the guy with the Oakland Raiders t-shirt, the porsche sunglasses, and the budweiser beer cap -- a complete walking billboard in complete denial.<br />
<br />
It's very funny, but sometimes sad and even outright disturbing to see a good chunk of the people I work with open a People Magazine and go apesh*t over who is supposedly dating who and their clothes and then do everything in their power to dress up in similar clothes and whisper about the shoes and belt buckles of those who don't.  They're completely convinced that they're out there and on the edge, defining a new way of living or something, but they're like open floppy disk slots waiting for a program to be slid into their gaping slots.  These folks aren't all kids, either.  Some of them are well over 30 or 35.  Sometimes I look into their eyes and I'm scared for all of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Are you suggesting that SOE paid their employees to create usernames and make posts glorifying Frogloks?  I guess we'd at least know then that someone from there was reading these boards.  However, one flaw in your logic would be that I've heard people talking about wanting to be a Froglok for a year and a half now (only been playing that long).   That has been the second most requested thing I've heard, next to gnome monks.</div></div><hr />

In a word...Yes<br />
<br />
Take a look at the &quot;I found the Froglok city&quot; thread, its written by a proponent of Sony / EQ not a pure consumer.</div></div><hr />
