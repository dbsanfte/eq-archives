<br />
We pretty much zerged our way down with the help of The Corps... had a bit of a corpse recovery issue since Falla and I both got the Trak Touch... the end was pretty hectic, trying to summon Falla back in time to loot the damn beast.  But, it all got done...<br />
<br />
GREAT BIG THANKS to all that were able to help out last night, and a big thank you to Jice and the Corps for hustling their asses as well!<br />
<br />
GRATZ FALLA!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for posting, Coati.  =)  I've been meaning to do some screenie editing and get a post up, but my schedule this week is absolutely insane.  Can't stay at my desk for more than a minute or two, and lunch is but a distant dream....<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was more or less loitering in PoK last night when Klydon sent me a tell asking me to meet him in Skyfire.  When I arrived, Kly hands me a white dragonscales!  Been waiting almost a year to see those drop.  Seems KoE/Corps took out Vox and instead of the usuall no scale drop, she dropped two.  Thanks a heap Kly.<br />
<br />
<br />
After assisting Corps with a fast Ragefire kill, I did a bit of running around for turn-ins, then   headed to Sebilis to check for the Undead bard to spawn mini-Trak (the last fight of the bard epic quest).  Lo and behold the bugger was up and noone else was around.  I half-faceciously asked in Gu and on the joint raid channel if anyone wanted to kill a dragon.  In less than 15 minutes, there were 26 people headed down to help take him down.  <br />
<br />
That is one humbling show of support folks.<br />
<br />
We zerged over everything to the lair and prepped to kill Trak.  Jice came up with a strategy to keep Trak from running that worked flawlessly.  The only hitch was the stupid excited bard not turning off AE mana for the pull.  I was right at the top of the hate list and promptly got ported to the shrooms.  Coatlicue was touched soon after, and we both watched the conclusion from our bind points.<br />
<br />
Now comes the sticky part.  Seems SK's are unable to summon players over level 60 due to a level limit on their summon corpse spell (this is stupidity defined).  Well, a couple of guard attacks later, I had de-levelled to 60 and was running like a madman back to Sebilis.  Baracus dueled out to get a coffin (thanks Baracus, I know the timing got a bit hairy for you).  I arrived back in Seb, got a group invite to Jice's group just in time to hear she had been mezzed and watch her health dropping.<br />
<br />
Insert long string of expletives here.<br />
<br />
Mez broke and Jice summoned the corpse, I was ressed and looted the final epic piece with about eight minutes left on the clock.  WHEW!<br />
<br />
Now, what's missing int he above account?  Yep.  In the excitement of getting the epic kill, de-levelling, etc, I had forgotten Coatlicue!!!  ARGH!<br />
<br />
Back to Nexus to pick up Coatie and her boy-toy gnome.  =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Back to Sebilis.  Summon corpse and necro res.  <br />
<br />
Now off to Steamfront for a quick hand-in, then to Dreadlands to complete the quest.  About 2 AM CST, I recieved my Singing Short Sword, with Mekil and Coatlicue in attendance.  I want to thank you two for following the half-asleep bard around just to be there when I finished.<br />
<br />

<br />
Now for the thank-yous.   KoE, y'all are a superb bunch of folks.  I've never had a problem in-game that I couldn't count on a hand from someone in our guild.  I have been in a pickup group exaclty once in the last year and a half simply because I am so spoiled on the level of expertise our members show.  I could not ask for a better online family.   Corps......I've never been a member of your guild.  Nevertheless, I have received a lot of help from your membership and awesome support on this quest in particular.  From the bottom of my being, thank you.</div></div><hr />

I need to be unavailable more often. You guys get a lot done when my work interferes with my play time.  <br />
<br />
Much deserved, Falla. Well done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Was just one of those late-night, spur-of-the-moment things, VB.  Wish you could have been there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Never fear though, we have another bard chomping at the bit for a Trak kill.  We tried last night and lost to the bugger at 4%, largely because I did a poor job of communicating what needed to be done to keep him from running.  Next time!</div></div><hr />
