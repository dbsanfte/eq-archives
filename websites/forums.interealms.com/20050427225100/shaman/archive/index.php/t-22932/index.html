level 1-5, newbie zones, unless you have twinked your character, and have alot more hp than most level 1-5 characters.<br />
<br />
5-10, warrens, yes, but closer is blackburrow, both can take you to 15-20, if you want to hang around that long.  personally, i would do blackburrow, as there is a side quest to help you bring up faction in Qeynos, or in Halas, depending on which you go to.  &lt;gnoll teeth&gt;.  not to mention, not having to invis to get to the Warrens.<br />
<br />
10/12-18 kurns tower is a good option, but again, there are others, such as staying in BB, going to the warrens, (invis potion), heading to the Oasis, South Karana, Lake Rathe, East Karana, West Karana.  And all those places on the moon, that I've prolly run through, but never hunted.  Side note: there is a bard in West Karana, about a 6 minute spawn, that you can hunt, drops a manolin each time (sells for just over 1pp, with merchant right there) that you can hunt from 14 to 19, quite easily.<br />

Hunting her will lower your faction with the leauge of antonican bards.  I was kos to them and it made it hard to get around some cities</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lions</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I start a new toon, I power level them in the same spots.  For leveling you can do the same thing, only with little level difference.<br />
<br />
1-4 Qeynos<br />
5-8 Qeynos Hills<br />
8-12 Black Burrow</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Really depends on your situation and goals.  Are you twinked?  Twinked with fungi?  Want to exp grind levels as fast as possible, or want to quest and do the ol immersion thing?<br />
<br />
Last couple of characters I've started, I've had a great time working up through the newbie quests without twinking.  Had a hoot, but it's not for everybody.<br />
<br />
When I'm looking for ideas, I pull up the zone level chart on alla's (still can't spell it right) and look for dungeons for thrill and outdoor zones for easy fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crinic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Butcherblock is decent area to level up - there is a skele-bone quest (NPC is paladin guild end of hall to left NPC.) 4bones per gift gives you decent XP an a trash clothing or something you can use or sell right there. Bird-claw quest (same idea - 4per) is a bit more of a hassle but still good to keep in back of mind - NPC is paladin hall somewhere inside.<br />
<br />
newbie runaround area is good till 5 or 6. Then switch to gobby camp outside Kaladim ( go left from Kaladim all way back along wall to gobby camp - they drop heads and blood (3 - 4plat each). Then switch to first gobby camp at about 8th or so - found by following road left outa Kaladim to second guard house then right to gobby camp in valley. <br />
<br />
PS - the first camp outside Kaladim spawns some Wizards and Shamans that will own you at 5th. Pull them to the guardhouse and let the guards own them - run back and continue with DB, white an Yellow mobs.<br />
<br />
By the time you have reached 7 - 10 almost everything in BB is accessible - EXCEPT Crazed Gobby Camp - behind first guardshack that has a dwarf standing beside a Blacksmith anvil. These gobbys are not for anyone under 20th soloing. They are same class as the Crazed Gobbys deep in High Hold Keep . . . stay clear till your 20+</div></div><hr />
