<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Suggestions anyone?  No twink, but some decent bought stuff. Most of the references around seem to be older...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Paludal caverns from the Shadeweavers thicket entrance.  Head in until the room opens up with some water in the middle.  Kill any blue con bugs and shrooms.  Be careful they will add.  Once those green out -  by 12 - Go down the tunnel the first tunnel on your right from the first time you enterred the cavern.  Follow that around until you hit the grime tunnelers.  These will hold you for the next few levels, but will be tough conning blue - yellow depending on what spawns.  The glowing muck diggers are tough so be careful with them.<br />
<br />
Around 15 there is a nice hallway that's difficult to describe how to get to but it's got a wandering tunneler and 3 big shrooms in it.  Great little hallway until 17.  Then try for a bandit group.<br />
<br />
If you still want to solo there is more in PC but you need to get to it from Shadowhaven and it's a bit tricky.  The shiknar's are awesome from around 18-22.  Then you definitely want bandits.<br />

I'll have to try that. I did get a temperance buff last night and went hunting Minotaurs in Steamfont. Tough part is that they pull in pairs, but there is time to get off a Tainted Breath on each before the melee starts. And the kobold camp is a safe place to med/buff back up. Maybe Paludal this weekend.</div></div><hr />

I'm jealous =(<br />
<br />
I miss hunting in Steamfont and Crushbone and stuff. <br />
<br />
For me the real, real fun part of the game was when you were new and no one cared about exp modifiers and crap, just looking at the scenery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try soloing in the pit in Field of Bone or you can try soloing the first floor of Kurn's Tower.  I usually take my toons there.<br />
<br />
In the pit, I found that more you move &quot;north&quot; the higher the mobs are.  I would stay on the right side of the Dragon Bone Head until the mobs are trivial for you.<br />
<br />
Kurn's Tower is at the North Eastern corner of the pit if I recall.  You need to follow the ramp up around the tower to the entrance.  A lot of the mobs here are undead, and you can burn through them pretty fast to level 18-20 or whenever you get bored.<br />
<br />
Crushbone is nice as well, and you can stock up on belts for future toons.<br />
<br />
North Ro might be still decent for you as well.  Find a Derv group for a few levels and head to Oasis for the Orc Highway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nickels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally I went to PC.  Entered Shadoweaver side and killed Muck Diggers and the shrooms until 14, then I went deeper in and found more shrooms and muck diggers.  That got me to 16, after that I found a bandit group and got all the way to 25.</div></div><hr />
