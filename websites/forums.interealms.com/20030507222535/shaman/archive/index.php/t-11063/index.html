As you can see, the Shaman hat you mentioned is one of the &quot;booby prizes&quot;, rather than one of the really nice drops from this camp.<br />
<br />
We normally set up camp in the middle of the North Wall, not on the pyramid itself. The only spawn in this area is a raptor that is the PH for Terrorclaw. All of the other spawns listed above can be pulled to this spot, except for the Enraged Amy, who is a seperate camp. Most groups can't keep all of these spawns clear though, so you will need to prioritize which PHs you want to keep clear. Named spawns are quite rare, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
If you are new to CT, be prepared to die and CR a lot. Breaking into 4c and holding it is a great challenge for a group at 60. If you don't have the stomach for doing tough stuff, you may as well forget this camp. At 65, it becomes a lot easier - but also much less rewarding for exp.<br />
<br />
I practically lived here pre-PoP, so I ended up with one of just about every Shaman usable item that drops here. VERY nice place for gear upgrades if you don't like raiding.</div></div><hr />
