<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We were in Chardok last night, hoping to kill the King for someones Epic. We got all the way down to the two rooms just before the kings room and were easily Zerging it. When, for some weird reason every mob from the kings room including the king himself stormed in on us and completely wiped us out (except me, cos I'm nailz and managed to gate out when there was only two of us left and still 15 mobs fighting us).<br />
<br />
So, what I want to know is has anyone else noticed this strange anomaly. The monk who was pulling for us, said that this is the second time that this has happened to them in a week. And never happened that way before then.<br />
<br />
Anyone else noticed this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What I bet happened is you fought a mob near the Kings room and pushed it onto a chair, wall hanging or some piece of furniture.  <br />
<br />
If you do, the mob can warp and pop near the King, creating an instant and impressive train that can wipe out most raids.  <br />
<br />
Don't fight mobs on that kind of geometry.<br />
<br />
Why on earth do you have gate loaded?  If it wasn't loaded, how do you have time to sit, and load it without casting, rooting, healing and trying to help the raid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We pulled the king on sunday without any problems. However we did wipeout on monday but that was due to a lazy pet owner argh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Had the same thing happen this weekend. I thought someone had fallen into the pit (which you can do even when the door is closed I found out :) ). Some mob passing aggro makes sense. Was quite a fun fight to be sure and we did win. &lt;3 enchanters and pbae stuns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Every time we've seen that it's been a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Every time we've seen that it's been a pet.<br />
<br />
same here.  Just have ALL the pet classes drop there pets on or before the library.  Some kind of weird pet agro happens and the last 2 times we have done it whout pets it has worked just fine.  Just a suggestion of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">2 group of us went down for royals sunday (for a cleric bot epic).<br />
Everything went smooth (no death except bard puller once) and we killed king and queen without any problem /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it probably could of been the MOB warping through the wall thing.<br />
<br />
Which wall would it have been though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It pretty much happens every time we go on a royals raid.  Send in a monk/sk or two to try splitting the room, suddenly, the king, followed by the rest of the room is in the prep area with us, while the monks are still down there scratching their heads.  We've just resigned ourselves to fighting the entire king room in the prep area now.  Its not so bad when you get used to it  :D <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure it's the King firing off his ae when aggro'd by the pullers, and hitting the pets somehow, in the room above (prep).  Well, I dont know if it's damaging them or not, but it certainly is aggro'ing.  They usually take off down the hall, then the king storms in, followed by his guards.<br />
<br />
I suppose it would be easier to just dump the pets.  We never do anything the easy way  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There's a chair in the each of the two rooms between the King/Queen and the Library, as well as some wall hangings.  There's also some geometry in the library itself along the left wall (I think) that can cause a problem.<br />
<br />
You can't push mobs onto that kind of geometry or you risk them warping and finding yourself with a bit of a mess.  <br />
<br />
Doesn't always happen, but I've seen it twice now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">did you have a runner?  They sow themselves down there.<br />
<br />
Did King and Queen on Tuesday, all was well.  Royals raids are fun again, with a single grp of non-kos people!  gogo bot epics!  :)</div></div><hr />
