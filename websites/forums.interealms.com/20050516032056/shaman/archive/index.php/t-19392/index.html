<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>trrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I just came back to EQ 2 months ago from a 2 yr break. I started a shaman as my main (my main 2yrs ago was a cleric) and I have a few questions on some of our roles in group.<br />
I've leveled my shaman to 54 now and I just got the diseased based slow spell. I'm confused on when/where to use that one compared to the 75% slow I already have. Does it get used in conjunction with Insidious Decay on usually unslowable mobs?<br />
Also when in a group without a chanter or other char with tash, do you automatically tash before even trying to slow, or do you slow then if it doesn't work tash then slow again...I'm not sure if it's worth the time to cast tash while the tank is getting beat on and then slow. Seems like it would be better to slow it (pray it doesn't resist) and then tash.<br />

thanks for your help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hiya Trrist, welcome to the Crucible.<br />
<br />
Generally, you will be using Turgurs instead of the disease based slow. There are a few mobs in the game, which are very very MR but still slowable. These are good candidates for a disease based slow. Some examples include: Lord Seru, Emperor in Srra, The Guard Captain in the Scout Charisa quest, etc.<br />
<br />
If you were using the disease based slow, you should definitely pre-debuff with one of our spells which lowers disease resistance.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;tash&quot; (I'm guessing you mean the malosini-line?) it really depends on where I'm fighting and how resistant the mobs are. I didn't use the spell very often before POP. At level 65, I use malos in most exp groups, but only rarely in LDON adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You would only need to worry about using the disease based slow when the mobs that you are fighting have a pretty high resist chance of bouncing our normal slow.  This regulates to about 5% of any named in the game that you will fight (prob more than that, but I'm just generalizing).  If you land the disease slow then land turgors, it will take off disease slow (you'll see the wear off message) so there's no stacking if you are wondering that.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure exactly what you mean about tash.  Shaman can't tash, we can use the malos line of spells to bring down the mobs resistance.  Some of them are unresistable (malo and malos) while a few of them are used somtimes after malo(s) lands for additional debuffing (malosinia debuffs the mobs resists a little bit more than malos does, but it's resistable).  Whether or not you try to debuff the mob is up to you before you try to land slow.  It depends on situation, mobs, resist rate.  Put it this way, once you hit 60 and you get malo (assuming thatyou do), it's beneficial to debuff the mob using that since it's unresistable and then try to slow as soon as you are done with that.  This will bring down your slow resist rate.  It's also beneficial to begin casting malo just before the mob gets to camp, cutting down on the time that it takes to get the mob slowed, and saving the tank's hp and the healers mana.  Remember, it's all situation dependant.  At 65 you'll have a lot easier time slowing mobs and sometimes you may even find it easy to slow without using malo(s).  <br />
<br />
One thing to note, the malo line does not debuff the mobs disease resistance, so i usually debuff it if I have to use disease slow by using insidious/malicous decay first and then going with disease slow.  Again, not always required, but beneficial enough to use it.<br />
<br />
Hope this answers your question.<br />
<br />
edit: damn glori ninjaed me while i was writing this :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>trrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah I meant the Malo line of spells.  Is &quot;tash&quot; the right way to refer to them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Welcome mate.<br />
<br />
Just to add to Gloriana's post..<br />
<br />
Think about this when casting Malosini or whatever. It pretty much has the same resist check as Slow, so if you can land Malosini you can land Slow.<br />
<br />
Now once you get to 60-65 you have 2 new spells, Malo and Malos. Its at this point i think shaman start debuffing more often, cause you know for a fact its going to lower the resistance for slow.<br />
<br />
Anyway, play with it and figure out your own way. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1. Disease-based slow: I only use it on mobs which are Disease-slowable and are not Magic-slowable. See this post  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=12590)  for which are which. And yes, Insid. Decay helps land that slow. But not on unslowable mobs.<br />
<br />
2. Situational. I can't Tash; I can Malos. But with mob lifespans in PoP and LDoN, unless I'm on a raid, I don't Malos unless Turgur's has bounced twice and the mob still has 70+ life left. Hmm, let me rephrase that. What I do is:<br />
<br />
A. Raids: I malos while other Shamans let the Turgur's fly. If they haven't slowed the boss mob by the time my gem lights up, I try to stick it as well.<br />
<br />
B. Groups: Turgur's. If resisted, Turgur's. If still resisted, and mob life is still over 70%, Malos and then Turgur's.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tash isn't the right way to refer to them, Trrist.  Tash is the spell enchanters get to lower magic resistance on a mob.  Tash is unresistable, but has a lot of agro when cast.<br />
<br />
Shaman generally just say malos or malo for that particular line of spell.  You also see it as malXX a lot, since there are about 8 versions of it.<br />
<br />
I think the others answered your other questions!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well friend, I am still in the 50's, so I have played with this quite a bit recently...<br />
<br />
For LDoN's where my level is close to the level average (i.e. I'm not low man on the totem pole) I mem two slows (turgur's and torgors) and if one resists I go straight to the other.  The difference in the two slows is highly negligable in LDoN, and this is usually the fastest way to have a slow landed on the mob.<br />
<br />
However, If I am low man on the totem pole, and am basically in an adv set one level higher than me, I get alot or resists.  For some reason I seem to get less resist on malosi than on turgurs.  Supposed to be the same resist line, and the same resist check, but I swear malosi lands more than twice as often as turgurs on resistant mobs.<br />
<br />
So, if I'm in an LDoN and am the low man on the totem pole, I start casting malosi while the mob is running to camp.  If it lands about a second or two after the MT turns around and lands a taunt/hit I never get agro from it (it's not nearly as agro heavy as slow from my experience).  Then I slow it.<br />
<br />
The difference for the MT is only one round on an unslowed ldon mob (which most chanters can take easily, so it certainly won't be a prob for your MT) and it has the added benefit of helping everyone elses spells land (though there really aren't that many resists in ldons)<br />
<br />
Now, If i'm doing a hard adv, I malosi every time before slowing, because everyones gonna need the resist help.<br />
<br />
If we get a big overpull, and the chanter manages to mez them all, I malosi then slow each and every add.  Malosi first, because it'll help the chanter land their mez, and mez is a whole lot more helpful to keeping the chanter alive then slow.  But I still make sure to slow the adds before mez breaks for good measure.<br />
<br />
A little trick to do after slowing the mezzed adds is to /assist the mob and see if it's still targeting the chanter, or you.  If it's the chanter, and I have alot of extra mana, I might slow it again to pull the agro back on me.  Or I might just root it, if I know It's breaking soon.<br />
<br />
Anyway, kinda strewing from topic, but I just figured I'd add a few tips =)</div></div><hr />

I'm a learning sponge!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Check the hunting grounds threads, they are divided up by lvls and contain mountains of valuable information.  Out of all the class boards I frequent, the crucible here seems to be the most helpful and polite.  Welcome and enjoy the bounty of knowledge.  If you are grouped with a Mage, they get some of our Maloxx type spells, ask them to lead with it so you can slow asap.  Of course its their call if they will or not, but it will help their nukes land and helps to get stuff slowed fast.  One more point is that Maloxxx spells dont have nearly the aggro slow has so you can blast with them from the get go.</div></div><hr />
