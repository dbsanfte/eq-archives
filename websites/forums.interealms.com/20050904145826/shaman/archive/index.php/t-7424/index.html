<br />
I've got a strange problem with Internet Explorer 6. When I right click on a link and select open in new window, the page that I'm launching from freezes and the new window won't open for 20-30 seconds, and then once it loads the original window starts working again. <br />
<br />
It's very strange, when this happens any other IE windows that I have open still work and respond. It's only the window launching the new window that freezes.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix it? or any addresses where I can post a message to a good message board. Microsoft's is very poor.<br />
<br />
I've checked my pc for Viruses using an up-todate version of Norton anti-virus, and I've cleaned up my PC with PestPatrol (spyware and pest remover)<br />
<br />
My PC is AthlonXP 2100 1 GB Ram, with a 600K Cable Modem connection, running Windows XP with SP1, and IE6 with SP1. I've also used the update windows to ensure that it's uptodate.<br />
<br />
I'm really lost as to what's causing it so any advice would be gratefully received.<br />
<br />
[Edit - changed the title so that people with the same problem could read my solution below]</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's related to zone alarm/pest patrol not fully disabling some ad crap.<br />
<br />
I got a copy of ad-aware (freeware spyware checker) and that found a few items that pest patrol didn't. Once they were deleted explorer went back to normal. :)</div></div><hr />
