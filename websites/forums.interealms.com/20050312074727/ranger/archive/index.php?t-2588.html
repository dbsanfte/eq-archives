<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sunmoon, while I think Valphoo may be overreacting, I am seeing a disturbing trend emerging again from Verant.<br />
<br />
1. Ranger specific weapons in Luclin are jokes compared to other classes.<br />
2. Two hand damage has been modified to make our dual wield far less effective in the scheme of things.<br />
3. Spell stacking issues seem to be getting worse instead of better.<br />
4. Ranger armor choices remain less varied than other classes. (This is a general chain class problem though, not just rangers.)<br />
5. Fletching remains the unwanted stepchild of Yakatizma and the crew at Verant.<br />
6. Other classes are seeing epic component drop rates investigated and fixed. Ranger SEOC drop rates remain pathetic.<br />
<br />
There are other issues as well. However, it's not any one specific thing - it's the sum of the parts that worries me.<br />
<br />
I keep waiting to see this EQLive team address some issue of importance to the ranger community. Instead I see them bending over backwards to accomodate rogues and The Safehouse again and again.<br />
<br />
I think rangers are in pretty solid shape right now but that is in relation to the other classes. However, over time, if our weapon upgrades don't keep up, if our armor choices don't keep up, if our useful spells don't keep up, we will end up back where we were in 2000. And that's not a happy picture.<br />
<br />
Personally right now I am a little concerned. I'd be less concerned if one of the Verant lurkers would admit that they knew about the above types of issues and were at least looking at them. But right now, as other people have stated, we seem to be an ignored class.<br />
<br />
My main hope is that we can maintain the relative position in the melee hierarchy that we've recently re-established. We're not number one but we can do many things well. I don't want our class to fall to a situation where we are perceived as unable to do anything well at all.</div></div><hr />

Aye, the only address I know of is the feedback@. I'm not sure how visible that addy is as I don't think I've gotten a response back from it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunmoon</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keltaras.. you may not have been around long enough to know this, but I know all about helping and crusading to make our class better. I think many people can attest that because of my effort and a lot of support here at the Glade, we were the catalyst to MANY Ranger changes that have been beneficial to us.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to list them all, but there are quite a few, especially back in the day when Rangers were legitimately having issues.<br />
<br />
You need to pick your words and issues wisely though. If you sit there and bitch and moan at every little thing you don't like, then you will eventualy be ignored, maybe even disdained. However, when you look at the grand scheme of things (which is tough when you haven't been playing long, or only play one class) then you can't understand how things really are.<br />
<br />
When it comes down to it, right now, Rangers are very well off. Many of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds still accept and enjoy Rangers. We have more offensive firepower than we have ever had.. better spells... hell, a lot of things better than what it used to be.<br />
<br />
Sure, you see other classes getting this and that, but when you honestly sit down and look at the relative power we all share, our specific niches and the flavor our class has, you will see that we are very well off.<br />
<br />
So don't accuse me of sitting by the side with my thumb up my butt, or depressing those with legitimate issues. I just don't want us to be misconstrued as those damn whiny Rangers. I and others have been here a very long time and we really do know what we are talking about.</div></div><hr />

Since the early days of eq when rangers were gods it has been a pretty consistant downhill slide. WE fell off the damn cliff with kunark and ever since then have been trying to get break even.<br />
<br />
I fear that we are seeing a disturbing trend which will see rangers fall even farther.   If we don't speak out quickly with and vehimatly verant will not listen. When kunark came out some of us said how badly rangers were getting screwed but most said &quot;wait and see&quot;. In fact we were being screwed and it took the release of DAOC to force verant to rectify some of our glaring issues. So maybe I am over reacting in this case but the fact remains we need to stand up and fight against these little changes so verant does not forget about us and screw us over once again. <br />
<br />
Look rangers are pretty good right now but we need to fight to keep it that way. The fact is no matter how good you think we are now... rogues/monks/warriors all own us in the high end game. <br />
<br />
I don't mind being a jack of all trades and a master of none but the fact is rangers and all hybrids have been margionalized at the high end game. Class balance is joke and we need to speak up of we WILL be forgotten.<br />
<br />
 aside: <br />
I have been around the glade a long time and a ranger in eq for a very long time. My old log for the glade was valarin and the reason changed names was I lost the email I used to setup the account and forgot my password when I quit playing eq during the ranger dark times in kunark. ( I quit playing eq cause we got shafted while the other rangers i knew were all making rogue twinks people like baven and janx to name a few).  So trust me I do know *** I am talking about. If youstill have access to the old kunark threads you will see thread making recomended changes for balacing rangers. you will see that my suggestions are exactly what verant ended up deciding to make live when DaoC came out. ( the post was exactly what they did inclyding the dodge/parry/defense skill cap numbers i had suggested.)</div></div><hr />

You need to pick and chose your battles.  Verant will only concede on a few issues and if you take every issue to them they are likely to give in on those that matter the least.<br />
<br />
Incessant whining will eventually bring us to the point where Verant will just consider us whining for whinings sake, and will then ignore everything we request.<br />
<br />
I don't think that Verant hates Rangers, but I know I would eventually start to hate someone that constantly complained and never showed any gratitude.</div></div><hr />

So what if they do.. we still own every other class.. blah blah, I get so tired of rehashing this. If you can't see how good Rangers are, perhaps you don't need to play one. Go play one of your &quot;perceived&quot; god classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerail</div><div class="date">05-08-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it is right now rangers are a very desired class to a lot of high end guilds, in fact our Ranger team has been dubbed &quot;RRT&quot; by my guild (rockin ranger team) and whenever all of us are at a raid everyone says stuff like, 'oh man this is going to be easy' or 'pls put me in ranger group I want xp' and stuff like that.  I do agree that there are some things that we are lacking (high end weapon content anyone?) but we shouldn't moan and cry at every little thing to verant, we need to discuss what the big things are, and have one person (maybe have sunmoon represnt us again) tell our complaints to verant.<br />
<br />
Oh and Keltaras, insulting Sunmoon like that is like when the Guards in the Shire insulted Frodo at the gates at the end of Return of the King,  and Sam got pissed because he'd seen all the great things Frodo had done for everyone and they were treating him like Dirt.  Sunmoon has done tons for the Ranger community, so instead of insulting him listen to what he has to say and try to understand where he's coming from.</div></div><hr />

2.5 years ago I used to wonder where the hell Sunmoon was coming from.  <br />
<br />
Now I find myself siding with him on most threads ( tho I rarely post).<br />
<br />
Instead of insisting we're being shafted ( btw I enjoy my rangers abilities more now than ever before).  Put together a thread, discuss what you think WP should be ( be realistic) and let's mull it over.<br />
<br />
All I know is I can dish out huge damage, keep muh attack high ( without cheating like most of you seem to wish) and need no more than a druid for a healer.  I play in a guild that is , quite arguably, in the top 20 of all guilds in EQ.  With that being said our guild loves our rangers and uses them to great effect.  <br />
<br />
Quit thinking the world is out to get us, it's simply not true.  Be realistic or choose another class to play.<br />

<br />
Sunmoon mentions &quot;try playing a necro&quot;. <br />
<br />
All casters except wizards and clerics have problems in the higher level raid game - and wizards suffer a pretty lonely existence for most of their life. <br />
<br />
For raids, the druid (maybe need 1), the mage (not pet - mod rod/COH), the enchanter (can get by with 1) and even the shaman (can get by with 1 or 2).<br />
<br />
Comparing yourselves with rogues is comparing yourself to the most powerful (most stackable) damage dealing class in the 55+ game.  I think therer should be some backstab immune mobs.</div></div><hr />

ummm they really are god classes, perception has nothing to do with it. Rangers were the god class at one time. A ranger in full rubicite with FBSS and ykesha had the same ac/hp and damage output a warrior. The trade off being that we needed significantly more experience to level. The problem is that &quot;THE VISION&quot; keeps changing. The entire concept of an experience penalty and they way it was handled proves it. An experience penalty is based on the concept of inequality of classes. Classes whose power is greater a specified level pay a penalty in experience. It was this way in eq and it was this way in D&amp;D etc. The fact is all hybrids and nonspecialists have been to differing degrees been margionalized because of the 6 man group limit and the increasing reliance of specilists to achieve large scale (ie:raid) goals.  <br />
<br />
you are totally correct that saying rangers have it pretty good now but I would argue we need to fight or else it will slip away. pointing out that uber guilds etc will take rangers in no way shows how good or bad the class is. Look even when rangers sucked in kunark I could get groups. Any guild with half a brain will take the best players they can get regardless of the class they play. why? You can change classes with relative ease but it is alot harder to find true quality players. The best players around can play nearly any class and play that class well. The  &quot;desireability&quot; of rangers by high end guilds in no way reflects &quot;the state of the ranger&quot;.  I can tell you right now though that at least for guilds like harmonium/triton/ra that the standards for a ranger app are SIGNIFICANTLY higher then the expectation for a wizzie/cleric/rogue app.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Traditionally, higher end guilds only wanted one or two token rangers at most.. just to have someone to loot all that ranger-only stuff. These guilds are typically on Eastern Time or in Europe. A pacific time ranger like myself traditionally would have had a snoball's chance in SolB of joining higher end guilds no matter how good they are. At the moment, the bigger guilds want quality rangers to the point that even us goofy pacific coast ones will get considered for membership.<br />
<br />
<br />
In comparison...<br />
<br />
Paladins are still collecting dust at the zoneline in Sebilis, and remain one of the classes that has a hard time getting into guilds (partially because there are so many.)<br />
<br />
People still don't know *** a shadow knight does, so guilds don't think they need many.<br />
<br />
Bards may be desirable for guilds, but tend to rank low for getting help with epics or gear upgrades unless the needed bard-only item just happened to drop.<br />

Beastlords take a hudge hit to their damage potential on raids, and not all guilds are excited about them.</div></div><hr />

Namly first VI fix 2hand damage for all classes but mostly SKs Pallys benifit, then they change our skill caps we get defence SK Pallys get defance and offence upgrades. Then to compansate still more for pallys and SKs low damage they release loads of Uber weapons  for those classes (uber here is dam/delay ratio).  Now I wonder if they get all these weapons with super stats to compensate their low offence skills WHERE are all the ranger only armor (with warrior ac or better plus super stats in em) that should compenste our low defence caps???????<br />
<br />
Note I dont play tank I dont want to play a tank I still curse over the never implimented tripple attack I whould trade back my extra 20 defskill for tripple any day !!<br />

I don't think I am over reacting at all.  you cannot appreciate the recent change out of context. Since the early days of eq when rangers were gods it has been a pretty consistant downhill slide. WE fell off the damn cliff with kunark and ever since then have been trying to get break even.<br />
<br />
I disagree.  Kunark was definitely the proverbial cliff-fall as you say, but Rangers since then (especially with the advent of AA points and new spells) have really become a respectable and desired class - solo, in experience groups, and on high-end raids.  Compare the positive changes to the Ranger class with the negative ones since the release of Kunark.  Most, if not all of the major issues we had with Kunark are now distant memories.<br />
<br />
And hey, if you've been on the Glade so long, why on earth don't you realize the futility of comparing Glade bragging rights with Sunmoon?  Even if you were the second user to ever be created on the original boards, read the old newsletter, and have 2000+ posts... Sunmoon's still got the trump card of being the admin since EQ time began, and the leader who has rallied more than a few class changes in his time.</div></div><hr />

However, read over the first post again, it's a pretty simple question, and there's a statement of opinion in the title.  Then people start flaming about things implied and assumed, without answering the question.  I see a lot of disrespect, going both ways, and that's not right.  The guy may have perfectly valid concerns, and it's his right to communicate these concerns to Verant if he so chooses.  I don't think he deserves flames for wanting to do so.  Sounds like it's a good time for everyone to back away from the computer for a day, take a deep breath and go out and have some fun.<br />

Yes, I do, and I am entitled to respectfully disagree instead of blindly kissing ass (drexel), especially when what I've said was taken out of context. <br />

Giving credit where credit is due is hardly &quot;blindly kissing ass.&quot;  While you are always free to disagree with whoever you want (drexel), your tone in this thread has not been respectful.</div></div><hr />

Kind of strange for me though, when rangers really did have issues I never had anyone poke fun at me...   Heheh, I've noticed lately more and more have...

Do you even PLAY a ranger?<br />
<br />
If you did, you would have listed the MANY problems that plague archery. /sigh <br />
<br />
Do you even play a ranger Keltaras?<br />
Fandros, definately does play a ranger. (The proof is on my website.) He's a kickass one on top of that. I'll admit that he can be a bit out of touch some of the problems of younger rangers (sorry Fanny) but he definately knows his stuff when it comes to the class.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm finding that some of the archery issues that I used to see almost all the time just are not showing up for me now.<br />
<br />
Most noteworthy is that I can regularly shoot arrows into a dragon that is half sticking out of a wall with no part of myself was touching the wall... even though there are claims that this isn't possible.<br />
<br />
The only one that I am seeing now is the lack of minimum damage.. /rude double damage for 1<br />
<br />
While I would say that there are not enough bows in the game, that is an item issue and not an issue with archery itself. (I'll even go so far as to say that some bows are underpowered for the difficulty of obtaining them.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I do see the possible problem of rangers becoming an ignored class.  We've seen a lot of activity since Velious release that has balanced rangers as a class compared to other classes at the time.  Sure, we don't have any real problems right now, but that doesn't change the fact that its a possibility that Verant is not paying much attention to us now.  They may have gotten to the point where they feel our class is balanced, and we need nothing more.  While this is true to an extent, it doesn't stop them from unbalancing us again in the same manner.  With a new expansion coming, it's quite possible they could do the same thing they did with Kunark.<br />
We may be a fine class over all at the moment, but when we're talking about relative class power, we have a problem.  Other classes such as Warriors and Rogues are getting upgrades to armor, weapons and skills, while Rangers are left in their &quot;Balanced&quot; state, things become unbalanced again.<br />
<br />
I think it's an old and outdated concept that a class has a set way of being.  Over the years Rangers have evolved countless times in countless ways.  People should get used to the idea that rangers can, will, and should change as time goes on, for both better and worse.  As long as our relative power remains the same, and we're not shunned as a useless class.<br />
<br />
As for this comparison to classes that are a little worse off than rangers?  So a guy lives on the streets with a Tin roof over his head, and has a neigbor with a tin roof with holes in it, does that mean the first guy can't strive for something better, just because someone else doesn't have it as good?</div></div><hr />

Verant's entire game system needs a big fat kick between the eye's but we already know that. By and large Rangers are doing quite well these days, it's the game as a whole that has no balance and hasn't since Kunark was released.<br />
<br />
Anyway about WP. Do I think it's BS? Umm yes.<br />
WP (at least in my mind) was basically a COE, SON replacment that lasted much longer and gave us a few fringe benefits.<br />
Why it should not stack with our main raid buff (COE has so many stacking issues, I rarely get asked for it these days) is beyond me. It wasn't meant to replace it. It certainly doesn't add the attack of COP and SON. So....I'd just like to know what verant's vision for this spell is......<br />
<br />
<br />
To me it looks like <br />
Luclin spells work with luclin spells<br />
Kunark spells work with kunark spells<br />
<br />
Bend over and enjoy it while we figure out our vision. I'd just like some consistency and some logic. God forbid they test something out before they release it.<br />
<br />
Lol to me the more important issue isn't the stacking with COP, it's did they fix it so every damn well meaning paladin and mage doesn't fubar me when they try to help buff me</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been playing Fandros in EQ since July 99.  This is the only toon I play and I'm proud to say I know the ins and outs of this class.  I've been playing rangers in one RPG or another since Xmas of 1978 ( right after finishing The Lord of the Rings the first time).  So yes, I'm again familiar with the vision most games have for rangers.<br />
<br />
I simply don't think we're broken, quite to the contrary I think we're at a high point of our development.  Back when most folks saw us as gods we were off the hook and out of line.  Now we bring alot to the table<br />
<br />
I've not one piece of SOL equipment and guess what.  I still deal out death in all directions during guild raids.  While I agree that the player defines yer toons usefullness I have to state that being a ranger during initial Kunark release was just painful regardless of player skill.<br />
<br />
Get in the game Brothers/Sisters and enjoy. Spend less time whining and more time growing to the limits of your class.  <br />
<br />
I agree we need to refine what we envision WP should be.  I also agree that archery needs tuning ( autoattack/min damage and some LOS issues).  Tho tuning archery too much would really put us so high up in the public eye that Archery mastery would be nerfed ASAP. kkthnks whiners. ;P<br />

I don't think that Valphoo's opening remarks warranted such a hostile initial reply, and the follow up replies sounded like a VI employ...&quot;If you don't like it go play a necro&quot;? What the hell was that? No way would words like those NOT raise some hackles.  &quot;Shut up and do what I say&quot;, has never been an effective means of leadership. How about we all take a step back, listen to four wisemen from Liverpool and &quot;Try to see it my way, if you think there's a chance that we might work it out&quot; (I'll look at it your way, you can count on it ).<br />
I believe that rangers in EQ do have some legitimate gripes, and it will not surprise or upset me if anyone here disagrees, I would just like some respect when you do so. <br />
<br />
Spells are not what they should be in relation to other similar class's spells; in effectiveness and utility paladin's spells are head and shoulders above ours. Our damage output in MELEE is not where it could be and probably should be...we give up a HUGE penalty in Hitpoints and AC and Defense (both raw and defensive skill caps) for the MELEE skills of a warrior, while paladins and shadowknights are nearly on par with a ranger's MELEE (after the changes to their offensive cap, reworking of damage tables, and uber 1H and 2H SK/Pal only weapons).<br />
The ranger has not received nearly the upgrade that these other two classes have. The equivalent upgrade for us would be increasing out Hitpoints to 95% of the Hitpoints of a SK/Pal and make chain armor ranger only uber loot drops off every uber mob in luclin. Instead we get almost NO ranger only, or even ranger useable items from Luclin. Some of the slap in the face things i have seen are chain drops that Shaman and Beastlords as well as all other plate classes can use, exclude rangers totally..why is this done? Do Shaman and Beastlords need/deserve that item more than a ranger, will a ranger equipping that item unbalance the game? Hardly.<br />
<br />
Ranger issues that should be looked at (just my opinion folks, and opinions are subject to change):<br />
<br />
Post epic weapon choices/availablity, including bow drops.<br />
(perhaps the design team needs to review what a ranger needs in a weapon)<br />
<br />
Armor drops.<br />
<br />
Spell design choices (stacking, overall demand/utility).<br />
<br />
Archery issues, including: minimum damage, situational effectiveness, acrylia arrows not fully working, autoattack button, and fletching above 202.<br />
<br />
I am sure there are other issues I am forgetting, but these are the ones that are on my radar now.<br />
<br />
It is difficult to believe  that there might be a ranger representative at VI at all, or maybe the person in charge of ranger issues/development is some quiet, stoic individual who thinks change will come if they are patient and don't make waves...meanwhile the rest of the other class handlers shake their right hand in protest every time anyone even looks in their direction with a nerf bat, all the while pulling more than their share from the cookie jar with the left hand. :) <br />

<br />
What I am trying to insist upon is that disagreeing with what Verant has done is FINE, just come across in a respectful and mature way about it. Don't go screaming, waaa, you nerfed Warder's Protection all to hell and back, you suck and look what you did for rogues.<br />
<br />
They've got ears at Verant.. and eyes. Yes, it doesn't seem they always use them, but we need to keep making valid points in a civil way. For example, why don't you start a thread on how to improve Warder's Protection? Or better yet, lobby to have them re-evaluate the stacking features of the damage shields that are causing us headaches... or the SK debuffs that wipe ours out.<br />
<br />
If you simply sit there and scream because your precious spell got nerfed, you're not going to get any response. Most every change I've seen in EQ for the GOOD was because people brought up very valid points on a continual basis for the developers and they finally realize, or got a chance to test.<br />

I'm not saying you can't gripe.. hell, I'm the king of it at times, but coming across with a little tact.<br />

you are right I may be perhaps too negative at times however I am POSATIVE my points are valid. warders protection not stacking with COP is not the end of the world. HOWEVER, it is pathetic that after MONTHS of rangers complaining about WP and that it needs an upgrade/fixing the only thing verant sees fit to do is nerf it. Now, IF verant had not simply nerfed the stacking but also made some alteration to WP in the spdat to show they were aware the spell needs work THEN i would not be nearly as annoyed.<br />
<br />
The issue is not simply one of WP and COP not stacking but rather a general trend on the part of verant to treat rangers like  a red headed step child. Rangers DO have some SERIOUS issues which need redress. Instead of talking to rangers and helping them verant nerfs a bug and helps classes who already get far more then thier fair share of development time. <br />
<br />
I don't mean to be rude sunmoon because I do respect you for all you have done for rangers, but the fact is you have not been a &quot;high end&quot; ranger. If sean or shar or celt or locz or even pilferr (janx) want to come up and tell me I don't know jack about high end raiding they have a leg to stand on. The fact however, is that many of the &quot;high end&quot; rangers from xev/povar probably remember me from days long ago and will vouch for my knowledge of eq and rangers  I know the high end game inside and out so pleae don't try to tell me my concerns are baseless. <br />
<br />
Look the fact is rangers are not nearly in the dire circumstances we were in kunark and on that issue I cannot argue. However, this stacking change  and the ranger drops in luclin are insults becuase they are part of issues we have been petitioned for months to have redressed and yet we have seen no action! <br />

We basically fixed up a whole bunch of stacking stuff.  It might (or might not) be true that we should evaluate how that affected certain spells.  But the implication that we're out to screw rangers is pretty unfounded and silly.<br />

Everyone, once this has died down a little and we can get in-game and see how things are really working, then I'll be happy to sit down and try to organize what our main concerns are.<br />
<br />
We all know we have a few stacking problems.. we just need to sit down (Locz, I'll need you on this especially) and really evaluate as a class where our important shortcomings (as we perceive them) are showing up.<br />

Hero+Marzin+Aegis:  1100 hp, 53 AC<br />
Aegolism:  1100 hp, 54 ac.<br />
<br />
COE + SON + COP + shield of spikes:  75 hp, 65 atk, 25 ac, 21 damage shield<br />
Warders: 75 hp, 70 atk, 13 ac, 21 ds.<br />
<br />
So to START with, unlike aego, the whole is not as good as the sum of its parts.<br />
<br />
And then we have the issue of raids.   Paladins throw a group spell that overwrites this expensive, 350 mana, 2 hour buff.  Not to mention, brells + cop + coe blows warders out of the water.<br />
<br />
WP isnt far off... but it needs to be made equal to the sum of its parts, and some regard for the **** we go through on a raid would be nice.   226 hp sure would fix a lot of stacking issues..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought absor was close kin to the easter bunny. In light of the new developments I plan to rethink my stance on santa.<br />
<br />
I agree totally with coryn. warder protection is supposed to be one of the key spells we recieve in luclin. It is the pinnicle spell of an totally new spell line that was introduced in luclin. However, in it's current form it is useless. The only thing that MADE it usefull was the spell stacking bug.  So, if you want to make Warders useful make it at least equal to the sum of the parts if not a little bit better. As it is, rangers are penalized if they use warders instead of being rewarded. It is a sad commentary when people like me would rather use our old buffs from the last expansion over our new 'super self only buff'.<br />
<br />
Also, I would love to see the dev team take a close look at the &quot;melee balace&quot; as it were. I can tell from personal testing that most of the melee classes are not near the %warrior damage outpit which was published during melee balacing.</div></div><hr />

To be honest I see only one unfairness in game with rangers atm. And that still need comparing with other classes (but just the other hybrids). <br />
Namly first VI fix 2hand damage for all classes but mostly SKs Pallys benifit, then they change our skill caps we get defence SK Pallys get defance and offence upgrades. Then to compansate still more for pallys and SKs low damage they release loads of Uber weapons  for those classes (uber here is dam/delay ratio).  Now I wonder if they get all these weapons with super stats to compensate their low offence skills WHERE are all the ranger only armor (with warrior ac or better plus super stats in em) that should compenste our low defence caps???????<br />
<br />
Note I dont play tank I dont want to play a tank I still curse over the never implimented tripple attack I whould trade back my extra 20 defskill for tripple any day !!<br />
<br />
Just posted this since u discuss fairness and class balance (and yes I know it sucks being SK or Pally) <br />
<br />
I would gladly accept 30 more defense and more hitpoints in order to allow the shadow knights and paladins in my guild to use their 45/40 2 handers with a full 250 skill in offense and 2 handed slashing... wait no... that means that I would do less damage than them, have the same AC and slightly less hitpoints. Not a flame sir, I just use sarcasm to point out what I percieve to be not great suggestions. /blame Seinfeld.<br />

I dont want to be level 108 before I become a &quot;Damage dealing God.&quot; I want to be what I feel all Rangers should be, number 3 in the damage dealing hierarchy regardless of AA Skills. Which I think we are at, but I worry that with better and more powerful weapons coming out for Warriors and the Knights it might soon become a 4 way tie for 3rd place.<br />

Or better yet, lobby to have them re-evaluate the stacking features of the damage shields that are causing us headaches... or the SK debuffs that wipe ours out.<br />
<br />
If you simply sit there and scream because your precious spell got nerfed, you're not going to get any response. Most every change I've seen in EQ for the GOOD was because people brought up very valid points on a continual basis for the developers and they finally realize, or got a chance to test.<br />
<br />
Yes Sunmoon they do have eyes and ears at VI, but sometimes you need to jolt someones attention. I recommend spitwads. Seriously tho, I have seen at least 4 threads on this board prior to today regarding the terrible stacking issues with WP, and still no changes to it. Perhaps with the specific mention of the change to WP in the patch message they have noticed some of the terrible issues around the spell, then again perhaps not.<br />
<br />
P.S. I remember a thread from a fan faire where someone specifically mentioned WP to the devs and the reply was, &quot;Oh God yes, that spell is a train wreck.&quot;<br />

You'll catch more flies with honey, and more Dev attention with logic.  Feel free to send a logical, concise post to the Dev corner about this and I'll pass it on.  But don't ignore the big picture, don't slant the argument, don't rant, don't do all that other stuff people do just to make their point sound better.<br />
<br />
We basically fixed up a whole bunch of stacking stuff.  It might (or might not) be true that we should evaluate how that affected certain spells.  But the implication that we're out to screw rangers is pretty unfounded and silly.<br />

I think this would be the most reasonable and fair way to deal with all classes. Either hire someone out of the Player Base to represent their class or force an employee to play 6 hours a day for 2 years until they can &quot;Feel our pain.&quot; :D</div></div><hr />

I have been playing a Ranger since Christmas of '99.  I never expected to get an epic (figuered that that would be for the 'uber' Rangers.  I find myself at 58 with epics Full SS armor BoB's Eyepatch etc and have never even to Lucin (Grrr puny computer).  Our guild just took down Vindy for the first time and I've never snifed a Primal.<br />
<br />
And guess what, I have never been denied a spot in a group.  When one raids everyone wants Rangers in their groups cause they have a better chance at exp.  All those classes you say own us said I was crazy for dropping into Perma to solo the Bear Pit.  2 nights and 3 yellows later they all want to know how I can possible do it.  Because I am a Ranger I say.  The high level Rangers on my server are leaders in their guilds.  They (and I) are asked to join raids and exp groups all the time.<br />
<br />
Why??  Because we can do almost anything!!  I have been a back up healer, parker, slower, snarer and,  yes I have been a MA at times.  I am regularly the SA on HoT raids.<br />
<br />
I am not saying this to brag.  There are many Rangers in the Glade much more impressive than I.  BUT you will have a really hard time convincing me that we are hated, nerfed, broken, reduced, owned, undervalued or any other &quot;insert word&quot;.  We rock pure and simple and the only reason people play other characters is cause they have neither the patience, skill, creativity nor stones to play  a Ranger WELL.<br />
<br />
Sure I would like WP stacking issues looked at, or some archery stuff fixed, etc.  But I will put myself and many of you all up against any other class easily.  Never forget who you are.  You're RANGERS.<br />

Keltaras.. you may not have been around long enough to know this, but I know all about helping and crusading to make our class better. I think many people can attest that because of my effort and a lot of support here at the Glade, we were the catalyst to MANY Ranger changes that have been beneficial to us. <br />
<br />
Sunmoon I respect you because well, you do a good job on the glade and have the support of others.  But I don't think those contributions were that significant at the time.  You may have been heard better because you run the glade but there were those of us that fought and strove to keep the debates alive and to get hte fixes made.  I should know, it seemed to be an endless quest to me to everyday log on and address the issues writing extensive posts up to cover the WHOLE of the issues instead of the pieces.<br />
<br />
As I said, I don't doubt you contributed but I did monitor your participation and there were so many others that worked very hard to get those changes made.</div></div><hr />

Nuff said <br />
<br />
I began to play a necro just at the time they nerfed the pet weapon thing.  I have consistently played a necro from that point.  My necro is now 60.<br />
<br />
I understand a bit about what you are talking about here but I don't agree that it is valid.  Cause another class is constantly nerfed doesnt' mean we are all the better.<br />
<br />
I agree that there are problems emerging that are upsetting.  I've been trying to point some of them out.  I don't just have the ranger experiences to draw from but a whole plethora of characters at the high level of which I levelled myself.<br />
<br />
In the end he's right.  We grow weaker through neglect and if we don't start to discuss it ourselves we'll never be in the right frame of mind to address verant with them when the time makes it imperative.</div></div><hr />

[B]All I know is I can dish out huge damage, keep muh attack high ( without cheating like most of you seem to wish) and need no more than a druid for a healer.

Man, I gotta be in the wrong guild.  My guild could care less about my damage even though I have archery mastery and endless quiver.  They say they like rangers but have no qualms about not helping us do our damage.  Instead they just stand in my way and knock the mobs in the wall amost completely negating the damage I COULD do.<br />
<br />
As well, our rangers, with the exception of those in the leadership clique, are typically least rewarded.  As I have stated over and over I have gone months while raiding regularly to receive nothing in rewards.<br />
<br />
When we recently hit NToV and ruled it beyond our wildest dreams the guild again began to equip the warriors, rogues and the leadership clique again.<br />
<br />
Frankly I didn't spend 3 years to be able to hit the number &quot;1&quot; key to shoot an arrow at a mob.<br />
<br />
Maybe my guild is an issue here, I don't know.  All I know is that I'm a founding member of the guild and have watched it grow from the an OK guild to a powerful guild.<br />
<br />
I've bscially decided to cease play of my ranger till some of these issues are worked out.  If you guys try to shut up the discussions and debates that help us center our issues then we might as well not post here either.</div></div><hr />

I don't know that I would agree with the civility of things being the only way that works.  Somtimes you have to yell loudly to get others to pay attention.  Other times you keep alluding to the same thing while telling stores hoping some of it will sink in enough to get people to see the bigger picture.<br />
<br />
The problem with how Verant takes issues is that they tend to only focus on the little pieces instead of the big picture. You can see a prime example of that in the WP+CoP nerf.  You guys focused so much on the on 5% increase in relative power of the self buff and ignored the rather significant decrease in ranger ability by allowing low low level DS buffs to overwrite WP.<br />
<br />
Finally, had not the ranger community reacted so vehemently against this change and the word went out you would not have come here to read this board.  See, it took that energy of our unhappiness combined to get you go react and respond.  Frankly, you virtually never respond to us as is proven by your 3 posts here to date.</div></div><hr />

Most of the stuff i see is really only little stuff in my opinion. Archery really does bug me though, at my lvl arrows cost most of my money and i hate it when like 12 per battle go pop</div></div><hr />

My comments never implied he had a responsibility and infact were stating that we should not necessarily put emphasis on what he says because he did post here.  For me his posting is more a contradiction then a success for us.  The reason is because it is out of the norm.<br />
<br />
At no time did I imply that it was his job to either way.<br />
<br />
I was just commenting that at times, for example, you have to tell the room of people that won't shut up to SHUT UP.  Somtimes you have to tell your kids to stop their fighting.  Sotimes you have to boycott a product.  Some times you have to get ever ranger together on a server and hold a sit in.  In other words civility of words sometimes don't get results.<br />
<br />
My point about his visit is that he would never have come here and post if he had not seen us getting upset and if someone had not pointed it out to him.  Let's be honest, he didn't come here of his own accord as part of his normal routine.</div></div><hr />

Post Count does not have any correlation to the number of times per day that he visits us, it instead indicates &quot;How many threads he has posted on.&quot; He may come here every single day for all we know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i forget who else has an aego-like spell.<br />
it's not bad.  the extra long duration is nice.  the overwrite issues suck balls.  but it really needs a little more oomph to be balanced. <br />
now i -know- we're only hybrids, and we're not meant to get the best spells, but if memory serves me at quarter to five on this fine thursday morning, rangers have had a new thing to be the best at: ATK buffs.  (we used to just have archery and tracking, and - sort of - aggro management.)  <br />
<br />
now Absor/Verant(if you feel the need to answer), does this still apply?  is there a reason this is self-only?  Aego and KEI are both HIGHLY useful in grouping and raiding situations, but this spell just has something about it... like it's just super mega hyper ultra firefist 2000.  which is great! but with extremely limited usefulness.<br />
<br />
i have two possible visions for this spell.<br />
1. 90atk 20ac 150hp 21ds, self only.  i can see +-10, 10, 75, 5 point adjustments to the respective stats.  imo, a bit of an extra push, but nothing out of line.<br />
2. 70atk 25ac 100hp 6ds, single target, stacks with druid/mage damage shields.  rangers bow/fearkite, not so much toe-to-toe fighting, so the DS loss won't hurt soloability (although it will affect most any duoing you might do).  <br />
<br />
basically, #2 is a combo/upgrade for CoE/SoN/CoP, like the spell should have been all along. like the equivalent buffs of other classes.  i would much rather see this, as it would greatly increase my effectiveness in a raid or group situation.<br />
<br />
but if the good folks at Verant see fit that it should remain self only, #1 should convince rangers to never again use the old velious combo, just so they can swap SoN out for brell's.  and really, if our aego is self only, it should be so good we don't think of turning back, because self only is a huge limitation, and a new restriction on our atk buffs.<br />
<br />
but they should give #2 a fighting chance.  i'm more than content to have my unbuffed melee on par with warriors if i know that they'll need me to eke out that 7-10% more damage.  it leaves me knowing i'm desirable.<br />

Either that or you do not raid alot (assuming you are using a point system and your raid say 1/10th of the warriors, rogues etc that would cuase them to be higher on points). I think you will have a hard time finding a &quot;uber&quot; guild that DONT want rangers because they do some amazing damage.  I aint going to say what our rangers do on AoW but lets only say I love to tripple our ranger squad, hell, I will gladly take 10 times the rangers for it :p Rangers rock in the highend game, period. With a good bow (and yes, bows are severly lacking, VI cant you put in some more primal type bows heck, throw in primal proc even on them and remove all stats or something to compensate lack of ST key and fix the ST bow and AoW bow to be better then the dropped at the same time) and the AA to add to is so are they doing amazing damage. Anyone who feels rangers got bad issues etc should really try to look past your own class for 2 min. <br />
<br />
Auto attack and min damage? Why dont you ask for a direct nerf when you are at it? A reason to having strong bow skills atm is because it is spiky and situation which allow it to go way over the &quot;intended&quot; damage for rangers. Ask for auto attack, min bow damage (there is but that is another issue of 8 damage hits etc) and you can also expect a nerf to the max damage you do...<br />
