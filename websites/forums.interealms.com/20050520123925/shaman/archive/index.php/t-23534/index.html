<br />
I'm thinking most players will quit after being in groups where you either have a guy who wants to be Capt. Kirk &quot;Oh..my god..what...is...that, Spock?&quot; or the port class (think druid/wizard) who constantly says they are going to &quot;beam the group up.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The old SNL episode where Shatner was at a ST convention and Chris Farley (RIP), Kevin Nealon and the rest were asking him the most obtuse questions (&quot;How many horses do you have on your farm?&quot;) was classic.<br />
<br />
Then there was Galaxy Quest, an obvious homage.  <br />

But let's be honest, if I'm stranded on a remote planet with only one person to keep me company:<br />

Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden)</div></div><hr />

I can see the class that players would be least likely to play: sacrificial bridge ensign.  Special defensive move: &quot;Look out sir...ARRGH!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
resistance is futile.. biatch<br />
<br />
edit: i just looked at the link for the first time :p i think it'll be a piece of crap game, only being made to milk the millions of trekkies (hell they already sit in their parents' basements all day long.. give em something to do!) <br />
<br />
but ive always wanted a game where you and 1000+ other people are all on one ship, not exactly feasible for every single ship to have 1000+ crew members.. but with a large enough playerbase the uberest of guilds could probably get that many people together /shrug</div></div><hr />

Habbo Hotel  <br />
<br />
***...Habbo hotel? Has anyone played that game?  'Tis a rediculous little game where you have a sprite in a hotel with a bunch of other people sitting around chatting, and you collect furniture or &quot;furnies&quot; for status.  My boyfriend's 9 year old cousin was playing it non stop when we came to visit last Christmas.  It looks like a Super Nintendo game really.<br />
<br />
ROFL I can't believe that thing is in the top 15.<br />
<br />
sorry.../sidetrack off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm a little confused how the engine will work, I can't see the fun in monitoring an engineering section and I'm not too sure how much I'd enjoy the game without ship to ship combat.  The beaming down and exploring I can see working, even the missions to infitrate ships and installations.  I have no idea how they will work in the artsy science crap (&quot;captain, why dont we  blank blank blankety freaking blanky blank blank blank using modified tachion emmisions to blank blank blankety freaking blanky blank blank blank&quot; ... yeah ... run THAT through the universal translator dude!).<br />
<br />
I wonder if they will implement a quest to see if you can nail more alien tail than captain Kirk, if you can flirt your way out of a tight spot, or act like an illogical a$$ to make robots explode.  IMHO, no way you can make a dynamic enough engine to make this work.  Fun idea though.</div></div><hr />

they probably rated them on their population (though im not sure why lineage isnt at the top..) which would probably put habbo hotel on that list, given the fact that its basically just a graphical msn.. and like 50 billion little kids use that</div></div><hr />
