<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am quite a bit of a lurker here, but I frequent this webpage consistently always looking for new, insightful ideas.  I read just about every post (good or bad), and I agree with some and disagree with others.  Well, enough of that- on to the topic.<br />
<br />
     Obviously, some of the SOE reps do visit this site.  I am sure the peruse through many of the posts, and some even give replies.  For quite a while we have flooded our pages with rants on our weaknesses, and for the most part- to the untrained eye, it looks like just a bunch of ranting.  Some feel we are balanced, others feel we are horribly imbalanced.  I think I tend to fall into the middle- we could probably use a few bones.<br />
<br />
     Here is where a problem lies for SOE.  Everquest players have a tendency to do things ingame that developers never thought would happen.  Some examples that come to mind from some classes are:<br />
<br />
Quad-kiting: Developers never thought druids and wizzies would be running around in circles hitting 4 mobs at a time with AoE nukes.<br />
<br />
Snare as an aggro device: I really don't think snare was intended as a way to hold aggro, but it does a pretty damn good job.<br />
<br />
Pet Canni: this finally got nerfed, but for a while mages were mana regen machines.<br />
<br />
Mod Rods: Endless mana anyone? Finally got hit with a nerf bat<br />
<br />
I could keep going on all day with examples of abilities/spells that are used daily in ways that they were never intended to be used.<br />
<br />
The Bottom Line:  You throw us a bone and we find some way to trade it in for a steak.  <br />
<br />
     Next topic: Class Balancing<br />
<br />
     This has to be one major pain in the ass for the Developers.  You have to really watch what you give a class, and now with so many cross-overs in abilities, you really have to get very technical.   With ever encounter the goal is: Our group dps &gt; Mob's dps.<br />
<br />
The Bottom Line:  All classes should have equal desirability with the except of tank, healer, cc that should have a slightly higher desirability.<br />
<br />
     The Shaman Problem:<br />
<br />
We were Giants....<br />
<br />
     We were too powerful and that caused a lot of envy from many classes back in the day.  Developers always have to watch what they give us because new abilities always increase our soloing ability.  SoE wanted us to come together with one voice on what we felt we needed, and here is where the problem lies- We are a jack of all trades, and our trades are declining.  Our spell books are filled with incomplete lines, nerfed spells, or just ones that are outright unusable in today's gaming environment.  We could forseeably use upgrades in all areas.<br />
<br />
You guys get so many tells for groups....<br />
<br />
     I still get plenty of group invites, but not always what I am looking for.  In a 30 minute time period I may get 4-10 tells depending on the time and day of the week.  Three of those tells might be PoV, PoS- places that I will not go because I have a decent amount of aa's, and I am looking more for progression/gear.  Two tells may be for BoT- another example of a zone I will not step foot in.  It's crowded, loot drop rate is horrid at best, and its where every brand new lvl 62 feels they need to be (Karnor's Castle 2.0).  The rest of tells are usually for LDoN which is fine.  Some tend to be lower levels though, and when you group with them xp and adv point return is pretty bad (pre 65 is about 31 points and 1/4 aa xp; all 65 is 52 points and close to 1/2 aa xp.)  A full 65 adventure group also tends to finish adventures quicker due to better gear and more aa's.  So out of the 4-10 tells for groups I may only find 2-3 that are worth my time and energy.<br />
<br />
But you guys are uber....<br />
<br />
    I find there is still a lot of shaman envy still out there.  I usually get replies of: &quot;But you solo'ed Lodi and WW dragons&quot; or &quot;What, you want an unresistable slow now?&quot;  I went into a sewer trial last night with some guildies and was talking with with the druid that shaman heals could use help.  His reply was &quot; you guys don't need any help.&quot;  After we failed the sewer adv the druid said that he wasn't too comfortable with his healing abilities in the group.&quot;  I replied with &quot;See what I mean, my best heal is 1300 hps.&quot;  He was shocked and asked about our incomplete heal.  He was then further shocked by our 1900 inc heal, and the fact that we have nothing else (not talking about HoT's).  The druid had bit the big one on one of our pulls and I was forced to chain heal the MT until the mob was dead (this was by the entrance mind you.)  I burned close to 80m keeping him alive. (after mob was slowed)  I understand GoD is the new high-end, but there is no gear out there that is going to drastically improve my ability to heal.  We are starting to hurt in our abilities and people are starting to notice.  Check the beastlord forums- even they are breaking down and saying it as well.  <br />
<br />
     New Expansion, New Ballgame, New Rules.....<br />
<br />
     Everquest is always changing.  We are always faced with new game mechanics and new encounters.  Gone are the zerg raids and now we have the zerging boss mobs.  Raids are very technical now- filled with scripts, low hp high dps mobs, slow mitigation, weapons resistances, and countless other annoyances.  FOR SHAMANS, DOTS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR SOLOING.  I don't care if you can stack 6 on x boss mob, because the time you took to stack all those dots you could have been chain nuking, bridge healing, or something else slighty more useful.  Our dots are just as expensive as our nukes when you factor in how long it takes to kill mobs today- sometimes more expensive.  We still need to slow mobs, but on raids with chanters and mages spamming debuffs- it only takes 1 shaman to land slow.  On raids with multiple adds its good to have an additonal one or 2 to help slow, but that's it.  Shamans do not stack well on raids, and take up spots that could be better filled by another class.  Most boss mobs last 5-10 mins tops.  You can't swap out spell set with all the AoE's going off- so stacking dots is really out of the question.  We are left with nuking or healing, and we have seen what that amounts to.  <br />
<br />
     Goodbye Holy Trinity, hello Holy Six Pack....<br />
<br />
     GoD is requiring an entirely new group lineup.  Instead of the old tank,healer,slower,cc,dps,dps.  We are now seeing tank,healer,bridge healer,slower/mezzer,corpsegetter/summoner,dps.  We don't fall into any of those categories.  We certainly can't be main healer, we are going to have a hard time keeping up with a bridge healer, and chanters are bringing more to the table as a slower/mezzer.  We are not going to be tanking, we have no SoS, summon corpse ability, and we are a far cry from a dps mob.  Shamans are not in this boat alone mind you, we are sharing it with mages and monks right now.  Mages are only bringing nukes and mod rods, monks are having their lull resisted in the new content, and we having our long casting slow/weak nukes.  So for GoD, many of us will be sitting on the sidelines.  <br />
<br />
     Conclusion, its not bad yet.....<br />
<br />
     Many of the problems we are facing is probably only happening to 10% of the shaman population, but its effecting about 75%.  I remember when I was guild hunting and was looking around to see who was recruiting- High end guilds are not excepting shaman applications.  Most already have 4-5 with 6-8 BoTs hiding somewhere.  They don't need anymore, so you see many unguilded shamans soloing in some cave to pay for bazaar upgrades.  Loot gets passed over to the clerics and druids to improve healing ability.  Chain drops get thrown to the rangers and rogues to improve dps capability- so what's the point?<br />
<br />
     I enjoy my shaman dearly, and I am by no means quiting, but when I check the boards to see people doing research to see if dog-dog hits better with a fine steel sword than a rusty dagger- it makes me feel that there is something definitely wrong!<br />
<br />
     I don't expect any changes to happen.  I think it will have to get far worse for us to actually get something, so those of us that gripe will keep griping and those of us that feel we are feel will continue to live in their dream world.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like your post and agree with the theory of it, but you don't outline why we are loosing an up hill battle.  <br />
<br />
We are a jack of all trades.  We are not good at any one particular thing and I think our desirability was in balancing out a group.  We would add the underlying subtlety that would make a group kill that much faster or that more effecient.  <br />
<br />
Here in lies the problem.  The subtle changes have been reduced to nothingness.  You have fights that are all out damage.  You kill faster than it kills you.  Either you have more mana and more DPS or you loose.  <br />
<br />
When you get heals that don't keep up with damage output, they don't help a group.  The slow line we have is mitigated.  The malo, slow latency really doesn't work cause you are dead in that amount of time.<br />
<br />
It is simple game dynamics.  You have X mob putting out this much damage in this amount of time, you need to be able to react and have something of value to offer in that amount of time.  <br />
<br />
Our subtleness does not work in this game as it is right now.  There is no chance for us to offer something in a fight that straight forward.  <br />
<br />
Does it balance the game out???  You better believe it does.....<br />
<br />
But again, where do we fit into the picture??? <br />
<br />
That is the main concern here what will we get to make the group better?? <br />
<br />
The stats that are maxed out, the classes that keep getting better regen, and spells that overlap or duplicate ours???? <br />
<br />
The other thing that people forget is that shaman come to power post 60 with thier hard as hell spells to get.....<br />
<br />
80 percent of shaman out there will have problems with GoD, and now we are getting reports back that even the best shaman geared in the game are having problems.  <br />
<br />
When you are at the top of your game and have worked to max out your AA and you are still having issues in game something is wrong.  It takes a lot of hard work to get that many AA its sad to hear that we are not united.  <br />
<br />
For a solo group experience in PoV we are still of value, but look at the differance in content.  From old world to new world there is a huge difference  We can't suffer for the game design we need to be made to fit into a situation of change. <br />
<br />
That is my 2 cents.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for helping to expand on my thoughts.  I was trying to be brief as possible on the problems at hand.  It would have been easier if we were a one trick pony, but we are not and I think that is the problem we are running into with the devs.  The question they are probably facing with our complaints is how do you balance out a class that has the ability to do a number of things?<br />
<br />
I find that the biggest problem I have is the speed of the group compared to my classes speed.  I am always in the process of casting something.  If its not slow, heal, another round of the FA rotation, a nuke, then its Canni IV.  The farther I progress in the game the less valuable Canni IV becomes, because I literally do not have time to cast that spell.  I am not even sure I would want a new Canni spell because I would still have to load it and keep wearing out the keyboard hitting my hotkey.  <br />
<br />
Some things that I have found to work out sort of: (most of these are pretty obvious)<br />
<br />
-Our heals only seem to balance out if we are grouped with a pally- it seems the combination about equals a druid's healing power, but the pally needs to be properly geared/aa'ed to keep up with the speed of the game as well.<br />
<br />
-We work well with an enchanter in the group.  I have found that using slow's aggro is great for pulling adds off the MT, and usually by the time they get to me the enchanter has them mezzed.  I then root them to lock them down.  With us covering slows a chanter seems to have an easier time controlling mezzed mobs and any pet if applicable.  Also, a trick I normally use is to slow the chanter's incoming pet.  That gives the incoming mob 2 people on its hate list (MT and myself.) Then I just cure disease the pet once under control. <br />
<br />
- Put the mage to work debuffing the mobs.  Slow lands that much<br />
  quicker.<br />
<br />
-Your AoE poison rain spell is your friend.  If there is no mezzer in the group have the melees push the adds together and watch your dps skyrocket.<br />
<br />
-Quiescence makes a wonderful ghetto rune if you have no idea what you are doing.<br />
<br />
-Tae Ew Ritualist Mask is a must have- right click invis from inventory.<br />
 Better if you can get the Gather Shadows Ring.<br />
<br />
Plenty of other tips out there.</div></div><hr />
