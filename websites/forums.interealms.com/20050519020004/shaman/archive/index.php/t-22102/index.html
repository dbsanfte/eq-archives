<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A buddy of mine and I were chatting over a cup of coffee the other day and he asked me if Id ever been to Howeling Stones..I raised an eyebrow and said..&quot;uhhhh&quot;.. He laughed shook his head and said I didnt know what I was missing..Last time I heard that I ended up going to fear and getting spanked...So, that being said, is it possible to solo there as a 63 shaman, and is the loot soloing there..Plus I found out you need some damn key, how long and boring is that little quest..Just currious..Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was farming AA's there when 60 was the max level. I still farm AA's and loot there today when I'm bored...it's that easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I love messing around in HS but remember one thing. It is possibly THE WORST zone to CR in. Each hall needs a different key. The first hall key drops from devourers at zone in. It is Lore and No Rent. If you die once you pass the north door you wil need someone to come loot another key or log out for 30 minutes so the old one poofs on you. Theres a quest for a master key that will open all doors. Its a fun quest but something yiou wont be able to do solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The funnest part of Howling Stones is running past all the harm touching scorpion guys that climb all over the globe entrance without invis dropping.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HS is great if you have a long time to devote to it. Takes me just over a couple of hours to clear the north and west wings to gain access to the south side (which is where I am right now collecting drops for my 7th cudgel *sigh*).<br />
<br />
Like Tat said, CR is a bitch. I ended up begging an SK buddy of mine to summon me recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I duo'd the master key with my necro and a BST.  The master key goes on your keyring, is permanent and will open any wing you like.<br />
<br />
the key to get into HS is easy,  Need a jade Chokadai prod from LOIO and the xalgoz fang from kaesora and that's it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HS is a blast, but remember, if you use OT Outpost for anything (not like anyone cares now, but in the Kunark and Luclin era, it was a bigger deal) that zone will wreck your faction faster than any other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">aye, HS is on VS faction. Get rdy to be KOS at the outpost, even if you are an evil race :/</div></div><hr />

Eh, what?<br />
If you can't survive while you're equipped, how are you going to fight back to your corpse while naked?<br />
No Rent items don't ever poof off corpses.<br />
The Lore tag doesn't check your corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Like they said, do the key quest.  There is a master key quest that is suprisingly easy.  You can do it in an hour or two with the help of a rogue.<br />
<br />
It goes on the keyring, and then you can go into any wing you like, dead or not.<br />

<br />
How do you get to your corpse where the key is when the key is on your corpse?  It's like having all of your coffins for corpse summoning sitting on said corpse... dilemma huh?<br />
<br />
I don't think a no rent key would go on your key ring or be soul bound, but I dunno... don't wish to experiment really lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With a knowledgable rogue you can do the master key quest in less than an hour.  3 of the 4 parts of the key are droppable.  Bring a bunch of ITU potions and chances are you can skip 80% of the mobs on the way to the only non-droppable part of the key.  If drusella is up, might be a bit tougher though, since the last piece is in her room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hs is a blast and remember that the no rent keys will stay on a corpse so when you are ready to leave duel someone and leave the no rent keys on a corpse ... do this until you get the master key</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">HS fantastic zone, and adding that key was the a great thing as all the keys being norent was incredibly annoying. There is fantastic loot in this zone, the South is the best from my perspective, although North and West also give credible loot if I remember rightly. Just watch the traps, and some of the mobs summon especially the named and undertaker skeletons if I remember rightly.This is how dungeons should be made not crappy ones like Ldon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The pieces to the master key are not no-rent, but the keys to the wings are.  They are two separate things.  That said, the wing keys have some nifty clickable buffs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Soram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">there really isnt any walk through<br />
<br />
there are 4 things you need to make the master key.<br />
<br />
they drop in each wing.<br />
<br />
3 of them are items, the 4th being the combine bag.  Its on the floor in drussel's room.<br />
<br />
collect all 4 things, combine them, bam.. you have the master key.  click on any door thats normally locked, and it gets added to your /keyring.  Put the master key in the bank or destroy it, you'll never need it again.<br />
<br />
You can now open any door in zone, in any order.<br />
<br />
Best thing they ever did for the zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Back in my soloing days I used to love soloing HS.  The aa exp was pretty good and a couple items sold for some decent money.  This was also the time I needed the quest skulls for my 7th cudgel so I had somewhat of a reason to be there.  Sometime after I got my 7th cudgel they upgraded Nurga/Droga and I left for greener pastures.  Last I heard there was a few mobs that can now summon you otherwise nothing has changed much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">http://members.cox.net/iwantavr4/hs/hsmkeyguide.htm<br />
<br />
a great walkthrough for the masterkey<br />
<br />
(and NONE are drops... they're all &quot;ground spawns&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The cool thing about the Master Key Quest is that all parts except for one are droppable and can be gotten by a SoS rogue.  So have the rogue go to each wing and grab the piece, then you have to go and clear Drusella's room or something to get the last piece.  Alternatively if you don't think you can solo that room or duo it or whatever, you could just pop on a Quiescence, run thru stopping in the far left hand corner and picking up the bag which is the last piece, and then running thru the far door, then next door, then across this other room infested with golems and such and thru a last door and then zone out a portal to the outside of HS.  Of course that's assuming you have the HPs to make such a dash and you don't get stunned a lot on yer way there.  A well-equipped shaman can solo the room without too much difficulty if Drus isn't up.  If she's up, you'd better be really a good player to have a shot at pulling that off.  <br />
<br />
The zone itself is home to a few higher-selling drops.  Like Sash of the Dragonborne (usually i get two to drop in 4 hours), Steel Hilted Flint Dagger (procs 650 DD, ranger/bst), and Adamantite Club (procs 60dd/6sec stun (worth bout 8k)).  There are some other items that sell for less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Adamantite Club (procs 60dd/6sec stun (worth bout 8k)).<br />
<br />
They still sell for 8k on your server? They're under 500pp on Xegony now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">you could just pop on a Quiescence, run thru stopping in the far left hand corner and picking up the bag which is the last piece, and then running thru the far door, then next door, then across this other room infested with golems and such and thru a last door and then zone out a portal to the outside of HS. <br />
<br />
Only one problem with this plan.  The door on the other side of Drusellas room is locked.  You would have to pick up the bag, put in the three other items, combine them to make the key, and finally open the locked door and continue the run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I had a rogue with me when I did this piece.  I had him agro room and run to zone out.  I walked over, picked up bag and gated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">And I'll add my comments about this zone too...<br />
<br />
I love HS, it's a great place to duo and solo.  I love to solo here, it's always quiet on my server.  Only problem I have is splitting some of the rooms where the mobs are dark blue.  I'll 2 box with a rogue sometimes, but I think I'll switch to 2 boxxing with a necro, so the necro can split.<br />
<br />
Once you get the master key it's real easy.  I usually zone in, kill ZI mobs and then invis past the golems, usually S wing.  In the room behind the golems I summon, equip and buff pet, then just start pulling and crawling.  It's actually quite fun :)<br />
<br />
Stop by the bazaar or a friendly mage before you go and pick up 2 or 3 pet kits (muzzle, belt, 2 weapons).  Your pet can solo most of these with just an occasional Q, so he is handy for crowd control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If the only reason for boxing is to split mobs, consider pet pulling.  If your pet is green to the mobs there is no social aggro (unless the pet dies).  Using suspend minion 2, pet hold and a lower level pet, pulling singles is trivial really.  Try it : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">But if the pet dies before you get the mob out then you get the whole room.  And that sucks.</div></div><hr />
