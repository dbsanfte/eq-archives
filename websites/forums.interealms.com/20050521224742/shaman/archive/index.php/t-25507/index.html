<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, according to SOE, your characters on your account will stay for three months untouched, then will be deleted; however, I have friends who have had accounts cancelled for over a year, and their characters were still there when they came back.<br />
<br />
so, I hope that helps..</div></div><hr />

I think Sony has that clause about characters only being saved for 3 months as a &quot;CYA&quot; type of thing.  I don't believe they are actively deleting characters older than 3 months (since they know it isn't worth angering players that MIGHT come back to the point they definitely will never do so), but they want their bases covered should a character get lost due to database corruption, etc.<br />
<br />
The first time I left the game in 2000, I made this mistake of deleting my then-main character (a 35 Mage).  When I came back I ended up creating a Shaman (didn't realise then that I might be able to petition and get him back) and honestly consider myself lucky that I ended up changing classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, Mages are an interesting class to play, first character I ever played was a High Elf Mage, but that was on a friends account quite a number of years ago.<br />
<br />
I love playing a shaman, I've tried playing alts, but I don't really pay too much attention to them, a monk and a ranger...both kinda left unplayed after the first week or two, I go back to my shaman. I'll probably PL the ranger simply for a track bot... (you know...they should give dogdog the ability to track, it'd be fun, /petfind a_noc_swiftblade, and you just follow dogdog to mob)<br />
<br />
but yeah, 3 months is just what SOE stated, its not a hard number, because, like I said, I've seen people come back after over a year...</div></div><hr />

Does Canceling My Account Delete My Characters <br />
 <br />
  Question <br />
  Does Canceling My Account Delete My Characters <br />
 <br />
  Answer <br />
  Canceling your account does NOT affect your characters, only your billing information. If you cancel your subscription and then re-subscribe to EverQuest within 3 months, we guarantee that you will still have access to your game characters. Unfortunately, after that period we can no longer guarantee the validity of the characters. As we do not actively purge accounts, most characters will remain available. If you wish to reactivate your account in the future, you will need to use the same Station Name and Password that was used before canceling your EverQuest subscription.<br />

 I have a guildie that reactivated his account after a 16 month absense from the game. His characters and all gear where still where he had left em. Of course he was in a state of shock for about 2 weeks trying to take in all that had changed.</div></div><hr />
