<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im trying to find it and i cant , i wanna guage how tought itll be , though i already know its REALLY hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">fd ring from plane of sky quest.  can't think of the full name off the top of my head, but the drops are pretty rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Vermillion Sky Ring is the name if I remember correctly.  Bad stats and two charges of FD you can recharge.  The effect is very nice, but the effort required to get it . . eh, kind of overboard. You'd have to go on probably 5 PoSky raids before you got the right pieces for it.  And anyone who's been on a full PoS raid knows what a total drag even ONE raid can be.  I suppose it's much easier at 65, but then again, how would you convince people of that level to go there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">actualy im there right now and it is draging , i am starting to hate it , however , after being here for going on 10 or 11 hours , im sure we have atleast SOME of the parts ..<br />

Test of Snake<br />
Reward: Vermillion Sky Ring<br />
Quest Items: Bixie Essence, Emerald Spiroc Feather, Spiritualists Ring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good luck, I've cleared sky at least 5 times and only got the feather.<br />
<br />
The odds of getting the ring off the Sister of the Spire are pretty tough, she only drops one quest item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have had everything but the ring from Sister of Spire for 2 years now....I keep it stashed in the bank just in case....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That quest is evil and will make you cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the spiritualist ring is non drop ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes, no drop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Allakhazam's:<br />
quest: Shaman Test of the Snake (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=479)<br />
reward: Crimson Ring of Desinence (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1640)<br />
<br />
Is &quot;Vermillion Sky Ring&quot; the new name or the old name for the ring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Looks like they added a point of wisdom and changed the name. Hm...added 5AC also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There's not a lot of incentive to get beyond Spiroc island really.  Farming mage crowns I suppose, but the agony of Sky can be a bit of a deterrent.  <br />
<br />
I love the zone actually, but it's an incredibly awkward zone with fairly poor risk(effort really) v. reward.  The Stein of Flowing Ichor remains one of the great mysteries of EQ.  Who thought that would be an item Shaman would want?  The quest haste items are pretty decent though.  <br />
<br />
People already bypass content with duel/summon/revive.  I think they ought to enable Coth.  And loads of DT mobs is a bit of a drag.  Makes you have to drag more people around.  <br />
<br />
I finally got a Fairy Hide Mantle, after I don't know how many Spiroc Lord kills.  Probably 40.  Of course, it's not better than a DWS really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They would make it a much more viable zone if they let the keys go on your keyring. Or perhaps have a master key quest on the last island where you turn in all the lesser keys to get a master that went on your keyring. Then people might use the zone again.</div></div><hr />
