<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, Okay, we're all angry here about what we see on lucy. Plague of &quot;Delusion&quot; (cute, btw, I liked that name), The lure slows with terrible durations with a resist check that was essentially already given to beastlords for free.... No new nukes, almost worthless AA, and no upgrade to cannibalize.<br />
<br />
Yes, the way things stand, we have a right to be outraged. Especially with clerics getting an ability frighteningly like Cannibalization (details pending) and avatar.<br />
<br />
However things seem to be changing rapidly, so lets just ramp down on the freak out sessions shall we? Every week the AA's and spells change. If GoD comes out and our abilities are still crap, guess what? Eventually Sony's blind and deaf CR team will get word that the shaman community is really pizzed off, and they will do something about it, just like how the warriors got what they wanted after enough whining. So lets just calm down herre and watch what happens okay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">though there are a lots of threads this being another, and it might be better to have just one, i dont agree with the wait and see. if we had said nothing sure there might have been changes but only to tweek the stuff already there. <br />
<br />
it is much better to make clear now what is wrong then have to then wait 6 month or more to get it sorted out later. All you have to do is look how long it took them to short out our heals after kunark came out, or any other class that unbalance or not wanted? beast? warrior? all took for to long and much complaining to sort.<br />
if we have to wait this long shaman will be a class that is relagated to lower areas and possiblly disappear as shaman give up frustrated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah wait until it's too late and manifest during one or two years to be &quot;updated&quot; (like warrior and monk).<br />
<br />
ps: the duration is not a joke ,they have wait soooo long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">People are forgetting one thing. While the spells and AA's have been changing some, can anyone really say we have seen improvement from when they first hit test?<br />
<br />
The one time we thought things were going better was when we accidentally assumed the Canni spell would be an AA hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So lets just calm down herre and watch what happens okay?<br />
<br />
Would you take a no as an answer?  ;) <br />
<br />
Seriously if it was only one or two minor things or some 'not so good' additions, i would agree with you. Discussing the issues briefly and some /feedback would be enough.<br />
<br />
But NONE of the currently assumed shaman-specific additions is without blatantly obvious design flaws or gives anything of significant value to shaman's class role (and no, dog trainer is not our class role). Let alone that nothing of the concerns, that were voiced on this board for months now, is adressed in any form.<br />
<br />
We are not 'broken', but i fully support any efforts now to get our class tweaked and back on track to some defined class role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">after the initial outrage they change 2 weak ass slows to 1 better slow(still not good though) and a dot, so yes they have done changes.<br />
the fact they where horrible changes is why they test them, and get FEEDBACK. <br />
they need feedback to tell them what is ok and what not. (and overpowered but poeple arnt gonna feedback that so much:))<br />
without feedback they will assume that what they have done is fine, or might change something good. <br />
not all aa are bad critical afflicition good ,but really that should have been in with critical blast how long it taken them to add that?<br />
and second forte nice. but thats it:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You know, this expasion comes out in like 20 days..<br />
<br />
<br />
/tosses fuel on fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Honnestly, i'm not expecting any good changes from SoE now... Maybe I'm wrong (and I hope that I'm totally wrong :p).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't just do something; stand there!<br />
<br />
A sustained level of negative feedback from the Shaman community will better serve us in the future even if the GoD (by the way I find the acronym offensive) expansion goes live with poor upgrades for Shaman.  With making our collective voice heard now we will have more credibility in the future.  If in a few months the Devs have to review the Shaman upgrades after a bloody uproar from our community they can be pointed back to threads and posts from this pre-release time period and see that Shaman were indeed critical of the new spells and AAs from the get go.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Your spell was mostly successful&quot; crap for our slows.<br />
<br />
Is there such a thing as a consistent &quot;Partial&quot; CH?<br />
Is there such a thing as a CONSISTENT &quot;Partial&quot; nuke?<br />
<br />
CH's land 100% all the time.<br />
Nukes hit for full most of the time (with focus, full damage is exceeded!)<br />
But my freaking slows are not hitting for full ALL THE F***ING TIME in LDON Hards!</div></div><hr />

This is a point that is IRRELEVANT to the discussion at hand about GoD spells and AA's for Shaman.<br />
<br />
You have a problem with Slow mitigation?  You're about a year too late.  I have NO problems with this.  Slow has been deemed too strong and overpowering and I think that this is a fine solution for dealing with it.  Did you see what the INITIAL version of this was?  Before this you would land Slow and the mob's attack speed INCREASED. Ha ha.  Funny.<br />
<br />
Hell the gods in Time aren't Slowable period.  <br />
<br />
And I fight a TON of mobs that I have DDs that never land in full on.<br />
<br />
Back to the case at hand.  My Cannibilization options are ALL OUTDATED.  Hello, *how* old is Canni4 spell now?  And how old is the Canni AA even now?  Newer yes but it is not up to speed and on par with my level, gear, or the content that I am doing now.  Get me something that is ON PAR.</div></div><hr />
