<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zeuce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey all im a 52 shaman and i need money bad, was wondering if you all ahve some fav zones or camps to get some money or drops from, around my lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Branston Pickle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">my shaman friend was able to do ice giants at 51, in everfrost..<br />
<br />
it's ****-slow for plat, like 300pp per giant-camp per hour.. but it's okaaaaaaayish exp, and you can't beat raw pp drops<br />
<br />
alternatively, highkeep guards - they drop upto 6pp each and a fine steel sword, there are a lot of them.. i'm not entirely sure about the melee capacity of your pet, but the 49+ necro pets can blow through those guards with no help from its master, bagging the necro an easy 700pp-900pp per hour (depending on pet quality and PC actions, nuking etc), no exp though, my favourite plat spot now PoG is lost..<br />
<br />
this will demolish your faction with human cities<br />
<br />
you could probably get much better PP camping item x in zone y, but i like getting raw plat much more..</div></div><hr />
