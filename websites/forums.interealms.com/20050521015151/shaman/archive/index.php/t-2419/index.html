<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm finally at the point where I can afford a JBB.<br />
<br />
I've decided against trying to get the mob myself, simply because it's 1) tough to get a group there, and 2) I don't think my heart could stand losing a roll for one if it dropped. :)<br />
<br />
So, the question comes to mind:  How did other Shamans get their JBB?  Did you just sit around and auction?  Did you unleash your guild to ask around?  Did you get it as a gift?  Did you park yourself at the Duke's place and wait?<br />
<br />
Any advice on the best strategy to get one would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You know, this might be a good poll topic.  I wonder how many people actually looted their JBB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">paid 5k for it when i was level 51.  purchased from a friend.<br />

now i need to get one again since i gave away that one when i quit :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, a poll might be a good idea.<br />
<br />
And actually, what I meant was.... *how* did you buy it?  Did you get your guild involved?  Did you happen to be in EC or Greater Faymart when someone auctioned?<br />
<br />
That's the sort of thing I'm looking for (and I'm sure others are too) to make the search for a seller easier than I anticipate it might be at the rate I'm going. :D<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I traded right there on the spot. So.. I sorta got my JBB in the crypt.</div></div><hr />

When Mojo had &quot;quit&quot; a while back, he gave me his and I wore two for a while, until I was able to get a sweet deal for a fungi using the second JBB.<br />

Pretty much all my nice gear has come from friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ironically enough, the guy I traded it to was basically throwing a temper tantrum and trying to give or trade away all of his stuff for bad trades before deleting his toon. I later went on to join the guild he was once a member of. He then started playing again, PLed from 1 to 60 in roughly two months, begged me for the JBone back upon recognizing me, then ended up throwing another temper tantrum and deleting his toon again.<br />

Eventually got a tell asking how much I'd pay for one. Offered 9k. They said they wouldn't sell for less than 10k. Bargin! Welded it to my wrist (with burst of flame :D ) there and then. Found out I can root kite HG's (not really my style, but I was just testing) with it with no downtime. Had pet up just to kill of place holders.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I would suggest getting all your friends involved (possibly your guild, but I wouldnt count on them), not to help you auction, but just keep their eyes open for anyone offering one.  I had several friends looking for one, meanwhile I auctioned everywhere I went.  I saved up 15k to begin with so I was ready which was the going rate back then.<br />
<br />
Took about 2-3 weeks but finally a good friend saw someone auctioning one and let me know.  When I sent the guy a tell and offered 15k immediately he was ecstatic, I think he would have sold for a lot cheaper, but it was well worth the cost and I was already 52 or 53 at the time.  I found it quite handy all the way to 60, and not just for farming.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I was level 43 or so and got very lucky.  Won a roll on a Thick Banded Belt .  Someone somewhere else in LG that day happened to be looking for one, and they traded me a FBSS for it.<br />
<br />
Ran my green butt to EC, having the FBSS and about 2k to my name.  Someone was selling one for 15.  They rejected my FBSS + 2k offer, but he said he would give me the rest of the night to come up with 13k.  Tried and tried to sell that FBSS for 9k for hours, no buyers.  On my way back to the Neriak bank in dismay, I hit my /auc and *wham* someone in Neriak Commons wanted it!<br />
<br />
Being up to 11k, I frantically sold off my gear that I was wearing to scrape together the last 2k.  By the end of the night, most of my beloved Totemic was gone and replaced with Banded.  But I had my shiny new bracer, and never looked back :)</div></div><hr />

Your friend, isn't a friend if they charged you that much. Monetary system in this game stinks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The funny thing is I didnt have the cash soooo....<br />
<br />
I asked the person to hold it for me for a few hours while I make the cash.  How did I make the cash?  Lets just say it was like I did a server transfer since I was in the nude when I got my JBB. :)<br />
<br />
&quot;Selling everything on me at 1st Torch&quot; My guild and friends thought I was retiring. ;)<br />
<br />
I finally got the cash 8 hours later and a few hundred pp short but she let me go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I bought some silver chitin handwraps for 4k for my monk, about 2 days before they were upgraded.

You mean it can be looted from a mob?!? I thought you can only get if it drops by somebody at the autction &amp; market channel.   :)</div></div><hr />

I offered him my first born and pledged alliegance and all, but he just got a laugh out of it and moved on.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'd rather have my friend back and playing (so long as he was enjoying himself) than the JBB.  I rarely had a chance to group with him, but he's one of the better mages I've met and a great guy to boot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Oh, a sore subject, but a wonderful one as well.<br />
<br />
started building up fund to buy at L51, got it up to 13K but could not find it for sale. Kept farming giants and leveling, got up to 2Ok and could not find one for sale. was L54 and only offers were in the 20+K range. I think people in nfp learned i was getting desperate and tagged me for a sucker.  The prices kept going up.<br />
<br />
3 months go by with no success getting it even though I have money to buy it.  One work day I did not go into work right away due to a morning doctor appointment, and on a lark I logged on for 30 minutes to check. Put out my normal hotkeyed /WTB JBB message and got a tell from a player from Japan. He sold it to me for 10K with no haggling. A real gentleman.  Had worked up to 27K at that point.  I suddenly had an extra 15 K over what I had expected to pay, and instead of blowing it on other gear, i went back to leveling. I was extremely grateful and figured the extra money would help my spell fund someday.<br />
<br />
A week later got my first crypt group, and won a jbb. that day I traded it and my extra money for a fungi.  <br />
<br />
I am 59 now, and that 2nd Jbb is the only 10K + item I have ever won a roll on, and i got it after I really did not need it.  Game is ironic sometimes.<br />
<br />
What I learned was to check the market at different times. <br />
1&gt; Servers can have different economies at different times of the day.  This knowledge has served me well ever since.  <br />

3&gt;I also came to realize that never, never, never tell someone what you are willing to pay for anything. This continues to irritate me to no end.  People /auc saying they are selling something and then they say, what are you willing to pay, or make an offer.   Screw that.  Asking someone to Make an offer is saying to them, &quot;maybe you am really stupid/desperate and will wildly overpay&quot;.   <br />
<br />
It is a totally different matter however to say, I looted something and I have no idea what this thing is worth, and let them make an offer. I usually offer to get a a price check. <br />
<br />
If I walked into a store and they did not have prices marked I would walk out.  Can you imagine going to buy a car, and having the salesman say, make an offer, and I will tell you if I will sell or not.  This is absolutely nuts but Eq players have allowed sellers to get away with this forever.   After 3 months of getting jerked around on my Jbb, I now steadfastly refuse to play those mind games anymore.<br />
<br />
Today when someone says make an offer, I have a hot key, that says, &quot;/R Give me a tell when you figure out what you want for it. or get a price check and then we can talk.&quot;.  80% of people will be forthcoming and tell you. Others I refuse to do business with.<br />
<br />
I challenge people on this practice all the time.  (now i use mules to buy and sell for me)  I have actually had people say things like, &quot;you are a shaman, you guys overpay all the time for key stuff&quot;   and &quot; maybe you will overpay, it cant hurt to let you if you want to.&quot;   So, apparently the shaman community has a reputation of being desperate and it is a sellers market for jbb, fungi, malo, torpor, pox, etc.  As long as we are willing to state our level of desperation by naming our own price, we deserve to get slaughtered in the marketplace.</div></div><hr />

Turns out, a few months later I got another Trakasaur's Tooth to put back on my Rogue, so it only cost 2k in the long run.<br />

<br />
Asked the guy how much he wanted for it and he replied 14k.<br />
<br />
I had exactly 14k in the bank.<br />
<br />
Catch is, on tribunal they sell for 18 to 25k.<br />
5 mins after I bought it, 2 people were auctioning they were buying one and paying 20k.<br />
<br />
I'm still shaking..hehe.</div></div><hr />

 A guildmate named Gutak gave it to me.   Gutak was a very skilled chanter and all around nice guy on TM.  <br />

<br />
Ironically, the two weeks before I bought it, there were like 5 shamen auctioning WTB JBB, so I didnt even bother auctioning for it. A friend told me someone was selling a JBB in EC, and though I assumed it would either already be gone (to one of those 5) or the price would be too much for me (assuming the seller declined the offers of those 5), I sent him a tell. Yes, he still had them and price was ... only 10k. Must have been lucky. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I got lucky and won a White Dragon Scale on a bard-less Vox raid.  I held onto it for a bit until I saw a somewhat decent offer, and sold that for 52 K.<br />
<br />
Was auctioning to buy a JBB for about 2 days, when someone sent me a tell.<br />
<br />
I traded 13K plus a captains mallet for it.  So, the equivalent of 18 or 19 K, i suppose.  That is a high end price, but worth it to me, specially since i had just won the lotto sorta and didn't feel like waiting.<br />
<br />
I bought that, a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang, some various armor pieces, a horse, and i still have plenty left over.  <br />

Will hit 45 tomorrow. :) :)<br />

So then I camped the guy for four days, and he finally came on.  I had to compete with someone else offering 14k, a fbss, and 4 velious quest gems, but I managed to get it for 20k (fairly standard price on Bristlebane).   I had to borrow 5k from a friend to pay for it, but I am now two blue bubbles away from 45, and sooooo happy about my latest purchase.  Hopefully I will be able to use it to earn back the 5k I borrowed...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I guess the real question I have is related but not... What is the best way to make thousands of PP in EQ? I mean I have done HGs and Geonids..and while the cash is good and steady...even after a few nights, it's still no where near 10k or more... I wonder if I just never learned the right ways to make money in Norrath...<br />
<br />
Or maybe I just have no idea what I can solo and farm for sale..I hate that mentality, but money is money, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Really, the best way to make large amounts of money is to get lucky on winning drops and then being a smart seller.   Many people successfully play their server economy, consistently buying low and selling high.  There are people on my server in their 30s who have never been on a dragon raid yet buy and sell  hot commodities like CoFs and Trak bps.<br />
<br />
That method has never been attractive to me, which is why I never have any money and didn't get a JBB until 57 when a friend gave me one.<br />
<br />
I never struggled to purchase gear, but the nice gear came anyway.  Level up, network, make lots of friends and all the rest will come.<br />
<br />
When you consider the first wave of shaman made it to 60 while wearing mismatched totemic/RE and bits of JB, most current 50-60 shaman are wearing incredible gear comparitively.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, it's worth 15k. The friend only charged 'em 5k. I would love to make that person my friend.<br />
<br />
:) <br />
<br />
Overpriced.  It's a status item, not worth that much. I'd say it's worth the top end of 1k.<br />
<br />
If there were like 35k players, I would be in the ballpark.. but with 400k+, prices are inflated to insane levels.<br />
<br />
Goes back to my original saying... give me my own server for me and my friends so we can provide ourselves decent tech support :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Like Gloriana said, most money doesn't come from farming, it comes from trading.  However, you don't have to play West Commons and the auction channel like the stock market to make money in EQ.  You can also do tradeskills (lots of time and energy, but recently they've become worth it), do camps of rare mobs (there's this bear out in Everfrost people like a lot....) or you can even sell powerleveling services to twinks with too much plat.<br />
<br />
Of course, there's also more traditional methods, like getting to level 60 and then soloing the entrance mobs in Seb (depending on what gems drop, you can make a good 1k an hour this way) or getting in a good group in the crypt/4d, winning items like JBB and Heiro Cloak, and then selling them.  Or, you can just focus on enjoying the game, leveling, and doing quests, and forget about money/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Never owned one, don't really want one.   I have the THO spear that now clicks a 180 Nuke just like the JBB does, just less damage.   I also have Epic and a Bone of Bertox, which both click mana-free DOT's and both stack over Pox and Bane, so I'm pretty good for Mana free DPM.<br />
