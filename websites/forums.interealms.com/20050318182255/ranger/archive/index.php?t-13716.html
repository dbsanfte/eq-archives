I wonder who out there has invested much in to Lightning Reflexes and could shed some light on how much of a benefit you've noticed.<br />
<br />
Is it noticable at all?  CA1-3 at least we were told how much of an affect was granted (2%, 5%, 10%) and although I don't think Phys Enhancement is reported, I'm pretty sure it's widely accepted that PE gives 2% to all three skills.  So, does Lightning Reflexes give 1%? 2%? or, Knowing VI, does it give like 1/2% or less?<br />
<br />
Just wondered if there was any news about this skill.</div></div><hr />

He says it is a fine skill an if he made another ranger hewoul inest in LR also.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lightning Reflexes is broken atm.  I bought CA3 and PE before PoP came out, and was looking forward to getting this also.  However I heard it was broken, so before I bought lvl 1 of it I ran a large base test of CA3+PE to see what my miss/parry/riposte/dodge percentages were before it, then after I bought lvl 1 I ran the same test under the exact same conditions.  Result?  Absolutely no improvement at all.  This will be a cool skill eventually, but don't bother with it until they fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feeldary</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think the skills need to be fully maxed to get decent results<br />
<br />
i mean, when verant dev team created the AAs, they wanted us to make choice of specialization or something (they dunno we play like mad and get mass xp), and therefore i think they make the skills &quot;really&quot; effective when they are maxed.<br />
<br />
AM1 is booh, but once u got AM3 you are (supposedly) happy.<br />
CA : 2% is nearly nothing, then 5% might be noticeable, then 10% &quot;must&quot; be noticed<br />
...<br />
<br />
atm i got CA3 and 6 unspent points, they will go in LR and GotF as soon as PoP comes out in stores in Europe (booh!), and i ll try to max LR</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing is, people have LR5, and are also saying no improvement at all.  I thought I'd test lvl 1 to see if it was just hype or bad testing, but apparently its not.  They'll fix it eventually once enough people have it and parse logs to come up with the same whack results that I did.</div></div><hr />
