<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>baelish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick one here.  All the Shaman Epic guides I have seen only refer to the inferior Barabarians *grin*<br />
<br />
Is there anywhere which explains how the quest differs if you are Ogre/Troll/Iksar etc?<br />
<br />
Is there any difference at all?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No differences.<br />
<br />
Well, very minor, at the beginning.  As a troll, ogre or iksar (don't know about vah shir, think they are neutral) you will need to invis to go through NFP after giving the gem to the boozed up barbarian in the sewers.  Same words, same place to see the spirits, and all that.<br />
<br />
And you can start in Rathe Mountains, as well as OOT, to get the very first gem.  kill a bandit on the hill by the zone to lake rathe, in the clops area.  I went by tere a few times, and the spirit was always up already, because the cyclops killed the bandit chief ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Iksars get their first item in the FoB, I believe (barbs go to OOT, evils go to RM)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think gloriana is mistaken.  I do not believe that it matters what race or religion you are, you can start the quest with any of the spirits that spawn after killing the greenie wuss mob.  I started mine in blackburrow killing peg leg, but one time in RM I saw someone kill something (forget what) and a spirit spawned.  I went up and hailed it and had the exact same conversation I did in blackburrow :)  I could be mistaken but I think the only difference between the races is what the greater spirit says to you when you answer whether you follow hate, war, etc... and I am willing to bet that if a troll answered &quot;justice&quot; he'd get the same response I did as a barbarian :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>baelish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What about the bit in freeport where he asks what path he follows - anything different there based on your responses?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, it's different.  I could be wrong but I think that the spirits just make some snide remark about you using your power for the wrong purposes blah blah blah.  Once I actually have my epic I will go back and screw with the spirits and see what all the responses are.  I would do it now but I don't want to accidentily fooker my truespirit faction or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What about the bit in freeport where he asks what path he follows - anything different there based on your responses?<br />
<br />
Yeah, if you play a Troll basically the spirit tells you that you suck. I almost wanted to just quit the quest at that point, as it was obviously designed (as with most Shaman content) by a Barbarian-lover. Once my Troll finishes the SoF quest, I'm going back, respawning any spirits I can, and trashing my True Spirit faction. It's bad enough that my Troll has to run around looking like a bear, just so he can get some extra regen, but now when he walks around Grobb everybody laughs at him because he's helping out the pinky spirits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just meant that there is a spirit in FOB that is convenient for iksars. (I thought there was at least).</div></div><hr />

I just meant that there is a spirit in FOB that is convenient for iksars. (I thought there was at least). <br />
<br />
Oh, I see what you meant.  There's a spirit in FoB that's there for the good little iksars that never left kunark as they went from 1-50.  Ditto for the rathe mountain spirit that's there for the trolls that never left the swamp.  I don't know if that makes sense or not :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm a troll and I talked to the spirit in Nfp. =P Just used invis, it's not too hard, and I didn't feel like walking to RM at the time. (I was level 20 or so)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crystalflake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is also a bandit leader (halfling, if I recall right) on the jumble of broken ships in Timorous Deep who spawns a shaman spirit when killed, just like the others. Discovered this while helping my leezard husband do his shackle quests and the lil bugger jumped me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Peg Leg is in Butcherblock.  :)<br />
<br />
Also, when I talked to the Spirit in Freeport and had to answer which god I followed, I answered Fear (Cazic Thule).  The spirit told me it did not agree with my choice, but everyone serves the spirits, or something like that.<br />
<br />
Places I know you can start the quest:<br />
Field of Bone - Kill an Iksar Manslayer near Kurn's Tower<br />
Butcherblock - Kill Peg Leg<br />
OOT - Kill Captain something<br />
Rathe Mountain - ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Crystalflake, those bandits in TD are gone now...they have been replaced by 45+ mobs ( I just can't remember what they're called at the moment). No right minded person should go near those wrecked ships now....</div></div><hr />
