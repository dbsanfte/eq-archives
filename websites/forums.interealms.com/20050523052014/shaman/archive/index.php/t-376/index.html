<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
I just started a shaman because they are thought of as gods by monks (my main). Well I was wondering if i could ask some questions. I had alot before but seem to have forgotten alot :P. Will post them when I come up with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Is HP / AC more important than Wis and mana?. I cant find a quote from the monk boards but this is exactly what they said<br />
<br />
&quot; HP / AC &gt; WIS &quot;.<br />
<br />
2. How does Canni work?. Seems kinda ****ty to me since your like getting practically no mana for 50 hp which is alot (atleast to me... even my druid only has about 700 self buffed)?. I mean you can heal yourself but your using mana then... and regen... well that just sucks. Sitting down and staring... wow 7/tick!.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Will ask more as I think of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh just thought of another.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Can anyone suggest any cheap upgrades for my shaman totalling under 1k?. My shaman is wearing all my monk stuff (mainly) and has 22% haste. Hes using a Centi Warspear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Okay, let me have a try here.<br />
<br />
1) AC vs. Wis<br />
<br />
*Repost from an earlier thread*<br />
<br />
I'm a proponent of AC &gt; wis and let me tell you why I think that. Unlike clerics or druids who have no way to actively regain mana lost and are relegated to sitting on their butts when the mana runs out, we are blessed with cannabalize. <br />
<br />
The ability to convert hitpoints to mana is amazing. The process gets better and better, culminating with Cann IV and torpor (I guess can V, but I'm not there yet) at level 60. <br />
<br />
What does this mean? It means that our mana pool is not soley determined by wis/mana gear like other priests, our mana pool is governed by wis/mana AND our ability to quickly convert hitpoints to mana. I don't just have one blue mana bar, I have a blue bar AND a red bar, I look at my red bar as mana, just waiting to happen. <br />
<br />
What happens if a mob hits me for full damage? Some of my precious hitpoints (future mana) is eliminated. How can I conserve my hitpoints? Higher AC to mitigate hitpoint loss. The less damage I take, the more hitpoints I have, the more mana I can generate. <br />
<br />
This is why a fungi tunic + regrowth is such a powerful tool for shaman. When considering gear in your 50s, I would definitely not just consider wis and mana gear, but also AC and hitpoint gear and regen gear! (and resists as appropriate!) <br />
<br />
I'm not saying wisdom is a bad thing, not at all (especially with the recent changes that increased mana returns after 200 points), when I would consider a piece of gear, I would evaluate it compared to other gear for that slot. Did it have wis? AC? resists? hitpoints? <br />
<br />
Let's look at a velium ruby veil (no AC 8 wis 8 str) vs. an enshrouded veil (7 AC 2 wis 30 hitpoints 30 mana 10 fire resist). For me, the enshrouded veil is the hands down better choice, the increased AC, hitpoints, mana and resists makes it a far superior choice over a difference of a lousy 6 wis. <br />
<br />
You should definitely play whatever style suits you, but when you hit level 51+ with turgurs, your main role in a group is going to be to slow that mob as soon as possible. Mobs aren't going to like it, they're going to smack you around. Your role in a good exp group is to not suck up unnessary mana by either waiting to slow the mob and causing damage to the tanks that must be healed or falling like a wet paper bag when the mob hits you causing the cleric to waste mana on you. <br />
<br />
So, I don't have 200 wis, what happens in a typical group? Mob is pulled, I slow immediately, laugh at the few melee rounds that barely dent my hitpoints, throw on whatever other spells I want, redo group regrowth (or any other buff that needs doing), cann my mana back so I'm back to full mana before the next mob comes. The cleric is so bored, she has mana to nuke, the mobs are lined up like an assembly line and we have NO downtime at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Benefits of Cann<br />
<br />
2. How does Canni work?. Seems kinda ****ty to me since your like getting practically no mana for 50 hp which is alot (atleast to me... even my druid only has about 700 self buffed)?. I mean you can heal yourself but your using mana then... and regen... well that just sucks. Sitting down and staring... wow 7/tick!<br />
<br />
You're right, Can I + chloro isn't the most expedient mana regen.  It gets better with regen and awesome with cann III + regrowth and slobbery good with Can IV + torpor.  <br />
<br />
You'll find though, even at the early levels that health regens faster than mana.  So, you can can can can a bit and while medding (which you would be doing otherwise, right? I mean, how does your druid med?) your health and mana will increase.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, one of the devotees of &quot;cann dancing&quot; will post.  Cann dancing is a great tool to take advantage of the spell casting of cannabalized combined with the benefit of &quot;sitting&quot; for the actual med tick. <br />
<br />
Around level 51 or so, I realized that unless I was memmng a spell, there was no reason to sit, ever.  <br />
<br />
3) Gear<br />
You didn't mention race.<br />
<br />
Basic gear (1K isn't a lot to work with)<br />
<br />
Full sent of banded (medium of possible, to take advantage of totemic quests later)<br />
Forest loop earrings (imbued ivory if barb)<br />
New blackened iron meddallion from RE<br />
Charred Guardian Shield<br />
Strawspun belt<br />
Silver/plat ruby veil<br />
Silver jasper rings (to be replaced as soon as possible)</div></div><hr />

Strawspun belt<br />
Silver/plat ruby veil<br />
Silver jasper rings (to be replaced as soon as possible) <br />
<br />
The Silver/plat ruby veil? I would go with the Banded or Goblin Forged mask(or something the 8ac 15hp one from droga) over the Silver/plat ruby veil. <br />
<br />
If your using the monks gear to use the 6ac/65hp rings are very good. <br />
<br />
The charred guardian shield imo would be better spent on a clay guardian shield same price to. Thats just what I would do to except those few changes. Oh yea and a Slime Coated Harpoon for a poker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi, Thanks for the response.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to the shield and weapon, isnt 20/30 with my borrowed monks 22% haste good?. I know its 2hp... but at like 9-13 Im sure I will outdmg warriors, rangers and the like with it...<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and race is barb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry Winsome, was trying to think what I was wearing as a newbie!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you had 1k to spend as a newbie? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was thinking about what I was wearing from 1 -30.  I never had 1K at any given time,  but I did spend money over 30 levels.  Somehow by level 30, I had a full set of banded, lizard scale mantle, cheapie wis jewelry, charred guardian shield (cost 400 plat!!!) and my beloved staff of the observers!  My dream piece of gear at this level was the runed mith bracer, so beautifully lavender but sadly out of my price range, it cost over 1200 plat!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1) Work that defense, its more important than any single piece of gear you have (barring fungi, epic and jbb). Gain as much as you can as early as you can, simply since it will save you time and effort later.<br />
<br />
2) When you first get canni its simply a way to reduce downtime ever so slightly or when you need that last shred of mana to finish something off. Canni dancing is simply the best of both worlds, you get the regen of sitting down medding and the little extra kick from a canni in between.<br />
<br />
3) Levels are important, they make you go from &quot;no we would rather have a REAL healer&quot; to &quot;how much cash do you want to join our group, we badly need a slower that can take a kick to the head... please...&quot; :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">:p hehe Glorr yea I can see where you got that.<br />
<br />
Well the only problem I would see is with the 20/30 piercer you have is that  the dmg cap till 20. But if ya like it I would use it up till 30 or so when you would want to switch over to 1hd and shield for the stats on both. <br />
<br />
Though the Slime Coated Harpoon at the lvl your at with your haste would be hitting faster(by a bunch) and just as hard as the 20/30 piercer would because of the damage cap! Mostly just do want you want to do and have fun doing it! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lemme give you a lil lesson as an Iksar Shaman<br />
<br />
Canni is hella good.. Slap on a chloro + bear form and you're regening 17hp a tick. Canni 1 = 50hp for 20m.. I usually canni two times, then sit. so while im medding i get an extra 40m, and i can regen 100hp in about 7 or 8 ticks. <br />
<br />
Canni is not used to get back all of your mana, it just helps you. 50hp is nothing as an iksar shaman. Chloro + bear + natural regen is godlike. <br />
<br />
So before you diss Canni why don't ya read up on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One thing to consider are your multiple weapon skills.  You'll ideally want to keep piercing, 1hb, and 2hb trained.  For a 1hb, I'd look for a centi warhammer or a smoldering brand - nice two handers include the drakkel sledgehammer or icegrinder, gatorsmash maul, frost giant femur, groaning mace.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shaman can use the Centi Warspear now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Short of a fungi/iksar bp with regen, the absolute best items for a youngster of any class are 6ac 65hp rings and 2ac 35hp 25mana earrings. 200hp extra at low levels makes a HUGE difference. <br />
<br />
After that, its AC and HP for me. With 142 wis and around +100mana in items at level 23, I find myself above 50% mana in most group fights. I slow mobs, heal, and buff my group with no huge problems and with my high AC and maxed defense skill I can tank without a huge amount of hp loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Low delay weapons are much much better than a higher damage weapon.  You will have a cap on damage early on, and with a longer delay weapon you won't get skill increases as often.  A very fast weapon will be much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am not going to take credit for this it was posted to these boards in the past I kept hold of it for reference material.<br />

Arkand Eagleseeker's Guide to Canni-dancing <br />
<br />
First, let me make sure you all know there's nothing secret about the canni-dance. Verant is well aware of it's usefulness and the design of Cannibalize may have been intended for this use. In fact, one friend of mine was taught the dance by a GM (not a guide, a Verant employed server GM). <br />
<br />
Canni-dancing is, to put it mildly, annoying. It requires significant micro=management, interferes with conversation, and causes the other healers in the group to be constantly on edge; however, it has significant advantages for long term and emergency mana production. <br />
<br />
First, let's understand how mana is generated. Every 6 seconds, the server sends a HP and mana update to the client. The amount of HP and mana gained are dependent on a number of factors, but the important one for the canni-dance is sitting state. If the PC is sitting at the moment the server does it's calculations, the PC recieves sitting HP and mana regen. The number for HP is dependent on level and spell/item regeneration. The number for mana is dependent on the meditation skill, clarity/manasong, and the rare Flowing Thought items. The equation for meditation seems to change over skill, but at 200+ skill, it seems to run at skill/10, capped at 25/tick. Lower levels have reported skill/5, so the effect of meditation skill may suffer from diminished returns. Regardless of the actual lower level med-&gt;mana equation,. skill/10 will be used in this document. Further, a tick is defined as 6 seconds long, and begins with the HP/mana update. <br />
<br />
Cannibalize first comes into the Shaman's life at L24. Med skill at this point should be 125, or 12 mana/tick. Cannibalize converts 50HP to 20mana at this point (casting time is 2 sec, recast 5). So merely by standing and chain-casting Cannibalize, the PC gains mana much faster than medding. There is a HP cost, of course, but emergency mana production is greatly advantaged. In 15 seconds, the Shaman can gain enough mana to cast the L19 Healing spell, which could be a lifesaver. The actual maximum mana production rate of Cannib alone is 20x6/5 = 24 mana/tick and the HP loss is 60/tick. There is, however, another way to use Cannib that will serve to greatly increase long term mana production. <br />
<br />
One can notice that the casting time, 2 seconds, is significantly less than a 6 second tick. That means cannib can be cast immediately after a HP/mana tick, and then be sitting down long before the next mana tick arrives. The recast time is 5 seconds which means the spell can then be cast after the next tick. By casting Cannibalize in between the HP/mana regeneration ticks, the SHM can gain 12+20 mana per 6 second tick, or 32 mana per tick. This exceeds the straight chain-casting of Cannib by 33%, making it faster mana production. Additionally, the PC loses 50 HP/tick rather than the 60 of chain casting Cannib. This is more mana/second for fewer HP/second. It also limits the harm of fizzles, since a SHM can recast the spell before the next tick, thereby maintaining the higher mana regen rate despite fizzling. With straight cannib casting, fizzles decrease overall mana production rates. This is the Canni-dance -- casting Cannib between the HP/mana regeneration updates. <br />
<br />
To Canni-dance, first go to full screen 800x600 mode. You want to be able to bring up the transparent inventory window, which has this very convenient HP report for you. Mana and HP are regenned at exactly the same time, so that HP meter will serve to tell you when the tick occurs. So, if you aren't damaged, stand and cast Canni once, then sit. Wait until you see the HP's increase, then stand, cast Canni, and sit. Some people create a hotkey to do this (/sit off, /cast x, /pause y, /sit). You'll need to experiment to find the proper /pause value. I have found that in raid situations, there's too many lag spikes to trust a hot key, so I personally don't use it. To each his own, use what you think is best. After that, just wait for the HP to increase again and repeat. Be careful, you CAN kill yourself with Cannibalize, and it costs exp. <br />
<br />
If you can't enter 800x600 mode, then you'll have two options for detecting HP/mana updates. The first and best is for teh SHm to self-target and watch the higher resolution HP update in the selection bar. The second is to watch teh lower resolution HP bar under the SHM's name. The worst possible choice is to stare at teh mana bar, since the mana bar updates in smaller increments than a regenning HP bar. <br />
<br />
The problem with Canni-dancing at L24 is inefficient healing. Regen is the PC's most cost effective healing spell, at 5mana/tick for 10 minutes, or 500 HP for 100 mana. Converting that 500 through Cannib becomes 200 mana/10 minutes, and when you subtract the cost of regen itself, the actual mana gain is at best 100mana/10 seconds. If the PC has access to healing through other means (Bard healing song, for instance), more mana can be generated. <br />
<br />
At L39, the Canni-dance really starts to take off. Chloroplast increases the regeneration to 1500HP for 200 mana. Through Canni 1 (at this point, 50-&gt;23mana), this converts to 690 mana, minus the 200 casting, is net 490mana/15 minutes. Cannib 2 converts 67-&gt;28mana, for only 626, net 426 mana per 15 minutes. Now, that would seem to indicate the Shaman should stick with Canni 1 over Canni 2, but Canni2 provides more mana faster in emergency situations, and cuts down the number of Canni castings by 33%. This improves the micro-management a little, and increases the Shaman's communicativeness. Overall, teh spell may not be more efficient, but it's easier to use and worth the downside. <br />
<br />
L51 also inherently aids the Canni-dance by increasing sitting HP regeneration from 2 to 4. This occurs again at L55 when it rises to 5/tick. Any regeneration increase converts into mana for the shaman <br />
<br />
Regrowth at L52 is the next boon to Canni-dancing. at 2250HP over 15 minutes. This converts through Canni 2's 67-&gt;31mana to 1041mana, or net 704mana/15 minutes. <br />
<br />
And at L54, Canni 3 converts 74-&gt;36mana. This increases mana production to 1094/15 minutes, 794 net. The biggest problem with Canni 3 is the horrible fizzle rate. It runs about 20%, so the Shaman finds chained fizzles common. Don't try to cast a fourth Canni, or you'll miss the med tick. <br />
<br />
This continues until L58, where the Canni-dance ends with Canni 4, right? Wrong. Canni 4 changes the rules, but the canni-dance can continue, should the Shaman desire it to. Canni 4 changes the casting time, so that many think the Canni-dance stops being possible, but it only changes the details of the dance. Canni 4 is a 2.5 second cast with 7 second re-cast, and the conversion ratio is the same as Canni 3, 148-&gt;82 instead of 74-&gt;41. (Other spells can be cast 3 seconds later, but Canni 4 is grey for 7 seconds.) Canni 4 greatly improves the fizzle rate, down to about 5%. Since 7 seconds exceeds the 6 second tick, it can't be used for sequential ticks, but obviously could be used every other tick. So first and msot obviously, the Canni-dance continues through L59 at one cast every other tick.</div></div><hr />
