<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After an unbeleivable night in CoM (more **** ups than you can imagine) I have my epic :)<br />
<br />
Did every step and each one only once.  Was bricking it as well as some of our methods were rather un-orthadox, and just before handing my tear to Lord Rak I was REALLY wishing I had handed in an extra set of Ghiosk books or something just to make sure, but there wasnt a problem thankfully (well - not with my faction anyways).<br />
<br />
Needed 3 rez's afterwards, although the xp from the final hand in is very sweet.<br />
<br />
The raid kind of went as follows:<br />
<br />
All arrive in CoM, decided to try and pull Neh rather than have to fight up to the top (in hindsight fighting to his spawn point may have been quicker).  1st attempt, ranger pulls, I hail, nothing happens except ranger dies and someone didnt see the DONT ATTACK message and died as well.  2nd attempt - didnt even see where ranger had pulled to, ranger dies, Neh returns to spawn point.  3rd attempt, monk pulls, FD's, Neh warps away.  4th attempt, monk pulls, I had in ring as he FD's (really ****ting myself as I was worried about Neh warping back and me losing the ring), Neh aggros, we kill Neh, that part of epic sorted.<br />
<br />
We then kill reavers till Lord Rak spawns.  Someone aggros Lord Rak.  Lord Rak goes on killing spree.  Lots of dead people about.  After our cleric manages to get back to CoM, rez everyone, we all buff and get ready for proper attempt.  Have 3 mages so shouldnt be a problem.  I hand in tear, Rak aggros, pets attack.  All going well until we get an add, enchanter charms add and sends him in against add.  For some reason Rak aggros and and goes legging it off across the bridge and then leaps into the water (bastard).  From there it all goes a bit pear shaped.  Finally get Rak out of the water (2 mages and numerous fire pets later).  He gets to about 20% health and then gates back to spawn point, summons me, kicks my unbuffed ass (death number 3).  Monk mate gets fed up at this point, runs up to Rak, hits attack and starts laying some serious smack down on his ass.  Couple of heals and about 30-45 seconds later Rak is lying in a dead heap on the ground :D<br />
<br />
Was certainly one of the more interesting Rak fights.  Have done that part of the quest a couple of times now and has always gone smoothly, just typical it was for mine that it all went a bit wrong.  Got my epic tho so I am happy :D<br />
<br />
Just want to say thanks to my guild for being awesome and coming to CoM for the fight.  Had a huge turnout for it which was absolutely great (even had to turn a few people away as we just had too many for me to try and cope with).<br />
<br />
It is days like today that remind me of why I play this game, seeing loads of people all coming to help a friend in need.  Was an awesome night :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gratz, I am hosting Fear June 9 and hope to get that part done then and Rak the next day. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mucho gratz brudda!!! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grats Kronenbourg!<br />
<br />
Was the psycho monk Weet ?<br />
<br />
I was duoing in there last night, assuming this all happened on the AB server :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup - monk was Weet :) Not sure if we would have got the same result without him.<br />
<br />
He was the sod that got me into EQ in the first place so wanted to be there when I got my epic :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1) Congrats. I won't say you  &quot; look &quot; like a Shaman, but SoF is nice just on appearance.<br />
<br />
Imagine being a necro<br />
<br />
Epiced_Necro_01: Ho-hum, kill, skelly, evil....<br />
<br />
N00bie: &quot;Say mister what's that?&quot; (pointing at staff)<br />
<br />
Epiced_Necro_01: &quot;Why it's my Uber Epic Weapon&quot;<br />
<br />
N00bie: &quot;You mean the culmination of weeks or work? BWAHAHAHA. It looks like a Apteryx head on a stick.&quot;<br />
<br />
2)  Monk mate gets fed up at this point, runs up to Rak, hits attack and starts laying some serious smack down on his ass. <br />
<br />
Amen to that. I can do about 1500 points in 9 seconds (inner Flame) with SoM and SoS.  No AA Uber abilities. Now TAKING Rak's Fire attack is another matter.<br />
<br />
Congratulations again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Congratulations mate :)<br />
<br />
I wish I could have been there to cheer you on ;)<br />
<br />
I better get off my arse and start working on mine again now :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">CoM is a great zone really - except I hate the lock door stuff.  Like rogues need help.  And can bards ever pick any door that's useful?  <br />
<br />
Congrats on the epic.  Your story was pretty funny, and certainly reminded me of a few of our own raids to CoM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Congratz Kronenbourg :)<br />
<br />
It's nice when loads of people you knew ages ago turn up to help you, just because they want to. When I did my Rak fight, I had idly mentioned to a few people that I was going for it (was meant to be a closed raid, out guild and allies). In the end about a dozen old friends from one of the more uber guilds on torv showed up. We had loads more people than we were expecting, it got a bit disorganised. But I think the self invited friends could have done it all without us anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Congratulation Brother!<br />
<br />
<br />
I was organizing a CoM raid to finish my epic and asked a mage for his help.  A couple days before the raid, he sends me a tell asking if I can get a port to EJ.  At this point it becomes a little surreal.  I zone into CoM and there's a group consisting of the mage, a second mage, an enchanter, and a shaman.<br />
<br />
Back past the goo house in a nice clear area stands Neh Ashiir.  They were farming reavers and brought her reaver all the way down and spawned he perfectly in a corner.<br />
<br />
They say, &quot;look behind you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned and there stands Rak Ashiir spawned in the exact opposite corner.  I was floored.  <br />
<br />
I turn in the ring and they kill Neh by chain casting elemental pets.  Easy as cake.<br />
<br />
Now for the wild part...<br />
<br />
The mage says, &quot;hand your item into Rak and run this way&quot; pointing towards the path leading to the T bridge.  I do this and he CoH's me.  I think Rak got one little smack in, that's all.  Aggro is cleared and the mage says, &quot;Now we have three hours to kill Rak.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I had my epic 10 mins later.  I was reeling.  They had it down to a science.  <br />
<br />
Huge, huge thank you to Razzl, Stalpus, Theremon, and the enchanter who's name escapes me.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Congrats!<br />
<br />
I got mine on Tuesday as well :)<br />
<br />
Good thing about mine was that for some reason Rak was stuck in the wall by the Reaver pull spot, you know the safe spot in corner before going around in the Reaver building.<br />
<br />
That made things alot easier, no worries on adds or anything. :)<br />
<br />
It feels Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood to have my epic finally. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">grats~~<br />
i want spear too =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Grats on your epic Kronenberg :)  Its one of the sweeter looking epics and will help a bit when soloing or occaisionally group exping (was great to have in Akheva last night).<br />
<br />
The raid that got me my epic was a little wierd.  We gathered a small raiding party to hold the zone till the West Coast folks could arrive.  I needed to do my last 2 fights.  Well we find Neh sitting on the bridge and we do her there (2 parties) saving us the hassle of going up, although we go up later and 5 chanters do the charm Jax thing.  While leving down from the tower, somehow, someone aggros half the zone and with only 2 clerics for 4 parties we tool close to 25 mobs (lost count at 18) with many close calls but no deaths (I nearly bought it 2 times but my drood friend is an awesome healer and kept both me and the MA alive).  As tough a fight as that was, we did have 5 chanters who really took control of that fight in a hurry (somehow they coordinated stun/mezz/tash duties in total harmony, a friend raiding with us was so impressed he later joined our guild).  Later when our mages get online we do Rak.  I was shaking as I looted the scale.  Was a really good day in CoM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nice, congratulations!<br />
<br />
I actually pulled my Rak from the house...took a few minutes and the rogue had to stand there and keep the door open..but eventually rak stopped casting on me and decided to follow into the waiting Jobaber fists of flame. ( eventually he did gate, but we just flooded in and smooshed him after that ) Final fight is unbelivably easy as compared to other epics I have been a part of.</div></div><hr />

Got stuck in 52 for a loooong time, kinda lost all motivation to level.  Ended up doing some Alt XP to get run speed 1.  All of a sudden I seem to have motivation again, I just need to find a sweet place to solo with JBB, Epic and Fungi at 54 as CS has started to really go light blue on me.</div></div><hr />

Entrance/exit to chardok, Perma pits (get a tank to duo), Hole entrance (HIGHLY recommend this one, made 1 blue exp every 1.5 hours non-stop slaughter no fungi on the light blues mobs with a 25%ish exp bonus, pet helps, just watch the crappy pathing, and some decent cash), solB bats/LDCs.</div></div><hr />
