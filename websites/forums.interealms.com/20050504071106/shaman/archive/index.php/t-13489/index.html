<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read somewhere that for smithing if strength is higher, that's the value used in determining whether you get a skill up or not. Is this true? Reason I ask is that with buffs and gear, I get my strength up to about maybe 250 (definitely could get it higher, this is just stuff I had on me at the time - not specifically bought for skilling), but can only get wisdom to about 200 without buying additional gear. Either way, I'm going to buy specific gear, but I'd like to know which stat to focus on when buying (also, if strength only applies to smithing, but maybe others are int/wis, let me know also). Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Smithing uses the highest of STR/WIS/INT to determine skill ups.<br />
<br />
All tradeskills use INT/WIS and some (like smithing) also have a third stat that can be used.  I &quot;think&quot; its DEX for fletching and jewelcrafting but dont quote me on that.  Check eqtraders.com for full information on all tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For chance of skill ups, a tradeskill uses the highest of your int, wis, and in some cases another stat.<br />
<br />
For smithing, strength does come into it. The highest of strength, wisdom and intelligence is used to base your chance of getting a skill up in.<br />
<br />
For fletching and jewelcraft, it's dexterity.<br />
<br />
I'd say if you mostly want to do smithing for now, work based on strength, since you can nearly max it with existing gear. If you want to do other tradeskills, plan to build up some wisdom gear, since most tradeskills have no third stat.<br />
<br />
Remember also, KEI and bear form give wisdom bonuses, so you don't really need to get 255 from items. If you're paying 10pp or so for KEI each time you're doing a skilling session, that's probably more cost effective than buying items to bump your wisdom up by that same 25.<br />
<br />
Side note, success/fail rate only works off your current skill, and has nothing to do with int, wis or anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Higher WIS only comes into play if you are a WIS caster.  Sorry, Warriors :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, higher int/wis applies to all classes and all tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Smithing had strength added because it made sense, and gave the tanks a skill they could do without having to build up int or wis gear. Likewise dex for fletching and jewelcraft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, warriors could buy wisdom gear for trade skills and it works just as well for them as it does for wisdom casters.  Of course, for wisdom casters such gear has the added benefit of helping them with their spell casting.  The poor non-casting classes are more or less screwed when it comes to most trade skills.  But if they have the money for either wisdom or intelligence gear to boost up their stat, and can find items that their class can use, then they can certainly switch gear for trade skill sessions.  It&#8217;s just more of a challenge for the warrior, monk and rogue types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dunno for sure, and I certainly don't have logs to prove it, but I am a firm believer in getting a VoQ, and casting Ferine Avatar on myself when doing any combines, plus the appropriate geerlock/philosophers stone, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can cap all of my stats just by taking some wis gear out of the bank and casting ferine on myself.  I always do this before I do any combines.  I don't know if it actually helps, but it definately won't hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does brewing have a third stat? I can only get my wisdom up to 195 with KEI and Greater Bear Form. I can easily get my str up to 246+ and my dex up to 205+ with hos and rage. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dex helps success rate on Tailoring combines but not skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are lots of pet theories about tradeskills, but if you head to http://eqtraders.com they have the best advice I've seen.<br />
<br />
Here's the FAQ on it: Stats and Tradeskills (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=31)<br />
<br />
It's commonly accepted there, after plenty of testing that the following holds true:<br />
<br />
- The highest of wis/int and in some cases a third stat is used to determine your likelihood of a skill up. The third stat is strength for smithing, dex for jewelcraft and fletching, and no other skill has a third stat. (Tailoring has been mentioned as a dex possible, but tests show it's not implemented that way yet.)<br />
<br />
- *ONLY* your current skill determines your success probability, for all tradeskills.<br />
<br />
So, brewing is dependant on wis or int only and dex doesn't help tailoring at all, though some people are superstitious and max wis and dex both. :)<br />
<br />
If you can provide proof that dex effects tailoring success rates, head over to EQ trader's corner and post it there - I'm sure they'd love to see it. If you want speculation about it, and people debunking that particular theory, I suggest you go to their tailoring forum and do a search on &quot;dex&quot;. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Q: What stats are used in what skills? <br />
A: For ALL tradeskills, the greater of your Wisdom or Intelligence will determine your skill-up rate. In smithing, Strength also affects this rate, while Dexterity affects Fletching. NO stat changes your rate of success, as far as we can tell. <br />
