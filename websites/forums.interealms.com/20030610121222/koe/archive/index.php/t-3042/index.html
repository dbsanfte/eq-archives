<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(disclaimer I am not a father nor even married so I guess these rules apply to me as well....gulp thinking of Rizz, Wulf or Hammer meeting me at the front door cleaning their shotguns)<br />
<br />
When I was in high school I used to be terrified of my girlfriend's father, who I believe<br />
         suspected me of wanting to place my hands on his daughter's chest. He would open the<br />
         door and immediately affect a good-naturedly murderous expression, holding out a<br />
         handshake that, when gripped, felt like it could squeeze carbon into diamonds.<br />
<br />
         Now, years later, it is my turn to be the dad. Remembering how unfairly persecuted I felt<br />
         when I would pick up my dates, I do my best to make my daughter's suitors feel even worse.<br />
         My motto: wilt them in the living room and they'll stay wilted all night.<br />
<br />
         &quot;So,&quot; I'll call out jovially. &quot;I see you have your nose pierced. Is that because you're stupid,<br />
         or did you merely want to APPEAR stupid?&quot;<br />
<br />
         As a dad, I have some basic rules, which I have carved into two stone tablets that I have on<br />
         display in my living room.<br />
<br />
         Rule One: If you pull into my driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package,<br />
         because you're sure as heck not picking anything up.<br />
<br />
         Rule Two: You do not touch my daughter in front of me. You may glance at her, so long as<br />
         you do not peer at anything below her neck. If you cannot keep your eyes or hands off of my<br />
         daughter's body, I will remove them.<br />
<br />
         Rule Three: I am aware that it is considered fashionable for boys of your age to wear their<br />
         trousers so loosely that they appear to be falling off their hips. Please don't take this as an<br />
         insult, but you and all of your friends are complete idiots. Still, I want to be fair and open<br />
         minded about this issue, so I propose this compromise: You may come to the door with your<br />
         underwear showing and your pants ten sizes too big, and I will not object. However, In<br />
         order to assure that your clothes do not, in fact, come off during the course of your date with<br />
         my daughter, I will take my electric staple gun and fasten your trousers securely in place<br />
         around your waist.<br />
<br />
         Rule Four: I'm sure you've been told that in today's world, sex without utilizing a &quot;barrier<br />
         method&quot; of some kind can kill you. Let me elaborate: when it comes to sex, I am the barrier,<br />
         and I WILL kill you.<br />
<br />
         Rule Five: In order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports, politics,<br />
         and other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information I require from you is<br />
         an indication of when you expect to have my daughter safely back at my house, and the only<br />
         word I need from you on this subject is &quot;early.&quot;<br />
<br />
         Rule Six: I have no doubt you are a popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other<br />
         girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have<br />
         gone out with my little girl, you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished<br />
         with you. If you make her cry, I will make YOU cry.<br />
<br />
         Rule Seven: As you stand in my front hallway, waiting for my daughter to appear, and more<br />
         than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie, you<br />
         should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process which can take<br />
         longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why don't you<br />
         do something useful, like changing the oil in my car?<br />
<br />
         Rule Eight: The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places<br />
         where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there are<br />
         no parents, policemen, or nuns within eyesight. Places where there is darkness. Places where<br />
         there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is<br />
         warm enough to induce my daughter to wear shorts, tank tops, midriff T-shirts, or anything<br />
         other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka zipped up to her adam's apple.<br />
         Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature<br />
         chainsaws are okay. Hockey games are okay.<br />
<br />
         My daughter claims it embarrasses her to come downstairs and find me attempting to get<br />
         her date to recite these eight simple rules from memory. I'd be embarrassed too - there are<br />
         only eight of them, for crying out loud! And, for the record, I did NOT suggest to one of<br />
         these cretins that I'd have these rules tattooed on his arm if he couldn't remember them. (I<br />
         checked into it and the cost is prohibitive.) I merely told him that I thought writing the rules<br />
         on his arm with a ball point might be inadequate - ink washes off - and that my wood<br />
         burning set was probably a better alternative.<br />
<br />
         One time, when my wife caught me having one of my daughter's would-be suitors practice<br />
         pulling into the driveway, get out of the car, and go up to knock on the front door (he had<br />
         violated rule number one, so I figured he needed to run through the drill a few dozen times)<br />
         she asked me why I was being so hard on the boy. &quot;Don't you remember being that age?&quot;<br />
         she challenged.<br />
<br />
         Of course I remember. Why do you think I came up with the eight simple rules?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morgrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL This is great!  I have a 6, nearly 7 year old daughter of my own and I will certainly be utilizing your rules in the not to distant future as my worst nightmares come true and she begins to date.  I know a few tattoo artists who can probably hook you up with a reduced rate just based on the concept alone.  Another on the way and due any day now but this one is a boy...I checked the ultrasound just to make sure and I am envious of him already.  Perhaps I shall have him memorize the rules also so he can be the perfect date :)  <br />
Happy Hunting</div></div><hr />
