<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, whenever i cast a spell, there is the little spell effects, but when anyone else, pc/mob casts one there is little/no effect graphicly. The little invis bubs show up some times, as do the purple ring around hte caster of a port spell. Please help, it didn't do this before, and now it does.<br />
<br />
Also, when i cast canni, this is annying then it is crucial, but when i cast it, my health goes up, then rockets back down, instead of just going straight down. <br />
<br />
Can anyone help me?</div></div><hr />

I'm sure you can find the exact reason .. but it has to do with WHEN your client machine reporting to the server that you casted cani in relations to the health/mana increase &quot;tick timer&quot;... <br />
Someone had figured out that sometimes you lose a little in this process and sometimes you when a little... but in the long ... AND BOY DO I MEAN LONG run to 60(heh, and I aint even there yet) you will probably come out even.... That is unless you're just that guy in life where NOTHING goes right ;)</div></div><hr />
