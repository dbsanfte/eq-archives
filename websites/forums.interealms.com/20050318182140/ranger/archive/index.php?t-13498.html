We lost, heh. We tried a second time and managed to reach him no problems but due to the unknown we were not prepared for this fight and did not win. <br />
<br />
 Went back again tonight for a re-match and guess what? Frist attempt to get to him he agrod us just as we enterd the locked door. Every single mob between him and the locked door in one little room=very bad;/ We didn't give up and went back in again thinking it was some dumb wierd chain agro or something, i dunno. reached the stairs and well guess who decided to re-hash the lastnights events with us, again.<br />
  <br />
 I am thinking maybe someone on a horse agrod through the walls or bard song +puller chain agrod the whole castle. Whatever it was this place is stupid and I hate Grummus, thnx.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what they did, but obviously something works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Araya Le'Bon</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what you have to realize about the castle in PoD.<br />
<br />
It is an outdoor zone.  Therefore LoS restrictions do not apply.  Things will aggro right through the walls(mistmoore ring a bell?).  <br />
<br />
The guards right before Grummus(the unmezzable ones) will usually attack you if you even go near the stairwell.  If Grummus happens to be in the room just below stairwell at that moment he will add.  Best to have someone scout with an eye and make sure Grummus is not in the room.  May as well just pull whatever comes too, as splitting is a pain for monks due to the casters.   It's easier to offtank the guards than to have your monks die over and over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TS worked very nice with him and kept the Rangers safe from AE.  First time we killed him, projection lasted like 10 mins or less.  Glad VI now fixed the duration.</div></div><hr />
