<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Could someon post and eplain how exactly do I load a new skin or Ui.  Please explain exactly which folder the new file goes in, if it goes in a folder or what I need to copy.  THanks for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go to:<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com/<br />
<br />
and look at the faq, its really easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had a lot of problems with it until I realized that the ui zip file that I had downloaded had a problem and downloaded a different one and it worked fine :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Basically, in your Everquest directory is a folder called UI files. In that folder is a folder called 'Default'. That contains all the files for the new interface.<br />
<br />
If you want to make a custom interface, copy all the files in the default folder into a new folder and rename it. Then you can download (or create) custom files and you put them in the new folder you created. Once finished, just type /loadskin 'xxxx' while in the game ('xxxx' being the name you gave the new folder).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You don't need to copy any of the files from the Default directory to your new UI directory. In fact, this will cause more problems than it was intended to fix. The EQ client is now a little &quot;smarter&quot; in that it will now load any files it doesn't find in your custom UI folder from the default folder.<br />
<br />
1) Find a UI you like.<br />
2) create a new folder (name it whatever you want) under the UIFILES folder in your EverQuest directory.<br />
3) Unzip all of the files in the new UI into that directory.<br />
4) Start EQ<br />
5) Once in game type &quot;/loadskin &lt;directoryname&gt; true&quot;<br />
<br />
Most complete UI's come with a &quot;UI_charactername_##.ini&quot; file that you should rename to your characters name/server. This is the file that contains all of the windows/UI parts x,y coordinates. Otherwise you'll be manually positioning them which can be a real pain in the butt.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqinterface.com is the best source for custom EQUI mods I've found.<br />
<br />
G'luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also worth noting: check the upload date of the UI you're trying to get to work. I've come across older full conversions that don't work anymore.<br />
<br />
Also, also, give a look at the Vert full conversions. One of the more popular ones for people who don't want frills, just cleanliness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wincer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The first time I saw a player-made UI, I thought it had a mana number.  I have have only seen % since then.  Probably I was mistaken the first time.  Is there any way to include a mana calc in an UI?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">note:  do NOT copy any files you are not modifying.  If you do this you will break everytime they patch.  <br />
<br />
You only should put modified files in your new skin directory.  All other files will be found in defualt and VI will update defualt with every patch. so you get the updates automatically.<br />
<br />
I have yet had the need to remove my skin because of an update.</div></div><hr />
