<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urgit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, as a non-shaman I would suggest the following to reach balance and make shamen desireable in groups (my best friend is shaman so i personally love to have em in group)<br />
<br />
Slow:<br />
To make Shaman the No1 slower again there could be 2 ways:<br />
1: Make the new GoDslow break through mitigation on at least all non boss mobs (maybe tough to script)<br />
2: Raise the slowpower of the new slow to 80-90% or so.<br />
Overpowered? I think not since it is only available in hard GoD zones that the lesser players will not be able to conquer (the casual BoT expers).<br />
<br />
Heals:<br />
one or more of 3 changes would help:<br />
1: New quie, bah make it 5-600 hp/tick to make it useful.<br />
2: Add a Group Quie, maybe for 300/tick only maybe more, and make it MGB-able.<br />
3: The new Fast heal, make it 2200 or so RAW healing (plus aa and focus)<br />
Overpowered? I think not, quie is virtually useless unless during medbreaks as of today and shammy spamheal has to crit to help anything when mobs hit for 990 and way up.<br />
The mgbable group heal would be a nice raid addition making shammies more helpful.<br />
<br />
Buffage:<br />
Easy Pickens, just make shammy buffage exceed statcaps, well not all of them, but Focus and Boar should, possibly wrulan too.<br />
Group FA would be a tad too good imo.<br />
<br />
Dottage:<br />
Maybe a minor tweakage or a new line of shorter duration dots, possibly adding to and revamping Bane-line dots a bit.<br />
<br />
Nukage:<br />
Well maybe one bigger nuke would be concidered balancing but i think it would not be necessary to help the class.<br />
Face it, Shamen cannot be Wiz+cleric+slower+necro of the raid/group, make them best at slow+debuff and make their buffs worthwile again and then shamen would once again be wanted in groups.<br />

Slow:<br />
To make Shaman the No1 slower again there could be 2 ways:<br />
1: Make the new GoDslow break through mitigation on at least all non boss mobs (maybe tough to script)<br />
Sadly the fight duration in these zones is usually too short for this to be useful. If Balance of the Nihil actually landed well without other debuffs then this might work.<br />
<br />
2: Raise the slowpower of the new slow to 80-90% or so.<br />
Overpowered? I think not since it is only available in hard GoD zones that the lesser players will not be able to conquer (the casual BoT expers).<br />
A 75% slowed MOB deals two and a half times as much damage as a 90% slowed MOB . . this may work with mitigating MOBs but it will utterly overpower shaman anywhere you can reliably stick unmitigated slows. I would rather see MOBs mitigate slow less or not at all then some sort of fix that is not enough in areas where we need help and too much in areas where we do fine.<br />
<br />

I am not sure if we need a 2200 unfocused heal but the current Daluda's is not enough. As for HoT upgrades I am not sure if they would help our situation. We need help in short, brutal fights. HoTs are best in long endurance fights - where we do not need the help. An upgraded spot heal and an area (not group) or rain style direct heal would probably work fine.<br />
<br />
Buffage:<br />
Easy Pickens, just make shammy buffage exceed statcaps, well not all of them, but Focus and Boar should, possibly wrulan too.<br />
I am not sure if that is possible to code. They can certainly add similar focus style effects in place of the stats though (combat effects for dex, strikethrough for strength etc.)<br />
<br />
Group FA would be a tad too good imo.[/QUOTE]<br />
Why? We can already keep our own group supplied with it easily. If it needs to be limited let it be castable on our own group only (possibly still MGBable). That way you would actually be able to keep less people FAed, but you get your spellgem back and you click a lot less.<br />
<br />
Dottage:<br />
Maybe a minor tweakage or a new line of shorter duration dots, possibly adding to and revamping Bane-line dots a bit.<br />
Unless DoTs get shortened yet more or are made unresistable and have their aggro reduced they will not be useful where we need the most. I have had single group fights in GoD where MOBs did not last three full ticks and that was without an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Nukage:<br />
Well maybe one bigger nuke would be concidered balancing but i think it would not be necessary to help the class.<br />
I do not see a problem with giving us similar nukes to cleric nukes or enchanter nukes, especially considering that our entire DoT lineup (which has already gotten devalued compared to other DoT classes) is entirely useless in large parts of GoD (and LDoN and to a lesser degree PoP).<br />
<br />
Face it, Shamen cannot be Wiz+cleric+slower+necro of the raid/group, make them best at slow+debuff and make their buffs worthwile again and then shamen would once again be wanted in groups.<br />
We do not want to be &quot;Wiz+cleric+slower+necro&quot;, we want to contribute to a group or raid. As this expansion has basically rendered debuffs, DoTs, HoTs and mana regeneration irrelevant we need either a ton of fixes to all of our spell lines, a completely new role or a revamp of the expansion.<br />
<br />
The only one of these I can see happening is a fix toour spell lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seems like everyone keeps thinking 1 dimentional.  &quot;I want better nukes like this class&quot;, &quot;I want better heals like that class&quot;.   Dont you guys want to be different in almost every way then other classes.<br />
<br />
DPS / BUFFING<br />
<br />
Our DoTs are useless.   I see no way in which the Devs can physically  implement (coding) our dots into fights that last only about 30 seconds.  I see no change with our DD in the future. Our rain spell must resist at least 1 out of 3 times or the world will come to an end.  How about this;<br />
<br />
Lets contribute our dps, just by buffing the melees in the group. I am not just talking about giveing them some lame attack bonus, from FA. I am talking about giveing them different form of Buff Procs.  For instance, we would buff the MT with some sort of stun/DD proc, while we buff the rogue with some sort of low initial DD/DoT proc.  Let the mana be about as large as how good the buff proc is, and make them last about the same time as FA.<br />
<br />
This would = let all of our attention on debuffing the mob and healing , instead of getting frustrated, trying to land some damage on the mob, with the little bit of time left in which the mob has to live.<br />
<br />
WE WOULD BECOME THE KING OF BUFFS ONCE AGAIN<br />
<br />
DEBUFFS<br />
<br />
After continuously using Balance, I really dont see much needed improvement on this particular spell, other then perhaps giveing it a -50 instead of -45 resist check (oh and that whole Tugurs/Balance overiding thing).<br />
<br />
As for the whole midigation thing,  this was done for a reason, and I dont see the Devs changeing this.     I am just being real here<br />
<br />
One thing I would really like to see though, would be to have an upgraded version of our OLD cripple spell.  I think its about time for a new version, dont you ?<br />
<br />
HEALING<br />
<br />
This idea had acutally been talked about by us and other classes, particularaly druids.  It is the idea of giveing shaman a 3 or 4 tick HoT spell, that would acutally be usefull during combat (1500 or so a tick). <br />
<br />
The only way this wouldnt be over powering, is to tack on a large mana number that would not be much more mana efficient then our regular fast heal.  <br />
<br />
Simple Scenario<br />
<br />
{The mob is pulled.  Chances are, Balance sticks.  You dont have to worry about landing resists debuffs right away, since your dps is already being worked on from the other melee classes.  You then help the cleric by HoTing and perhaps spot healing the MT (cleric uses less mana = almost as good as clarity).  You can then calmly cast malosinia (malosini neck if you have it), so it can be snared easier, before it runs away.}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unfortunately, Warbear, I think many would rather stray away from the overburden of buffing, and I'm one of them.  I didn't create my shaman just to buff others, nor was it or should ever be our primary role. <br />
<br />
Buffing others over and over = BORING.  If they improve the quality of our existing buffs that people ask for, then it'll be tolerable, but would like other avenues of skills that no other class touches, to spice the class up.<br />
<br />
Strong debuffs are always welcome in my book, as long as it's not shared by another class (malosinia with mages; cripple with enchanters, etc.), but unfortunately too many are.<br />
<br />
As far us asking for nukes &quot;better&quot; than others, you're flat out wrong.  We've ony asked that our nukes scale up like all the other classes.  Our nuke lines have been pitifully stuck for some time.  There's absolutely nothing wrong for upping our DPS.  Every other class have the means to show noticable dps that makes them attractive to join groups.  Clerics might not be far ahead of us, but we all know they get a special seat in any group or raid for other means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Group FA would be a tad too good imo.<br />
Group FA is too powerful?  This concept has always bugged me.  <br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar is a short duration buff that grants 140ATK and some useless stat buffs.  Strength and dexterity are already going to be capped on almost every character on which you can cast a level 65 spell by Focus and Diaku.  That is if they're not already capped by equipment.  140AGI adds, at most, 5 AC.<br />
<br />
Strength of Tunare and Spirit of the Predator add a total of 130ATK and are both group spells that last over an hour but aren not considered unbalancing.  Admitedly, SoT has stacking issues, but any character that considers HP &gt; ATK isn't going to want Avatar either.<br />
<br />
Share Form of the Great Wolf and Feral Pack both add 65 ATK in long lasting group form.  60% movement increase and Ultravision are probably both more useful than the stat buffs on Avatar.  Heck, the wolf illusion probably has more value than the AGI component, even in the current version of the game that makes faction meaningless.<br />
<br />
There are bard songs that add ATK to the entire group.  Since I don't have a clue if they are affected by amplification, I'm not even going to comment on them.<br />
<br />
So, why exactly is Group FA unbalancing?  Probably the same logic that put 50% haste on Talisman of Alacrity.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Even proofreading three times can't find all the spelling errors.</div></div><hr />

I can see one way. Make the Bane line unresistable and take away the curse counters. It still is not going to run fully but now you can stick it while thr MOB is incoming and not have it resisted and not get instant aggro.<br />
<br />

We are talking about an upgrade to a Kunark spell here. Just make it last as long as Turgur's and up the resist modifier to match Malos. It reall is ok to replace a spell completely if it happens 7 expansions, 14 levels and hundreds of AAs later.<br />
<br />
One thing I would really like to see though, would be to have an upgraded version of our OLD cripple spell.  I think its about time for a new version, dont you ?<br />
I really only used Cripple on bosses to reduce flurry and the likes. How about a -200 dex debuff?<br />

If it costs as much as our spot heals it basically comes down to trading healing focuses vs. durations focuses. Oh, and it frees up some time for casting, which is nice of course. About the biggest downside I can see is actually overhealing our cannibalize damage. Trushar overheals as is. It would be a nice spell though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just curious why shamans *aren't* the no.1 slower already.... I think we are.<br />
<br />
We have the best slow, the fastest slow, the longest lasting slow, the only slow with a resist modifier, the only AE slow, the only disease slows.<br />
<br />
The only reason why we may not be the slower of choice for groups is because of the our *other* abilities compared to what the other classes bring to the group.<br />
<br />
I like Nihil and I think our slows are fine now. I think we need to concentrate on what else we bring to the group, because if someone wants the best slower, they already ask shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We have the best slow, the fastest slow, the longest lasting slow, the only slow with a resist modifier, the only AE slow, the only disease slows.<br />

<br />

<br />
I don't see the spells as the issue on slows. The issue comes when we bring mitigation into the picture. Mitigation, especially partial and slight, makes the difference between our slow and a Beast's slow to small to notice. We have this ratio we are forced into with heals, that I have felt should also have been applied to slowing abilities when they added the BL. The small difference in percentage of slow, added with the other abilities that are brought to a group greatly reduce the desirablity of a shaman in a group as we all know. We also know that the Devs will not get rid of mitigation by mobs.<br />
<br />
So the question becomes how can we address this imbalance in slowing ability and other benifits to the group, while mitigation is in place. The solution I see is allow the Shaman class to mitigate, the Mobs mitigation for non boss mobs. Trash_mob_01 normally mitigates slow to the partial range, with Shaman mitigating this, the mob would mitigate shaman slow to mostly instead of partial. This is enough to produce a visible difference that a group could see, hence making the shaman the desired slower. This would effectively produce enough ability gap that enchaters would be seen in a similar fashion as druids, with healing, when it came to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slow mitigation affects how much the slow slows by, and this closes the gap between shamans, but we still have the best slow even under mitigation and we still have advantages in all the other areas of slowing.<br />
<br />
If we want to maintain the gap even on mitigated mobs, I rather think the answer would be to change how mitigation works, rather than to give shamans ways to work around mitigation. After all, mitigation is there for a reason, they put it in to lessen the impact of slow - so giving shamans a slow that breaks through mitigation would be counter to the idea behind it in the first place.<br />
<br />
To maintain the gap, I think a better way would be to have mitigation work additively rather than multiplicatively.<br />
<br />
Currently, with say, 50% mitigation:<br />
Shaman slowed = 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375 overall<br />
Enchanter slowed = 0.70 * 0.5 = 0.35 overall<br />
I agree that this is marginal.<br />
<br />
A new system, aimed at having roughly the same slowability... Mitigation 0.40<br />
Shaman slowed = 0.75 - 0.40 = 0.35<br />
Enchanter slowed = 0.70 - 0.40 = 0.30<br />
<br />
Something like this would maintain the gap  between shaman and other classes, but wouldn't involve any new slows that cut through mitigation or are unresistable or anything like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can see one way. Make the Bane line unresistable and take away the curse counters.<br />
<br />
That is what Bane was, when it first came out on Beta.  It was great for fast kills and PvP.  But of course Shaman cannot have any real offensive capabilities, unlike druids and necros (which all have resist modifiers).  So once it went live, they nerfed the sh$t out of it, to where it is now almost useless.<br />
I am pretending the devs had a reason why they did this, so I doubt it will get changed, even after all of the feedback that was given over this.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is why we need to come up with a &quot;fresh apporach, fresh idea&quot; plan.  I mean common, why nukes ?  Everyone has them.  Why not come up with something to where we dont have to spend much time at all to add DPS to the group, and which doesnt cause much more added agro tacked on to our debuffs.<br />
<br />
Only thing I can come up with atm.<br />
&quot;Lets contribute our dps by buffing the melees in the group with Buff procs.  For instance, we would buff the MT with some sort of stun/DD proc, while we buff the rogue with some sort of low initial DD/DoT proc. Let the mana be about as large as how good the buff proc is, and make them last about the same time as FA.<br />
<br />
This would = let all of our attention on debuffing the mob and healing , instead of getting frustrated, trying to land some damage on the mob, with the little bit of time left in which the mob has to live.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spirit Anger&quot; = cast a spirit upon a person that would proc 475 initial DD, and a 3 tick dot at 330 a tick.   Lasting 6 min. with a 3 min recovery time.<br />
<br />
Average dmg to each mob          = 1200+<br />
Average kills in 6 min (with pulls)  = 6-8<br />
Total average dmg                    = 8000-9000 dmg<br />
<br />
So 8-9k dmg over a 6 min period, should cost about 900 mana or so.<br />
<br />
(This could also be our way to fix the dps with our pets)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh my dear lord.   If there was anything that could make me quit playing Thor in a heartbeat it would be MORE spells like FA. I've already had to drop a spell from my line up to make room for the spell spawn of evil that is FA; having to put OTHER short duration, long recast mana hog spells into my spell line up is going to cost me more spell slots that I dont have.  If Sony added more spell gems then I might consider memming more than one of those type of spells but I would still not want to cast them because of the duration.  While being more usefull in a group situation beyond BoT is important I dont think that it should come at the expense of fun for the shaman; Being changed to casting one of 3 or 4 short duration long recast buffs after I slow is NOT what I would consider fun.<br />
<br />
Now, as to healing...<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
1500 a tic....for 4 tics?  Can you imagine what the outcry from clerics would be?  They would collectively **** a brick.  And so would I.  But what is most troubling is your proposed mana cost.<br />
<br />
Tnargs efficency=<br />
1300 healed / 450 mana = 2.88 hp/mana<br />
<br />
Daluda's efficency=<br />
1550 healed / 490 mana = 3.16 hp/mana<br />
<br />
Ok...lets work with Daludas, as thats our most efficient heal.  Healing 1500 a tick for 4 tics would make the total amount healed 6000 hp.  In order for that to be AS effeicient as our Daluda's, the mana cost would be...are you ready?<br />
<br />
1898 mana<br />
<br />
6000 hp healed / 1898 mana = 3.16 hp/mana<br />
<br />
To be the efficeny of Tnarg's, it would need to cost 2083 mana per cast for a 2.88 efficency rating,<br />
<br />
ARE YOU INSANE?  Did you work the numbers before you proposed this heal or just grab the first good number that came inot your head?    I wouldnt care if they gave this spell out free in PoK; I wouldnt use it.  <br />
<br />
The best HoT in the game is Holy Elixer, which heals 600/tic (4 tics) for 480 mana.  Efficency is 5 hp/mana.  Breath of Trushar is more efficient at 6hp/mana, but the point is bigger heals, usually at thecost of effeciency.  Shoot for something along those lines.<br />
<br />
How about:<br />
<br />
550 hp/tic (2200 total) for 460 mana.  That gives you an efficiency of  4.78hp/mana.  Clerics still get to stay on top if the healing pyramid but shaman get a nice boost in effectiveness.  A fix like this still doesnt do the job of blast healing (which is more important IMO) but hey....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The only slippery slope I see with having &quot;Mitigate slow mitigation&quot; AAs in the new expansion is that knowing Sony, they'll get lazy, so next time they need to give Beastlords or Enchanters new AAs in another expansion, they'll pull from what they already have.  Thus putting us right back in the same position, just delayed six months or a year.  Sony needs to make a determined effort to truly make us the best slowers in the game, or give us some other, new(and probably universally hated since best slowers is an awesome attribute already) unique aspect.  If they add AAs for mitigating mitagation, then they need to put these in our Class list and keep their hands off them in the future.</div></div><hr />

ok then, how a bout a 'buff' that is a kin to assideous vision, yu cast it on a warrior/monk/knight etc, and basically yu imbue them with yur spirit, when they get hit yu take a small % of the damage *shrugs* 10% something, but yu get to add to their attacks.<br />
<br />
Say they swing 3 times a tick, yu imbue spirit them yu bind yur sight to them and yu 'add' 2 extra attacks and a bash or kick or whatever they got extra, which yu control, however yur using their attack rating damage cap etc... kinda like a charm but rather than dominate the PC yu coexist with them.. does that make sence??<br />
<br />
OR/AND<br />
dots we all complain that theyre not worth the mana to cast  on a mob as they last a tick or 2, well how about this change aka to bst's when they had to buff their pets... we cast our dots BoS, BoN, Bane, BoU. they land as buffs on dogdog and when the old pooch is engaged in melee with a mob they fire off when hes not attacking they dont fire off (maybe let them be casted on other mobs too bu then they revert to being the old school buffs) the other side to this insetad of dogdog buffs, is that dependant on the line (poison, magic,disease) yu 'summon' a extra 'pet' (super shrinked size) so disease look like the pusslings, poison look like crystaline spiders, and magic look like *shrugs* ghosts?? i dunno, basically they attack the mob dealing their damage in swings and they remain until they've spent their full damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The only slippery slope I see with having &quot;Mitigate slow mitigation&quot; AAs in the new expansion is that knowing Sony, they'll get lazy, so next time they need to give Beastlords or Enchanters new AAs in another expansion, they'll pull from what they already have.  Thus putting us right back in the same position, just delayed six months or a year.  Sony needs to make a determined effort to truly make us the best slowers in the game, or give us some other, new(and probably universally hated since best slowers is an awesome attribute already) unique aspect.  If they add AAs for mitigating mitagation, then they need to put these in our Class list and keep their hands off them in the future.<br />
How is being the best slower &quot;an awesome attribute&quot;? It used to be, back in Luclin and PoP. With the combination of fast fights, moderately high resists and slow mitigation being the best slower is just as useful as being the best porter post-Luclin.<br />
<br />
For slow to be worth casting it needs to prevent more damage then you could heal for. Given our crappy healing this is usually still the case, although barely in GoD.<br />
<br />
For slow to be worth grouping a shaman for it+shaman healing needs to prevent more damage then another cleric or at least a druid could heal. That simply is not the case anymore.<br />
<br />
For slow to be &quot;awesome&quot; it would have to prevent more damage on its own then a druid could heal and still leave the shaman with mana and time to do other things. That has last been the case in Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A 75% slowed MOB deals two and a half times as much damage as a 90% slowed MOB . . this may work with mitigating MOBs but it will utterly overpower shaman anywhere you can reliably stick unmitigated slows. <br />
<br />
just to play devil's advocate here, since when has overpowering a class relative to older content been a concern of SoE .. Bards can solo kunark dragons now, groups of rangers can take out gorenaire. I believe a SK soloed gorenaire a few months ago. You can kill Vindi with 10 people .. and maybe less now. Seru with 12-15. Rathe with 40-45 (well not anymore after the LD bug in earth b)<br />
<br />
The reasoning that increased slow % makes shaman stronger against &quot;old content&quot; falls right in line with SoE's normal progression of class power levels.<br />
<br />
This idea had acutally been talked about by us and other classes, particularaly druids. It is the idea of giveing shaman a 3 or 4 tick HoT spell, that would acutally be usefull during combat (1500 or so a tick).<br />
<br />
See, now this is a good idea, it could work like bane, be a 4 tick heal at something like 1500 per tick with a refresh of 24 seconds and a mana cost around 400ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">but of course .. if we do get a large amount heal over time you can expect a shaman to be casting the 1500 HoT heal on the tank every fight every raid .. <br />
<br />
which of course .. probably woudlnt' be such a bad thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oh my dear lord.   If there was anything that could make me quit playing Thor in a heartbeat it would be MORE spells like FA. I've already had to drop a spell from my line up to make room for the spell spawn of evil that is FA; having to put OTHER short duration, long recast mana hog spells into my spell line up is going to cost me more spell slots that I dont have.  If Sony added more spell gems then I might consider memming more than one of those type of spells but I would still not want to cast them because of the duration.  While being more usefull in a group situation beyond BoT is important I dont think that it should come at the expense of fun for the shaman; Being changed to casting one of 3 or 4 short duration long recast buffs after I slow is NOT what I would consider fun. <br />
<br />
-As this spell would be a substitute for a DoT or DD that you would have memed before, I do not see any problems with filled up gems.<br />
-Since you would only have to cast this spell evey 6 min, instead of every kill (DoT / DD), I would think this would even be easier on us.<br />
-If you have a problem casting buffs on people, I would seriously reconsider being a Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, as to healing...<br />
1500 a tic....for 4 tics?  Can you imagine what the outcry from clerics would be?  They would collectively **** a brick.  And so would I.  But what is most troubling is your proposed mana cost.<br />
<br />
Tnargs efficency=<br />
1300 healed / 450 mana = 2.88 hp/mana<br />
<br />
Daluda's efficency=<br />
1550 healed / 490 mana = 3.16 hp/mana<br />
<br />
Ok...lets work with Daludas, as thats our most efficient heal.  Healing 1500 a tick for 4 tics would make the total amount healed 6000 hp.  In order for that to be AS effeicient as our Daluda's, the mana cost would be...are you ready?<br />
<br />
1898 mana<br />
<br />
6000 hp healed / 1898 mana = 3.16 hp/mana<br />
<br />
To be the efficeny of Tnarg's, it would need to cost 2083 mana per cast for a 2.88 efficency rating,<br />
<br />
ARE YOU INSANE?  Did you work the numbers before you proposed this heal or just grab the first good number that came inot your head?    I wouldnt care if they gave this spell out free in PoK; I wouldnt use it. <br />
<br />
- As I stated already, this was not my idea. It was already discussed by us and other classes.<br />
<br />
- It would be Quite usefull, despite your &quot;Calculations&quot;<br />
1) Most clerics that really need Shaman help to heal the MT Requires us to spam our fast heal anyhow. (Daluda's Mending x3+ times)<br />
<br />
2) If you Figure in everything, it is quite efficient. <br />
 - 1500 x3 would be around 1400 mana.  {not bad}<br />
 - HoT spells are effected by our AAs and Focus effects, Thus adding an additional tick or 2 on this.    (6000+ heal / 1400 mana)  4.28+ efficiency<br />
 {This would dramatically improve our role as a healer during combat, due to the speed and efficiency of this spell, compaired to our regular heal}<br />
<br />
&quot;Thorzion, Did you work the numbers before you cut down this heal or just grab the first good number that came into your head?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Oh, the issue is not us soloing Kunark dragons even easier now. The problem is, there are still fully slowable MOBs in GoD - where a 90% slow would be insanely powerful since these are usually the ones you have to offtank.<br />
<br />
At the same time it would be a tiny increase in effectiveness on mitigating MOBs.<br />
<br />
Getting a 150% increase in slowing power vs. the MOBs we need the least help with and maybe a 20% increase against those we need the most help with does not seem like a good plan to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
slows, we covered this pretty well.<br />
<br />
dps, shaman are probably the worst dps class in the game for groups/raids due to either painfully slow cast or truly Massive agro. nothing like tanking raid mobs because you are putting out a blistering 60dps and you get summoned over the hate procc wielding hate procc augmented taunting/disc taunting warrior whos putting out 100ish dps. and the wizard whos cranking out several hundred dps.<br />
<br />
its time the shaman Shed the old Vision entirely, its time shaman were given at least ONE area where they are the clear absolute undisputed king. a new line (or revamped old line) of low agro/high dps dots. buffs that matter, a buff thats so sweet you save mgb so you can do it mid raid instead of burning it on focus. maybe one huge fat nasty disease nuke with a long recast but in the 2-3k range. (and please dear GOD dont make it a 2.5 minute cast time like most of our nukes are already) <br />
<br />
shaman are the Charlie Browns of eq right now, we are just wishy washy. we have no dominance at all in any area, many of our core abilities are duplicated on classes that bring more to the table and its long past time for a fix.</div></div><hr />

No, I don't think there's any reason to throw out the old vision of Shaman at all.  We just need to be updated to the times.  We need mitigation to be curbed back or some way to counter mitigating non-boss mobs, we need shorter cast times on our nukes, we need slightly better buffs and we need dots that either do more damage per tick or tick faster with less aggro(drop the counters).  Sorry, but everyone whining about &quot;stats don't matter, everyone is maxed out&quot; you're not taking into account the whole picture, and the whole picture includes many more people who are not maxed out, than people who are and stat buffs matter to these people.</div></div><hr />

You might not use it, but I would.  With modifiers applied this spell would be approximately 1400 mana and run for 6 ticks, or 9000 heal. That means with 6 k+ mana and hitting canni once in between I can problably run this spell for 30 ticks, or around 3 min.  That would actually make a difference in a GoD or time boss fight.<br />
Unfortunately heal over time spells don't stack, so it be probably limited to one shaman per raid.  But it would make a great spell, maybe as a comming ancient?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once again, here we are comparing apples and oranges.  To pre-elemental characters, stat buffs most certainly do matter.  Their gear doesn't get them to the stat caps.  To elemental+ characters, no, stat buffs don't matter.<br />
<br />
Now the whole issue of Shaman balance is *not* pre-elemental!  It's not!  Yes, certain things become more difficult as you progress, but up until elementals Shaman can compensate with AA's and gear to maintain their effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Saying that adding stat buffs will help balance Shaman is not true.  To the Shaman of a level where stat buffs matter, balance is *not* an issue.  To the ones who are feeling the balance pinch, stat buffs are in fact worthless.</div></div><hr />

It would be awesome if slow was not mitigated and fights were longer and resist were lower. Speeding up fights nerfed slow all by itself, upping resists made it a lot worse and then slow mitigation makes slow nearthly worthless.<br />

You're both saying the same thing guys.  Changes are required.  The difference is that the more drastic changes are required at the high end of the game as the differences are apparently more noticable there.  That said, changes are also noticable for 65 shaman doing tougher pre-elementals in more limited situations and settings.  You are both saying that faster fights give us fewer opportunities to be as efficient/effective as many other classes.

I think you are forgetting the fact that with a 75% slow the mob will only get one swing where it would have gotten 4. To carry that out further, the Cleric now only has to cast 1 CH instead of 4. This could conceivable be extended to the group being able to pull 4 times as many mobs before having to take a med break. We can take this to the extreme and say that this could take the 4 hour trial and reduce it to 1 hour. <br />
<br />
The groups I hunt with regularly, almost never pull a single mob. Typically we have 2 or 3 mobs a pull, which keeps the chanter and I both busy locking down the mobs, getting them slowed and debuffed. In this kind of situation I am not going to worry about healing the tank, that is the clerics job. If the chanter of cleric starts getting hit then I'll heal them.</div></div><hr />

We can take this to the extreme and say that this could take the 4 hour trial and reduce it to 1 hour. <br />
We can also take a look at what actually happens in the game where you do not have a zero mana, instant recast time, no aggro unresistable unmitigatable slow.<br />
<br />
This is what happens: The MOB is incoming. You may or may not need to cast Malos. Let us say, if you do it happens while the MOB is incoming. The tank engages. You cast slow. Let us assume you do not get aggro from that. Your slow may or may not land at this point. If it does not you have to wait a while before you can try again. If it does it gets mitigated. Overall it is quite likely that you will spend 400 mana per MOB to slow him after about 5 seconds on average. This is on MOBs that take 20 seconds to kill. So your slow percentage will be about 60% overall on MOBs that do not mitigate slow. 40 to 50% is far more likely. And you are not doing anything else then slow and malos and generate mana.<br />
<br />
Overall you may double the cleric's healing rate. In theory that is. In practice you produce spikes in damage output, by slow aggro and by reducing swings per second instead of damage per hit. You will probably still save the cleric a good deal of mana though - about 30 to 40%.<br />
<br />
Of course the group could just take another cleric, reduce the risk of someone dying, not worry about resists at all, have another rezzer and have a lot more healing overall as well as more emergency heals. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Akinwande</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">To maintain the gap, I think a better way would be to have mitigation work additively rather than multiplicatively.<br />
<br />
Currently, with say, 50% mitigation:<br />
Shaman slowed = 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375 overall<br />
Enchanter slowed = 0.70 * 0.5 = 0.35 overall<br />
I agree that this is marginal.<br />
<br />
A new system, aimed at having roughly the same slowability... Mitigation 0.40<br />
Shaman slowed = 0.75 - 0.40 = 0.35<br />
Enchanter slowed = 0.70 - 0.40 = 0.30<br />
<br />
I agree 100%.  I believe this is the way that slow mitigation should have been implemented all along.  Using multiplication to calculate slow mitigation only multiplies the problem (how novel of a concept is that).  Subtracting the mitigation from the original slow percentage maintains the class balance pertaining to slows.  Coders could then design the mobs around what the maximum percentage they wanted the mob slowed to be.  If you feel a mob should only be able to be 25% slowed at most, then make them mitigate 50 (through subtraction).  At that point Enchanters would only slow by 20% and Beastlords by 15%.  This maintains the 5% gap.<br />
<br />
As for all the other thing needed, such as healing power, and modified stat buffs, I can't speak to those as I'm only 36th level, and my healing is adequate and stat buffs are still needed.  I can however see things getting bleaker as I progress.  The problem with using percentages for everything (including healing comparisons) is that you are using multiplication in the calculations.  When you use multiplication, the bigger the numbers get, the larger the spread is.  Dev's need to keep in mind that if Shaman are only gonna heal 50% (forget the actual number) as good as a cleric, then 50% of 5000 point heals (new age) is a lot worse comparativly (hp/heal) than 50% of 2200 point heals (post era).<br />
<br />
So basically, in a nutshell, what this inexperienced, know nothing shaman alt is trying to say....<br />
<br />
Mitigating, comparing, or balancing by %'s only multiplies the differences.  Devs need to realize this and adjust accordingly.  Balancing by subtaction maintains class balance much better, and I believe would make people much happier.  But it doesn't take a math wiz to see this, it seems common sense to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't notice anyone mention anything about this, and didn't want it to slip through the cracks.  I kinda like this idea from what I'm hearing.  While the rest of the description seems to overcomplicate things, I kinda like the basic principle.  Taking a percentage of the MTs damage upon ourselves would be yet another way of indirectly healing them (much as slow does currently).  Everyone keeps asking for a &quot;unique&quot; solution to the situation, and this one truely seems like a possibility.  I'm sure it needs some tweaks to the numbers, which I am far from qualified to supply, but the coding already exists (IE Warriors shielding, Mages splitting damage with their pet).<br />

Just something I thought stood out and may merit honest discussion.  Adding some sort of attack onto it also just seems over-complicated.  Maybe a 2nd buff that Infused a portion of your ATK onto a character would be a nice possibility too.  <br />
<br />
I would think that something like this would once again show merit to grouping with a Shaman.  It would once again support the addage of &quot;adding a shaman saves mana overall&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">just to play devil's advocate here, since when has overpowering a class relative to older content been a concern of SoE .. Bards can solo kunark dragons now, groups of rangers can take out gorenaire. I believe a SK soloed gorenaire a few months ago. You can kill Vindi with 10 people .. and maybe less now. Seru with 12-15. Rathe with 40-45 (well not anymore after the LD bug in earth b)<br />
<br />
The reasoning that increased slow % makes shaman stronger against &quot;old content&quot; falls right in line with SoE's normal progression of class power levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seru became a 2 group mob with pop and our 40% disease slow.  Emp could be done by 3 groups (CC would be 2chanters w/ ancient rapture, 2 tanks, shaman, cleric; 11k+/2100AC warrior needs 2 cleric chain; a Druid could handle ramp healin).  A group of rangers can do Sontalak (one WS tanks, the others TS, when he goes down, next ranger takes over WS tanking).<br />
<br />
Now Rathe with 45?  I could see 60 but 45 is really cutting it.</div></div><hr />

They just do not happen.<br />
Between slow mitigation and fight duration you are lucky to get a 50% slow overall. And you spend an amount of mana on it that is usually at least sufficient for a CH if you had been a cleric.<br />
<br />
med breaks/mana regeneration<br />
There comes a point where you simply do not have time to regularly cannibalize anymore (nor have a need to). A cleric with maxed FT and decent buffs easily regenerates 70 mana per tick. CH costs about 340 mana. That means a cleric can cast one CH every 30 seconds forever. More importantly it means that with a mana pool of 6000 mana it will take a cleric that chaincasts CH (one every 13 seconds) more then 7 minutes to go out of mana.<br />
<br />
If a shaman tries to match either he will be out of mana well before the cleric and still not have healed as much.</div></div><hr />

You are aware that clerics are suppose to be the best healers.<br />
<br />
But then again clerics can't provide haste to others.  Where a shaman could and while healing.  :)<br />

Maybe with a shaman's ability to heal and buff we can drop the need for a cleric all together.  After all, that is what cleric does basically (heal and buff).<br />

<br />
I have my right to chime in when I believe there is nothing wrong with the shaman class and that some GoD content just needs to be tweaked.<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">You are aware that clerics are suppose to be the best healers.<br />
Which is why I specifically compared shaman healing + slow to cleric healing. I did not go into problems such as a slow resist on a somewhat challenging MOB usually meaning death for the tank if a shaman is healing. Or how utterly amazing divine arbitration is. Or how pacify will often prevent more damage then slow.<br />
<br />
Even if slow allowed shaman to heal/prevent as much damage as clerics we would still be far behind because heals are not resisted, do not have to be cast multiple times on multiple MOBs, are not mitigated, do not suffer from mitigation and can heal non-melee damage.<br />
<br />
That is not even going into group heals, emergency heals, Bulwark of Vie and superior HP buffs.<br />
<br />
But then again clerics can't provide haste to others.  Where a shaman could and while healing.  :)<br />
Shaman cannot provide spell haste. Shaman cannot rez. Shaman cannot pacify. Clerics cannot haste. Clerics cannot invis. Conclusion: the classes have a different spell set. Now, how does that relate to healing capabilities? Are you trying to say the shaman buffs are so much better then cleric buffs that they make up for the lack of pacify, rez and less healing?<br />
<br />
Maybe with a shaman's ability to heal and buff we can drop the need for a cleric all together.  After all, that is what cleric does basically (heal and buff).<br />
As opposed to a shaman . . ? In a group, if you need as much healing as a single cleric provides you need three shaman to match a cleric - that is two extra slots the group simply does not have. Any additional capabilities shaman have you now have two group slots to get them in. Even a shaman + druid only barely matches cleric healing and is strictly inferior to cleric + enchanter.<br />
<br />
Who can heal, buff, and haste????  Oh wait, in some cases we can.<br />
Oh, so any class that can heal, buff and haste has enough power? A level 20 beastlord can do that. That is seriously your argument as to why shaman are balanced?<br />
<br />
I have said it before but let me state it again. If shaman cannot heal close to clerics (not necessarily with group heals, spot heals, just on regular single pulls) you cannot consider them healers.<br />
<br />
Just as you cannot consider knights tank if they cannot tank adequately in single group content.<br />
<br />
If you can not perform your primary role adequately in the vast majority of single group content you are dead weight to your group. Being able to choose which of your abilities you want to be crappy at does not make a balanced class.<br />
<br />
This is a multiplayer game. Classes do not exist in a vaccuum and you have at the very least 5 group slots to pick classes that complement each other. Why should you pick the class that can choose to either heal badly or buff and crowd control/debuff worse then an enchanter? You are going to need both haste and healing anyways, why not pick the real classes instead? You will end up with more healing and more buffing and additional abilities on the side.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat that: Just because you can do some things a cleric can not does not mean the group will not have that ability from another class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-----<br />
<br />
By the way bring up a 20th level bst being a class used for heal, buffing and hasting is a horrible example.  Especially since in a group they are not even used for that.<br />
<br />
Beastlords hardly have the ability to take the role of primary healer like a shaman can.<br />
<br />
Melee advertise in PoK that they to donate for shaman buffs they DON'T advertise for Bst buffs.<br />
<br />
Plain and simply, shaman haste is better than Beastlords.<br />
<br />
The truth of the matter is a Beastlord is picked up for primarily DPS in a group.<br />
<br />
And if they are picked up for DPS why not just get an enchanter.<br />
a. Enchanters offer better haste.<br />
b. Enchanters offer often more DPS.<br />
c. Enchanters offer better slow<br />
D. Infact beastlords really can't even say they have the one thing shamans have over enchanters (healing).<br />
<br />
I think shamans are just fine and that perhaps at most some GoD content may need a little more tweaking.<br />
<br />
But don't think for a second, I don't have the right to clear the gray you try to cover over the class I love and play (shaman).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">A shaman cannot replace a cleric in a group.<br />
<br />
And a shaman cannot replace a enchanter in a group.<br />
<br />
A shaman can however. Make either class leaving a lesser blow by partly encompassing what they do. While adding a little more to the table than either class (Enchanter or cleric) individually. <br />
<br />
But you know what. In the End game where the hairs bredth of a differance can be the stepping point from dying or living. the Shaman doesnt shine at all. <br />
<br />
That is our problem, in trivial content we are incredible. We can take anyone and make a group. A shaman is the Just add warm bodies component of a good group in trivial content. <br />
<br />
But guess what. So are clerics. And so are Enchanters. Useing thier tactics properly they can make groups shine as well. In trivial content. Or in the advanced freshest content. They are pretty much required to either be around or on call. Shaman ain't.<br />
<br />
A shaman in my mind should be the glue, and the grease. At the same time. The glue to hold things together when times are rough. And the grease to make things flow smoothly when the going is good. <br />
<br />
The way this would be accomplished is rather simple. Stop taking away our bread and butter slows and debuffs through content revisions and paradigm changes in fight duration. Shaman are an over time class, a long distance runner that has been forced to run in the sprints. While not being told the race is only 50 yards now. <br />
<br />
Should there be a shaman in every group. No. Just like there should not be a Cleric or an enchanter or a warrior required in every group. But when a shaman walks by the meele should be salivating. And the monsters should be hoping we do not notice them. &quot;Cause That Snoww... She does bad tings to us monsters&quot;<br />
<br />
My opinion of course. Take it with a grain of salt. And maybe a little pepper too to add flavor. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">We can't be wiz + cleric + slower + necro of the raid ??? Where did you get this idea ? Where did you read that's what we want ?<br />
<br />
Nukes<br />
<br />
All I want is to be at the same level than clerics. We are supposed to be the battle priest, actually clerics ARE the battle priest (don't tell me about BST). Better nuke, better heals and even better melee than us. Go figure.<br />
So asking to be at the same level than clerics is not something too much to ask.<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Same pattern. I just ask to be at the same level than Druids. I just want to be able to heal correctly in GoD and OoW (don't think the mobs will be less powerful). It's too much to ask you think ??? Even if they raise our DD AND Healing, we won't be the best on both (which is totally normal) but at least, we will be on par with the two other priest classes on each respective way.<br />
<br />
DoTs<br />
<br />
I don't even know why they give us more dots in OoW as they are totally useless on quick dead mobs and I don't even talk about the non-existant way to control dots aggro (ie : necro can reduce aggro with FD).<br />
<br />
Slow<br />
<br />
We just slow slightly better than bst and enc and the mitigation still hurt us the most. Grab an enchanter or beastlord in GoD or future OoW, and you'll see absolutely no difference except that both bring far more to your group or raid.<br />
<br />
Necro thingy<br />
A necro on big bosses can do 10 times more damage than us with DoTs and DD. Their DD are more powerful/efficiant and as they can FD/control their own aggro, they can drop all the dots they want. We drop 2 or 3 dots, be ready to rez the shaman (healing him will be a waste of mana). Our mana regen is self only and ACTIVE.<br />
<br />
Druids<br />
Good heal for back up healing and even a MGBable AA group heal<br />
Excellent nuke (for a priest)<br />
Equivalent Dot than shaman<br />
Nine &gt; Fo7 and even the incoming new focus<br />
<br />
Clerics<br />
Better heals of the game (as it should)<br />
Better nukes than shaman (supposed to BE the battle priest)<br />
Better melee than shaman (supposed to BE the battle priest)<br />
Virtue/Kazaad &gt; Fo7 (as it should).<br />
<br />
So asking to be on par with cleric on nukes and with druids on healing, I don't think it will make us better than both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Another way to describe our concerns.<br />
<br />
Build a group.<br />
1 Cleric<br />
1 Enchanter<br />
1 Druid<br />
3 DPS (melee or caster, don't matter)<br />
<br />
go on GoD<br />
<br />
try to switch any of the 6 by a shaman... <br />
<br />
Guess what... anything a shaman can do will be made in a better way by anyone in the group (except slow, but in a slightly manner). We aren't even equal to anything with the worst ppl of the group.<br />
<br />
The worst DDer will do better than us.<br />
The worst melee DPS will do better than us (even the cleric will do better).<br />
The worst Healer will do better than us.<br />
<br />
But you right, shamans are balanced. We can do a ton of things, but not one to an equal level of the worst people of the group in each category.</div></div><hr />

I think your missing what I said above.  <br />
Clerics Are supposes to be better healers than shamans.<br />
Where does it say that clerics are supposed to heal more damage over an infinite timespan then a shaman who is consistently able to land 75% slows to help his healing?<br />
<br />
Yes, clerics are supposed to heal more then shaman. No, clerics are not supposed to prevent more melee damage then shaman over a large period of time, and certainly not to the degree they do at the moment.<br />
<br />
Can Shaman replace a cleric in a group?  Yes!<br />
No, not in current content. Not by a long shot.<br />
<br />
Can shaman replace an enchanter in group?  Yes!<br />
No, not in current content. Not by a long shot.<br />
<br />
You cannot even do it in BoT or LDoN easy adventures but at least there content is so trivial noone notices.<br />
<br />
Our diversity and spell lines make us much like druids.  We fit the niche.<br />
You are aware that druids outheal us, outdamage us and have more utility then us?<br />
<br />
Maybe you are talking about Velious druids who could choose to be bad healers or bad damage. That pretty much is were we stand now.<br />
<br />
Taking sometimes the place of two classes!<br />
You mean if the group basically needs no healing and no crowd control we can replace two non-needed classes? Because we certainly cannot replace a cleric or enchanter who actually uses his abilities.<br />
<br />
(This often makes us so powerful it allows us as a side effect to solo well.)<br />
Compared to whom? Every pure caster outsoloes me. Druids outsolo me. Bards outsolo me. That leaves me outsoloing melees and clerics. In other words, we are at the very bottom rung of the soloing ladder - it is barely worth the effort. We certainly do not shine.<br />
<br />
By the way bring up a 20th level bst being a class used for heal, buffing and hasting is a horrible example.  Especially since in a group they are not even used for that.<br />
<br />
Beastlords hardly have the ability to take the role of primary healer like a shaman can.<br />
I can not be a primary healer in GoD. At all. Not even in the sewers - a single slow resist leaves me chain-healing and low on mana.<br />
<br />
Melee advertise in PoK that they to donate for shaman buffs they DON'T advertise for Bst buffs.<br />
Well, that settles it. Buffing power is determined by what melees on your server auction for.<br />
<br />
Plain and simply, shaman haste is better than Beastlords.<br />
<br />
The truth of the matter is a Beastlord is picked up for primarily DPS in a group.<br />
Which was not my point at all - you say we are fine because we can heal buff and slow - my point is, we are not fine because the sum of our abilities does not add up to as much as everyone else's - to which you reply &quot;but we can do xxx a tiny bit better then class Y&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sure we can. But hasting 10% better then beastlords does not make shaman a balanced class.<br />
<br />
And basically, being able to do a lot of things crappily does not make a good class, not if you can not be at least decent at some of them at the same time.<br />

-------------------<br />
<br />
Veeshan,<br />
<br />
Saying the only difference between beastlord and a shaman is 10% haste.  Is not correct.  <br />
<br />
Shamans as I said above can play primary healer in an experience groups other than some GoD areas.  Bst can't play primary healer at all.<br />
<br />
And thou you stated you don't think melees want our buffs from the indication from PoK tells and /ooc.  The melees Very much want our buffs and are willing to Pay cash for them.  <br />
<br />
It is true clerics, enchanters and warriors in GoD currently have a good foot hold on groups.  But this is all old news.  In previous expansions we have seen whines about the holy trilogy before.  And some how it always works itself out.    <br />
<br />
Again GoD content just needs to be tweaked a little more.<br />
<br />
Saying that Shamans &quot;being able to do a lot of things crappily does not make a good class.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not true because of the fact shamans can replace clerics and enchanter in 65th level experience groups . <br />
<br />
Imagine if Shamans prevented just as much damage as clerics and performed the dudies of an enchanter just as easy.  Because that is basically what your asking for Veeshan (not all shamans).  How is that fair to clerics and enchanters.<br />
<br />
By the way I believe shamans are better than druids on so many levels.<br />
You stated that every pure caster can out solo you.  Well I solo much better than a Mage I will tell you that.  Oh and I quit my necro at 60th level because I saw a shaman solo something at the same level that I could not solo.  Now at 65th level and Tons of AAs I very happy I did quit my necro.</div></div><hr />

I did not say that.<br />
<br />
Shamans as I said above can play primary healer in an experience groups other than some GoD areas.  Bst can't play primary healer at all.<br />
GoD is the current expansion. Shaman can not heal adequately there. Which was what I said.<br />
<br />
And thou you stated you don't think melees want our buffs from the indication from PoK tells and /ooc.  The melees Very much want our buffs and are willing to Pay cash for them.  <br />
I did not say that at all. I said &quot;what people are willing to pay for&quot; is not an indication of buff power, much less class power.<br />
<br />
It is true clerics, enchanters and warriors in GoD currently have a good foot hold on groups.  But this is all old news.  In previous expansions we have seen whines about the holy trilogy before.  And some how it always works itself out.<br />

<br />
This is not true because of the fact shamans can replace clerics and enchanter in 65th level experience groups . <br />
Let me state it again. Being able to replace non-needed classes in trivial content does not make shaman a balanced class. Sure, I can cover heals in content I can solo. That does not mean my heals are great. The content to measure against is GoD single group content - and shaman are woefully inadequate there.<br />
<br />
Imagine if Shamans prevented just as much damage as clerics and performed the dudies of an enchanter just as easy.  Because that is basically what your asking for Veeshan (not all shamans).  How is that fair to clerics and enchanters.<br />
*boggle* I am asking to prevent, using both slow and heals, as much damage as a cleric on long fights with 75% slowable MOBs. None of these exist anymore. Even if they did it would not account for slow resists, spell damage or multiple pulls. And it would not account for the infinitely superior cleric emergency heals, nor for group heals.<br />
<br />
By the way, how do we replace enchanters again? I must have missed that one.<br />
<br />
By the way I believe shamans are better than druids on so many levels.<br />

<br />
Check the difference between max beastlord haste (that can be put on a player), and max shaman haste. Beasts get Celerity as their highest, Shaman get Swift like the Wind.  <br />
<br />
Also... Beastlords can't haste at 20. They get a pet haste at 22, and a player haste (Alacrity) at 60.<br />
<br />
Shamans as I said above can play primary healer in an experience groups other than some GoD areas.  Bst can't play primary healer at all.<br />
<br />
no, and yes. My Shaman simply can not heal effectively in places I group. Plane of Valor, BoT, LDoN hards, even places like Hate's Fury, Umbral Plains, and Qinimi, on occasion. Can I be main healer? yeah, if all I do is heal and cannibalize. Providing I have a KEI. The fact that a Chanter can fill my shoes on slowing, and still flip out with hte charms, lulls, and mezzes, while I can't even match a druid in heals, while doing NOTHING BUT healing, well, that kinda ticks me off.<br />
<br />
And before you ask, why, yes, I AM lacking all those nice healing AA and focii. It's rather beside the point, because 1) The druid / cleric STILL beats me if htye have that stuff, too, and 2) Class balance should be inherent, not bought / dropped.<br />
<br />
And, interestingly, I HAVE been main healer with my Beastlord. Granted he's only 55, but a potent combination of a high DPS group, maxxed bind wounds, and a healing focus item makes it pretty easy. Go fig.<br />
<br />
And thou you stated you don't think melees want our buffs from the indication from PoK tells and /ooc.  The melees Very much want our buffs and are willing to Pay cash for them. <br />
<br />
Focus is only one buff. SoW can be cast by four classes. Two of them have a superior spell. I have NEVER, NEVER seen a Melee say &quot;Donating for highest Agility!&quot;. In fact, the oddest buff request i've seen a Shaman get, was when my Beastlord donated 60 plat to have a wandering Shaman slap Tribunal on my group before going to fight hte epic spider.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'd rather my group wanted my buffs, than some twink PL'er with an extra two bits. <br />
<br />
It is true clerics, enchanters and warriors in GoD currently have a good foot hold on groups.  But this is all old news.  In previous expansions we have seen whines about the holy trilogy before.  And some how it always works itself out. <br />
<br />
Usually after everyone else buys all the overpriced gear from the Holy Trinity, followed by SoE gimping the zones. It's not so much warriors and enchanters. With a little brains, you can figure out crowd control with Root, Flash of Light, and hgih aggro. A smart Shadow Knight or Paladin CAN tank most stuff with the right backup. <br />
<br />
However, Clerics are the most needed part of a group. When I'm hunting in GoD, LDoN, or most of PoP (read - Anywhere worth going to), i do my damndest to get a cleric into one spot. Why? Because, like I said, I can't do anything else when i'm on healing. If someone dies. i can't rez them. And, gosh darn it, my lack of plate AC, hgih damage weapons, invulnerability, and standing mana regen buffs kinda puts them ahead of me as pinch-tanks, too.<br />
<br />
The class might not be overpowered, but they ARE over-needed. When every ounce of content past luclin requires a Cleric for a moderate success rate, something is being done wrong (Well, I suppose a VT-equipped Druid, or an Elemental / GoD equipped Shaman with full AA'sand extra buffs, maybe...)   <br />
<br />
Again GoD content just needs to be tweaked a little more.<br />
<br />
Any more tweaking and it'll be gimped. it was simply a crappy expansion. If it weren't for the Chaos Claws / Whirling Claws procs, my 55 Beastlord would be tanking for groups in Qinimi.<br />
<br />
Saying that Shamans &quot;being able to do a lot of things crappily does not make a good class.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not true because of the fact shamans can replace clerics and enchanter in 65th level experience groups . <br />
<br />
Level 65 exp = BoT / LdoN easies, right? You're aware that a shaman can be replaced by a nine year old botting a Mage and a Paladin in those situations, right?<br />
<br />
Imagine if Shamans prevented just as much damage as clerics and performed the dudies of an enchanter just as easy.  Because that is basically what your asking for Veeshan (not all shamans).  How is that fair to clerics and enchanters.<br />
<br />
Easy. Clerics still buff better than us by a large margin and have superior damage output. Clerics still have crack, Lulls, mez, and the best damage output in the game, period.<br />
<br />
I think giving us cleric-level healing and... Well, actually, tell you the truth, I could give a damn less about Crowd Control. I can do fine with root and ggro spells, as I said (Nothing makes the cleric's eyes bug out like the Shaman slapping down Tigir's, Infectious Cloud, and a rain spell, and taking it)<br />
<br />
By the way I believe shamans are better than druids on so many levels.<br />
<br />
Mostly the sign outside the Cricible that says &quot;Halflings Stay Out&quot;<br />
<br />
You stated that every pure caster can out solo you.  Well I solo much better than a Mage I will tell you that.  Oh and I quit my necro at 60th level because I saw a shaman solo something at the same level that I could not solo.  Now at 65th level and Tons of AAs I very happy I did quit my necro.<br />
<br />
Dunno about you, but when I solo for experience rather than to post &quot;lookie what I killt!&quot; on a message board, I suck. Shaman kill slowly. In the time it takes me to kill ten exp mobs, I would have gained about twice as much exp from a group with good DPS.<br />
<br />
While i'm soloing Phinigel Autropos for my guild mages, guild wizards and druids are quadding in the planes, the bards are swarming most of nightmare or Innovation, and the lonely SK is going &quot;Who's phinny?&quot;<br />
<br />
Let me ask you... Did your necro need to kill the monk guildmaster for anything? Wank material doesn't make a class balanced. A Wizard can slap down a 5k crit, but they still can't get a group, because compared to, say, a rogue, they suck.</div></div><hr />

You can do it, but the group is pretty much always better off with a non-shaman.<br />

Also... Beastlords can't haste at 20. They get a pet haste at 22, and a player haste (Alacrity) at 60.<br />
<br />
I and Veeshan know this.  Hyena please go back to playing your beastlord, your so advicate about.  <br />
<br />
Oh please reread over the level 20 part we were discussing.  We weren't talking about haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
no, and yes. My Shaman simply can not heal effectively in places I group. Plane of Valor, BoT, LDoN hards, even places like Hate's Fury, Umbral Plains, and Qinimi, on occasion. Can I be main healer? yeah, if all I do is heal and cannibalize. Providing I have a KEI. The fact that a Chanter can fill my shoes on slowing, and still flip out with hte charms, lulls, and mezzes, while I can't even match a druid in heals, while doing NOTHING BUT healing, well, that kinda ticks me off.<br />
<br />
After looking up past posts on you, 'The Hyena Shaman', I actually know why you can't primary heal in place where there is little effort needed to primary heal (especially PoV and BoT.)<br />
<br />
The Hyena Shaman, your shaman is not even in the part of the discussion of a 65th level experience group.<br />
<br />
InFact *Hyena Shaman* your not even 65th level!  <br />
You are jumping on the band wagon for the sake of whining when perhaps you haven't even experience even GoD yet with your shaman!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
And, interestingly, I HAVE been main healer with my Beastlord. Granted he's only 55, but a potent combination of a high DPS group, maxxed bind wounds, and a healing focus item makes it pretty easy. Go fig.<br />
<br />
WHAT WERE YOU Greater healing!!!?????  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Oh, and if you want more DPS for your experiencing group and better skills pick up enchanter, not a beastlord.  (so far I have found other than the fewest of areas this is true.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'd rather my group wanted my buffs, than some twink PL'er with an extra two bits. <br />
<br />
What group wants BST melee buffs???   When they could have better?<br />
This is rediculous.  (Maybe the casters want sometimes beastie crack you mean???  sorry KEI is enough for me thx.)<br />
<br />

<br />
 :rolleyes:  oh man, this proves further you don't experience in GoD.<br />
<br />
However, Clerics are the most needed part of a group<br />
<br />
um... no.  If they were the most needed then druids and sometimes shamans would not be replace them in ANY 65th level experience group. <br />
<br />
When I'm hunting in GoD, LDoN, or most of PoP (read - Anywhere worth going to), i do my damndest to get a cleric into one spot. Why? Because, like I said, I can't do anything else when i'm on healing. If someone dies. i can't rez them. And, gosh darn it, my lack of plate AC, hgih damage weapons, invulnerability, and standing mana regen buffs kinda puts them ahead of me as pinch-tanks, too.<br />
<br />
a. um... rez doesn't fit the shaman class.<br />
<br />
b. Oh god. you think just because clerics wear plate they mitigate damage they take, better than shamans?  Wow, you don't know EQ.  (hint: Both shaman and cleric no matter what their wearing and if they have the same AC, mitigate damage taken the same way.)<br />
<br />
c.  Oh, I can out damage a cleric and your worried about a clerics weapon damage?????<br />
<br />
d.  /sigh.. Shamans get a standing mana/regen hp buff to Henya.  But Hey wait you probably don't play your shaman anymore.  Realizing that bear form is not just a standing mana regen buff but and hp regen buff too.  ;) <br />

<br />
Any more tweaking and it'll be gimped. it was simply a crappy expansion. If it weren't for the Chaos Claws / Whirling Claws procs, my 55 Beastlord would be tanking for groups in Qinimi.<br />
<br />
But you know what its just not that either, many groups need a High HP class with taunt and don't feel safe with a beastlord or monk tanking. <br />
<br />
<br />
Level 65 exp = BoT / LdoN easies, right? You're aware that a shaman can be replaced by a nine year old botting a Mage and a Paladin in those situations, right?<br />
<br />
Wow, all three classes you mention above have TOTALLY different functions in a group.   WTH are you talking about with this analogy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Easy. Clerics still buff better than us by a large margin and have superior damage output. <br />
<br />
You do realize that the only thing shaman and clerics have in common with buffing is..... HP and AC.  All other stats Shaman out do clerics by a huge margin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me ask you... Did your necro need to kill the monk guildmaster for anything? Wank material doesn't make a class balanced. A Wizard can slap down a 5k crit...<br />
<br />
a.  At the time I did want was on the guildmaster monk.  To help out our guilded monk.<br />
<br />
b.  Oh after the wizard slapped on 5K crit (that would be resisted because they did not use practically a lure spell) and without killing the guildmaster then they would promply die if they do not escape.  <br />
<br />
c.  Simply fact my necro got skilled by a shaman before GoD.<br />
<br />
d.  Veeshan, necros now can solo a lot of the same mobs shamans can but it is extremely sloppy.  Sorry, I don't like having to squirm to mash FD or DS when a summoning mob will not let my necor get any drain spells off on them.  As a shaman I can sit back take the pounding and get off the heal spells for less mana and have no worries.  I won't go back to the sloppiness necros go through to kill high damaging summoning mobs.<br />
<br />
Clerics still have crack, Lulls, mez, and the best damage output in the game, period.<br />
<br />
Wow.  <br />
a.  So your saying that clerics gets the best damage output in the game?<br />
b.  That cleric mana regen or crack as you put it is better than our canni IV and V?<br />

I am not going to debate with you about anything, because you are simply mentally challenged, but just by reading the paragraph from Hyena's post you quoted and replied to above, one can easily see that the word &quot;Clerics&quot; was a supposed to read Enchanters. Of course, that was very difficult to see, if we assumed the reader has an IQ of &lt; 80.<br />
<br />
Just another hint, &quot;Atone&quot; is a low level memblur.</div></div><hr />

Beastlord outbuffs us. This has been discussed over and over again - in exp groups they just provide more then a shaman can, by far (even stats, thought that is largely useless).<br />
<br />
um... no.  If they were the most needed then druids and sometimes shamans would not be replace them in ANY 65th level experience group. <br />
Now you are getting utterly ridiculous. Go on, try to replace a cleric in Qvic. We can replace clerics anywhere the MOBs are trivial anyways. If the cleric actually has to heal more then once per minute we can not.<br />

Necromancers can go toe to toe with harder hitting MOBs then we can, thanks to lifetaps. They have the added option (as in: something they can do but do not have to do that we can not) of using feign, aggro kiting, splitting spawns and go invulnerable. They do more DPS, regenerate more mana, have a better pet, nuke better and can do damage against more resists, with better resist modifiers.<br />
<br />
The only area where shaman might have a small edge is on high HPs, moderate damage, summoning MOBs that are easy to pull. They keyword there is might.<br />
<br />
By the way, for someone who likes to ridicule people for arguing about something they have no personal experience with you sure seem to like to base your arguments on &quot;what I did with my lvl 60 necromancer I no longer play&quot;.</div></div><hr />

VeeshanMurtak,<br />
<br />
First let me say I commend you.  You have been very calm and not insulting at all during this thread even thou I have been snappish.  Thanks.  <br />
<br />
Beastlord outbuffs us. This has been discussed over and over again - in exp groups they just provide more then a shaman can, by far (even stats, thought that is largely useless).<br />
<br />
I am still wondering about this perhaps if you could post here the buffs of a Bst compared to the buffs a shaman provides so that I may see this difference. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now you are getting utterly ridiculous. Go on, try to replace a cleric in Qvic. We can replace clerics anywhere the MOBs are trivial anyways. If the cleric actually has to heal more then once per minute we can not.<br />
<br />
When I capitalized &quot;ANY&quot; in my last phrase I was trying to prove that we can infact replace clerics in many cases.  <br />
<br />
But even as I state over and over again I believe GoD just needs to be tweaked more to fix our healing issues, such as Qvic. <br />
<br />
I would not say we can only heal in trivial areas of the game.  Shamans can main heal in Plane of Earth areas and Hard LDoN dungeons (done this myself).  Admittedly I will have to buckle down and try the PoE main healing option that shamans have posted here before.<br />

<br />
No No No, you got this all wrong.  I have actually never been in a pvp battle with a necro.<br />
<br />
I got skilled by a 60 shaman AS a necro 60.  When I was trying to kill the guildmaster monk in Freeport.  Basically, after 3 attempts our guild 60 shaman walked up and took a crack at it and killed the guildmaster for our guilded monk that was waiting for the guildmaster monk's drops. <br />
<br />
<br />
Necromancers can go toe to toe with harder hitting MOBs then we can, thanks to lifetaps.

<br />
The only area where shaman might have a small edge is on high HPs, moderate damage, summoning MOBs that are easy to pull. They keyword there is might.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, as I stated above that when a high damaging mob summoned my necro I would use lifetaps to save my cloth necro butt.  But when the summoning, high damaging, unslowed mob interrupts my lifetaps, my fiegns, and my Damage Shields casts, I got further fed up with my necro.<br />
<br />
Sorry but necros can take high level damaging summoning mobs but it done often very sloppy.  It is not controlled at all as say a shaman slowing a mob and then easily getting off a heal for less mana than it cost the necro to drain life for.  <br />
<br />
This was another factor as to why I dropped my necro for what is now a 65th level shaman with all the trimmings.  I have never looked back since that day and I have been very happy with the results.<br />
<br />
The shaman class still makes me happy with all I can achieve.  I do feel very powerful from the roles I can play in a group and from soloing experiences.  Simply,  I dislike morbid posters like Giac that every chance they get post about how they believe shamans should be a God class with all these different powers added.  Well I already feel like a God class I don't need his mobid posts.<br />
<br />
Yeah, sorry Veeshan I snapped at you but I don't believe a shaman should be able through their slows and heals be able to prevent as much damage as a cleric does with their heals.  From a fantasy stand point a shaman is more of a battle priest compared to a cleric to me.  <br />
<br />
Seperately, I can see that a shaman can to do battle with a mob better than a cleric.  (Heck shamans solo way better than cleric, how is that for a battle priest.)<br />
<br />
But its for this reason I believe clerics with their lack of battling/soloing skills are rewarded with better heals to support them.<br />
<br />
I don't want to see, ever, a shaman truely be the FULL power of an enchanter and a cleric in one.</div></div><hr />

Which has zero bearing on lvl 65, post-elemental class balance.<br />

Necromancers kill faster then me, with less risk then me, in more circumstances then me. It might have been different at lvl 60 but it sure is that way today.<br />
<br />
Yeah, sorry Veeshan I snapped at you but I don't believe a shaman should be able through their slows and heals be able to prevent as much damage as a cleric does with their heals.  From a fantasy stand point a shaman is more of a battle priest compared to a cleric to me.  <br />
Which is why clerics get the melee toys? Tell me, what is our role in a group then? Heal less then healers and do less damage then damage dealers? That is utterly useless.<br />
<br />
Seperately, I can see that a shaman can to do battle with a mob better than a cleric.  (Heck shamans solo way better than cleric, how is that for a battle priest.)<br />
We can solo for crappy experience better then clerics. Too bad this game is mainly about grouping and raiding.<br />
<br />
But its for this reason I believe clerics with their lack of battling/soloing skills are rewarded with better heals to support them.<br />
Funny, I do not see enchanters being penalized for their soloing power.<br />
<br />
I don't want to see, ever, a shaman truely be the FULL power of an enchanter and a cleric in one.<br />
And neither does anyone else on these boards. Just because many happen to believe that we need upgrades (and can actually state reasons other then &quot;we are fine&quot;) does not mean they want to be able to do everything.</div></div><hr />

Lets make it most obvious from one of your short picked in 60 seconds of looking and its a sweet and smaller post showing how MUCH of a change your looking/expect for in the shaman class.<br />
<br />
Nothing will be done about it, though.<br />
<br />
It's painfully obvious that they aren't worried about it. This should be a top priority. The summer is close and I don't like to waste my time so I'll be moving on if I don't see drastic changes to my class and I suggest you do the same.<br />

Unless clerics have mez nowadays his meaning does seem to be pretty clear.<br />
<br />
lets look at something for a sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Easy. Clerics still buff better than us by a large margin and have superior damage output. Clerics still have crack, Lulls, mez, and the best damage output in the game, period.<br />
<br />
First its obvious his subject is clerics from the beginning sentence.<br />
<br />
Second he starts with cleric again in the next sentence.<br />
<br />
Third Clerics do infact have a form of crack (or mana regen for them selves, often turning down FoS for this reason.)<br />
<br />
Fourth Clerics do get Lulls.<br />
<br />
Fifth (Mez basically, stuns and has a chance of memblur)... the atone line does the same.<br />
<br />
But let Henya be the final say.  I am sure he will chime in with you guys soon enough.  (He may not post on the weekends.)<br />

add to that mana regeneration, which we cannot buff at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Veeshan not every class has Sta Maxed out it would only be fair to include the HP shaman provided with Sta + Focus.  I still know caster asking for Sta in experience groups.<br />
<br />
2. Spiritual Vigor ... well you got me hm.. I don't like that.  But I still like how Ferine Avatar is one lil short term buff with sizeable power compared to two buff slots needs for Spiritual Vigor and Ferocity. <br />
<br />
3. Veeshan that is not fair mentioning the resist buffs, the way you did.  Shamans get your mentioned Bst resists (Talisman of Jasinth, Shadoo)<br />
Plus Shamans get the fire and cold resistances, Bst don't.  It is clear that Shamans come out on top for options, when it comes to resistence buffs (compared to Shamans and Bsts)<br />
<br />
4.  Yes, shaman haste is better than a Bst haste no arguement there.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to prove anything you should try to show us a line of reasoning, instead of just a flat statement. If you want to tell us about &quot;many cases&quot; you should not post &quot;ANY&quot;.<br />
<br />
The orginal post was this.<br />
&quot;If they were the most needed then druids and sometimes shamans would not be replace them in ANY 65th level experience group.&quot; <br />
<br />
((***First my english above is horrible ~ I B foriegn, (I am a french american) :)  ))<br />
in other words it means that if clerics were always needed then druids and sometimes shaman would not be replacing them in ANY 65th level experience group.  But shamans are.  <br />
<br />
So tearing only words like &quot;many cases&quot; from my phrase above is not fair and a moot point to argue about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which has zero bearing on lvl 65, post-elemental class balance.<br />
<br />
If shamans even have a chance at playing Main healer in Plane of Earth or can heal and even solo in Plane of Fire.  <br />
<br />
Then, I don't think we are talking about POST elemental anymore...?<br />
<br />
Necromancers kill faster then me, with less risk then me, in more circumstances then me. It might have been different at lvl 60 but it sure is that way today.<br />
<br />
Veeshan, I never said necros don't kill faster than shamans.  Hell take me to Crypt of Decay I will show you how really fast a necro can kill.<br />
<br />
But, I have shown concern for the sizable uncontrolled risks necros take to do this soloing.  Reliable Charms suck.  Reliably getting off a drain life a on high damaging, summoning, unslowed mob sucks.  I find it often very sloppy.<br />
<br />
I have found from experience, that Shamans can solo these mobs with more control and more liably.  This has helped me to fall in love with the shaman class and to feel I have power.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is why clerics get the melee toys? Tell me, what is our role in a group then?<br />
<br />
Our role in group offers not a bad pet and after dropping our slow on the mob maybe a spell like bane. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Heal less then healers and do less damage then damage dealers?  That is utterly useless.<br />
<br />
That way we are a mix.  And I believe we are a good kind of this mix compared to other classes :).<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny, I do not see enchanters being penalized for their soloing power.<br />
<br />
This is a different matter even the Devs. stated they are uncomfortable with the potential of charmed mobs used for experiencing.  It may very well be changed soon for this reason.  Which hasn't been the first time.<br />
<br />
And neither does anyone else on these boards. Just because many happen to believe that we need upgrades (and can actually state reasons other then &quot;we are fine&quot;) does not mean they want to be able to do everything.<br />
<br />
Saying that all I stated is &quot;we are fine&quot; is not fair.  I do give reasons.  You don't like my reasons and your quoting/answering my reasons, proves I don't just state &quot;we are fine.&quot;    <br />
<br />
But on the same token I TOO hate the posts (not necessarily yours, Veeshan) that state we are horrible but give no examples.  Some of these short phrases of negativity can be identified by looking at Giac past posts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess what, Beastlords can stamina buff fairly well too.<br />
<br />
Ferocity has 40 stamina, Infusion of Spirit has 45. Our Boar has 60, and of course we can use IoS too but it doesn't stack with Focus.<br />
<br />
If we used IoS and Talisman of Kragg and Boar, we have an advantage of 20 stamina over beastlords, but lose 149 HP from focus to kragg.<br />
<br />
No class gets 149 hp from 20 sta, so we wouldn't do it that way, so they will out-sta buff us too. And they still out HP buff us on top of that with SV.<br />
<br />
So basically, even if you count stamina, they can buff HP better than us, and same number of buff slots as before (add one each to the list for stamina and IoS).<br />
<br />
2. Spiritual Vigor ... well you got me hm.. I don't like that.  But I still like how Ferine Avatar is one lil short term buff with sizeable power compared to two buff slots needs for Spiritual Vigor and Ferocity.<br />
<br />
Ferocity is a short term buff with a LOT of power too. SV is a longer lasting buff which gives HP and atk, similar to strength of Tunare. I really don't see your point about 2 buff slots for SV and Ferocity?<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, Ferocity:<br />
<br />
5:  Increase STA by 40 <br />
7:  Increase ATK by 150 <br />
8:  Increase All Resists by 65 <br />
<br />
Compare that to Ferine Avatar:<br />
<br />
3:  Increase ATK by 140 <br />
5:  Increase AGI by 140 <br />
6:  Increase STR by 140 <br />
7:  Increase DEX by 140 <br />
<br />
If you were stat capped, which would you prefer? Or even if you weren't, the 40 sta is worth more than the agi/dex/str put together.<br />
<br />
3. Veeshan that is not fair mentioning the resist buffs, the way you did.  Shamans get your mentioned Bst resists (Talisman of Jasinth, Shadoo)<br />
Plus Shamans get the fire and cold resistances, Bst don't.  It is clear that Shamans come out on top for options, when it comes to resistence buffs (compared to Shamans and Bsts)<br />
<br />
See above spell details on Ferocity. 65 to all resists. Hello? Beastlords out resist buff shamans. And to do so, they only need 3 spell slots to our 4. Or with just ferocity by itself they match our DR/PR.<br />
<br />
To be fair, Ferocity is a 6.5 minute duration buff like FA, and has 2 minutes recast to FAs 1, so it's not useable all the time, and is a pain to use.<br />
<br />
Without AA and focus, they can keep it up on 3 people at a time, but for those 3 people, Beastlords have the potential to out-HP buff, out-atk buff, out-mana regen buff and out resist-buff shamans.<br />
<br />
We can haste buff 10% better than them and do 1 HP per tick better HP regen.... Oh and we have something like 100-200 on them on str/dex/agi... woopety doo.<br />

I'm doing the second and third trial as the secondary healer easily in Ikk.  Been doing the third trial alot looking for my cloak from the named for the BiC quest.  So, yes, I'm always getting groups.  In fact, I don't know if it's just my server, but I've never had a probelm ever getting groups with the shamna.

A random quote out of context from a few months ago, in which I state that fixing the Shaman class for the current content should be a top priority. <br />
A fix that requires drastic changes to multiple key abilities Shamans have been neglected on for years. And you actually thought you had an argument there?<br />

<br />
Fifth (Mez basically, stuns and has a chance of memblur)... the atone line does the same.<br />
*boggle* And you are telling me you actually reached Qvic not having a clue what mez, memblur, lull and stun spells do and what the differences between them are?<br />
<br />
1. Veeshan not every class has Sta Maxed out it would only be fair to include the HP shaman provided with Sta + Focus.  I still know caster asking for Sta in experience groups.<br />
Beastlords provide more stamina the shaman.<br />
<br />
2. Spiritual Vigor ... well you got me hm.. I don't like that.  But I still like how Ferine Avatar is one lil short term buff with sizeable power compared to two buff slots needs for Spiritual Vigor and Ferocity. <br />
Ferocity alone is better then Ferine Avatar.<br />
<br />
3. Veeshan that is not fair mentioning the resist buffs, the way you did.  Shamans get your mentioned Bst resists (Talisman of Jasinth, Shadoo)<br />
Plus Shamans get the fire and cold resistances, Bst don't.  It is clear that Shamans come out on top for options, when it comes to resistence buffs (compared to Shamans and Bsts)<br />
Jasinth/Shadoo do not stack with Tribunal. I listed the maximum amount of resists the two classes can buff.<br />
<br />
4.  Yes, shaman haste is better than a Bst haste no arguement there.<br />
And it is the only thing we buff better then beastlords - and our lead is tiny. Beastlord provide more stats, more resists, more HPs, more ATK and more mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
The orginal post was this.<br />
&quot;If they were the most needed then druids and sometimes shamans would not be replace them in ANY 65th level experience group.&quot; <br />

<br />
So tearing only words like &quot;many cases&quot; from my phrase above is not fair and a moot point to argue about.<br />
Ok, so what you actually meant was &quot;as long as there are any 65 experience groups where I can replace a cleric the shaman class is fine.&quot; Which is just as silly as your original statement. You can experience in LDoN easy adventures just fine with ranger healing, much less cleric healing. Because they are trivial.<br />
We can replace a cleric - as long as healing is trivial for him. Heck I do not necessarily want to replace a cleric, I just want to bring a similar amount of usefulness to a group as a cleric does.<br />
<br />
Veeshan, I never said necros don't kill faster than shamans.  Hell take me to Crypt of Decay I will show you how really fast a necro can kill.<br />
<br />
But, I have shown concern for the sizable uncontrolled risks necros take to do this soloing.  Reliable Charms suck.  Reliably getting off a drain life a on high damaging, summoning, unslowed mob sucks.  I find it often very sloppy.<br />
I have found from experience, that Shamans can solo these mobs with more control and more liably.  This has helped me to fall in love with the shaman class and to feel I have power.<br />
Who cares if you die every now and then if even with unrezzed deaths you gain experience faster. I even have a hard time believing necromancers die more often, considering they have feign death and harmshield.<br />
Regardless, soloing power plays a small role in class balancing anyways.<br />
<br />
Our role in group offers not a bad pet and after dropping our slow on the mob maybe a spell like bane. :)<br />
You are not actually being serious here, are you? Bane after slowing amounts to maybe 2 ticks worth of damage. Combined with our &quot;not bad&quot; pet we might reach 40 DPS with that. The group will always be better of with an enchanter and cleric then with a shaman + any class.<br />
<br />
That way we are a mix.  And I believe we are a good kind of this mix compared to other classes :).<br />
Let me show you some numbers. Shaman heal 50% as well as clerics (less actually). Let us be generous and make that 70% after figuring in slow - when doing nothing but healing. Let us further say shaman deal 50% of the damage a dedicated DPS class does - when doing nothing but damage.<br />
Now, we have a group and that group will need a certain amount of healing - say 140% of what a cleric can do (likely more is needed in GoD). They also need a plate tank and the rest of the group is DPS.<br />
<br />
They could get a cleric and a druid to cover healing. That leaves them with 3 slots for damage classes and or 300% of damage.<br />
Or they could get 4 shaman to &quot;heal and do a little damage) - leaving the group with one DPS slot or 100% + 4*25% or 200% damage overall.<br />
<br />
Flexibility in a class does not cut it if you are not very close to the specialists, not if you can mix and match on a group level to get exactly what you need. If your are not able to provide a mix of damage and healing that is close to 100% (at the same time) you better be a tank, else you are dead weight to a group.<br />
<br />
This (&lt;--charming) is a different matter even the Devs. stated they are uncomfortable with the potential of charmed mobs used for experiencing.  It may very well be changed soon for this reason.  Which hasn't been the first time.<br />
They said that in Luclin. They said that in PoP. They said that in GoD. Do you spot a pattern ?<br />
<br />
Saying that all I stated is &quot;we are fine&quot; is not fair.  I do give reasons.  You don't like my reasons and your quoting/answering my reasons, proves I don't just state &quot;we are fine.&quot;    <br />
&quot;we can do many things!&quot; is not a reason. A reason would be &quot;our superior mana regeneration is enough to overcome the cleric's superior healing spells and heal more damage over a large span of time. As we can still heal adequately in the majority of single group encounters I think shaman healing is fine - shaman are better over long periods of time, clerics are better in emrgencies and can rez.&quot;<br />
<br />
But on the same token I TOO hate the posts (not necessarily yours, Veeshan) that state we are horrible but give no examples.  Some of these short phrases of negativity can be identified by looking at Giac past posts.<br />
We, as a community have discussed some issues for a long time now. Restating literally dozens of pages of posts becomes tiresome after a while. Here is my own personal summary of our issues - others have posted their own too. <br />

<br />
Well, one, I don't advocate it. He's an alt that became more fun for me than my main. No biggy.   <br />
<br />
Oh please reread over the level 20 part we were discussing.  We weren't talking about haste.<br />
<br />
Well, you might, but Veeshan mighta needed some clarification.<br />
<br />
Oh, so any class that can heal, buff and haste has enough power? A level 20 beastlord can do that. That is seriously your argument as to why shaman are balanced?<br />
<br />
After looking up past posts on you, 'The Hyena Shaman', I actually know why you can't primary heal in place where there is little effort needed to primary heal (especially PoV and BoT.)<br />
<br />
Heavens to betsy, I'm not in an Elemental+ guild? Say it ain't so! :shock:<br />
<br />
Wake up and smell the jojos, man. BoT, PoV, LDoN (hard, whenever possible, kthx d00d), even wied little zones nobody likes (such as Torment) are all on my list. And I distinctly remember saying that i CAN main heal... Just that asking me to slow, buff, debuff, heal, haste, regen, oh, and do it all while cannibalizing is... Taxing. Again, I'm not Thottbott. if you are, more power to ya.<br />
<br />
The Hyena Shaman, your shaman is not even in the part of the discussion of a 65th level experience group.<br />
<br />
Because I'm incapable of comprehending the concepts set forth by those who are? Because of some bizzare congenital defect that keeps me from both understanding &quot;the point&quot; AND meeting your standards? Or is it simply because you have no other leverage to dismiss my points other than &quot;Pfft, n00b&quot;?<br />
<br />
InFact *Hyena Shaman* your not even 65th level! <br />
<br />
SCANDALOUS! :shock:<br />
 <br />
You are jumping on the band wagon for the sake of whining when perhaps you haven't even experience even GoD yet with your shaman!!!!<br />
<br />
Matter of fact, I haven't experienced much with my shaman since the DX9 rollover. I SERIOUSLY need a new video card. Does the fact I have a Voodoo3 (barf) make me incapable of understanding that, hey, if the level 65 game has flaws now, reason goes to stand that, hey, those flaws will still be there in two levels, unless somehow, they get changed.<br />
<br />
But, y'know, you seem to be lacking the concept of &quot;perception&quot; here. You say we can be main healers? Okay, I agree, we can, even if I personally don't find it all that easy. So.... Who are we main healing? Our pets? Groups want clerics. If you want DPS, you want the best. If you want crowd control, you want the best. If you want healing, you want the best.<br />
<br />
And we are NOT &quot;the best&quot;. <br />
<br />
WHAT WERE YOU Greater healing!!!?????  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Actually, just healing, with a blackened glass eye earring, 214 bind wound, and, as I said, a high DPS group (A bigger BST as tank, me, a motley assortment of rogues and mages filling hte other four spots. Those vampires never saw what hit 'em)<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you want more DPS for your experiencing group and better skills pick up enchanter, not a beastlord.  (so far I have found other than the fewest of areas this is true.)<br />
<br />
And if you want tanking, pick a warrior before an enchanter. And you can make money by selling things for more than you paid in the Bazaar. Stating hte obvious here, man<br />
<br />
What group wants BST melee buffs???   When they could have better?<br />
<br />
Well, as others kindly pointed out, a 65 Beastlord can nudge ahead of a 65 Shaman in the one buffing area people care about - Hit Points. But, now that you mention it, playing my Beastlord, most groups are perfectly okay with those gimp-ass single-target laughingstock buffs - Either that or they bought a focus from a Shambot in PoK. <br />
<br />
Face it. Stat buffs suck<br />
<br />
This is rediculous.  (Maybe the casters want sometimes beastie crack you mean???  sorry KEI is enough for me thx.)<br />
<br />
KEI? I make do with Virtue, punk. Same buff, in many ways... From a shaman perspective :p<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:  oh man, this proves further you don't experience in GoD.<br />
<br />
Have you done anything in GoD since hte patch? &quot;With the right backup&quot;, knights can tank there. And in other content, knights can tank &quot;most&quot; encounters. <br />
<br />
Try to read what I write, instead of seeing &quot;knight&quot; and &quot;tank&quot; in the same sentance, and assuming I said &quot;OMG knights can tank everything solo in teh face! :shock: &quot;<br />
<br />
um... no.  If they were the most needed then druids and sometimes shamans would not be replace them in ANY 65th level experience group.<br />
<br />
/who all LFG<br />
[65 Cleric] Iheelzu LFG<br />
[65 Druid] Treewyndwhisperrainwolf LFG<br />
[65 Shaman] Pokdurmom LFG<br />
<br />
Group needs a healer... WHO do they pick out of the above lineup? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? <br />
<br />
Shaman can be main healer. But then, Rangers can be crowd control. And Shadow Knights have heal spells, too!<br />
<br />
a. um... rez doesn't fit the shaman class.<br />
<br />
well, I won't lecture you on Shamanism, the concepts of psychopomps, and the seasonal symbolisms inherent to ressurection concepts in religion. Unless you ask, and I'll go on for a few hours.<br />
<br />
But, &quot;it doesn't fit&quot;, is presumably why I don't have it, and my lack of the spell, IMO, is probably why I can't cast it, which, interestingly enough, can be quite a disadvantage for a group that opts for a shaman and not a cleric.<br />
<br />
b. Oh god. you think just because clerics wear plate they mitigate damage they take, better than shamans?  Wow, you don't know EQ.  (hint: Both shaman and cleric no matter what their wearing and if they have the same AC, mitigate damage taken the same way.)<br />
<br />
Weeeel, no, sorry, they don't mitigate the same way.<br />
<br />
Clerics mitigate as a plate class. Lower defensive skills and caps put them at the bottom of the heap in that grouping. Shaman mitigate as a chain class. However, like clerics, we get the lowerst defensive skills and caps in our grouping. Berserkers, Rangers, and Rogues will all mitigate better than a Shaman due to things like, oh, Parry, higher dodge and Defensive caps, ll that nice stuff.<br />
<br />
But, let's take a moment and assume that mitigation was based on class grouping rather than armor groupings (I.e, &quot;Tank&quot;, &quot;DPS melee&quot;, &quot;Caster&quot;, &quot;Priest&quot;, rather than &quot;Cloth, Leather, Chain, Plate&quot;)<br />
<br />
Clerics wear plate. Plate, generally, has higher AC than Chain. Shaman wear chain. So, assuming all things are equal before armor, this would mean that an armored cleric would have higher AC than an armored Shaman. And this is WITHOUT tossing in the superior AC and HP buffs...[/quote]<br />
<br />
c.  Oh, I can out damage a cleric and your worried about a clerics weapon damage?????<br />
<br />
I can outdamage a cleric, too. The thing is, the circumstances. I have to burn a pile of mana to outdamage a cleric. That's mana that's not healing somebody. None of my weapons hit for crap (boy, that 200 cap and no damage bonus on the second-lowest damage table in the game sucks for pure melee damage, huh?!), and I lack 200 DD, five-times-a-minute procs on them. And if I want to regain mana, I cannispam, which takes away from my DPS by eating into my cast time AND swing time.<br />
<br />
Compare this to a cleric. They pop a Yaulp 5+, and go beat on things with thier zappy-hammer. for 50 mana and a fast casting time, they're getting self haste, an AC buff, an attack buff, and + strength, ALONG with standing mana regen. They're also swinging a hammer that might not actually HIT, but procs constantly<br />
<br />
So... In order to outdamage a cleric, I have to be on a horse, casting all my DoTs constantly with maybe a quick poison DD. You know that eats more than 50 mana, right? You also know that it pretty much grants perma-aggro, right?<br />
<br />
d.  /sigh.. Shamans get a standing mana/regen hp buff to Henya.  But Hey wait you probably don't play your shaman anymore.  Realizing that bear form is not just a standing mana regen buff but and hp regen buff too.  ;) <br />
<br />
That's already been corrected... The buff you're looking for is Wolf Form. Noticable mana regen, better than SoW speed, AND a little bit of ATK. But, at least we can cast bear form indoors...!<br />
<br />
But you know what its just not that either, many groups need a High HP class with taunt and don't feel safe with a beastlord or monk tanking. <br />
<br />
That kind of strengthens my point. Any more &quot;tweaking&quot; of some of this stuff, and it'll be gimped. BL's don't have much trouble holding aggro, if they have any skill in Conjuration<br />
<br />
Wow, all three classes you mention above have TOTALLY different functions in a group.   WTH are you talking about with this analogy.<br />
<br />
Exactly that. In bottom-end content like LDoN easies, most classes CAN be easily replaced by anything that wanders by.<br />
<br />
Your group for LDoN easy just lost it's shaman? Quick, let me log in my Mage Rod-Bot to fill the gap so we get the exp bonus<br />
<br />
You do realize that the only thing shaman and clerics have in common with buffing is..... HP and AC.  All other stats Shaman out do clerics by a huge margin.<br />
<br />
Because the masses are clamouring for Agility and Charisma on your server, right?<br />
<br />
By the way, Clerics get a really nice beneficial spell haste line. <br />
<br />
a.  At the time I did want was on the guildmaster monk.  To help out our guilded monk.<br />
<br />
You realize, of course, that plenty of other classes can't solo this guy, right?<br />
<br />
b.  Oh after the wizard slapped on 5K crit (that would be resisted because they did not use practically a lure spell) and without killing the guildmaster then they would promply die if they do not escape. <br />
<br />
Like I said. Wank material is wank material. I can take down Phinny. It's fun, but what damn good does it do me? I'd rather be swam kiting stalkers in PoN and gaining experience and loot I can use, than slapping a fish in a dress around because he's lonley. <br />
<br />
c.  Simply fact my necro got skilled by a shaman before GoD.<br />
<br />
Cool. Can you solo the SK epic mob in CoM? Necro's pulled it off. There was a necro fella who managed to solo pretty far into VP, too. There's some encounters that some classes are better at than others.<br />
<br />
For instance, a number of mobs in Luclin are highly resistant to Shaman DoTs - But my beastlord can just slap them around with no real problem. On the other hand, same expansion, teh shades and vampires eat the lizard alife with hteir crazy procs, but a Turgurs and a cripple cleans that right up.<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah, low-end crap, but it's an example. <br />
<br />
d.  Veeshan, necros now can solo a lot of the same mobs shamans can but it is extremely sloppy.  Sorry, I don't like having to squirm to mash FD or DS when a summoning mob will not let my necor get any drain spells off on them.[quote]<br />
<br />
And i can't stand running around with a pack of snared critters behind me. This is why I don't play a druid<br />
<br />
[quote]As a shaman I can sit back take the pounding and get off the heal spells for less mana and have no worries.  I won't go back to the sloppiness necros go through to kill high damaging summoning mobs.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there's necros out there who consider all that &quot;sloppiness&quot; to be &quot;strategy&quot; and &quot;technique&quot;, and enjoy it. Different strokes for different folks, and all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow.  <br />
a.  So your saying that clerics gets the best damage output in the game?<br />
b.  That cleric mana regen or crack as you put it is better than our canni IV and V?<br />
c.  And a cleric's Atone spell line for the short stunning duration and resistance it get is a mez spell?<br />
<br />
This conversation is over.<br />
<br />
That was, indeed meant to be Enchanters.<br />
<br />
But in answer to B, well, it takes 50 mana, lasts for a bit, and doesn't suck time away from casting other spells or taking swings. Cannibalize does.</div></div><hr />

B. Henya your post was not bad other than I don't agree about Cleric AC and Shaman AC.   Reguardless of whether Chain or Plate.  Not only can I get the same AC as a Cleric but I mitigate damage taken just like them.  Its just the way the game is programmed.<br />
<br />
C. Kianor your post was the most valuable of all, your examples were clear and to the point.  Stating the stat difference.  <br />
<br />
My concerns with less slot buffing can make a point to group members not really us.  But Kianor you also mentioned a Bst maybe able if keep up buffing 3 players using less slots but I am sure it would be very draining on the Bst especially with no major form of mana regen like the shaman.<br />
<br />
D.  Veeshan your post was actually offending this time.<br />
<br />
a) Please look up the meaning of morbid.<br />
b) Please stop putting words in Giac's mouth.<br />
<br />
Giac stuck his own foot in his mouth.  <br />
THOSE WERE HIS WORDS.  I can quote them agian if you want. <br />
Infact the quote did ask for drastic changes, he did threaten to leave without these drastic changes and then he was telling others to do the same.  <br />
<br />
Sorry but that is childish, morbid thinking and huffy &amp; puffy whining. <br />
<br />
I expect my kid to throw the swear words around like he does or to quit doing their homework (saying all they won't do it unless it gets easier).     <br />
<br />
<br />
*boggle* And you are telling me you actually reached Qvic not having a clue what mez, memblur, lull and stun spells do and what the differences between them are?<br />
<br />
VeeshanMurtak, this is not fair and dishearting.  Even, with the very fact your preaching about taking words out of context.  <br />
<br />
I said mez stuns and has a chance of membluring.  And guess what that is the truth.  Atone does the same thou the duration of stun is much lower.<br />
<br />
I never gave a definition of lull nor did we go into detail about it.  But Veeshan if you want to convince me what I did say is wrong go for it.  Convince me that clerics don't get the lull series of spells.  <br />
<br />
And I definately did not talk about the stun line of spells.<br />
<br />
One other thing at least I explained myself other than giving a short snappy one liner.  I thought only Giac did that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus Shamans get the fire and cold resistances, Bst don't.  It is clear that Shamans come out on top for options, when it comes to resistence buffs (compared to Shamans and Bsts)<br />
<br />
agreed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jasinth/Shadoo do not stack with Tribunal. I listed the maximum amount of resists the two classes can buff.<br />
<br />
And if shamans don't use Tribunal and use Jasinth/Shadoo like the beastlord then what?  (this is not sarcasm but a true question)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so what you actually meant was &quot;as long as there are any 65 experience groups where I can replace a cleric the shaman class is fine.&quot; Which is just as silly as your original statement. You can experience in LDoN easy adventures just fine with ranger healing, much less cleric healing. Because they are trivial.<br />
<br />
A.  I don't see why your offended that shamans do have sometimes the option to take a clerics place as main healer in a 65th level group.  <br />
<br />
B.  Why are we back on the word trival if I stated shamans can handle HARD (not just easy) LDON main healing and even some elemental plane areas such as Plane of Fire and Plane of Earth.  Its as if you don't want to hear this.<br />
<br />
C.  Wise cracks like ranger healing is being enough in easy LDON dungeons is:<br />
1. Not true<br />
2. A bad relation to your point<br />
<br />
<br />
Who cares if you die every now and then if even with unrezzed deaths you gain experience faster. I even have a hard time believing necromancers die more often, considering they have feign death and harmshield.<br />
<br />
(deaths add up.  But I also don't have a second account for a cleric bot, to rez my cluttered necro's corpses.)<br />
<br />
Well relate with me on this then because I faced this alot with how sloppy soloing high damage, summoning, and unslowed mobs with my necro before I changed to a shaman.<br />
<br />
Scenario:<br />
I am summoned by the type of mob above, who is hitting me like crazy, seeing it is unslowed.  I try my first drain spell (mob pushes me)... interrupt, I try my second *bash (I am stunned and the spell interrupts again.)  <br />
<br />
a.  Now I have the option of hitting FD allowing the mob while I am on the ground to start to regen HP like crazy because it no longer has a hate list.  <br />
<br />
...but say I have my pet out an it is still on the hate list beating on the mob.  If I stand, I get beaten because the mob needs to go back to its spawn spot before forgetting how much it really hate me.  <br />
<br />
(by the way FD does not drop me to the bottom of the hate list when I stand.)<br />
<br />
This is why the guy above idea about stacking DoTs in a group then FDing and stacking some more does not work.  When he mention that I knew he really didn't play a necro and was just talking up a storm about how he thought it was.<br />
<br />
b.  What if, I hit DS instead of FD and try to get the mob off me and on my pet.  But soon find that DS only works that way with another player engaging not a pet.  In fact you can hit DS and unless there is another player engaging and not just your pet the mob will just stay on you.<br />
<br />
Sorry but I don't like these odds.  <br />
I like trying to get a heal spell off as a shaman.  And while a mob that is slowed is on me more often than not I have no problem with getting the heal spell off.  Plus as a priest I do mitigate the damage taken better than a caster such as a necro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless, soloing power plays a small role in class balancing anyways.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was not pointing out a balancing issue as much as I was pointing out ONE thing that put me that much further over the edge to change to a shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are not actually being serious here, are you? Bane after slowing amounts to maybe 2 ticks worth of damage. Combined with our &quot;not bad&quot; pet we might reach 40 DPS with that. The group will always be better of with an enchanter and cleric then with a shaman + any class.<br />
<br />
Before this statement.  The example was talking about cleric DPS to shaman DPS.  While the cleric was healing and the shaman was slowing.  What the shaman brought to the table compared to the cleric via DPS in the group.  But we can go on to this new subject if you want to?<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me show you some numbers. Shaman heal 50% as well as clerics (less actually). Let us be generous and make that 70% after figuring in slow - when doing nothing but healing. Let us further say shaman deal 50% of the damage a dedicated DPS class does - when doing nothing but damage.<br />
Now, we have a group and that group will need a certain amount of healing - say 140% of what a cleric can do (likely more is needed in GoD). They also need a plate tank and the rest of the group is DPS.<br />
<br />
They could get a cleric and a druid to cover healing. That leaves them with 3 slots for damage classes and or 300% of damage.<br />
Or they could get 4 shaman to &quot;heal and do a little damage) - leaving the group with one DPS slot or 100% + 4*25% or 200% damage overall.<br />
<br />
This one scenario.  (You already know my feelings on GoD and that I agree with you about GoD.  But we continue to bring this up /sigh.)  GoD just needs more tweaking.<br />
<br />
But I will play along.  <br />
<br />
How about an enchanter (and charmed mob), a shaman, Warrior, Bard, 2XRangers.  <br />
<br />
1. Mob is fully slowable (now due to some changes in GoD already.)<br />
<br />
2. Enchanter provides the off tanking mob that at the end of the fight gains massive HP back.  <br />
<br />
3. Warrior provides tanking too.  Once in a while stepping out of the fight to allow the shaman to heal.  (with a slowed mob, enchanter + Bard + FT and Canni.... a shaman has plenty of mana to chain up Heal over time and some Direct heals to the warrior who has stepped out of the fight.)<br />
<br />
4. Bard pulls the mob managing the aggro for the shaman to land slow and the warrior to get some of a hold on the mob (not so much that he can't step out of the fight.)<br />
<br />
5. Rangers plug arrows out making crazy DPS.<br />
<br />
6. Enchanter stays far enough back with very little aggro the mob is the group is taking and to their own charmed pet allowing if charm does brake for the bard or enchanter to get off a stun (no not a point blank stun) to recharm.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed a group like this :).  My shaman did an excellent job of main healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flexibility in a class does not cut it if you are not very close to the specialists, not if you can mix and match on a group level to get exactly what you need. If your are not able to provide a mix of damage and healing that is close to 100% (at the same time) you better be a tank, else you are dead weight to a group.<br />
<br />
Our flexiblity makes us stronger.  <br />
Infact when does flexibility never make one stronger.<br />
1.  I don't believe shamans are a dead wieght in the group.  <br />
2.  I know I am not.  <br />
3.  Hell, Valsuvious above gets groups, I bet he does not feel like a dead wieght.<br />
4.  Sometimes if you believe you are horrible at playing then your play style can reflect that.<br />
 <br />
<br />
&quot;we can do many things!&quot; is not a reason. A reason would be &quot;our superior mana regeneration is enough to overcome the cleric's superior healing spells and heal more damage over a large span of time. As we can still heal adequately in the majority of single group encounters I think shaman healing is fine - shaman are better over long periods of time, clerics are better in emrgencies and can rez.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now your just going over the deep end with these examples/sarcasm.<br />
<br />
<br />
We, as a community have discussed some issues for a long time now. Restating literally dozens of pages of posts becomes tiresome after a while. Here is my own personal summary of our issues - others have posted their own too. <br />

You know, I actually did that. It is not even hard. When you find yourself out of healers that is pretty much what you can do. SO you gather 6 DPS classes and do LDoN normals.<br />
Heck, a group of 6 beastlords have done them just to show they can. I can easily duo them. Why would a decent group have trouble surviving on ranger heals?<br />
<br />
(replying to me saying that necromancers do not die often enough to make them earn less experience while soloing)<br />
(deaths add up.  But I also don't have a second account for a cleric bot for my cluttered corpses.)<br />
*boggle* Did you even bother to read my sentence before you quoted it? If the necromancer earns more experience even when he dies a couple of times the deaths do in fact not add up to make him earn less experience.<br />

(snip prelude)This is why the guy above idea about stacking DoTs in a group then FDing and stacking some more does not work.  When he mention that I knew he really didn't play a necro and was just talking up a storm about how he thought it was.<br />
Of course if you actually wait to get aggro before feigning that does not work. Which is exactly what said poster stated. Feign before you get aggro. Which is exactly what I see competent necromancers do.<br />

So aggro kite it? Move a bit? You are aware that MOBs are hardcoded to ignore pets while players are in reach, right? It will work fine once you are out of melee range.<br />

A cleric can match shaman healing and then outdamage the pet. A shaman can not match cleric healing. A cleric can not match a shaman for pure DPS but then noone invites clerics into groups to do damage.<br />
Clerics are better at the pure healing role. Clerics are better at the &quot;healing + damage&quot; role. What does that leave for shaman?<br />
<br />
This one scenario.  (You already know my feelings on GoD and that I agree with you about GoD.  But we continue to bring this up /sigh.)  GoD just needs more tweaking.<br />

Beastlords outbuff shaman.<br />
<br />
More HPs.<br />
More ATK.<br />
More stats.<br />
More resists.<br />
More mana regeneration.<br />
and a tiny amount less of haste.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">B.

<br />
<br />
Despite your ability to attempt to justify your arguements with incredibly rare &quot;scenarios&quot;, this is the line that sticks out the most to me.<br />
<br />
Here is the thing Murtak is saying. Anywhere a Shaman can function as &quot;main healer&quot;, it would be TOTALLY trivial for a cleric. <br />
<br />
He isnt saying Shaman cant be main healers in LDoN-Hard or EP XP groups (although both those tasks are EXTREMELY difficult, even for very good shaman). He is saying if a Shaman can do it, its TOTALLY trivial for a cleric. In every single case. <br />
<br />
And they can add DPS, to boot, because a cleric doesnt need even half the mana required if its difficult for a shaman. <br />
<br />
Go ahead, pick the HARDEST &quot;scenario&quot; you can think of that a Shaman is main healer, then insert Cleric instead. Its a joke. Even without slow, they outheal us by a MASSIVE margin. Even on fully slowable mobs, we are not even in the same BALLPARK as Clerics, or even druids. Now, factor in slow mitigation and immunity, and you have the MAIN reasons folks like Murtak are complaining about our healing. <br />
<br />
As for some of your other topics, you should just admit you lost the BL vs Shaman buffing arguement. Its not even close, in fact, they are SO far above us buff-wise its not even funny. <br />
<br />
Not gonna analyze the rest of your arguements either, man, but I will tell you this. You are losing them all. Baddly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Clerics with the same AC take less melee damage then shaman. Clrics can reach more AC with similar fear then shaman can.<br />
<br />
That is flat out not true.  A shaman can get the same AC as a cleric and they both mitigate the damage taken the same way.  I can look up the discussion of Priest mitigation of damage taken if need be.  All the priests are on the same table for damage taken.  This is rediculous.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you actually accusing anyone of being offending?<br />
<br />
Disagreeing with you is infact a discussion at times.  Just don't like you taking my words out of context.  Also admittedly I am see I have done this too.  But the english language is not perfect.  Want to debate in French ;).<br />
<br />
<br />
So Giac states he wants &quot;drastic changes&quot; which you then equate to &quot;tons of new abilities, none of which we had before&quot;. Go on tell us where Giac asked for tons of new abilities shaman never had before. Show us quotes, link us posts.<br />
<br />
Veeshan my posts are long and so are yours as we get further into the discussion I just simply decided I would pull a quote that showed the true morbid nature of Giac.  And it was splended example found in less than 60 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go reread the post I quoted from. You stated atone is a stun with a memblur. You stated mezzes stun.<br />
<br />
Mez in the sense stuns for a second even causing and interrupt in mob's spells.  Atone stuns for a second producing the same result.  None the less I say apples and apples you say apples and oranges.  (I am sure some wise ass will take this paragraph to the extreme and out of context.)<br />
<br />
<br />
See? you state it again. And no, this is not what mez does. Which is why enchanters complain about you hitting their mezzed MOBs and paladins do not complain about you hitting their stunned MOBs. The effects are not the same.<br />
Atone does the same thou the duration of stun is much lower.<br />

<br />
And there you go again, putting words in other people's mouths. I never stated clerics do not get them. In fact I often list them as a prime example of cleric utility.<br />
<br />
first - Them being lulls. <br />
Second you stated I did not know what mez, lulls, and stuns do.<br />
I stated, I never brought up how lulls worked other than to state that clerics get lulls.   But this is another language barrier issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other then saying atone is a stun you mean?<br />
<br />
<br />
You know how I relate mez and short duration stun spells such as atone from the explanation above.<br />
<br />
<br />
You actually replied to a too-early-closed quote. That was your own text you were replying to, which I proved false a single line further down.<br />

<br />
<br />
And they should be viable healers for all single group content, period.<br />
<br />

Who says so???!!  Why should a shaman ALWAYS be a viable choice as a main healer?  <br />
<br />
Are clerics ALWAYS needed for a group, No they aren't.  <br />
<br />
How is it fair that a shaman in your mind needs/should always be able to take over a clerics job in a group!??!?!<br />
<br />
<br />
You know, I actually did that. It is not even hard. When you find yourself out of healers that is pretty much what you can do. SO you gather 6 DPS classes and do LDoN normals.<br />
Heck, a group of 6 beastlords have done them just to show they can. I can easily duo them. Why would a decent group have trouble surviving on ranger heals?<br />
<br />
You know if I had a dime for every BST that bragged that they could have a group of BSTs handle any LDON normal dungeon without a problem I would be rich.  Seriously,  BSTs are very high on themselves about this.  But watch as they are rushed by a group of four mobs in a normal Takish dungeon as in a clutter of pets and no orginization watch 1 or two in the group die and need a rez.  :rolleyes:   <br />
<br />
<br />
*boggle* Did you even bother to read my sentence before you quoted it? If the necromancer earns more experience even when he dies a couple of times the deaths do in fact not add up to make him earn less experience.<br />
<br />
Veeshan what if the necro gains no experience.  Because you know what that has happened too.  We can presume all day but the fact is my necro took the fall several times and it was a contributing factor to my change to a shaman class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course if you actually wait to get aggro before feigning that does not work. Which is exactly what said poster stated. Feign before you get aggro. Which is exactly what I see competent necromancers do.<br />
<br />
Wait, so your actually telling me.  A necro can stack DoTs then FD before Aggro (granted this occurs) stand up and stack more DoTs thinking that your aggro has NOT remained the same with the previous DoTs stacked?  (By way you do remember when we stack just 2 DoTs like Bane and BoS, shamans see aggro.)<br />
<br />
Veeshan, if a necro has stack 2 dots on a mob then FDs before he gets aggro.  Then stands with in the group not more than 15 seconds after his FDing and proceeds to stack more DoTs as the poster was stating.  <br />
<br />
A.  The Necro will either get Aggro right away from standing up from next tick of the stacked dots.<br />
<br />
B.  or the min. he/she adds another DoT.  Will get Aggro immediately.  After all, stack DoTs is still stacking DoTs on a mob, regardless of the amount of damage the DoTs stacked on the mob, Stacked DoTs still draw major agro.<br />
<br />
Besides, when it comes to DoT stacking in groups necros have it just as bad as shaman sometimes only landing at most 2 DoTs in the fight without these DoTs going their full duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
So aggro kite it? Move a bit? You are aware that MOBs are hardcoded to ignore pets while players are in reach, right? It will work fine once you are out of melee range.<br />
<br />
Did you just say Aggro kite... Grr.  You don't agro kite summoning mobs!  Especially when they get a free round of unslowed wacks on you from just their summoning ability alone.  <br />
<br />
I know how players and pets are hardcoded.  And no just stepping back as you have your DS shield on does not cause the mob to focus on your pet.  <br />
<br />
Best example to show how little grasp pets in melee range have on aggro on a mob is with your shaman and your pet.  Cast Blind on the mob then stand back and watch as your pet in melee range does not have the same effect as if you were within melee range of a blinded mob.<br />
In many cases you blind a mob the mob could careless about the pet chewing on them.<br />
<br />
Aka:  DS will save you if there is another player in melee range of the mob but not if your pet is in melee range.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you don't like the necromancer style of soloing. Fair enough. But stating we somehow solo better then them is false.<br />
<br />
Taking my words out of context again.  I said a necro can take the same mobs a shaman can but I believe necros do this more sloppily.  I have been preaching that for the last 4 posts.  <br />
<br />
1.  unreliable Charms <br />
2.  unreliable casts of drain lifes on a high damaging, unslowed, summoning mob<br />
3.  Mashing FD and DS doesn't always give the chance to recover the fight (especailly since I had to nail FD an DS to begin with due to the state of my HP).<br />
<br />
How many more times do I need to preach this?<br />
<br />
A cleric can match shaman healing and then outdamage the pet. A shaman can not match cleric healing. A cleric can not match a shaman for pure DPS but then noone invites clerics into groups to do damage.<br />
Clerics are better at the pure healing role. Clerics are better at the &quot;healing + damage&quot; role. What does that leave for shaman?<br />
<br />
Its called support healing.  We have been this role even in raids/groups in past expansions and even now.  We add easy to the cleric's life of healing and add control situations that could get out of hand for the party members.  More often I have settled a warriors fear just by the cast of my quick acting slow spell.  And while the cleric is taking aggro and damage I can help to save them.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the group would simply be better of with a cleric instead of the shaman. It is almost as if you built the group in your example to make sure the shaman is not needed. I have trouble finding a worse example to show shaman power then that.<br />
<br />
You don't know that???<br />
<br />
The fact is that a shaman did take the place of a cleric and in a GoD example.<br />
<br />
But perhaps its really dependent on how morbid you look on the subject to which way you want to sway this arguement.  <br />
<br />
In one point I did replace the cleric in a GoD group.  In the other hand your stating you believe the experience would have been better if the group took much longer than they already had to beg a cleric to come.  Resulting in less exp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uh, would you mind linking me a post in which you do something else then ramble on about how something Tarthug said annoyed you?<br />
<br />
In your less than 60 min. reaction plus the time to write your replying post I doubt you even read my replys in that other thread to the list the communitee created.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am pretty much giving up on discussing class balance with you, as you seem to be content with being somewhat useful in content two expansions old.<br />
<br />
Funny when the discussion from my side is about Hard LDON, Elemental planes and even a GoD scenario.  I HAVE NOT BEEN BRING UP CONTENT TWO EXPANSIONS OLD.  <br />
<br />
Veeshan infact the only one stating over and over again and infact trying to put words in to my mouth like Easy LDON and BoT.  <br />
<br />
Is you...  <br />
<br />
Maybe you should get off experience from two expansions ago?<br />
<br />
<br />
But I would like to bring this point across.<br />
<br />
Beastlords outbuff shaman.<br />
<br />
More HPs.<br />
More ATK.<br />
More stats.<br />
More resists.<br />
More mana regeneration.<br />
and a tiny amount less of haste.<br />
<br />
No matter how often you ask &quot;but what if the shaman used inferior buffs?&quot;, beastlords will outbuff us.<br />
<br />
Yet, when a group thinks lets get a BST they are thinking about nothing but adding a DPS role to the group.  <br />
<br />
Where an Enchanter could fit that niche providing even better haste, mana regen, slows and DPS.  <br />
<br />
How many 'what ifs' are we going to bring up?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">No, it's more due to false claims than anything else.<br />
<br />
Fact 1: Atone is not a mezz in ANY way, shape or form. Hell, it's not even a stun, it's a very unreliable low level memblur<br />
<br />
Fact 2: Only &quot;some&quot; mezzes have a memblur component attached to them(40% being the highest, if my memory serves me well). Enchanters and Bards aren't the only class that have &quot;mezz&quot; spells. Clerics do not, however(yeah, that's no news)<br />
<br />
Fact 3: Game mechanics for mezzes and stuns are very different by itself(Mezzes work serverside by ticks and can be broken etc.). Mobs that used to be immune to stuns were automatically immune to mezzes up until PoP, hence the confusion. With PoP even that similarity changed.<br />
<br />
Edit: Corrected wording</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">That is flat out not true.  A shaman can get the same AC as a cleric and they both mitigate the damage taken the same way.  I can look up the discussion of Priest mitigation of damage taken if need be.  All the priests are on the same table for damage taken.  This is rediculous.<br />
<br />
Actually, mitigation is based on armor type, not class - Though monks and warriors both get a bonus, if I remember.<br />
<br />
So, let's say they both mitigate the same, based on that. That's naked.<br />
<br />
So, we armor them in equivilant class armor. Let's say, oh, Ornate sets.<br />
<br />
For this experiement, we'll be using two characters. A level 65 Barbarian shaman with 25 points in wisdom and 5 in Stamina, and a 65 dwarven cleric with 25 points in Wisdom, and 5 points in Agility (to raise it to 75 and avoid the AC penalty). We're going to max out their Defense and Dodge skills (200 and 75 each, respectively), and then we're going to give the Shaman a full set of Scaled Avatar, and give the cleric a full set of Vengeful Fury. Let's see what happens.<br />
<br />
Cleric: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1032881<br />
Result: 951 AC<br />
<br />
Shaman: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1032866<br />
Result: 877 AC<br />
<br />
Difference in AC between Shaman and Cleric in equivilant sets of class armor: 84 raw AC.<br />
<br />
But wait, that's not the end of it. Let's toss on AC buffs, as well!<br />
<br />
Cleric: Virtue: +72 AC. (I don't know if Armor of the Zealot stacks, so I'll omit it)<br />
<br />
Shaman: Ancestral Guard: +36 AC<br />
<br />
End results<br />
Cleric: 1023 AC<br />
Shaman: 913 AC<br />
Difference: 110 AC<br />
<br />
So, all things being equal, a cleric will out-AC a shaman<br />
<br />
And what's that? Hit points you say?<br />
Cleric base: 1793<br />
Shaman Base: 1866 (Oooo, we're in the lead!)<br />
<br />
Post-buffing:<br />
Cleric: Virtue (+1405 HP)<br />
Shaman: Fo7 (+ 544 HP), + Boar (+60 Sta, an average of, what 150 HP without ND AA?) for a total of 694 HP.<br />
<br />
End result: <br />
Clerics: 3200 HP<br />
Shaman: 2560 HP<br />
<br />
Now, JUST in their respective ornate armors, and self-buffed, Clerics are ahead of Shaman on both counts as far as &quot;tanking&quot; goes. Now, if Shama and Cleric mitigation is identical, as you say, then, Shamans in equivilant gear to Clerics will tank WORSE. <br />
<br />
If it's as i'm dead certain it is, and based on chain / plate, rather than class grouping, then... Clerics are still ahead.</div></div><hr />

Yes some Mezzes do carry a memblur component, though is it very small. Below Glamour of Kintaz, 54 chanter, it is a 1% chance of memblur, from this spell on it is 30 or 40% if the chance exists.</div></div><hr />

Henya,  <br />
<br />
Before you go any further about what you believe about cleric plate and shaman chain armor.<br />
 <br />
All the priest are on the same damage takening mitigation table.<br />
<br />
Short summary:<br />
&quot;Plate classes have a greater damage mitigation factor than chain classes since plate armor is supposed to absorb more damage than chain.<br />
<br />
This is not the case for clerics. The clerics ability to mitigate damage (i.e. not get hit for the full amount) ranks above a pure caster (i.e. wizard, i.e. cloth) and below a Beastlord (i.e. leather). This has been tested, this has been accepted as fact. Clerics are not asking for the ability to tank a MOB, since the very idea is ludacrous at best.&quot;<br />

Mez in the sense stuns for a second even causing and interrupt in mob's spells.  Atone stuns for a second producing the same result.  <br />

Yes, it does indeed look different. If you would look at your own words you would see that Mesmerize does have an effect atone does not have. This effect is what we like to call a &quot;mez&quot;. Atone does not have that component and is thus not one of these &quot;mezzes&quot;.<br />
<br />
The memblur component both spells share surprisingly does not mesmerize but instead memblurs.<br />
<br />
Who says so???!!  Why should a shaman ALWAYS be a viable choice as a main healer?  <br />
Are clerics ALWAYS needed for a group, No they aren't.  <br />
How is it fair that a shaman in your mind needs/should always be able to take over a clerics job in a group!??!?!<br />
None the less I say apples and apples you say apples and oranges.  (I am sure some wise ass will take this paragraph to the extreme and out of context.)<br />
Because that is our role as a class? Only three classes get heals from level one onwards. We call those classes healers.<br />
<br />
And no, clerics are not always needed. But they are always viable. Shaman are not. Moreover, if the content you are playing in, clerics are always optimal.<br />
<br />
You know if I had a dime for every BST that bragged that they could have a group of BSTs handle any LDON normal dungeon without a problem I would be rich.

But watch as they are rushed by a group of four mobs in a normal Takish dungeon as in a clutter of pets and no orginization watch 1 or two in the group die and need a rez.  :rolleyes:   <br />
Beastlord groups have done this. A group of my guildies did it. Seeing as I know paladins and necromancers who can solo entire LDoN normals I have no trouble believing it. Why would a group with 6 slowers, 6 pets, 6 melee classes and 6 healers even have the slightest trouble with pulling 4 MOBs a beastlord can easily solo?<br />
<br />
Its called support healing.  We have been this role even in raids/groups in past expansions and even now.  We add easy to the cleric's life of healing and add control situations that could get out of hand for the party members.  More often I have settled a warriors fear just by the cast of my quick acting slow spell.  And while the cleric is taking aggro and damage I can help to save them.<br />
Well, if your idea of being balanced is to be a weak cleric then pretty much all discussion is wasted. In other words: A cleric is a better backup healer then a shaman. Slow or no slow.<br />

So you do agree that beastlords do in fact outbuff us? Because that is what this argument was about. Whether or not beastlords are in outdamaged or outbuffed by other classes has zero bearing on them outbuffing shaman.<br />

I am not very good at German.  Smart ppl thou.  Even cooler accents.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no need to take it out of context. You are flat out wrong.<br />
<br />
All in the eye of the beholder.  To me... you are very wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because that is our role as a class? Only three classes get heals from level one onwards. We call those classes healers.<br />
<br />
Veeshan there was a time druids were whining for more healing.  They got it.  Now we see druids abusing that heal.  It ruins the game.  How?  They use it to take mobs they weren't intended too.  Thorns and Healing.  A new unintended soloing tactic was forged.<br />
<br />
Mobs virtually die on the Druids damage sheild all the while the druid uses a large healthy heal which is very mana efficently to save their butts.  Now, no dev. knew at the time this huge heal would be used in such a way.  <br />
<br />
Infact admittedly no dev. thought charm would be abused the way it is by enchanters.  <br />
<br />
But once you make a drastic change to a class its hard to take that ability back.  That little part that ruined the game can't easily be taken back without an even larger up cry being heard from those players that don't read the boards and don't know if their class has any faults to begin with.   This cry is a result of cancelled accounts far more than a few board posters and readers.<br />
<br />
Now if the devs were to JUST tweak the GoD mob encounters to be more shaman friendly a few more upper shamans would preach to the crowd (about their minds now at ease over GoD) and a few more lower/unexperienced shamans would hush their whining.<br />
<br />
I don't want a overpowering heal power, I don't want a line up for another abusive pattern ruining further content in the game.<br />
<br />
This ... This is my true arguement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, if your idea of being balanced is to be a weak cleric then pretty much all discussion is wasted. In other words: A cleric is a better backup healer then a shaman. Slow or no slow. <br />
<br />
Slow creates ease in healing.  And two clerics healing botch up the job healing at in-operatune (sp?) times.  This is just bad.  I will stick with the healer and slower thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or in other words, if you could have gotten a cleric you would have - you only used a shaman because you could not get anything better. Which just proves my point.<br />
<br />
So the fact I had a role the enchanter could not play from his disant in the fight.  I played a role as a healer.  I played a role as a stat buffer.  Hell, I even played the role of FA ing.  Makes you think a cleric would be better.  No way.  Not at all.<br />
<br />
Veeshan this is getting old.  My shaman in that scenario was ideal and very welcomed.  And guess what, I provided more exp for a group that could have very much been sitting around all day looking for a cleric all the while waiting gaining ZERO exp and Zero loot.<br />
<br />
Think about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
The elemental planes are in fact two expansions old.<br />
<br />
You are just as guilty bring up elemental planes in your arguements.<br />
<br />
And top of all that, you also, just as easily over look that I mentioned Hard LDON and GoD.  Whatever.  Geez.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you do agree that beastlords do in fact outbuff us? Because that is what this argument was about. Whether or not beastlords are in outdamaged or outbuffed by other classes has zero bearing on them outbuffing shaman.<br />
<br />
If you lose an argument just admit you were wrong and move on.<br />
<br />
No, this was the original arguement below, I stated against your very first post in this thread.  <br />
<br />
But Hey, you can make up the conclusion you like instead. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
You are aware that clerics are suppose to be the best healers.<br />
<br />
But then again clerics can't provide haste to others. Where a shaman could and while healing. <br />
<br />
Maybe with a shaman's ability to heal and buff we can drop the need for a cleric all together. After all, that is what cleric does basically (heal and buff).<br />
<br />
Who can heal, buff, and haste???? Oh wait, in some cases we can. <br />
<br />
Whatever, don't mind me, VeeshanMurtak, I am just tired of your complaining.</div></div><hr />

The clerics ability to mitigate damage (i.e. not get hit for the full amount) ranks above a pure caster (i.e. wizard, i.e. cloth) and below a Beastlord (i.e. leather). This has been tested, this has been accepted as fact. Clerics are not asking for the ability to tank a MOB, since the very idea is ludacrous at best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay, first off, Dikmer has posted a grand total of 6 times, five on a single thread. Each of those posts amounts to this:<br />
<br />
 Shaman so totally rock more than clerics, who suck even though I play one, clerics suck at tanking because I probably have the hit points of an anorexic enchanter and the Defense Skill of a twink bard soloer<br />
<br />
Here's an idea why beastlords are better at mitigating damage than clerics - higher skill caps in Dodge and Defense. Skills such as Block and Riposte. Matter of fact, Dikmer agrees with me on the fact... <br />
<br />
Oh, and more of his fun.<br />
<br />
 You want more proof, I once dueled a shaman friend in the Arena zone. We both used the same weapon (2h blunt) and we had real similar AC. We stood there and beat on each other just to see who would be better. My hits were lots and lots of 1's and 10's and a few higher. The shaman was hitting me for 30's and 40's. Consistantly.<br />
<br />
Might be because Clerics have a lower 2hb cap? 25 points does make a surprising amount of Difference. He also doesn't state what his strength was - it matters. &quot;Real similar AC&quot;? What is &quot;real similar&quot;? They fought with 2hb? What 2hb, exactly? If the Shaman is lugging around a boneshot greatstaff and the cleric has a runed totem staff or something, the fight seems a little foregone. And lastly, he was whipped by a Shaman in a melee duel. oh my god, we need a whack with the nerf stick, we can hit clerics with hammers if they accept a /duel! BRENLO! Can you hear me?!<br />
<br />
Cleric Defense caps at 200, as does Offense. Weapon skills (1h blunt, 2h blunt) cap at 175. Our pet has 100 HP and hits for about 45ish. The summoned hammer procs like mad, for 100ish.<br />
<br />
This being said, Shamans are better tanks.<br />
<br />
This being said, I like waffles. I can prove it, because one time, me and my little sister were eating eggos, and I, like, TOTALLY ate two more than she did. beat that.<br />
<br />
Gagner, seriously... Just because a source agrees with your misconceptions sometimes, doesn't mean that either of you are correct. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Hmm way back when you used to be mezzed in pvp, I got the message you are stunned.I also recall mezzing myself and getting that. And I am sure that when a mob mezzes you, you also get that message although I guess it might have changed.<br />
<br />
When you attempt to cast a spell while mezzed, the game will tell you you can't cast while being stunned, if I recall correctly. That's probably what you are thinking about.<br />
<br />
Gagner, your language barriers are no excuse for the ignorance you show. So this was what you quoted from my post:<br />

<br />
and there goes your reply:<br />
<br />
Giac, I could not find on lucy a single enchanter mez spell with out a memblur component of at least (1%). Care to tell me more?<br />
<br />

<br />
and here the next gem:<br />

Fact 1: Atone is not a mezz in ANY way, shape or form. Hell, it's not even a stun, it's a very unreliable low level memblur<br />

Its been known for a while that clerics, druids and shamans are on the same damage taken mitigation table.  Pointing out what 'you' think are extremes in Dikmer post does NOT change the facts.<br />
<br />

<br />
Bah... Giac your right.  I looked up Mesemerize on Lucy then clicked on Stacking.  It did not give these following spells:  Bliss of the Nihil, Lullaby of Morrell and Dreams of Terris don't have Memblur components.<br />
<br />
*Shakes his fist*  You won this round Captain Morbid errr Giac.<br />
<br />
Giac my grammar and spelling suffers and yes, I do blame this since many of my words in this thread were taken out of context.<br />
<br />
As for the atone issue that all stemmed from Henya's typo (inwhich he ment to write enchanter rather than cleric)  I give him the benefit of the doubt (and yes, my language barrier did not pick up he ment enchanter).  So I took it simply as Henya stated it below:<br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics still have crack, Lulls, mez, and the best damage output in the game, period.<br />
<br />
I assumed he ment:<br />
A.  Cleric shielding buff which provides mana was equivalent to crack (slur for mana regen).<br />
B.  Cleric's do infact get lulls spells.<br />
C.  What is the closest spell that acts like mez that clerics can use thats what &quot;I&quot; stated below.<br />
<br />

How am I wrong?  I believe the shaman class is just fine other than a few GoD encounters need to be tweaked.<br />
<br />
You on the other hand are proving nothing.<br />
