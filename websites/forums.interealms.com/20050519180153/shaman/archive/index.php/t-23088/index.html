<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jratkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Want to install EQ into different directories but dont really have a clue.  Was wondering if any of you would be so kind as to give me a few instructions.  Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would reinstall it from disk and when it asks what directories need changed put it in the new Folder you would like it in.  You only have to install the basic files.  Then take the old EQ folder and copy all files into the new folder and you will be good to go.  Keep in mind that not all files go to this folder so some maybe overwritten.  I believe that patcher will update them if they are changed anyway.<br />
<br />
instead of C:\program files\sony\<br />
you could use C:\program files\sony_new\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EQ is not directory specific.  meaning, you can just copy it to another folder as long as you keep EQs folder structure intact.<br />
<br />
ex&gt;  Eqgame.exe is in c:\Program Files\Sonly Online Entertainment\Everquest Trilogy\Everquest<br />
<br />
You can take the Everquest folder and copy it to d:\EQ<br />
<br />
Then you only need to recreate your shortcuts to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye. Just make a copy-over.<br />
<br />
I, actually, have a copy of a copy of a copy of my first EQ install.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, just copy c:\everquest to c:\everquest2 or something like that.. I've done it but don't really use the second directory, I seem to run 2 accounts fine from 1..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jratkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks a ton guys.  It helps a ton and currently copying over a 3rd for my cleric so I can see how 3 boxing is now.   DX9 totally messed me up for the longest on being able to box my toons.  Thanks again to all of you who responded.</div></div><hr />
