<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Never hunted here with my shaman, so honestly have no idea on mob resist rates, etc., for a lot of our spells  (I remember getting a lot of resist on stuns and FoL with the pally though).  <br />
<br />
I do know, however, that I solo/grouped here from 30 - 38 with my paladin (slightly twinked) easily.  Starting out, rockhoppers are probably your best bet.  Mobs do assist, by the way.<br />
<br />
Wish I could offer more advice.<br />

Moved up to stonegraber things by 35th then went to Dawnshroud.(zelniaks, et al.) to 41 and lost intested in things monkly.<br />
<br />
Anyway, <br />
Rockhopper things are indiff and social..<br />
<br />
Zelniaks are kos and social.<br />
<br />
Rockgrabbers are indiff and social.<br />
<br />
Rescuro fellas will attack the zelniaks (if you get an unexpected add of a zel you can run them over to the local rscuro camp)... However you may also consider knocking these guys off as they are seru faction, if that interests you.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a 31 dru the resists make this someplace to be avoided. (imho).<br />

Another thought at 25 is netherbein lair. However, I am finding it hazardus/annoying at 24 dual boxing with 24clr.<br />

From just a quick relook at the zone.. just as I remember it. Think I'll be staying till I find Dogdog. (=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As the originator of this thread I felt I should add a little more now that I have hit level 29 (nearly 30).<br />
<br />
Firstly..forget Marus Seru unless you are grouped. From 25 on you can solo in MS, but the mobs have a lot of hps and invariably add. Experience isnt great unless you are grouped and have a decent puller.<br />
<br />
Now...Echo Caverns is where you want to be !!!  :)<br />
<br />
When u zone into Echo Caverns, go left and thru the sliding doors. Just past the doors is a 4 spawn bogling camp..if you stay in the centre of the room you wont aggro them. Take the first right past these doors and the next right again. Here you will find the needlite cave. There are 6 static needlites with the occasional roamer and rarely the queen spawns (Last I saw her she was yellow to me at 27). They are for the main part single pulls (the two right in the centre of the room will come together). I found this a great camp and am still there at 29...I plan to stay til 30. The Needlites attack very fast, which is great for DEFENSE, but they usually only hit for 2 points. However, it makes sense to pull with Slow..then you can usually channel your dots thru. At 29, I now pull with Envenomed Breath and just melee them :) There are 6 Needlites, all on a 20 minute timer. 3 are on the left wall, 2 in the centre and 1 in a recess near the wormspore tentacle at the entrance. Camp is easily broken up into a kill every 3 or 4 minutes.<br />
<br />
If you're feeling particularly industrious you can pull the bogling scouts at the sliding doors too though the Needlites should be plenty til u hit 29.<br />
<br />
A word of caution...there are wormspore tentacles that will root and lifetap you in this zone. I keep Endure Magic up at all times and resist 33% of these. At 29 these are more of a nuisance than a danger. When they do manage to lifetap me they only take about 1/2 bubb hps and root only lasts a few seconds. To be honest at 29 this camp is just plain silly...almost too easy..but each kill still nets me over 1/2 blue bubb of exp.<br />
<br />
For all you Shaman who have been neglecting your defensive skills...GO HERE !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great post  Setantha, thanks for all the info :) I look forward to putting it all to use! Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the post, good info! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">wow, I just made 3 orange bubbles in about 1.5 hours there... great XP once you get the camp broken up good :)<br />
beg thorns off passing druids, they are a god-send since the little bast's hit so often. thanks again for the post Sent :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK, now alittle info about the loot in this little cave...<br />
About every other Needlite will drop a needlite wing, needlite legs, both, or 2 of one etc... These sell to vendors in SH for about 2 plat and wiegh hardly anything, good way to make a little money :)<br />
I saw the queen 3 times yesterday (went through level 28 in about 4 hours) at 28 I could solo her with full mana and HP but she was a bit hard. She has about twice as many HP as the regular needlites and hits for up to 35 (alot slower than the needlites though). The queen drops 2 things that I saw. A Giant Needlite Wing, (AC, AGI, DEX, saves) back item. Sells to vendors for about 20 plat. Giant Needlite Stinger (6 23 piercing or something like that, 2 disease damage, 3 save disease 3 save poison) sells to vendors for about 18 plat. At 28 the queen is an even con...<br />
Just thought I'd help ya'll out with some more info :)<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok you've got to be kidding right?  What have you got that I haven't got? Are you twinked, cuz I'm not and at level 27 this place ate my lunch.  Needlites hit for only 2hp BAH! In your dreams! Try 5-20 and they hit constantly.  Interrupt every spell I try to cast AND they are highly magic resistant too.  Even resisted my resist debuff! <br />
<br />
Pull with slow (if they don't resist) they still hit faster than most. <br />
<br />
I kept going back to try this place using different tactics, but with the same results each time. I had to gate out before biting the big one.  <br />
<br />
So, unless you are twinked or have someone to  PL you with damage shield and other buffs don't even think about trying to solo needlites until you get 29th level spells.</div></div><hr />

You can channel gate but cant channel a DoT ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I love the Needlite camp...but it is camped almost 24/7 on my server.   I'm getting pretty desperate to ding 29, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I read a lot of conflicting info about the Needlite cave. I decided to try it at 27.<br />
<br />
I like it. Good xp pretty fast. I do it counter clock wise and root DoT. The root breaks at random, so I often have to melee and reaply root. Takes me a random number of roots and two DoTs to kill one. I'm anywhere between 4 bbls to 1 bbl health after a fight. <br />
<br />
I have never failed to clear the room before respawn starts, so downtime is ok. I also try to melee because this mobs are great to raise defence.<br />
<br />
I seldom do the dubble pull. I usualy just bring them to the guards and go back to do the rest. I get 1/2 blue for each kill. <br />
<br />
I keep SOW up at all times. After I clear the room I just head to nexus and reaply. This helps a lot with the tentacle thingie at the entrance.<br />
<br />
Only seen the queen once and I let the guards do her.<br />
<br />
For reference:<br />
At this point (I just dinged 28 here) I have 597 AC unbuffed and a serpents bracer with afffliction extension II. <br />

Good grief....if you leave this camp long enough to go to nexus and resow yourself on my server, someone else will be there when you get back, guaranteed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Guess I have been lucky then :)<br />
<br />
Never ever seen anyone there. I have to admit that I haven't done this on peak hours. Things might be diferent then.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lets see...I checked at 1:30 am Tuesday...camped...checked at 11:30 pm Tuesday ..camped (by the same person).  Got up at 10 am Wednesday, not camped.  Within 5 minutes someone else was there trying to pull from my camp.  I explained it was camped.  They left.  I cleared it, I gated to Nexus to cast SOW, and in the time it took me to come back it was camped already.  Very frustrating.    Maybe I will get lucky tonight though.  Glad you are able to get it so often:)  If I can't get it soon I'm prolly gonna head to HHK though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was the one that didn't like the Needlites but I guess I just never got the hang of it.  They are pretty camped on my server too, so I headed back to the original recommendation of this thread and that is Marus Seru.  I don't like the main entrance for soloing, but outside the entrance to Santus Seru it is pretty easy to solo.  Greyhoppers are blue at level 24 and pretty easy to kill. Once they green out go for the Rockgrabbers, just remember to con them all because they vary a lot.  <br />
<br />
Lightcrawlers and Zelniaks will aggro<br />
<br />
Greyhoppers, Stonegrabbers and Beetles will not aggro unless you are fighting one of their own<br />
<br />
This makes it pretty safe to fight here and pretty easy to pull singles.  Exp is good here, loot sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">just a few quick things about Mseru mobs<br />
<br />
all the mobs are social so they will add if you are fighting another of their kind.<br />
<br />
Zelniaks and Lightcrawlers are the only mobs that wil aggro you for no particular reason, and are also the only ones that the guards will help out with if you train to the zone lines.<br />
<br />
Greyhoppers and Stonegrabbers never aggro unless you are fighting one of their own and the guards will not help out on them, but if you train to zone they won't aggro other players near the zone after you zone out.<br />
<br />
Recuso give positive faction in Sanctus Seru but one negative hit with Shadowhaven Smugglers. They start out non-aggro but the more you kill you eventually become KOS to them.<br />
<br />
I hunt here from mid 20's -low 30's grouped, never soloed here because the mobs have a lot of HP and just suck out your mana, too much downtime for the xp you get and the loot is decidedly subpar.<br />
<br />
Great for fast levelling in a group though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Selkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm really liking Marus Seru at 25.  I've been fighting near the Neth Lair zone.  It was bad at 23 before the level 24 dot, because everything has insane regen. Since 24 though, stacking Envenomed Breath, Affliction, Tainted Breath, and Sicken takes the hoppers down an average of 5% a tick.  (I throw Sicken in because their regen is just amazing.)  Sometimes I mix it up and slow &amp; melee near the end.  I rarely nuke because it doesn't seem very mana efficient.<br />
<br />
If I get one add, I just root and dot it too.  More than one though and I'm off to the guards if it's a crawler/zelniak or the zone if it's multiple hoppers.  I'm working up the courage to try AoE root dotting, but haven't tried it yet. :)<br />
<br />
No cash, but I've accumulated a veritable hoard of hopper hides. :)</div></div><hr />
