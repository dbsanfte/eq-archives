<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">TOAST OF THE IRISH:<br />
<br />
A man stumbles up to the only other patron in a bar and asks is he can buy him a drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, of course,&quot; comes the reply.<br />
<br />
The first man then asks, &quot;Where are you from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm from Ireland,&quot; replies the second man.<br />
<br />
The first man then responds, &quot;You don't say.  I'm from Ireland too!!<br />
<br />
Let's have another round to Ireland.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; says the second man.<br />
<br />
Curious, the first man asks, &quot;Where in Ireland are you from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dublin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe it,&quot; says the first man.  &quot;I'm from Dublin too!  Let's<br />
have another drink to Dublin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; replies the second man.<br />
<br />
Curiosity again strikes the first man as he asks, &quot;What school did you go to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Saint Mary's,&quot; says the second man.  &quot;I graduated in '62.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is unbelievable!!&quot; the first man said.  &quot;I went to Saint Mary's and graduated in '62 too!&quot;<br />
<br />
About that time one of the regulars sauntered in and sat down at the bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's been going on?&quot;, he queries the bartender.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing much,&quot; the bartender replied.  &quot;The O'Mally twins are drunk again.&quot;</div></div><hr />
