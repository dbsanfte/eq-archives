<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think this is a pretty easy choice....<br />
<br />
A friend and I are going to make a frog team...<br />
<br />
She wants to be frogs....<br />
<br />
Since I have a high level shaman I told here she could be a Caster...... She wants to be a shaman... but would play a cleric...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is......<br />
<br />
I think the only choice I have is to be a Paladin.....<br />
<br />
Warrior/ Shaman newb frog doesnt sound fun to me......<br />
<br />
DO you think this is the best combo for all frogs? .......<br />
<br />
What would you choose ?.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whatcha have for frogs? Warrior, Pal, Wiz, Cleric ,Shaman. MY wife loves frogs they werent a big deal to me. I have high lvl of each frog class already except cleric and i cant do it. I would of though tried the pally out but i had gotten mine to 60 right around LOY. If they could of been mage that would be a good choice but nope (. <br />
<br />
I miss any frog classes? Pal/shaman seem best choice than warrior/shaman  or warrior/cleric. Can make others work i guess just not as efficent maybe. I play pally/shaman combo myself after doing the warrior/shaman. Have alot more fun with pally but there were alot of dry spells but paid off in the end. <br />
<br />
  Dont mind me just spent a billion hrs getting jboots for my wifes wizard think i'm realizing i'm never going after an AC again and in short pally/shaman frog would be me choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman/Paladin would be your best bet.  Let her play the shaman since she wants too.  Paladin stuns and heals will help out alot.  Shaman become ineffective healers for warriors after level 30 since their hps out distance our heals even with Regeneration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did shaman/warrior to 60.  Took a long time, was very frustrating.  I think in the 50's it became a viable partnership again, with the big slow.  But you really can't tear loose with a warrior partner unless you can afford to get them crazy-aggro weapons.  Won't have that problem with a pally.  Not to mention they can heal up the canni.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">warrior cleric would work just fine , you would definetly have alot of fun , the cleric is exactly what the warrior needs.<br />
<br />
However , i myself went with the shaman/pally duo with my girlfriend. There is definetly alot more the team can do as far as spells. I cant really see them going places a war/clr combo couldnt , but to me itll be alot more fun. Heck , the SoW ability alone is worth it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I played a paladin to 54 on my original account, and now I have a froglok paladin.  I've tried warriors, but in my experience, they're very boring.  I like to mix it up a little, so I'm more of a hybrid guy.  I've had a blast with my paladins, and would suggest one before I would a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just wanna add ....<br />
<br />
Froggy monk please =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cleric/warrior would not be able to invis.  That's a huge huge handicapp if you like to explore.  <br />
<br />
Shaman/paladin would have both sorts of invis, enabling you to take your duo anywhere.  Paladins also get lull and stun lines that make single pulls more possible and they do get forms of rez, all thru the leveling process.<br />
<br />
Ya it's a viable combo.  Quite viable.  It's also an instant group.  Then again so is warrior/cleric.<br />
<br />
I'd say it's more a matter of personal preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with Landragoran.  Pally/Shm</div></div><hr />
