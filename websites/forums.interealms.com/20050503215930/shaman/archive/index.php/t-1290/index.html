<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think only priest spells, but we got 2 lvl 60 Luclin spells in about 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Here goes:<br />
<br />
My guild has been in Acrylia Caverns doing the Ring of the High Priest. We've been there with 4 parties but were way too many people, it's certainly doable with 2 parties, probably with 1 good lvl 60 party with lots of dmg output. The room has 4 possessed corpses or priests and a grimling high priest. The high priest isn't targettable, the possessed are normal local spawns. Note that the locals keep respawning, but the mobs are weak enough to not be a problem.<br />
<br />
As soon as one steps on the diving board he's perma rooted and the event starts. The high priest starts with doing some kind of ritual and soon the mobs start spawning one by one. There are 3 waves of spawns, each wave getting a bit harder. After the 3rd wave the Grimling high priest despawns and spawns as a killable mob. He's around lvl 58 but is weak (hits for about 200 but has lots of hp and can't be slowed). Once the priest is dead the event is over and the non-targettable high priest spawns again.<br />
<br />
We killed the high priest 2 times and got some crappy mask (unholy visor) along with a lvl 60 priest spell each time, Nature's Recovery and Blessing of Aegolism.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the high priest drops all lvl 60 priest spells but will have to verify. Just thought I'd let you know that this is a very easy way for a medium guild to get their lvl 60 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For those of us unacquainted with this ring, where is it located relative to the zone?  Can you invis to it?  You say one group might be able to do it, how uber is this final spawn?  How uber are the mobs you need to keel to spawn him?  Do the waves come on a timer, or are they triggered as to when you kill the last mob of each wave?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check out eqmaps.com, Landragon. I'm pretty sure I saw a map of Acrylia caverns there that had the High Priest location marked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bleh, EQmaps is all restricted now.  I don't go there anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's an unrestricted section of eqmaps if you click on the link on the top left area that says &quot;Map List By Zone&quot; and there's a decent (only) map of Ac Cav there with HP shown.<br />
<br />
where is it located relative to the zone? <br />
<br />
When you zone in, go right at the T, left at second junction (where you'd normally go straight/right for RoF), then follow that down and around til you pass a gate into a large area.  Hug the left wall until you see some short steps with pillars around it.  Go into that ent there and you'll be in a square room with large red gems embedded in the floor.  Past that and on the right wall is a door, then up the steps past that door is the area where the quest takes place.<br />
<br />
Can you invis to it? <br />
<br />
You can invis up to the short stairs spot where there's a couple of undead.  Just run up onto the landing and into the ent a bit and fight them there.  Pretty easy kills.  Undead the rest of the way but you can single pull them then move into the quest room.  Never tried ITU from there, but it'd probably work.<br />
<br />
how uber is this final spawn? <br />
<br />
As mentioned, both the named and unnamed PH are flagged unslowable, but every other spell landed for me at 57.  Uber being relative, he's not too hard.  A good CHer/tank combo in your group should be able to handle him.  Not sure if just Torpor could handle it though.<br />
<br />
How uber are the mobs you need to keel to spawn him? <br />
<br />
They're fairly easy kills also.  The healer skels are unmezzable but they hardly ever resist slow.  A good DPS for your group is most important.<br />
<br />
Do the waves come on a timer, or are they triggered as to when you kill the last mob of each wave? <br />
<br />
They're on a timer.  First 2 waves are 45 seconds per spawn (or maybe it's 51, don't remember now) and the last wave is around 30 seconds, I think.  Each wave has 13 or 14 skels to it, iirc.  The worst parts is when the room of 4 spawns a few times during the waves.  If you can split up each room spawn by a few minutes, it's probably easiest, of course.<br />
<br />
The named is a couple levels higher than the PH and harder, but not too much so.  After you kill the last of the waves then he'll shout out, summon back the person that triggered the quest and you're off.  We usually have a cleric do the quest since they can still heal from their rooted spot.  Don't go up onto that ledge or you become rooted also (or so I hear).  The skels pop at the wall facing the stairs up to the root ledge and head straight for the person rooted to try and kill or knock them off (either one stops the quest), so you have to set up a defense at the stairs and stop any before they make it up.<br />
<br />
You can keep doing the quest over and over again.  I'm pretty sure that only the person that started the quest the first time needs to camp out and come back, but maybe even that's not necessary.</div></div><hr />
