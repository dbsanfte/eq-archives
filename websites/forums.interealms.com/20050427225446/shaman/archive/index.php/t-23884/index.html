<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to tell waht I found out in regards to how my AAs worked.   I have been told from most to wait til I reached 65 to do AAs, however I found a way to get more AAs &quot;bang for you buck&quot;  so to speak.<br />
<br />
I did the 3 innate running AAs in PoJ.  I didnt care how long it took, I just wanted them as soonas I could get it.  I knew it would be useful and so it was.  Then in time I went to level 62 in the BoT zone.  I went to complete my Baroness statis and found something out.  Due to my low level in the zone BoT zone, I was getting roughly 3 to 4 points of exp in my AAs.  I coldnt believe this.  I complete my baroness statis realy fast that afternoon.  I went ahead and leveled to 63. I am now working on my AAs for my lvl 55 AAs. But something is different.  Instead of getting 3-4 points per kill I am now getting 2 points per kill.  Still that is good without a doubt, but if you wanting to fly in your AAs like I do, this is a shock.<br />
<br />
My point is, if you want to fly in your AAs, get at least halfway in your lvl 62, then change to 100% AAs, in BoT, or HoH.    Watch your AAs fly.<br />
<br />
If anyone else has seen awsome AAs like what I am speaking of, please share how many points you got and what zone you were in and at what lvl.</div></div><hr />

Are you telling me you were getting 3 or 4 AA's in one kill??  If that is the case, I think I'm going to start working towards 62 =0</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh I think he means 3-4% <br />
<br />
I noticed the same thing once I hit level 63 then it got much worse<br />
<br />
if you are with a group of people who are killing the easier mobs there very fast, then that is a MUCH better way to get aaxp I agree.  Its all about how quickly you kill which in those zones can be really fast with the new gear available at lower levels now, trickle down economics ;-)<br />
<br />
Porgy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's also about who you can group with.  A group of all 65's really well equipped and capable of earning AAxp much faster than you are used to, even at 62, will pass on you simply because you are 62.<br />
<br />
Level &gt; AA and level = advertising.  Nobody asks how many AA you have when you are invited to a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a 62 ranger that is EP flagged.  80 AA atm, makes them insanely fast.<br />
<br />
I'll usually box the shaman out of group and rake in the AA's over an afternoon.  While Jaidin is mostly right, sometimes being lower is better.  It just depends on your personal situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe that this is due to the 50% &quot;experience bonus&quot; that you get if you kill something that's within five levels of you.  Once the mobs you're fighting get to be 6 or more levels below you, your experience bar seems to just sit there telling you to move along.<br />
<br />
Personally I see this more as an experience penalty for soloers who are not geared well enough to consistently kill mobs only one or two levels below them.  Dark Blue doesn't mean equal experience I've found that expressing that opinion is flame bait.  It's all about perspective and lack thereof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">heh I think he means 3-4% <br />
<br />
Ok, that sounds alot more realistic :)  Still, that means in 25-30 kills you get an AA, and that is pretty darned good!  <br />
<br />
I just don't want to wait until 65 or 70 to get Cannibalization :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MLE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To me, experience per kill isnt' as good a metric as sustained experience rate per hour, since downtime after a fantastic exp mob may offset steady non-stop pulls.  At 65, there is no question, you can pull more and faster in any zone that yields worthwhile experience than you can at 62.<br />
<br />
However, I stopped at 51 to do run3, and I stopped again to do Cana5 on the way up, and I never regretted having done so.  It's what makes you happy and what fits your play style that should dictate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rugtuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I decided to stop leveling at 62 and get as many AA as I can.  The AA xp is alot better and I can get groups in HOH fairly easily so it would be silly for my to go up to 65 or even 70 before worrying about AA.  Alot of our AA's seem to have alot of value to us so I can stop and spend a few months doing nothing but AA and still improve greatly.  If I was able to get into PoE or PoF I would keep leveling, but I can't so this is the best stopping spot for me for now.  I do already group in WoS as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As you can see by my magelo, I have been staying 63 for a bit, I only need 3 more points till Canni 5, but I'm not sure what I will do next.  I would like to level, but to level would be to make all LDONs I want to do, hard only.  I still have high hopes for Regen 5 and FT2 augs.   I may stay 63 for a longer period of time and work on lightening reflexes, MGB, quick buff, cast reinf mastery, etc etc.   I like the idea of leveling, but I need the AAs, I use buffs everywhere I go, I'm constantly asked for buffs and I'm wanted for them.   Edit:  Suspend Minion is another I like the idea of.  I hate casting pets every time someone wants to go invse to get close to a different named in BoT, after the mage and I buffed pets, gave armor and pet weapons.<br />
<br />
I can't even get all my spells for lvl 64, I only have one via a SP in BoT.  I have my Haste tailsman spell via a SP but thats all.   Gosh no telling how long I will have to wait on these spells, so I'm not in a huge rush to lvl if I can't get my spells.  Everyone wants to roll on SPs and a few want to roll on EPs.<br />
<br />
I need a zone where SPs dont just drop every 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I believe that getting enough AA for canni 5 as soon as possibe(lvl 59) is still a good choice.  In fact i believe it is a no brainer.<br />
<br />
After canni 5, when 65 was the cap it seemed best to go 100% leveling xp to 65+ ~10% pad.  I have no idea what it would be like to be lvl 70 with virtually no AA but expect an AA less level 70 would be totally outclassed in level 70 content.<br />
<br />
I'm currently 1% from 68 and will switch to AA for a few days when I'm ~12% into 68.  Want to buy next levels of Ancestral Aid,  Healing Adept Mastry, and probablly Reflexive Mastry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you never do anything challenging, and AA's are you personal measure of success, sure, stay at lvl 62, as more things are even/red so you make more xp's. Its low risk, its low comittment, its low faith.<br />
<br />
However if you like to go places and kill things, risk finding groups with new people, believe that you owe it to your friends to be the most effective representative of the class you are playing, levels are &gt; all.<br />
<br />
The aa's &gt; levels concept is a myth. I did a LDON once with a 62 marshall with all his defensive aa's who proudly told the group he has chosen aa's over levels and never regretted it. Talk about painfull. It was clear to everyone but him that i was tanking the stuff better. And since he was completely unnable to hold agro I ended up tanking everything anyway.<br />
<br />
Whilst its nice to feel uber sometimes, if your a warr with 200 aa's and unnable to tank as well as a sham, there is something seriously wrong.<br />
<br />
Mind you he was only bazaar equiped, but its not like i am much further ahead, just one piece of EP chain.<br />
<br />
But to reitterate, levels &gt; aa's by any measure you wish to apply. The only toon that can maybe make a case is rangers with the insane dps boost they get from EQ and AM3 and elemental bows and arrows.<br />
<br />
Laters!</div></div><hr />

Levels give you the resist checks on your slow casts that you need to land slow in a timely manner on the new content. Especially Proving grounds +.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe I understand why you think you may be earning AA faster at level 62 than at level 62+. I also believe that you are mistaken. While it may be true that you can get slightly more AA exp per kill at level 62 (because you are closer in level to the mobs you are killing), I don't believe you fully understand how much more quickly you can kill based on power increases from level 62-65. The biggest gain you'll see is the removal of your group's cleric or druid. Consider how busy you are now trying to single target focus and replenishment on your group, malo and turgur (bounces fairly regularly still probably) for every mob, and all the while contributing minimal DPS. I could never main heal for a group in BoT at level 62. At level 65 I was fully capable of  functioning as both main healer AND main slower for that same group with get this... ZERO downtime. You'll be able to ditch the cleric or druid and replace them with another DPS class. Kill rates go up significantly. At 65 in BoT you'll still get 2-3pct a kill, your downtime will decrease and your kill rates will increase. Don't say you need a cleric or druid for the named, that is BS. I've main healed most of the named in BoT (outside of towers). Your ability to function as both main heal and slow will shed a whole new light on LDoN, PoV, BoT, OoW. Now mind you, you can't do this with a level 62 warrior tanking that group in BoT. It just won't work. LEVELS are the key. They improve your mitigation table, lower your resist rate, increase your hp/manna pool, allow you to scribe more powerful spells, raise your group desirability.<br />
<br />
Think about what the fastest you've ever earned an AA was. 2 hours? 1.5 hours? 1 hour? 30 minutes? What was the average level of that group. I've seen an AA tick by in 30 minutes working the top south camp in BoT. We cleared all the way down to the bottom of south before re-spawns. Everyone was level 65. I was main healing. Mobs unslowed. I couldn't have done that at level 62. Quiessence is a level 65 spell. Yes, the mage in my group was charming. But guess what, he couldn't do that at level 62. Call of the Arch Mage is a level 65 spell.<br />
<br />
There are possibly some good reasons to do AA before level for each class (though I'd argue not many as have others above), but saying you get AA faster at level 62 than you would at 65 is not one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well I'm not going to say &quot;do it this way&quot;, but I can assure other lower level shaman that I have NEVER regretted my own aa plan. <br />
<br />
I did one point in each level starting from (is it 55?) the level you can do aas. Got run speed 1 for emergencies, and some regen points.<br />
<br />
At sixty, i got a good buffer, then started in on canni 5: 12 points to get mental clarity 1, 2 and 3, and 5 (I think) to get Canni 5. I really really enjoy having that. I agree that it means i have missed out on other adventures.. but each level IS an adventure. <br />
<br />
At sixty one, got another buffer, and got VP (the knockback root), planar power (increase stats) one level and durability (hp increase). Now heading to level 62. Each level has been a blast, getting points (and groups) has not been a problem, mixing and matchin between Tier one zones, (soloing bots in PoI at 60 is ok xp) and now PoV... soloing yellow Razorfiends is fine aa xp. <br />
<br />
I understand that &quot;level is an advertisment&quot;.. but honestly, I have ended up having level 66 and higher folk ask to join me as I happily solo outer in PoV... and I'm the one who pulls, does CC and generally organises things. I'm only saying this to assure younger shaman that as a class, and provided you play well and thoughtfully, you will get groups and responsibilities. The clue is to take initiative.. make things happen!<br />
<br />
My gear is all shop bought, the shammy is my main, every plat earned honestly, and I enjoy the game very much indeed. Part of that is enjoying the challenges and rewards of each level, not just going for 65 (oops 70) and watching the scenery pass in a blur. Part of enjoying each level is judiciously getting those aa points to help support your claim to groups and your desire to solo and quest. <br />
<br />
The aa dont get advertised, but your competence and capacity does build rep.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>MLE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Personally, I stopped to get run 3/regen 3 as soon as I could.  I stopped again at 61 to get can5.  I never regretted having done so.  However, that doesn't change the fact that aa's come much more quickly at 65 than they do at 61 - it's a seperate discussion from if one should pause in level advancement to gain some aa's.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned above, the key to fast aa's is not how much of an aa  you get per kill, it's the sustained rate at which you can get experience over time.  If you get 6 percent per kill, but have 10 minutes of downtime afterwards, you aren't better of than if you get 3 percent per kill, with constant, steady pulling.  In fact, just the opposite.</div></div><hr />

Every calculation in the game involves the relation of your level to the level of the mob<br />
Whether you land a spell, whether you resist a MoBs spell, whether you hit with a melee strike and how much you hit for, whether you get hit with melee and for how much.<br />
<br />
No, it's not the only factor in those calculations but it is included.<br />
<br />
Show me an aa that does all that as well as opens new aa's for you and increases your HP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>goreldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">By all means I agree lvs &gt; then aa, but there is also one factor that is huge imo.  I stopped lving back when PoP first came out because I didn't have canni 5 yet.  Once I got canni 5 i went back to lving, and imo canni 5 &gt; then goin from lv 60 -70.   I dont care how much hp/m you get, canni 5 makes xp fly.  If you have that you can solo ungodly better why you wait for a group.  If I wouldn't have gotten canni 5 gore wouldnt be a shammy.  I found once I got canni 5 is when I actually had become a real shaman.  IMO it makes that much of a difference, the mana you can get/have is unreal with the extra ft3 prereq and then the 3 min use time on canni 5.  Once you get that I would say hit straight back to lvs.  Because like i said earlier the hp/m alone u get from lvs is fookin awesome and its free.  Plus with higher lv you can solo higher places for better cash drops, get better groups, and get into certain zones.  But thats enough of my 2 cents.<br />

Ok, that does it, I'm gonna get C5 before I get 65  :D  I may get 62 first so I can at least go to BoT, but then I'm going all AA.  I don't have Quiescense or Fo7 in the bank yet, and I'm still missing half of my 63/64 spells as well, so I might as well just work on making money and AA's until I can afford those spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I had run3 / regen3 by 55 or so. Stopped levelling again at 58 to get all the AAs I needed for Canni 5 Soon as I dinged 59, I spent what I had saved and ..blam .. unlimited mana (or so it felt)! Carried on up through the 60s, stopping to gain AAs whenever I felt a particular ability would make me a better shaman (VP, RC QB etc).<br />
<br />
Bought Mnemonic Retention as soon as I dinged 66, but now it's back to the levelling grind for me (unless I don't manage to pick up post-65 spells quickly, in which case I might go back to AAs ... just to see some measurable progress, if nothing else).</div></div><hr />

After. But I was responding to the original poster's statement of<br />
<br />
My point is, if you want to fly in your AAs, get at least halfway in your lvl 62, then change to 100% AAs, in BoT, or HoH. Watch your AAs fly.<br />
<br />
We could argue till we're blue in the face whether or not you should hold leveling to obtain CanniV. I say you shouldn't. Treebar would say you should. Whatever you decide will be right for you because it was your decision.<br />
<br />
I was only arguing that there is no way a 62 shaman can earn exp faster in BoT than a 65 in the same group. Add to that the fact that a 65 shaman's increased abilities open up new grouping options to earn faster exp and it becomes crystal clear (at least to me), that holding levels to earn AA exp &quot;faster&quot; is just a bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I don't know if it's fast or not. But after doing the weekend and half grind from 59 - 63 I was just flat out sick of watching the reg xp bar creep across the screen so I flipped it over to AA sometimes. I managed to gain 26 aa's in not that long of a time, and still get half way through 63. /shrug That was just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Personally, the only aa's I got before 65 were run2 and regen3.  I plan on getting enough aa's for canni5 and mgb and then leveling to 70.  I think that I may go partial aa's in that time, depending on the level.  But to me levels are far more important than aa's.  With levels come new spells, and new spells make you more useful to your group and or guild.  Canni5 and MGB (if you are guilded and raid) are very very important.  Oh and I just want to say that the price of spells is outrageous!!!!!</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure about the basis of your argument.<br />
<br />
Put a 65 warrior, cleric, 3 rogues with a 62 shaman<br />
Put a 65 warrior, cleric, 3 rogues with a 65 shaman<br />
<br />
Both in bot. After 10 hours the 62 shaman will have significantly more AA. I haven't been to bot in a while but if 65 sha got 8AA, the 62 one having 12 would not surprise me. And that is a big deal.<br />
<br />
In pofire I bot my friends 65 cleric and my 70 shaman. XP @70 is about 4% a kill and FAST kills. For cleric it is about 6%. At 1.5 min a kill that is 38min per AA for me, but 25 min an AA for her. 6 hours later we get:<br />
70shm: 9.5AA<br />
65clr: 14.5AA that's 5 aa =x<br />
<br />
If I grind 400AA she will have 600. She had no problems keeping FM cause our tank is amazing.</div></div><hr />

Now try and think back to when you were level 62. Consider trying to buff, slow and main heal for a group of 5 melee in BoT. Fast foward to level 65 and this becomes feasible. You just took a member of the group doing maybe 30dps with his hammer and traded him for someone doing 110dps. Now throw in the extra dps from SLtW(lvl 63) and FA(lvl 65) and you could easily boost each melee a 10pct increase in dps. How bout the following three groups:<br />
<br />
Put a 65 Paladin, 62 Mage, 65 Ranger, 2 65 Rogues with a 65 Shaman<br />

Lets give our level 62 Mage buddy say 200 aa's. He's probably pretty smokin dps. Good crits etc. He's topping maybe 180 sustained dps with his pet. Now lets give our level 65 Mage friend zero aa's, ZERO, and one spell: Call of the Arch Mage(lvl 65). I have seen parses of Mage charm pets in BoT putting out +350dps. Which mage will earn exp faster? The one in the first group above? Or the one in the second? Now lets consider the third group... again a tough group for a level 62 shaman to buff, slow and main heal. I don't think I could have done it at level 62. I have done it at level 65. Oh, and if you're lvl 62, god forbid there is a 65 shaman LFG at the same time as you are in BoT. You won't even get into the group.</div></div><hr />

Play your own game, based on your usual play style.  Most groups WOULD have trouble keeping mana, slowing down the kills.  If you are being pulled along by much higher (in exp and AAs) players, you have the luxury of stopping to gather AAs.<br />
<br />
Canni V is game changing, but so is Quiesence.  A relatively low-cost HoT without the slow you can use as part of your healing arsenal?  Wonderful.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am in the level uber all school, but I always put a small percent of exp into AAs despite the best advice of my peers.  Still am - with 10% toward AAs I am still getting AAs before level at 67.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">There are places that are very good AAXP for a level 65 as well.  Tables in Fire comes to mind if you're elemental-flagged, or WoS/NC in OoW.<br />
<br />
Soloing in PoFire I got one AA every 40-45 minutes, or around 2.2-2.5% per minute.  In a really good group I could cut that down to 30-35 minutes.  I don't think BOT at level 62 can beat that.<br />
<br />
For the record, soloing in PoV on the golems yields about 1% per minute pre-65, not sure what it gives me after 65.  It's a pretty good alternative if you can't find a group or if your favorite spots are taken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My group setups were to illistrate how the aaxp worked; not to say what gives the best xp etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Twilight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Well I'm a 64th lvl Shaman and have been doing AAs for a very long time, of course I usually only have a day or 2 in the week that I can play EQ.  The main reason I'm doing the AAs is because I've been unable to get ahold of any of my lvl 65 Spells, never had the cash, and not flagged for anywhere they drop.  Heck I've yet to get Pox, Malo, or Torpor.  As far as I can tell lvls aren't all that great unless you have a spell or 2 for it.  Just my opinion.  Otherwise if you have the spell then go for the lvls.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Wow I didnt realize I would touch on a subject that so many would entangle themselves on so easily.  I guess its a issue that all of us must face and learn what is best for us, when that time comes.  It did seem easier to get AAs when I was lvl 62 then when I was lvl 64.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Bullian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I just got canni 5 and i am about a half a yellow bubble to 65. The way i did aa vers. lvl is at first i would do aa's when in ldon or soloing. i started at lvl 55 but took aa's slow till i hit 60 then by then i was rdy for mc. at that time i came up with a plan to do 2 or 3 aa's per lvl again most of the time solo or ldon, now at 64 i have canni 5. i have only used it once (just got it last night hehe) but it is an awesome thing and i wish i got it earlier in my lvls. from looking at some magelos it seems i am uncommon in the fact that i have my wis maxed out at (for the next 4 lvl also) so i have the mana for a long haul of dotting but i still think canni 5 is a godsend and i do agree it should be gotten as soon your lvl meets the requirement.<br />
my 2 cps :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">If I was to pick a time to go full AA pre 65, it would be level 61 in PoV. You will still be getting 2 or 3 % AA per kill, &amp; 61 is a really fast level to get after the hell of 59-60. AA XP dropped of sharply there at 62. Would be far easier for a non 65 to get a group there than BOT.<br />
<br />
Truespirit will make a huge difference if you have to solo. <br />
<br />
The one expensive spell to get would be malo, It will massively decrease slow resists, &amp; it will be somewhat useful for the rest of your career, as the recast times on malo/malos are huge, so you can mem both at once if you need to get mobs debuffed fast.<br />
<br />
Save your money &amp; use kraggs/stoicisim rather than torpor unless you get a really good deal on it. Q at 65 is a huge upgrade to it.<br />
<br />
Level 65 makes a HUGE difference in our power as others have said. You've gotta get there anyway, &amp; 65 would be much faster to get than the AA's for Canni - even if you can get groups in BoT, which is pretty unlikely if there is a lvl 65 looking &amp; you're 62.<br />
<br />
The only AA I'd stop for, knowing what I do now, is run3 - which would be a lifesaver for ldons,  &amp; Even that is pretty situational now with spirit of shrew.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I was only arguing that there is no way a 62 shaman can earn exp faster in BoT than a 65 in the same group. <br />
If the group doesn't change except the shaman's level...the 62 shaman WILL get AA faster.<br />
<br />
Remember exp recieved is based on player level in relation to MOb level<br />
at 62 the exp will be in the shaman's favor<br />
<br />
And if, like you state, only the shaman changes level...the killing will probably go about the same pace in the group whether the shaman is 65 or 62.  <br />
<br />
Yes, the 65 Shaman will perform better, but the DPS of a shaman is low enough that even at 65 you're not going to make up the 3 level difference in exp per kill in speed per kill gained by 3 shaman levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Kror, at 62 you don't have Bane, Tears of Saryrn, FA, or Q.  The 65 shaman does. Those spells right there Are your DPS in a group. Obviously assuming you acquire them in the first place :)<br />
<br />
Which brings me to this point; I level/aa based on necessity. I'm level 69 so I can play in RS. If it weren't for this ONE zone, i'd probably still be 68. I have all my 66-68 OOW spells fortunately but Zero 69/70's. Well, let me make an addendum to that, my guild won't let anyone go in a greater/glowing if they can't use it Right Now. I have not been tapped as the main shaman, so I'm low on the totem pole for getting any greaters, but I'm eligible once the go-to shaman has all of hers.<br />
<br />
Till then i'm 90/10 aa exps &amp; really looking forward to some of the new AA's in addition to some of the &quot;old&quot; ones I still don't have yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Prexus_Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I'm working my butt off right now at 64 to get Canni 5. I had a group in WOS at firewall camp and in ... Musta been 3 hours or so played I got 4 and a half AA there. Group makeup was Me, a 67 ench, a 68 cleric, 70 paladin, 68 beastlord, and 67 necro. Near zero downtime, mobs were coming in almost non-stop, but for added dps I was botting a mage outside the group.  T-Rods and pet dps = the win! Most of the mobs I was slowing were white and yellow, with the occasional signet dropping named who was red to me. If I can get a similar grouping tomorrow or even later tonight after work I should get halfway thru my required MC levels and be that much nearer to Canni 5.  Mmmm....   As far as Levels &gt; AA /shrug  to each his own. I have played a shaman for a friend who needed a flag once, and she had canni 5 and it was sooooo nice, It's why I am on this C5 kick.  I do notice the AA is slightly less than what I was receiving at 63, but not enough to make a huge difference. Nw if only I could get my 64 specs for the group buffs.... I hate single target buffs with a passion now.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, 2cp from a Prexus Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">You're *64* and you're not pushing to 65? level 65 is Quiescence, FA, Malos, Blood of Saryrn.  Level 65 is Muramite Proving Grounds!  Level 65 is flaggable into PoTime.  Level 65 is +2 standing mana regen/tick, just for dinging.  Level 65 is one more level closer to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">just because you get more % AA per kill does NOT mean you are getting AA faster.<br />
<br />
I may get 2-3% less AA per kill on XXmob, but I can kill XXmob x4 by the time you kill it x1 or x2, and keep going with little or no pause.<br />
<br />
that kind of EXP adds up.<br />
<br />
and this is simply a level thing, once you get to higher levels, you can kill in higher level zones, higher level zones give better EXP and better gear. and the cycle of improvement moves from there. simple as that.<br />
<br />
play at your own pace, just go at what you enjoy. if you want to play in higher level zones, then you have to be a higher level...just the way the ball bounces....if you can survive lvl 60 at WoS or RCoD, by all means, do it. but a lvl 65 or lvl 70 will be able to survive longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">You're *64* and you're not pushing to 65? level 65 is Quiescence, FA, Malos, Blood of Saryrn.

<br />
All of this are true, but lets remember, my statement was made before DoN, and my knowledge of WoS..... Now having fought in WoS I am shocked at the Exp per kill and I now could feel safe to say, it is better to wait till you hit these other zones to do AAs.  Leveling is better  and I am achieving this.   I am now 4 blues till 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Airwhale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Level 65 is +2 standing mana regen/tick, just for dinging.  .<br />
Really? I never knew that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Yeah, innate mana regen (no tricks, aa's, etc etc, anything) goes from 1/tick to 3/tick at level 65.  It's not much overall, but definately a nice bennie for classes that don't actually Meditate much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>forsurenot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I remember first time grouped in MPG at lvl 65, each mob was giving 6-8% AA's in a full group.  But I was so very scared, because they were all very very red =(<br />
AA is very important though, I remember getting canni5 at lvl 61 in PoV and got MGB at lvl 65.  Never regret those.  Though don't ever stop lvling, maybe do a split or see a target AA, buy it then move on.  Because there are lots of benefit of being able to zone to higher zones to group.  Much nicer drops, soul imbue ring in taskfiend/blind hunter camp in MPG, i am sure lots of 70 shaman still using it.  And the shoulder from Odi. both item with 120ish hps/mana and drops all the time.  You'll be able to get your spell drops too, and not to worry about buying expensive spells from bazaar.  65-68 in MPG (WoS and RCoD is not bad too), then 69 you can move on to RS, where eventually you can get your new magic dot, group focus, awesome rare trash drops (160hps/mana +2regen +2ft face, and earring with nice focus 4 regen, 4 damage sheild) and tons of 65/70 hps/mana augs.  It's a totally differenet world, which you don't need any flags, but only levels and dependable group. Also can grind an AA in 30-40min.</div></div><hr />
