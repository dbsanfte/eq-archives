<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Woot - had actually totally given up on ever getting pox and had moved attention to BoU, then we ganked Sonti for a quick ST key the other night and he dropped Pox for me :D Ta v much for a finally complete Kunark section to my spell book!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice one mate. I've still got miles to go, but I got torpor and pox at least :) Just need malo to make me happy, I can live without PE, Avatar and the ancient spells, although I would get em if I saw em.<br />
<br />
Seen Pox on sale in the bazaar a bit recently too - though I guess that won't bother you anymore :D Last malo went for 40k, but I didn't have the cash - just paid 32k for torpor, which I felt was a pretty good deal. Lurvely spell with canni V and all.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, saw that, but was no way gonna pay 40 something k for it.  It is nice, but not that nice.  Only real use is gonna be duoing with my warrior mate in PoS to get those mobs dead a bit quicker.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt worry about Avatar tbh, I very rarely use it.  Looking forward to getting primal avatar, but not too concerned really.<br />
<br />
Grats on Torpor tho - still, imo, the best spell we get (other than Quiesence)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kagrobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Still looking for PoX .. Malo .. Avatar ... got Topor and Primal Esseence ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have pox and almost never cast it I think i should have just sold it. It does alot of damage but takes way to long to get full effect and all of our dots get resisted to much. be safe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Marxxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been soloing for VT shards as of late and I find the disease dots, although slower, do not pull aggro off of the 61 pet as easily. As for landing them and having them stick, I land a Malicious Decay on the mob first. The dots almost always lands.<br />

BoU<br />
Pox<br />

Whole time the pet is kicking ass. Works nice.</div></div><hr />
