<br />
 No offense Blazz, but I think you make the point adequately yourself. It IS our best dot. And yet it is not sufficient vs. GoD content. When it is resisted, it is 0 dps. When it is not resisted because you take the time to malos first(and assuming a slow from either Balance or TA)and then cast it, the mob is dead or near dead and the dot does not last to duration. On paper, it is a nice dot. But it isn't a high dps dot-it is a high potential dps dot. <br />
 In practice, I find it has room for improvement without being unbalancing. Simply taking away or even reducing somewhat the ridiculously long recast time OR giving it a modest resist mod would most likely make it a more scribe-worthy(ok, I just made that word up=/)spell in our line up.<br />
 I would be interested to know how Bane would perform on Test if the recast time was reduced. I doubt it would unhinge the universe of EQ if it were slightly modified to be more in tune with today's faster gaming environment but that is just my personal view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We're still getting screwed on the lack of a resist mod, druids -30 resists to the dots are great and they can still debuff fire better then we can debuff magic.</div></div><hr />

Bane is resisted all the time in GoD.  I was getting about 50% resists in a KT xp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">each type of mob in GoD has inate resistance to some kind of damage. You can cast mindlessly any spell on any mob.<br />
<br />
If you get 50% resists with bane, that means that you are casting it on the wrong mobs.<br />
<br />
Only fire based spells are not resisted by any king of mobs in GoD.</div></div><hr />

Not only does it do more damage, but it costs LESS mana.  And balance around canni is no excuse, as both Shaman and Necromancers have good self-mana regeneration abilities.  And that's not even counting their ability to FD off the broken DoT aggro.<br />
<br />
Necromancers are the Omens Kings of DoT's, and have a much higher gap from the second placers than we do from enchanters with mitigated slow.  Oh well, at least we get an ancient canni that, as opposed to being an incredible upgrade, is merely a solution that allows you to click less and is something that should have been implemented as a non-ancient since PoP.<br />
<br />
But hey, at least I'm not bitter about it!  And there is always the argument that most DoT's are useless in groups, and to this I agree, on every DoT other than Bane, that is.  I do actually get a lot of mileage out of Bane in MOST areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, lets see, our fastest, biggest damage, lowest aggro DOT that resist checks vs something I debuff every mob anyway, yeah, spells sucks. <br />
<br />

I admit that Bane and its sister curse lines for shaman are nice DPS, however after having it resisted 8 out of 9 times on a normal LDON today, I gotta say that its not all that phat. The necro grouped with me was using his curse line, Horror. For those that arent aware, here is its Lucy data:<br />
Horror   <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Curse Counter by 24 <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 430 per tick <br />
Mana: 470 Skill: Conjuration <br />
Casting Time: 5.5 Recast Time: 24 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.5 Resist: Magic <br />
Resist Adjust -30 Range: 200 <br />
-30 resist check, less mana and more damage. Now I know that a necro is a DPS class and a shaman is a, well lets say we havent a clue really, but, why do I have to burn an extra 400ish mana to ensure that it lands? Why should I wait for a chanter to tash so I can land it?<br />
Sure Bane and its line are great, but its still not enough. Often my group of low DPS class friends can often have Bane go its full duration in a given LDON, but if I group with a high DPS group or we have a few strangers, Bane rarely goes 3 ticks, making it of limited use.<br />
All I am asking for is tools to do something besides be a Malos whore in GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keeping a long refresh on a decent DPS spell that belongs to a community currently screaming about not being able to do enough damage is idiotic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When it is not resisted because you take the time to malos first(and assuming a slow from either Balance or TA)and then cast it, the mob is dead or near dead and the dot does not last to duration.

But you see, THAT is the point. You have done 2 other things to help the group kill this mob. Slowed it and debuffed its resists. Now, cast Bane. I am finding that in straight-up non-Charm XP groups Bane is lasting a good 4 tics AFTER Malos and Slow. Of course, I rarely have have Warrior Cleric Wizard Wizard Wizard Wizard group, usually my groups are more &quot;normal&quot;. <br />
<br />
Standard fight while named farming in Vxed, for example. No chanter, just a normal Tank, Healer, Puller, DPS, DPS, Slower group. Someone pulls, I malos as its coming down the hill, slow when the tank hits it, Bane, Q the tank, cast Spear or Tears. Repeat. I get almost ZERO resists in Gates, personallly, and I even use the spell constantly on Raids. I can usually keep Bane up full time vs EP and Time targets, and since it has MUCH less aggro than Poison, its fairly safe. <br />
<br />
I dunno, maybe I am just trying to justify my existance, but personally, I am TRYING to find ways to be better. Casting Bane on the pull, then Quies on the tank is about an 800 damage per tic result. If it gets resisted, cast it NEXT mob instead. Cripes, if BoS gets resisted, and you re-cast it right away, then yes, the mob is dead by tic 2. So what difference does the re-cast REALLY make?</div></div><hr />

The refresh itself isnt the problem honestly.  Whats the problem on bane is that Sony can't code common sense.  If they want Bane to pop, as Bane Wears Off.  Okay.  Fine.   <br />
<br />
But when resisted it should pop normally.   if they fixed bane to pop immediately on a resist it would be HUGE difference.</div></div><hr />

How long are your fights? How many tics are you getting on Blood after a resist and recast? After malos, slow, blood (resisted) and re-blood, your LUCKY to get 2 or 3 tics, even on some EP XP mobs. Your not even gonna get that on Gates stuff. The recast is almost irrelevant, since its back up by the next mob you have Malosed and slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Blood was more of an example.<br />
<br />
Yeah, fights are short in GoD blah, blah, blah, but there is just no logic in keeping the lengthy refresh on Bane-line spells.  Frankly, I don't usually even have time to rip a nuke off (SoT) in most exp groups before the mob bites it, let alone try to get significant damage off a DoT.  <br />
<br />
I probably use Bane most while soloing and on some raid material.  It would be nice to pick right up again off a resist and recast instead of waiting for Bane to cycle.  Heck, some &quot;raid&quot; mobs in GoD blow chunks so fast I can't get a recast in because of the refresh. =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense meant but come on. When you get that much resists, why not change your tactic after say resist number 3 or 4?? But i am guessing, you were a bit exaggerating here  ;) .<br />
<br />
Not saying we don't have issues in the dps department, we have. But that sounded strange.<br />
<br />
But you see, THAT is the point. You have done 2 other things to help the group kill this mob. Slowed it and debuffed its resists. ..<br />
<br />
Most casters have either two different resist types of dps spells and can adapt to the situation or are using lure type spells with a relatively small (imo) decrease in efficiency. So sure you helped your group some, but it's limited.<br />
<br />
Keeping a long refresh on a decent DPS spell that belongs to a community currently screaming about not being able to do enough damage is idiotic.<br />
<br />
Fully agree. But maybe we can just present more data to change the spell guy's opinion. That worked so well last time  :rolleyes: .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well as far as resists in KT, I exp there all the time and generally I lead with malos on incoming so Bane is almost never resisted. If you don't use malos then I imagine resist rates could be higher. I am not saying Bane couldn't be improved, I am saying it is not useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If it sticks in KT like you guys are saying I will be happy.  But right now in PoP elementals it is practically useless.  With the high dps that my guild groups put out I am lucky to get 3 ticks off of Bane and that is if it isn't resisted and I havent wasted the mana to cast it.<br />
<br />
I have been sticking with rains and our crappy nukes for this content and it is starting to really bug me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well if you look at it Necros are getting a HUGE boost in ther % for DoTs while we get a MUCH smaller one without a resist check.<br />
<br />
However the DoTs in OoW are only part of the problem.<br />
<br />
Ok first lets look at some history.<br />
We had Can.<br />
Necros had Lich.<br />
No ft existed.<br />
<br />
Ok they add ft<br />
We get Can5<br />
Necros get a bigger lich.<br />
<br />
Ok still pretty balanced at this point.<br />
Keep in mind our higher mana costs and spell cast times on our spells resulting from our higher regen too.<br />
<br />
Now Necros get a better Lich every expansion.<br />
Their regen goes up ours stays the same.<br />
Our cast times nor mana costs get any better.<br />
<br />
Now look at OoW.<br />
Our new Can isnt any more efficent just more convient.<br />
Necros get a better Lich get even better mana regen.<br />
ft caps get raised all other classes including ours goes up.<br />
But the ratio changes.....<br />
For every ft increase and lich increases the other classes get our regen becomes less of an edge yet our mana costs and cast times remain the same.....<br />
<br />
Every expansion we get a little more left behind the other classes in upgrades. OoW will be no exception.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Really, if they changed all dots to resist on a per tick basis, our need for a neg. resist modifier wouldn't be as great.<br />
<br />
Still, would really like to see:<br />
<br />
-critical affliction mirror fury of magic.<br />
-better itemization for dot focus effects.<br />
-agro for dots mirror agro for nukes dealing similar damage.<br />
<br />
It just doesn't make sense why these changes aren't being implemented on a bare minimum level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am most certainly not exaggerating. The first 8 out of 9 mobs resisted Bane flat out. Usually when I have a bad run like that I swap to a nuke or just forget about it at all, but after the 4th I was more than a bit curious as to how long my streak would go on. 9th mob it landed. Mind you this was the same day that I had one mob bounce 4 slows on a 6 pull (no CC) and VP got resisted as well as Petrifying Earth...just lucky I keep Togors up when my RL paladin friend is pulling or it have been a problem. Nihil reeeaallly needs to drop for me.</div></div><hr />

As a shaman that would have to be one of the worst groups hehe.<br />
<br />
On a more serious note I doubt much would change if all recast delays on our DoTs were removed. It seems really dumb to both have spells that last for a while and cant be stacked by one person also have a recast. Its like triple punishment.</div></div><hr />

The most solid arguement here. With the addition of Nihil, Malos has become a &quot;luxury&quot; that some shaman do not wish to bother with so they can contribute more DPS, heals or CC to the group. This makes Bane less useful, to be sure. <br />
<br />
I dont have Nihil yet, so I use bane on a regular basis in almost all situations. <br />
<br />
Oh and Helfdane, I have had LDoN runs like that. Its even worse when Turgurs is resisted 7 out of 8 times wihtout Malos. USUALLY I can get away with not having Malos memmed for LDoN Normal, which allows me a slot for more &quot;Parked CC DPS&quot; via another DOT, but sometimes, you get runs where EVERYTHING resists EVERYTHING. I haev even seen Wizards and Necros complaining, and they are casting spells with -resist checks. Must be some sort of random generator, honestly, because I have also had the reverse, where NOTHING resists ANYTHING the entire run.<br />
<br />
/shrug, I adjust. Thats what we do. We adjust to whatever the situation is. Fortunately, we are a class that has the ability to make that adjustment fairly effectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I exp in fire, still missing 2 sewer trials for KT access, but I get more resists on root then I do on bane. I agree, I would like the refresh time to be better, but it is a useful spell when I want to drop something faster. Now, mind you I havent been fire flagged long, but the spell has some major uses. It beats disease based DoTs, and BoS currently is still a nice DoT.<br />
<br />
Thats my take at least. On the bright side, we can always talk with Rytan and others and see if we can get this chain of DoTs modified to better suite our needs. Necros have it good DoT wise, but I also hear them complain about AAs. I personally, am happy with what I get this expansion, and will enjoy playing it.</div></div><hr />

I have the same problems...I am on win number 370 or something and I have seen a lot of weird crap....on a normal LDON run, I simply dont bother to mem Malos /shrug call me a bad shaman if you want, but its not something that is needed...do a hard and I malos everything that moves, even if it does con blue.<br />
I agree with previous posters, Grizlor especially, Malos is a benefit to all people in our group, raid, what have you. It just makes it even EASIER for wizards, necros, mages, what have you, to land their nuke/dot/debuff that has a negative resist check, while were stuck tossing out extra mana and maybe not even getting anything out of it ourselves. Most normal runs that I do are slowish, my regular group is 2 paladins, a cleric, botted chanter and a ranger. Were not heavy on DPS but are RL friends. Malos doesnt benefit anything that they do on a normal run (well other than the odd resistant to mezz mob or the charmed pet) and it really doesnt benefit me either.<br />
 I just dont understand why we should be left out of the loop here and not be given at least a -20 check on Bane. Leave the recast time, leave the cost, just let things make some sense for once.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The problem is you guys are lying / exagurating to prove your point. In god, bane does not resist. I am usually in this group setup:<br />
<br />
Warrior (best dps weapons) cleric shaman monk (sot) wizzy (white fire) wizzy (sos)... that's high dps and I basically malos on inc, slow before mob even hits the tank (uses incite to take aggro), I bane asap, and get 3-4 tics off. In the mean time I can nuke and do other usesless things. No problem with bane or resists...<br />
<br />
The problem is, it's not enough.. because hey, my guild has 5 shamans in it, another one apping. I want to know what he's like, either I can play a different toon, or I have to sit in that group, 2 shaman, and do absolutely nothing... our dots don't matter, 4 tics of of bane and 4 off of bos for 1k mana exerted, uba aggro, and crappy dps. I feel like a gimp nuking for 650, sometimes (ok often) I hit for 1350! wow, that's 150 more damage than a CLERIC's nuke. <br />
<br />
It's redicilous to be at a raid, I like to lay a dot, patch heal/cure, avatar. 1 avatar and 1 resisted bane means now I have 6 slots, nihil/malos, 2 down to 4 usable, Quiessence up, usually bounces, 5 slots, canni, 4 slots 2 slots, leaving me with: spear of torment and my heal. So basically in a lot of encounters I turn into a really really crappy druid. <br />
<br />
That's not acceptable, I don't want to be a crappy level 55 druid on raids or group! Resisted bane makes me gimp, unresisted bane and I'm still kinda gimp. Lots of things could use fixing.<br />
<br />
Also EVERY mob should be slowable, gd it increase the mobs dps by 4x and let it not mitigate AT ALL. Riposete disc is enough for a shaman to slow it, but at least he'll be needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">In GoD, mobs generally have around 32k HP.  (Basing this on Tipt mobs, can't tell you if anything beyond Tipt breaks that mold since I've not been there.)<br />
<br />
Now, if we Malos/Slow . . . let's say that takes 7 seconds.  Might be more, might be less depending on about 1000 different factors.  But, 7 seconds.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the mob now has 30 seconds to live.<br />
<br />
Cast Bane.  Runs for maybe 4 ticks given cast time and mob life.  BA4 + 1 crit tick . . . maybe . . . 2500 HP in damage?  Dogdog . . . 800?<br />

So total, we've done 3300 points of damage . . . just over 10% of the mobs life.  Not bad, considering that we mitigated a lot of incoming damage with Slow as well.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that in a perfectly balanced world each group member would do 15% of the damage to a mob.  We're pretty close to that, and we are not a DPS class.<br />
<br />
The problem is that Bane isn't as consistent, even with Malos, as it should be.<br />
<br />
If we were consistently able to do 10% of a mobs life in a short fight, as well as Slow . . . that might be ok.</div></div><hr />

In the same time I could cast about 4 or 5 spears which ends up doing more damage anyway. Guess I have bad luck.</div></div><hr />
