<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately my guild's been farming Ssra and BoT. The snakes don't really interest me much and I'm not flagged yet for the tier 3 zone. So, I need a spot to solo. I've got True Spirit and Bane of Nife, but no other good solo tools (missing Torpor, Malo, Pox, Anathema...).<br />
<br />
I was thinking possibly Inner Acrylia? I saw a post on here about that zone, thought I might give it a try.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be nice.<br />
<br />
NB: I play on a PvP server, and PoN/PoV are always extra heavy on the PvP so I'd like to avoid those if possible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Evicar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Inner wouldn't be a good idea to start at level 61.  I am also a level 61 Shaman and I just hang around the ritualist and primalist camp. ( The first couple rooms near enterence.)  That would be best until you get more spells and levels.  AA exp is not great but got two aa in a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suggest either:<br />
<br />
a) farm plat via the suggestions of many other posts in this forum.  By doing this you will have the money for Quissence.  Skip torpor, head straight to b)<br />
<br />
b) group until you are 65.  By then it won't be expected of you to have Q.  Get as many flags as you can and as many shots at runes as you can.  Don't bother with any tier1 xp spots, they are worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
<br />
Without Torpor or Malo you are very handicapped in what you can accomplish solo.  I recommend grouping to 65 w/ friends, especially due to the nature of your server - you are very vulnerable.  PoN inside the Hedge (starting the Hedge event to get inside but never trying to finish it) should be safe from attacks if you can make it there safely for duo/trio'ing.  Soloing there w/o Torpor would be possible I guess, but very dangerous.<br />
<br />
Get your Emp key if you don't have it yet, and finish off those shards for VT if your guild is progressing towards there.  The exp at the camps isn't that horrible at 61, but is really lame at 65 in those zones.  If your guild is heading to VT, you shouldn't find it to hard to form a 3-6 man group to knock those out.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd at least group to 62 and the direct heal upgrade before I try any heavy duty soloing. trying to solo mobs that damage ya faster than you can heal is just gonna add up to lots of corpse runs. If your gonna be awhile getting to 65 get torpor, if not get to 65 asap and get Q. If your looking for spots to solo for cash you can handle OS, HS, nurga, maybe some droga mobs etc. Root rotting mobs in pon is doable but its gonna be slow because you don't have alot of the right spells atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As others have said, IA is a good spot at your level.  Made quite a bit of cash there.<br />
<br />
An alternate camp, that is easy and safe, is the Top Shelf in Velks.  It isn't sexy, but at 61 most spiders are still DB; all are single pulls; they give average AAxp; velium still sells decent; and camp spot is safe to go AFK (although someone will usually take the camp if you do).  <br />
<br />
At 61, with basically the same spell set as you, I could take 4 named/ph spawns (Crystal Eyes, Crystal Fang, Frenzied Broodling, &amp; Frenzied Stalker) plus the other spiders between these spawn points and camp.  Most named mobs drop items worth 500-2k in the bazaar, but the Frenzy drops SCHW (3k on MT) and SCWB (7k on MT).<br />
<br />
In a four hour hunt, I could get 4-5 named to pop and get 3k-4k in velium and silks.  If I was lucky with drops, that might be 10k total plus an AA to boot.  <br />
<br />
Couldn't handle more than 2 of sessions in a row, however, as it is mind-numbingly boring, but a decent change of pace from IA, Droga, etc.<br />

<br />
Just thought that I would mention that smoking them would kill most of the psilocin and psylocybin. Just an FYI =D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok, i now have torpor! got it for free from an extremely nice and generous guildy. still searching for a malo that'll cost me short of a king's ransom, but that's not gonna happen anytime soon.<br />
<br />
of all zones mentioned above (HS, OS, Droga, Nurga, Acrylia, Inner Acrylia, Velks, PoN) what would be the best balance of exp and cash? im pretty much in need of both atm. again, any help is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail,<br />

Now that you have Torpor, you can effectively solo in all of the above areas.  I would say the PoN hedge would be the best exp if you can handle the mobs, and Droga or Inner Acrylia would be the best for cash drops if you don't have competition w/ other farmers.  One of the rooms in Innovation (down the left path, first room on your right past the factory door) would also be soloable if you could get there safely.  Good exp, fairly safe from trains once you make it there, and if things go bad GY rezzes are easy to get.  Tinkering tradeskill drops can be sold in the bazaar, but you won't get rich.<br />
<br />
OS gem drops have been nerfed, though you can still do alright on item drops if you know the area well and the zone isn't busy.  But CR's are a major pita if something goes wrong, and asking a cleric to go all the way out there AND have to then get to the body is a pretty big favor.<br />
<br />
HS can have similar difficulties for CR's, but I think the exp is better.<br />
<br />
Velks is still the bastion of rude people &amp; farmers last time I was there.  I avoid that zone &amp; at 62 the exp isn't that great anyways. <br />
<br />
Temple of Droga and Inner Acrylia would have okay exp for you and offer the best chance of cash rewards in my opinion.  I feel Droga is easier (and less boring) than IA, though IA probably has the edge in terms of cash value (Droga gets farmed more imo - so items are devalued more) per solo session.  Droga is easier to get to if things go badly, and easier to CR as well in my experience (nothing sees invis).<br />
<br />
Best of luck to you!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">An easy area on my blue server is nadox.  Plenty of camp spots and chance of named mobs popping all the time.  It's nothing fancy here, but you can load your bags, get some decent items (I use them for tribute now and that stuff adds up) and get decent xp.  You can solo the zone-in of Hates fury also, but spliting the room is a PITA.  Nadox/Tor mines(back area) are so vacant most of the time that it would be safe (I guess) for you also.</div></div><hr />
