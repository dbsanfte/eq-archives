My suggestion would be Kurn's Tower (Cabalis stone into the Field of Bone, then a short run) followed by the Estate of Unrest (Kaladim stone in to Butcherblock, run to Dagnor's Cauldron, then follow the beach/cliff to the tunnel on the right).  Both have good experience modifiers and lots of undead Mobs.  You'll collect enough bone chips to last a long time.  These two zones beat the heck out of the typical PC/HHK route as far as I'm concerned.  There are enough people to group with if you so desire, but neither is a zoo, at least not on my server.<br />
<br />
In Unrest you start out with the yard trash just inside the zone, move into either the front hall or back door.  Then work upstairs for a couple levels and finally move into the basement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">is it still true that if ur a necro or sk that u get an extra exp modifier??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">necros have never had an experience penalty (unless they're iksars, in which case they have the 20% racial exp penalty for their innate ac bonus, swimming ability, and the outdated regen bonus).<br />
<br />
shadowknights had, a long long time ago, an exp penalty for being a hybrid class.  those days are long gone now, and like necromancers they have no experience penalty (unless they're iksars, trolls or ogres).<br />
<br />
cool leveling spots past 15...<br />
<br />
well, uh, paludal caverns bandits will take you to 25.<br />
i think it was unrest, erm, the undead zone off of dagnor's cauldron at any rate, was a fun and quiet zone until 32-33 ish.<br />
befallen might be a fun alternative to paludal caverns.<br />
highkeep would be a snarky place to farm some exp/plat killing guards or goblins as your tastes run. guards are solid until at least 35, probably higher on the upper floors.<br />
hill giants in rathe mountains are an old favorite, they're nice for loot and it's fun racing people for them and just generally fun to kick the **** out of giants. the exp's not great but the plat's hoopy for the level.<br />
crystal caverns is a cool dungeon zone for the low to mid 30's ish.<br />
<br />
i dunno, try a lot of different zones from different expansions, do the dumb &quot;hot spots&quot; the management reccommends, mix it up and have fun or something.</div></div><hr />
