<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
Is it just me or does everyone think that PoP Spectral and Rune drops are rediculous?<br />
<br />
I mean you require a guild of reasonable strength to take down AD, TT, Grummus and MB and what do they drop? Friggin upto four Ethereals and the occasional single Spectral and NO Runes! I mean you got to wonder *** VI was thinking doing the loot tables for Boss Mobs.<br />
<br />
Then you can go to zones like PoTactics and BoT where single groups (or soloing chanters) can drop mini-boss type mobs that drop Spectrals and Runes. Or you can just EXP in tier 3 zones and above and junk mobs drop Spectrals!<br />
<br />
How can it be that boss mobs requiring an entire guild to kill don't drop Spectrals and Runes yet mini-bosses do? IMHO boss mobs that require a guild to take down should be dropping 4 Spectrals and the occasional Rune. Not friggin 4 Ethereals and the occasional Spectral!<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

Why don't you like runes and specs dropping of one-groupable mobs? <br />
They do .  Tier 1 mobs and 1 groupable mobs , are 2  different things. Every single rune i got was gotten in single group encounters adn ive seen so many pass by me it makes me sick ( cause i lost rolls). I agree though , they should drop a lil more often in the places they shoul dbe droping ,b ut runes droping in PoI or PoN , thats just not right.<br />
<br />
IMHO anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really have no problem with tier 1 &amp; 2 bosses not dropping runes/specs as long as there is some consistant way to optain them in tier 3 with one-groupable stuff.  Once you are able to kill these bosses you will have access to runes and specs so I dont see wha the problem is.  <br />
I have just gotten flagged for a some tier 3 zones so I can't comment on the drop rate firsthand but it does seem quite a few people are filling up their spell books.  <br />
Tier 3 bosses, like agnarr, saryn, mith-marr, on the other hand should be dropping multiple runes/specs as well as decent loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can exp at Plane of Nightmare hobgoblins and waiting for a Spectre parchment drop,too. <br />
<br />
BoT yard trash drop SP, but its nerfed drop rate,too.  Its about the same drop rate as forest loop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bastion of nerfed drops is my favorite &quot;rune&quot; dropping zone ever.  I've killed 5 67's now, loot? 1 spectral AND A KEY CONTAINER.  Just about everyone in our guild has a damn key container now.....  <br />
<br />
I've killed 4 65's and we always get a spectral, and I think we got 1 other drop... forget though.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess all I'm saying is Tier 3 zone's aren't all lovey-dovey-rune-dropping like you imply =/<br />
<br />
Sure I guess we're getting spectrals, but the 67's are 4 group ventures usually, and 1 spectral for all the work required is rediculous...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Try some tower mob raids.  They can be fun and the drop rate of the good stuff is higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">67's are tower mob's, I've killed everything but agnaar.  I'm guessing the key container to get to agnarr are the 67's rare drops and we've gotten &quot;Lucky&quot;.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone know how many key's you need to get to agnarr?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just 1 key. It opens the portal and everyone can go through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">misunderstood his question..yea u only need 1 key and everyone has (2mins ) i think to get in</div></div><hr />
