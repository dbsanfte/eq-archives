<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llegolas</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, we've had a favorite everything-else thread already, it's time for a greatest movies thread.  Here are the one's that top my list.<br />
<br />
American Beauty<br />
Absolute masterpeice.  I know a lot of people out there are going to strongly disagree with some of the sexual taboos in this movie, but if you can look past that, it's got a lot of very cool philosophies on life hidden inside.  The motto of the movie (which you can see on Lester Burnum's desk in his workplace) is &quot;Look Closer.&quot;  You can probably watch this movie then times before you begin to put the whole thing together.  Absolutely amazing in every way.  Soundtrack also rocks.<br />
<br />
Forrest Gump<br />
This one probably tops my list of favorite movies.  If you've never seen this movie, make it a priority to do so.  Forrest rules!<br />
<br />
Gladiator<br />
We all know why this movie rocks.  I'm sure everyone here has seen it already;-)  It's one of my few DVDs, but I'm very proud to own it.<br />
<br />
Pulp Fiction<br />
So... weird.  But I love it.  Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta rock as hitmen.  This movie is 2/3 weird dialogue and 1/3 swearing.<br />
<br />
Magnolia<br />
This movie was sooooo long.  But if you can spare a few hours to watch the whole thing, it's really good.  The whole thing is about random happenings that occur every day that turn out to be completely insane coincidences.  So many characters to fall in love with in this movie.  And when the frogs fall from the sky... so weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amdee</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool Hand Luke<br />
What we have here is a failure to communicate...<br />
<br />
The Road Warrior<br />
If it's all the same to you, I'll drive that tanker.<br />
<br />
These are my two favorites. I also thought Bladerunner was very well done.<br />
<br />
Soft spot for: Aliens <br />
Can't resist: Rock-n-Roll High Scool (just because the Ramones are in it)<br />
<br />
And for great quoteage: Evil Dead and Army of Darkness (Bruce is the man, lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ven Dragnborn</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Creator<br />
Peter O'Toole, Vincent Spano, Virginia Madsen, <br />
Great movie in which O'Tool is trying to clone his dead wife and works in a college. Good comedy,love story,drama.<br />
Favorite quote is:<br />
One of these days we will look in our microscopes and find ourselves staring right into God's eyes, and the first one who blinks is going to loose his testicles.<br />
<br />
John Boormans Excalibur<br />
Camelot<br />
<br />
<br />
a few others that don't happen to be on the top of my head at the moment</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reservoir Dogs<br />

Fargo<br />
<br />
Many, many more...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tulouis</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">American beauty<br />
Shawshank Redemption (sp?)<br />
Matrix<br />
Braveheart<br />
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (hehe...this is a love it or hate it type of movie)<br />
Star Wars (all of them)<br />
Clerks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micaeus</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pulp Fiction- Completely agree with the first poster. The dialogue oozes coolness<br />
<br />
L.A. Confidential- Unbelievable acting, classic film noir, great setting (1950's L.A.)<br />
<br />
O Brother Where Art Thou- Really clever adaption of The Odyssey. Great soundtrack, great setting also.<br />
<br />
Almost Famous- Sure, it may be a little sappy, but I get more attached to these characters while watching the movie than any other movie.<br />
<br />
Fight Club- Another very clever dialogue movie, excellent direction, and the most wild plot twist I have ever seen in a movie. Seven is also a great movie from the same director (David Fincher)<br />
<br />
Training Day- Denzel Washington. Wow<br />
<br />
Harvey- A real classic, Jimmy Stewart could kick dogs and make it likeable. The scene where he describes how he and Harvey met is the most charming and loveable scene in the history of cinema, in my eyes.<br />
<br />
These are just the favorites I have seen recently. Movies are a big thing in my life, it's hard to rank them like this, but off the top of my head, that's the best I can do right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buntar</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just bought Braveheart on DVD and watched it alone last night until 2:30 in the morning.  <br />
<br />
I've seen it 3-4, and it's probably my favorite non-comedy movie.<br />
<br />
UHF and Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail are great.<br />
<br />
&quot;You to drink from...the FIRE HOSE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lord of the Rings was great, too.<br />
<br />
Anything with Jay and Silent Bob, but mostly Clerks and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I don't know what you saying kid, but you special. You touched me right here. I'm gonna give you directions!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
AI was good, if you stop at the &quot;Kubrick ending&quot; and skip the whole &quot;Spielberg ending.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last 25 minutes of the movie tried very hard to ruin the first two hours.</div></div><hr />

5. The Big Lewbowski: Absolutely the funniest movie ever. &quot;Your about to enter a World of Pain!&quot;<br />
6. The Jerk. Ok this was the funniest Movie ever!<br />
7. The Good The Bad and The Ugly. The Best Western.<br />
8. The Outlaw Jose Wales. Ok the Best western also. (actually any of his spegetti westerns and The Unforgiven). (Sometimes I need to rent two or three of Clints westerns and get a big ole bag of popcorn!)<br />
9. The Naked Gun. Ok This was the Funniest Movie ever!<br />
10. Aliens. The first one. The second one had better effects but this one scared the crap out of me. &quot;In space no one will hear you Scream&quot;.<br />
<br />
11. The Fight Club: Man I have to add this in too!<br />
<br />
2-10 can be in any order depending on my mood. Ok You can enter Gladiator in there as well as Casablnca, and Harvey (I loved that movie). I will stop there heheh.</div></div><hr />

Best line in the movie:<br />

&quot;They said you was hung!&quot;<br />
&quot;..and they was right!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tons of great movies in this thread.  Some I dont think I saw on peoples lists:<br />
<br />
Backdraft<br />
Airplane<br />
Untouchables<br />
Young Frankenstein<br />
<br />
<br />
All of those are must see movies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Backdraft is AWESOME.<br />
<br />
My father was a firefighter for 20 years. We saw that movie so many times. We actually met some of the firemen who worked on the movie as consultants. The outdside scenes of the last fire at the end are of a chemical plant fire that the guy who was actually on that department called an &quot;lawnchair fire.&quot; You hose down the buildings around it, and get out your lawnchairs and just watch it burn.<br />
<br />
When they opened the Backdraft exhibit at Universal, one of the things Ron Howard made them do was that firefighters and their families go to the front of the line. When we went there just after the exhibit opened, the line was about 1 hour long. My dad was wearing his fire department jacket, and someone came and grabbed us out of the line to go to the front. <br />
<br />
(Everyone watch Myrea rant on-and-on off topic...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well lets see.. In no order...<br />
<br />
Star Wars (all of them including the Phantom Menace and the next two to come out though I reserve the right to change my mind.  I say this is all one choice since its really just one long story)<br />
<br />
Indiana Jones (all of them and again really 1 long story)<br />
<br />
Matrix (soon to be all of them though reserve right to change mind and again its one big story)<br />
<br />
Blade Runner<br />
<br />
Lord of the Rings (all of them when they come out again one big story)<br />
<br />
Aliens (all of them.. one big story)<br />
<br />
Mad Max (all of them.. I'm a Wasteland fanatic)<br />
<br />
Monty Python Holy Grail (too quotable)<br />
<br />
Tombstone (I'm your huckleberry *grins evilly*)<br />
<br />
Terminator (both of them.. just great Cyborg fun)<br />
<br />
Predator (both of them cause those are some bad alien dudes)<br />
<br />
Some runner ups include<br />
Tora Tora Tora<br />
Saving Private Ryan<br />
The Cell<br />
13th Floor<br />
Dark City<br />
Patton<br />
The Dirty Dozen<br />
Running Man<br />
Fire Fox (or is it Fox Fire.. the one where Clint Eastwood steals a Soviet Super plane)<br />
Hunt for Red October<br />
Starship Troopers (sucked compared to the book but taken on its own it was a fun flick)<br />
<br />
and for future releases/ wish they would make...<br />
Aliens vs Predator would rock (and plans have been mulling around for this for about a decade... might happen)<br />
<br />
more Mad Maxes... as many as they can squeeze out Mel Gibson<br />
<br />
more Aliens... you can never have too many<br />
<br />
Battletech (if they had good writers and actors the Mechwarrior Universe could be as intriguing as Star Wars.<br />
<br />
A return to the Conan series (this one is slated up as a project pending sign ons for certain actors.  Rumor has it Arnold will resume the roll of Conan but he will be an old king and that he will hand the legacy to his son which is rumored to be played by The Rock so that could be totally cool)<br />
<br />
Terminator... set in the future during the machine wars (also rumored to be in the works)<br />
<br />
Star Trek (I'm a soso Trek fan... but the movie I would like to see would have Capt Sulu on the Excelsior as you see him in &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot;)<br />
<br />
I could go on for hours but I best stop hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daffious</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Terminator!<br />

Both the original movies were far supirior the sequels. Sequels had better effects but the originals were best.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tombstone was an awesome movie also!<br />
<br />
How could I forget them!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also like to add In Harm's Way, very good John Wayne war movie set in the Pacifics during WW2.<br />
<br />
And another wartime movie on my list above is a MUST see imo, Empire of the Sun.<br />
<br />
Also liked very much The Guns of Navarone, and it's prequel, Force Ten from Navarone was almost as good.<br />

3. The Godfather<br />
<br />
I've purposely left out Star War and Indiana Jones. I dont know where to rank them but they are certainly somewhere within these 3. Special exception is made for The Phatom Menance and Temple of Doom. I didnt really care for Temple of Doom all that much and the jury is still out on Phantom Menace. It seems like I like episode 1 more each time I watch it though.<br />

Also, its a little off topic but I'm a HUGE Sopranos fan. God I love that show. Gandalfini is the man! Also I am really enjoying Six Feet Under. I just really seem to like the HBO original series.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Lord of the Rings - a wonderful adaption of the books<br />
Highlander - part 1 only as per my first post in this thread<br />
Monty Python's Life of Brian - I have seen it over a dozen times and I still laugh as much as I did the first time<br />
Ladyhawke - sometimes I am a sucker for romantic stories ;)<br />
High Noon - I saw it first when I was like 10 and it kept me riveted in my chair<br />
A Few Good Men - two words: Jack Nicholson<br />
The Name of the Rose - one of the best dark medieval movies ever in my book<br />
Braveheart - a grand historic tale, wonderfully brought to the screen by Mel Gibson<br />
Pulp Fiction - can't help but love the dialogues  /grin<br />
Das Boot - because of it's incredibly realistic atmosphere (and I actually walked through the u boat they used for the movie... wow)<br />
Groundhog Day - just because :D<br />
<br />
Without naming them all, I like most movies with Clint Eastwood or Mel Gibson :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I forgot to include Billy Madison in my original post. What Sandler does with his voice just cracks me up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Game! Best suspense ever. Seen it once, watching again is worhtless. I'm sorry, but this movie has the BEST plot turns ever.....<br />
<br />
A couple to add: <br />
Time Bandits<br />
Army of Darkness (Gimme some sugar baby!)</div></div><hr />

Also, some of the races included the actual footage of Pre.  I think the interviews of Pre during the Olympics were the actual interviews too.<br />
<br />
I forgot to add Blues Brothers to my lisa also.  Another great movie.  I love the scene with the nun beating on them!</div></div><hr />

A far less obvious choice is The Edge.  I LOVE that movie.  That bear is so freaking scary, I feel like it's after me!  heh</div></div><hr />

10. Almost anything with Will Smith in it. (with the exception of Ali.. haven't seen that yet.)<br />
<br />
That's my list.. and for those of you who haven't seen Phantom, it's a DAMN good horror version of Phantom of the Opera..  parts of it make you want to run screaming from the building due to sheer panic (some of the killings get downright gross), and other parts (like Christine's voice) make you want to sit there and yell MORE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've noticed a few that haven't been mentioned that I think deserve it.<br />
<br />
Gattica<br />
Sixth Sense<br />
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon<br />
<br />
I have to say I like Reservoir Dogs better than Pulp Fiction.  The acting was incredible.<br />
<br />
/sigh Bleuhearts, I have a soft spot for Chinese (5th generation) movies.  I need to go and rent some again.  Red Sorghum was good too.</div></div><hr />

In no particular order then.......<br />
*Alien(s)The second one!  Prolly cause I'm just a silly girl at heart who likes to see cute boys in movies~  First one was actually the better movie-Also, most James Cameron flicks before barf-o-rama Titanic.<br />

*Bladerunner<br />
*Terminator<br />
*Castle of Cagliostro<br />

*Godfather Trilogy<br />

*Dawn of the Dead<br />
*Manhatten Murder Mystery-Or just about anything by Woody Allen except that musical one I just couldn't get into :o <br />
*Lord of the Rings :D   Doesn't compare to book, but awesome none the less!<br />
*The Bear<br />
*Milo &amp; Otis-To quote the cat &quot;I hope that's a kitten coming out there...&quot;<br />
*Thin Red Line-Left me without words, just pure amazement.<br />
