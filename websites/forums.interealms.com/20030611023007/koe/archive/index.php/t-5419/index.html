<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My old friend Wutan is closing in on the ghoulbane quest and would like to knock off the Lucan fella tonight. Wutan is time-zone-challenged, so it's a little late for me to help. If any Keepers could give him a hand, that would be great. LOA thread for this event is here: LOA thread (http://www.lostorder.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1640)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wutan Ironblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for the help Baracus!<br />
  Indeed I am after that fellow Sir Lucan the FP guard.<br />
Tis the last thing I must do to obtain the pieces for SoulFire.<br />
I know many of you, most from your days in LOA.  I took a long vacation from EQ but now I am back.  I am closing in on my 44th season and hopefully soon I will be able to join my friends like, Timbo, Baracus, Cyrssi once again.<br />
   I know this can be an undesirable task to do, being it gives you a big negative faction hit with the FP guards.  Any help would be appreciated.  The plan is 8:30 pst, seeing how i am time zone challenged and must wait til the lil one is asleep.<br />
   I will try to be on earlier if possible.<br />
Thansk again.</div></div><hr />

Shoot me a tell, Wutan.  Falamil still bumps off FP guards when noone is looking anyway, so the faction hit doesnt matter.</div></div><hr />
