<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We did this the other night a couple times, and it worked like a charm.  <br />
<br />
Trial of Execution<br />
<br />
1 Warrior, lvl 64<br />
1 Enchanter, lvl 65<br />
2 Wizards, lvl 63 and 60<br />
2 Shaman, lvl 60 and 61<br />
<br />
Very, very simple.  Use the AoE tactics, use your shaman to keep wizzies up and running with chloroblast during the first few rounds, then CH chain during final fight on Warrior.  With pet damage, Wizard AoE's, and a solid tank and enchanter (who are vets of the trial), it was the smoothest run I've ever seen.  Only once did we get under 5 seconds on the kill timer of a wave mob, and that was easy enough to take care of with a couple poison blasts to help out the wizards.  <br />
<br />
Spell lineup was:<br />
<br />
1 - Summon Companion, switched to Spear of Torment after first wave (Blast of Venom for 2nd shaman)<br />
2 - Malo, only cast on the final boss (Malosini for 2nd shaman)<br />
3 - Cloud of Grummus, never used (Plague of Insects would be fine)<br />
4 - Turgur's, never used<br />
5 - Kragg's Mending<br />
6 - Chloroblast<br />
7 - Torpor (Stoicism will work just as well)<br />
8 - Cann 4<br />
<br />
After failing ump-teen times with different groups over the last few months, I was amazed how simple it was.  I know the other shaman and I were both sweating bullets before we started, but everything was a cakewalk after the 2nd wave (which gave us the timer scare.)<br />
<br />
Other things that helped were:<br />
<br />
61 Mage items, curtousy of Tweelis:  Swords, muzzle, and belt for pet, bracer, earring, and ring for the shammy's, and 3-charge rods for all<br />
<br />
Virtue from our friendly neighborhood cleric, Macey<br />
<br />
Focus of Soul from our favorite Shaman brother, Ripto.  <br />
<br />
Hope this helps a few more shammy brothers and sisters get those flags.  Good luck everyone!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats, glad more shaman are making it in PoV/PoS. I know the AE way is the norm these days, but I am glad I did it the tough way. 61 War, 60 Cleric, 60 Ench, 59 BL, 59 Rogue, and me (61 Shaman at the time). Was back when it was really hard to get Shaman in and we did it the melee way.</div></div><hr />
