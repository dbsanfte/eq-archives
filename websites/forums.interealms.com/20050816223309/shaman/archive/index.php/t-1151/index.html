Basically, lose 15 mana, 20 hp, for 13 wis, 3 ac, 20 hp.  More recently I've become more of a HP fanatic, and even though 20 hp is kinda small, it's still something.  Any other reasonably attainable masks?<br />

This one is mainly an AC desision.  Currently I'm around 1069 ac unbuffed, and would like to hit 1100 unbuffed.  But giving up 50 hp and 10 stamina for 15 ac just seems like too much for me.  I hate having 0 ac in range slot, but the hp on the 8th cudgel are just godly &gt;&lt;  Also, I don't think there are more than 10 people on all the servers with the 8th cudgel, so it's a rather unique thing to have as well, which is somewhat of an added benefit.<br />
<br />
<br />
3)  And for more fun, I'm slowly working towards the spirit wracked cord from chardok.  100 hp is just too good to pass up.  Currently I plan to put it in shoulder over my tattered mantle (50 levels + 12 aa levels it's lasted me so far...), but as soon as I get a matchless dragonwing mantle (15 ac, 65 hp/mana), do I put the cord in my bracer or arm slot?<br />
For reference, SS bracer is:<br />
AC: 16<br />
DEX: +2  WIS: +7  HP: +20  MANA: +15  <br />

<br />
vs SS arms, which are:<br />

The obvious difference here is the HP.  I'd love to keep the lod shield around for the resists and use the HP all the time, but 60k for a lod shield for sale, and heiros only being about 10 is a huge profit in the bank.  Not to mention most of my guild would kill me for selling a LSS without giving to them first =)  The effect is not to be underestimated too, it's so handy to not carry around an extra necklace for EB.  I can't realistically stuff a LSS in the resist gear bag and use a heiro, I'd have to sell it off if I swapped.  On this one just curious what most others use / have used in this situation?  I don't do a ton of raiding, mainly HoT, eventually we're going to move to West Wing of ToV and switch factions.  13 ac, 20 fr/cr, 10 mr, vs 75 hp.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Again, I'm an iksar, have 1850 unbuffed hp right now (would like to hit 1925 before I get to canni5 =) ), and AC is at 1069.  I'd like to someday get to 2k hp and 1100 ac unbuffed.  You can view the rest of my profile at magelo in the sig~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erathlyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Factoring in that above 200 wis 1 wis is about 6.5 mana<br />
<br />
My personal opinion on those choices:<br />
1) Death mask of the Elysians (more hp, relatively little mana difference)<br />
<br />
2) Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients (for sure on this one, very nice hp mana/wis etc, much better than just the 15 ac)<br />
<br />
3) For the choices you have there arm or wrist slot won't make much of a difference... if you have any future upgrades in mind I would base the slot location on those.  +hp arms and bracers are both very hard to find, bracers being slightly easier to find in my opinion (bracelet of fortitude).  Onyx chain sleeves is one of the few arm hp options so perhaps cord in arm slot.<br />
<br />
4) if your cr/mr/fr are all already around 100 ... hiero cloak ... otherwise lod shield, hard to beat the ac/resists/wis, and enduring breath is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">im on the debate with LSS and hcloak myself.. i think im going to stick with shield for resists, but damn 75 hp is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I basically have the same hp goals as you.<br />
<br />
Personally I would stick with the death mask of the elyasians, skyiron cudgel.<br />
<br />
bracers, I wear bracer of fortitude and wolfcallers/jbb.<br />
gonna put my cord (when I finally faction droga) on the shoulders.<br />
I would probably wear cord on arms, if I had matchless mantle, given the choice of wolfcallers arms vs cord.<br />
<br />
Lodi shield for me is good enough resists, ac and effect to sacrifice the slot hp-wise, though 75hps on heiro is tempting.  My resists are rather poor overall.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">damn i wish i had your problems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol, yeah, it would suck to have to decide which uber gear to wear :)<br />
<br />
I usually go for AC before HP, because I think AC helps me keep the HP I do have... but I see the advantage of getting 1925 hp unbuffed for canni 5, and after all, if hp &gt; 0, you're doing ok :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd stick with what you've got on 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 and start looking elsewhere for some hps upgrades. If your looking for hps I'd go for coldain skin gloves with 20hps and 9 sta totalling 47 hps and a 7/6 talisman from ww if can get onewith 30hps and 6 sta for a total of 48hps netting you almost 100hps between those 2 items. Since your sta is a ways from capping too you could go with the sta bracer from umbral for 45hps, 25 over what you wear currently. Barbed dragon hide boots or vindi boots would be a great hps upgrade for you too. If you guys are doing vindi grab a bp while your there too =)<br />
<br />
As far as range slot goes If you really want to upgrade to something with ac I would consider the talisman of benevolance. Relatively easy quest and gives a good middle ground between the 2 you mentioned.<br />
<br />
As for #3 i'd say it doesnt' really matter till you start upgrading you wolfcallers. Off hand I'd say go with bracer since you can hide it so it doesn't ruin your full armor look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well its personal choice of course, since you asked for opnions heres what I'd do.<br />
<br />
1. Elysian Mask. 35hp and mana, lovely, worth a bit less ac and wis for me.<br />
<br />
2. Tricky one, I'd use the cudgel over the DI personally, thats a massive chunk of hp when you add the sta. 1050-1099 ac or so works well for me, I got over 1.1 with ageo. I'd want more than 15 ac there to make it worth swopping out. Grats on the quest :)<br />
<br />
3. Whats the ac on the cord again? I'd be tempted put it in the arms slot myself, good luck on that, im far too fond of chardok/ too lazy to faction to do the quest.<br />
<br />
4. Well i never had a Lodi so didnt have to make this choice but I swopped an ancient seahorse cloak (25ac) out for a hiero so that goes some way to showing how much I value that 75 hp.<br />
<br />
Being able to eat a cann5 unbuffed is great. Get ressed, wait for HP to fill up, bang, enough mana to do a group focus. (plus it really freaks out your group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">12 ac 100 hp on cord.  <br />
<br />
Yeah I suppose I'll be stuck around 1050 ac for a while, need to get some kael stuff that has more AC I think.  Strength of Elements also on my list, but that could be a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got a nice dilemma too :)<br />
<br />
I recently traded a Orb of the infinite void for Boots of flowing slime (Good trade imo). Will these boots drop alot in price? (Common drop and farmed) Should I sell them and get alot of cash or keep em? If I sell, I can prolly buy a new pair later and still have a huge chunk of cash perhaps? What would you do?<br />
<br />
Allready got fungi and jbb.</div></div><hr />
