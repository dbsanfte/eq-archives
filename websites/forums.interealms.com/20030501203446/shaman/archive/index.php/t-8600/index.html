<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Replica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">okay, some things need to be known about this zone, ITS SO BUGGED YOU CAN EXPLOIT ALL THE WAY TO 58 WITHOUT GETTING HIT UNLESS YOU WANT TO!  I no longer choose to camp these spawns simply because they reduce the integrity of the game and gaining exp, and they are overcamped because of these exploits.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why would you need to exploit this?  At 53 I was doing the nobles, bards, and Isabella totally legit, and with just about no chance of dying.  <br />

<br />
if you cant get a turn learn to bind there and make deals with the people currently camping there. i have a few cash spots ive done this with and it has worked out so so nice , not to mention i used to do it at this spot :p</div></div><hr />
