<br />
Don't talk about stuff you don't have the slightest clue of. Pretty simple rule.<br />
<br />
FP is virtually unresistable(like almost all if not all the necro DoTs and specifically this line), Pox gets resisted easily with 50 DR(can be resisted with negative DR too!), FP drops like candy, Pox is one of the rarest spells ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Woland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">FP doesn't drop like candy. It's rare from Rhag2 (I've seen two drops from maybe 10 kills). I miss it and I know several necros that misses it (despite that necros are possibly one of the least played classes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">5 FP's on Bertoxx... i'd say thats perdy rare.  <br />
<br />
also, it might be the 'biggest' dot in the game, but if you calc per DPS (perhaps makes more sense...), our sessy Ancient &gt; FP.  though nobody has seen it yet that i'm aware of.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Giac, i will admit that i am nowhere near the levels in which i can see pox or FP being used, im just going from what i have heard.<br />
<br />
Disease is often less resisted then fire, so thats what i assumed, i had no proof for that one.  All i know is that at this level my disease dots have a far better chance of sticking on most mobs that have a tendency to resist my friends fire nukes. <br />
<br />
Ive spent plenty of time in the auction chan, and in NFP, and have never seen FP auctioned, but i have seen pox, bane, torpor and malo on various occasions.<br />
<br />
Also, talking to various necros, i know that alot of 60 Nec's dont have FP.  As bart said, if there are only 5 on ALL of bertoxx, then its probably pretty goddamn rare.  <br />
-<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell, ive never played a necro past about lvl 5 or 6, cant remember, so i dont have experiance in how often their spells are resisted and all..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, DPS wise FP is clearly the best dot in the game, more damage for less time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">FP drops like candy? We've killed rhag a bunch and we've seen FP twice. That is rare as ****. Pox is common at best now since it drops off juggs in sebilis. If i logged on now i would see Pox for auction some time today i am willing to beat on it. <br />
If they ever get the ancient spells back in I would really like to see scourge of Nife drop since its the same mana/duration as Bane but does 1900+! Thats a sweet spell and to stack it with bane with be nothing short of insane damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My reply was a bit harsh and i have to apologize...<br />
<br />
However when it comes to our DoTs and comparing them to necro DoTs i am very sensitive, because our DoTs suck ass, plain and simple. Even the Ancient one is going to suck, if they don't change it's coding.<br />
<br />
To all the naysayers:<br />
<br />
FP drops fairly common(compared to how Px used to drop). You have to consider that Pox has been in the game for more than 2 years and FP started to drop after a patch in february if i remember correctly.<br />
<br />
Again don't compare DPS when you compare DoT's. I would trade all my DoTs + the Ancient one(which no one has yet) for FP. It's ****ing sad what a disparity between DoT lines and their power exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hey Giac, give Necros Turgurs and they'll give us FP :D</div></div><hr />

Hey Giac, give Necros Turgurs and they'll give us FP :D <br />
they can keep fp, i mean, what good are uber dots if the mob rips em up real fast :P.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, just to add another thing to the mix, for us, getting epic is very easy.  many shammys get it pretty early in the 50's, yet i dont know any necros who have gotten theirs before lvl 60.<br />
<br />
Our easy epic quest gives us a huge advantage while soloing.  <br />
<br />
Also, JBB/Fungi make us completely uber.  I cant think of any item like the jbb that inhances any other classes soloin power like it does ours.  JBB is cheaper then FP too, and DPS wise deals similar if not more dpm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Can't compare JBB to FP. FP does more damage and gets resisted 1 in 1000 casts. You are constantly locked in casting a spell if you want JBB to do effective damage, while you cast FP and can do whatever else.<br />
<br />
Every caster class has a nuke item nowadays. Most of them are far better than the JBB DPS wise. JBB though is the easiest to get by far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah, as all the other ones drop of mobs most players will never see.<br />
<br />
JBB is easy to get, thats the thing, and it increase your power immensly.<br />
<br />
Im not sayin the JBB is better then fp, its not.  What im trying to say is that although necro dots kick the ass of our dots, we have things like an easy epic quest, decent dots, slows and of course the JBB.<br />
<br />
While fp is the best dot in the game, our potential powers are far great post 50</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Pox, although it can drop off the the Jaugernauts, is far from common.<br />
<br />
For several weeks I was spending quite a bit of time in Old Seb doing Juagernauts, Jumpy, and the Protector.  We got all sort of spell drops, including a couple of Banes of Nife.  We got zero Pox.  Zero Malo, and Zero Torpor.<br />
<br />
We found enough other rare and uncommon spells for other classes that we were able to supply a number of our friends with missing spells, sell over 130k worth of spells, and still have 2 spell mules with many many spells on them.<br />
<br />
I rarely see anyone auctioning to sell Pox, but know quite a few who are still looking for it.<br />
<br />
I do not think it is anywhere near as difficult to get as it was in the bad old pre-patch days, but it is still rare.<br />
<br />
But as to the original point -- glad the rangers are having fun with thier bows.    It is about time.<br />
<br />
Pox may have higher initial resists than FP, but we do have an unresistable disease debuff.  In my experience you can land pox after the debuff on many many mobs.   I often use it as my strategy for mobs that I know are going to be otherwise highly resistant.  Our epic dot -- zero mana, always memmed, just have to channel it -- shouldn't be discounted.  While it may not do maximum damage per second, it is rarely resisted, and easy to apply.<br />

<br />
ok, these numbers are against a rather weak mob, and Kitae is a highend ranger.<br />
<br />
Those numbers are pretty sweet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Quantic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Giac, no offense here, but it seems like you are the one that is clueless.<br />
<br />
Pox can drop off of Juggs, Kunark dragons, Emp in Crypt, etc.<br />
<br />
Funeral Pyre drops only off of Rhag2 in SSra.  Guess what else?  FP is considered an ITEM off of Rhag2, and not one of its spell slots.<br />
<br />
The chances of FP dropping over Pox is almost nil.<br />
<br />
Now lets check resistances.  FP is not virtually unresistable.  It checks fire resistance and is resisted quite frequently.  Pox is disease based, and how many disease based slows are there in the game that are widely used?<br />
<br />
You can disease debuff mobs then land Pox.  FP still wont land on some mobs after debuff.<br />
<br />
Another thing:  Do you honestly consider Shamen underpowered that if a Necro has a better dot than you, you will complain?  Necros don't have any viable DD spells, only an undead slow (wow, we all know how useful this is in 95% of the zones), and a pet that cannot be used in most raids because of hassles and the fast deaths from AE mobs.<br />
<br />
Stop with the class envy, it only leads to nerfs, for both classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Potus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">&quot;Waaahhh, all my other god spells like Malo, Torpors, and Turgur's aren't good enough, I don't just want Funeral Pyre, I want BETTER!! #$*(&amp;#*ing Verant fix this!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Really, stop being so silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Lately this board is reminding me of the picture that was around a few months ago about winning an argument on the internet and still being a moron.<br />
<br />
Last i checked this thread was about DoTs.<br />
<br />
Why are you trying to put words into my mouth and make it look as if i was comparing any other aspect of the necro and shaman class ?<br />
<br />
I am really tired to argue and will only say a few things.<br />
<br />
Pox has been in the game for 2 years(as i have said in the previous post and what you didn't bother to read). FP might be rarer than Pox now(And no FP doesnt drop only off Rhag2, so don't insist on this), but as of a few months ago the numbers on this board showed how many were still missing it. Do you think FP will be missed by many level 60s 2 years from now ?<br />
<br />
Now lets check resistances. FP is not virtually unresistable. It checks fire resistance and is resisted quite frequently. Pox is disease based, and how many disease based slows are there in the game that are widely used? <br />
<br />
You can disease debuff mobs then land Pox. FP still wont land on some mobs after debuff. <br />
<br />
God, don't make me puke please!<br />
<br />
FP will land on every mob that isn't totally immune to Fire without the need for any debuffs, who are you trying to lie to ? Are you an ignorant or are you just pretending ?<br />
<br />
*** does disease based slows have to do with all this ?<br />
<br />
If you had a clue, you would know that even after debuffing DR, Pox doesn't land on more than a handful mobs.<br />
<br />
Let's make it clear for the not-so-bright.<br />
<br />
Shamans have 2 DoT lines(necros have these lines too).<br />
Being that most of the mobs are very resistant to poison and disease nowadays(Yes, i know that in the Temple of Ssraeshza disease works fine on some ubermobs now), is it too much to ask that these 2 spell lines would be as &quot;unresistable&quot; as the Necro's Fire and Magic DoT line ?(If you now still insist on calling this class envy and nerfing another class you need mental help)<br />
<br />
The Necro class would still have a ****load of DoT lines + the 2 Shaman lines. It would actually be an upgrade to the class.<br />
<br />
K out of here now, before the next poster starts telling me we have a JBB and don't need better DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Briljin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">FP is not virtually unresistable. It checks fire resistance and is resisted quite frequently. <br />
<br />
<br />
As a 60th lvl Necromancer I can tell you for a fact that Funeral Pyre (along with Pryo and Ignite Blood) are VERY hard to resist, I have landed them upon mobs that Wizards can not land standard fire based nukes.  It can be resisted but it is pretty rare.<br />
<br />
Now Funeral Pyre is not dropping like candy.  My guild has slain pretty much everything in Luclin besides Blood, Emp and Seru (and VT of course) and it has only dropped from Rhag II and we have only seen it drop three times.  Yes it is more common then Pox but that does not mean &quot;it drops like candy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Personally I have no idea why you are bitching about it Giac, you act like the Shaman does not already have a crap load of great things going for it.  You are highly sought after for grouping and raids and can solo extermly well.  Even with your inferior DoTs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Where in my posts have i been bitching about Necros, their DoTs or anything? <br />
All that i have been bitching about for years now is that<br />
Shaman DoTs need to be recoded. The game has changed, my DoTs haven't.<br />
<br />
Keep looking, FP doesn't drop oly off Rhag 2. GRC doesn't drop only off Rhag 1 either.</div></div><hr />

Funeral Pyre of Kelador drops from a mob called Rhag'Mozdezh located in Ssra Temple.  The mob has approximately 400,000 hitpoints, flurries constantly, and requires about 40 level 60's to kill.  Perhaps 1 in 10 kills will drop the spell.<br />
<br />
I am a level 60 Necromancer with 122 days played and do not have this spell yet.  I have seen a couple of people auctioning to buy it for 50,000p though with no luck finding someone selling.<br />
<br />
As far as necro dots being virtually unresistable, that is a common misconception.  Have you ever heard of necro twitch?  It's us giving our mana to other classes because there's nothing else we can do with it.  It's why so many necros quit the game... because by the time we're raid level, the mobs resist way too many of our spells for us to be of use, are we're relegated to becoming mana batteries when we want to be damage dealers.<br />

You have haste, slow, debuffs, nukes, lots of stat buffs, dots, cures, heals, cannibalize, summon stuff, SoW, Pets.<br />

My point is Shamans really dont NEED dots because you can do so much else. So stop whining about the only class in the game that is overpowered :)<br />

<br />
Not sure what to do with this info. <br />
Everyone knows Rhag 2(as we have called the mob you are describing in previous posts) drops FP, but i can assure you that it isn't the only mob that drops this spell, if your intention was to convince me that it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as necro dots being virtually unresistable, that is a common misconception.<br />
<br />
Ok, you are saying Necro DoTs are heavily resisted ?<br />
What DoTs are you casting and of what mobs are you talking ?<br />
<br />

<br />
Looks like Briljiin and you don't get the same spells since he is proving what i said and you seem to disagree. <br />
<br />
I know the Necro class. I know the Fire based line is RARELY resisted. You get an occasional resist in a 100 casts unless the mob is fire immune(lure only).<br />
<br />
Have you ever heard of necro twitch? It's us giving our mana to other classes because there's nothing else we can do with it. It's why so many necros quit the game... because by the time we're raid level, the mobs resist way too many of our spells for us to be of use, are we're relegated to becoming mana batteries when we want to be damage dealers. <br />
<br />
Do you really want me to explain you how to play your class ?<br />
<br />
&quot;Twitching&quot; mana is just more important for many fights than doing damage with DoTs. However, nowadays Necros can do both in 90% of the fights.<br />
What you describe above is valid for fights like Tunare, but fortunately the mobs being lure only are almost non existant anymore. The expansion where lures were having a major impact on the game was Kunark, yet even the majority of Kunark mobs are susceptible to Fire for balancing reasons(Magicians and Druids use fire DDs mainly, thus mobs aren't fire immune usually) when nothing else is hitting.<br />
Furthermore, nowadays necros rarely use twitching anymore as main mana transfer(you figure out yourself what they *should* use) as it is highly inefficient and less effective.<br />
<br />
To clarify it. We are talking of DoTs here, not your lifetaps which were resisted alot in Kunark(Kunark was 2 years ago btw, lifetaps hit 99% of the mobs post Kunark), where mobs have no immunity to slow flag and needed to be immune to magic in order to be unslowable.<br />
<br />
Why are you guys dragging me into a Necro vs. Shaman debate anyways ? Have i asked for a nerf ?<br />
<br />
I am not even going to comment on the &quot;Shamans are overpowered&quot; post, since it's pretty obvious you haven't played the class for an extended period of time and every argument for or against that would tempt me to flame ignorant people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Quantic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Giac - Please enlighten us on which other mobs drop FP because Tritonn, Valon, FoH, LoS - no one has seen FP drop off of any other mob but Rhag2.<br />
<br />
Since you seem to have such a failry good knowledge, or source, that this drops off other mobs, please tell us.  95% of the 60 Necro population is curious because they don't have the spell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">just one last comment from me<br />
<br />
As far as the whole overpowered comment:<br />
<br />
I dont beleive that shamans are over powered, but we are immensly powerfull.  Malo/Turgurs/Torpor etc. all combine to make us amazingly strong.  No, i am not of that level, but ive seen higher level shammys in action, i know what they can do.  <br />
<br />
Shamans dont need anything IMO, we are strong enough as is.  Ive seen logs of 60 shammys soloing WW dragons in under 5 min.  What do you give a class that can do that? nothing<br />
<br />
well...maybe SH at lvl 44)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">God, not the WW discussion again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Abillister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Giac, since you are telling others they shouldn't talk about what they don't know...Rhag2 is the ONLY mob that drops FP.  it is an ITEM drop off of him.  last 10-12 kills on rhag2 and no FP has dropped.  the spell is very rare.  <br />
<br />
but yes, Fire is a very easy line of spells to land (atleast on mobs that aren't immune or have insane FR...but for the most part).  I've been in touch with most of the guilds on Povar that can do rhag2 since we all race to him, and not only do they have no extras for sale, most of their necro's don't even have (these are guilds with only 1-3 active necro's).  <br />
<br />
and for the people complaining about it...it is one spell, necro's (well most of us) don't complain about shaman slows.  Slows are the best spells in the game, the things i could solo if i only had slows.  also DD's and heals.<br />
<br />
However, I do think that shaman, like necros and mages, do need a revamp 50+.  Most raids don't need more then one or two shaman (though this is better then the fact that necros aren't needed at all on raids...never heard of a raid canceled because of lack of them....and don't say PoA), but one or two is BS.  Shaman i think should be asking for the same thing necro's are, DoT stacking.  when more then one or two of you are useful on a raid, then upgrades to spells can be brought up...until then i think it is a pretty mute point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Potus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">(like almost all if not all the necro DoTs and specifically this line)<br />

I guess you've never seen the Cessation of Cor, Ebolt/Plague resists then, or even Darkness(our epic) gets resisted out the ass.<br />
<br />
FP drops like candy, Pox is one of the rarest spells ever.<br />
<br />
Yeah right. Pox drops from Juggs in Sebilis, the most farmed npc's ever, hell you can even solo them... and FP? One uber mob in Luclin.<br />
<br />
Keep looking, FP doesn't drop oly off Rhag 2.<br />
<br />
Keep looking, the Earth is flat, you're all liars, I don't believe your astronomy at all, the Earth is flat, keep looking!<br />

It is possible to have disagreement on the board, and it is possible for us to learn a lot through those exchanges.  Disagreement often makes for interesting reading, and provides interesting insights.<br />
<br />
This has gone far beyond mere disagreement.  The exchanges are personal and nasty.  I feel like I'm referring an elementary school-yard fight.<br />

However, in Giac's defense, its hard as hell to admit your wrong when someone, such as Potus, is telling you to &quot;shut the ---- up&quot;<br />
<br />
When someone takes this additude, it is much harder to admit your at fault, because of the rudeness/lack of manners etc shown by the person.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
God, you look like a fool now.<br />
<br />
Cessation of Cor is one of the non-unresistable DoTs you have(see the word *almost* all your DoT lines are unresistable?)<br />
Now comes the stupid part...Ebolt/Plague ?<br />
<br />
Guess nobody told you yet that these are Shaman lines...and that is *** i am complaining, they are heavily resisted. thanks for proving my point.<br />
Darkness/Epic ?<br />
What do you expect from a snare ?<br />
<br />
Once again you look like a complete ignorant with these statement. We are still talking of DoTs, using my own DoTs to convince anyone that Necro DoTs aren't virtually unresistable is like the dumbest thing i have seen in this thread. And mentioning your Darkness line hoping i wouldn't know it has a snare component is a close 2nd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Woland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">This thread is silly.<br />
<br />
The problems with Funeral Pyre (rarity etc) and the problems with Pox of Bertuxxolus are in no way related to each other. <br />
<br />
FP is too rare. I'm sure most necros can agree on that. I'm a level 60 necro that kills rhag2 frequently with guild. I've seen it drop twice. <br />
<br />
Pox is also rare. We have 3 x as many shamans than necros though. The problems with pox being resisted also affects necros. <br />
<br />
When the necro spell chilling embrace was patched to add poison counters, it went from being virtually unresistable (saving vs poision) to be perma-resisted if you have over say 80 vs poison.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Poison and disease counters add to the resistability of a spell. If Pox didn't add disease counters, it could perhaps be as little resisted as the heat blood necro line is (including FP). <br />
<br />
You guys should focus on feedbacking to have the resist factor from disease and poison counters lowered, and the pox drop rate upp'ed.<br />
<br />
In the mean time I'll feedback about increasing the drop rate from FP, and lessening the resists on the necro poison/disease DoT lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Finally somebody that caught the point. Lowering the resist rate on Shaman DoT lines would be a benefit to Shamans AND Necros, yet some people keep talking about class envy.<br />
<br />
I got the first copy of Pox on my server so i have no reason to whine about it being rare. However, people following the threads on these boards know Pox has been one of the rarest spells in game(of course there are people complaining about the drop rate and not camping them ever, but that's another thing).<br />
<br />
FP was in the spell data when SoL went live, but it wasn't dropping until they patched it. It started dropping off Rhag 2 and was/is part of the item loot he has. However this happened 3 months ago and comparing drop rates of FP and Pox(which has been dropping for 2+ years) is silly. <br />
Anyways, VI went on in the last weeks and added FP/GRC to at least one more mob's loot table(i have witnessed it dropping myself) when people started complaining that Rhags would be easy to kill and farm and therefore the chance of seeing it ever was too small. <br />
FP/GRC are now additionally part of the &quot;spell loot&quot;(doesn't take the spot of an item) of this other mob and it has been reported that both spells(GRC/FP) drop in at least one other place(not witnessed myself, so take this as a rumor).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As i stated nowadays in 99% of the fights Necros can do both using a different way of transferring mana that is much more efficient/effective. <br />
However in fights where this is not possible, the only way to make sure your clerics are able to CH for an extended period of time are the new improved mod rods and the old style twitching.<br />
<br />
Feel free to correct me on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Aalandan Dustbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">First, FP is one of the rarer spells in the game.  I can pick up POX for 20-30k but good luck getting FP on any server for less than 50k...I paid 50k myself for mine and have only seen ONE other copy drop, bringing the total on Xev to around 7copies.<br />
<br />
Second, Cess was HIGHLY resistable, but since the disease changes in game recently its become more viable.  But wow, 1000dmg for 250 mana.  Not really a big deal when you compare it to other spells.<br />
<br />
Now to add to this I have a lvl 52 shaman I've played alongside my lvl 60 necro, both of which created and played together since June 3rd 1999.  Both of them have disease based resists as well..heck I barely memmed Plague ever before due to the resists.  So I can see your arguements there.  But since the recent patch changes, its gotten way easier to land these spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, please do remember that Rhag 2 is widely known as the only mob that drops the spell, and its an ITEM, like a sword or dagger...not like a regular spell.  Pox drops off the spell loot table, off mobs that with little effort any 60 shaman OR 60 necro could solo.<br />
<br />
One more thing.....necros dont get any disease based dots past plague.  Shamans get the Pox spell, 1998 dmg over 90seconds.  Very nice considering the new disease based resists being lowered.  Some tout it as the best dot in game period.  It does the 90dd dmg, plus 1998 dmg = 2070 dmg for 430 mana, and is a level 59 spell.  Necros do 2140 dmg with FP for 450mana at lvl 60 and its got no DD component.<br />
<br />
I wont argue that FP is better.  It is, if you look at raw dmg.  But no one said that shamans would have the best dots.  You do however, have the cheapest dot-heals in Torpor, best epic dot that is rarely resisted, and buffing capabilities that make even your green little dog pets pretty bad lil guys :)<br />
<br />
Dont make it a Necro vs Shaman Thread.  Both are AWESOME classes, I know I play them both regularly.  The comparisons between the two just arent fair, they both have their applications...and both classes are just great as is, we just need a little balancing soon :)))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Potus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">*almost* all your DoT lines are unresistable<br />
<br />
All necro dots.<br />
<br />
Ignite line- Low resist<br />
Splurt- Low resist<br />
Vexing Line- Low Resist<br />
Ebolt line- Easily Resistable<br />
Plague Line- Easily Resistable<br />
Cessation Line- Easily Resistable<br />
Darkness Line- Easily Resistable<br />
<br />
*ALMOST* All my spells are unresistable? I'm sorry, you're clearly mistaken.<br />
<br />
I agree Ebolt and Plague resist too much. However, its both a DD and a DoT. So how could you claim this foul, when you then turn around and insult me over Darkness being a Snare and a DoT? Is it not the same situation?<br />
<br />
Also, your class envy is shown by your posession of spells. You claim Ebolt and Plague to be &quot;yours&quot;(shaman) while &quot;ours&quot;(necros) are unresistable. Like you said, we both have the same dots. So all thats left is you crying about Necro's having more dots. That's class envy buddy, pure and simple.<br />
<br />
Stop with your personal assaults, and any harsh attitude I've given you, you've brought about with your own quotes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Aalandan is right, this has become tomuch of a necro v. shammy post.<br />
<br />
necro v. shammy is jus silly cause besides a couple dots, the classes are very very different.  the way we operate is completely different then that of a necro =\<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, this post is starting to annoy me.  People have gotten far to bitter for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>monotikitia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">However in fights where this is not possible, the only way to make sure your clerics are able to CH for an extended period of time are the new improved mod rods and the old style twitching. <br />
<br />

<br />
Ok, I will.<br />
<br />
Twitching is only useful for reducing downtime.  Granted, against mobs that are basically immune to magic there's not much else to do but twitch...but that's pretty darn rare.<br />
<br />
The last two twitch spells arrive at 44th and 56th level.  I'll use the 44th for comparison purposes...the ratio gets a little better at 56, but not dramatically.<br />
<br />
Complete Heal takes 400 mana.<br />
<br />
The 44th Twitch gives 100 mana (costing the necro 300) in 3 seconds cast time with a recast delay of 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
That means that in order to transfer enough mana to cast a CH, the necro has to waste 1200 mana, and it takes 3+8+3+8+3+8+3, or 36 seconds (with another 8 seconds recast before another twitch is possible).  <br />
<br />
The point? If you're running short of mana during a fight...you should have brought more healing.  Twitching isn't a substitute.<br />
<br />
There's also all the other things the necro can do with 1200 mana in 36 seconds that I'd argue generally outweigh the usefulness of twitching, but that's a lot more situational...</div></div><hr />
