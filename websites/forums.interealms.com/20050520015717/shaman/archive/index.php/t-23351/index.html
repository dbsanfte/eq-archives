<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">... and happened to come across Filter, on G4TechTV. It just happened to have been a bunch of top 5 lists for, well, should be obvious I hope :)<br />
<br />
While it looks like most of it was taped during the LV Fan Faire in Spring, the game snippets seemed fairly recent (see: Gunthak portal in Plane of Knowledge, even though it's been 2 and a half months on that already, but still), so I'm not sure if anybody's seen this yet or not. However, I did see something fairly entertaining. (If you don't want show spoilers, go away)<br />
<br />
Toughest Zone: Plane of Time<br />
Best Quest: Coldain Shawl<br />
Favorite Expansion: Planes of Power<br />
<br />
Favorite Races:<br />
5) Vah Shir<br />
4) Froglok<br />
3) High Elf<br />
2) Iksar<br />
1) Dark Elf<br />
<br />
Favorite Classes:<br />
5) Cleric<br />
4) Necromancer<br />
3) Shadow Knight<br />
2) Warrior<br />
1) Shaman<br />
<br />
... No, I'm not kidding. They then proceeded to mention our outstanding buffing, healing, and slow abilities. I won't go further than that.<br />
<br />
Notice how Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres, are not in the favorite races list /flex :P<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd throw that little tidbit around for those that either missed it, don't get the channel, don't watch the channel (I know I rarely do, except for Icons, which is pretty good), get to be clued in. Granted, that was almost 5 months old now, but... there you have it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mulkosaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well even if no one else loves you Shaman's and little dog dog I do.  /hug Shamans and gives dog dog pet wepaons.<br />
<br />
Actually I can see the favorite class being Shamans the poll wasn't based on game mechanics right?  <br />

I'll give you that too, but it's not like they made the decisions, the EQ players (I suppose) made them, they just announced them basically. Like I said before, I don't really watch that channel at all since G4 came in and took over... I watch Food Network more than G4, more interesting by a long shot (Good Eats, Unwrapped, Iron Chef (though I missed the tail end of the lamb battle last night, gah!), Secret Life Of... good stuff over there, despite the fact my cooking abilities are pretty awful unless the instructions are in English on the box... hehe).<br />
<br />
Ah, what fun it is when you have over 100 channels on TV, and still nothing on... and who needs 20+ sports and movie channels?! Not like you can watch all of them at once...</div></div><hr />

Ive said it before and I'll say it again:<br />
<br />
Real shaman dont have tails.  <br />
<br />
Iksar = tails, ergo not real shaman<br />
Vah Shir = tails, ergo not real shaman<br />
Froglok = tails (when they are tadpoles) ergo, not real shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">real shaman have fur.. oh burn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hardest zone is listed as Plane of Time?!? That must have been taken a long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i caught that episode myself and i thought it was ok. wasnt crazy about the lady dressed up as a dwarf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why are there cats on the moon again ?  <br />
<br />
Seeing Frogloks and Vah Shir near the top of the favorite race list makes me think this poll was taken at the Middle School down the street.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">favorite expansion PoP? what are they basing this on? Didnt SoE announce that Velius was the favorite expansion just a few months ago?</div></div><hr />
