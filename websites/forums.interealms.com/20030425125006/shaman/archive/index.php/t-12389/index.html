<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
sorry if this has been asked (if it has, i couldn't find it), but i currently use kromriff military legs and am looking to upgrade to either tae ew or rune crafters.<br />
<br />
so, which to choose?  HP on tae ew or mana on rune crafters...<br />
<br />
Tae Ew Chain Leggings  +23 AC +3 Str +4 Sta +2 Agi +2 Dex +4 Wis +2 vsMg +2 vsFire +2 vsCold +2 vsPos +2 vsDis +60 HP +5.00 Wt <br />
<br />
Rune Crafter's Greaves  +22 AC +5 Sta +3 Agi +10 Wis +30 HP +80 Mana +6.00 Wt Fx: Abolish Disease<br />
<br />
the clicky effect on the thurg legs is kinda nice, i guess.  rune crafters MQ is about 5k, tae ew is about 12-15k.<br />
<br />
thoughts please...<br />
<br />
thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easier said than done /lol <br />
(Yes I know you can do HoT with 3-ish high level chars now)<br />
Chain drop rates always sucked in there.<br />
<br />
Both Thurg Quest MQ's and Tae Ew Legs are good.<br />
<br />
Balanced gear is always good (HP/Sta/Wis/Mana/AC) but so is gear with an assload of HP :)<br />
<br />
At level 60 the Thurg Legs will give you +45 hp total (+15 hp from the +5 sta) vs +72 for the Tae Ew.<br />
However the Thurg Legs would give you about 200 mana vs 48 mana for the Tae Ew.<br />
<br />
Guess you have to ask yourself if 152 more mana is worth 27 hps less...<br />
<br />
Overshadowing all this of course, is the fact that when you get Cana 5 you have to deal with the sudden loss of 1924 HP's every 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
But then by the time you are 60+ and have the AA's for Cana 5 you may well be in a raiding guild and get phat lewts anyway!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have the cash to spare then I would go with the tae ew legs, mainly because you can atleast sell them back to someone else and get some of your money back when you get an upgrade :)<br />
<br />
If your on a budget go with the thurg legs, there isnt that much difference, even with the HoT legs.  I had the rune crafters for a long time myself until i finally got an ornate pattern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Barbed Rubicite leggings are also quite nice, while camping for blood to make Tae Ew may as well work at trying to get a set to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">best legs are the long slender ones that go from the floor to a well shaped @$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally I would pick Tae Ew, however there are other options also, Veteran's chain leggings from the PoN hedge event are incredibly nice also.<br />
<br />
Wolfcallers are great also and very much worth getting if you can, but as stated, the drop rate on chain in HoT is utterly horrible, it took me a long time to get my legs there =(<br />
<br />
Personally I'm wearing Ancient Wyvern leggings from iki, zero mana, but tons of sta/hp and easily the highest hp shaman legs availible back then =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks for all the replies, i just bought tae ew because the guy with the thurg mq was stalling.  i figure, i can duo or group around the bank and get some myself if i ever decide to try for them.<br />
<br />
veteran legs are sweet, but i've only seen 1 pair sold on brell and i'm not doing PoN atm.<br />
<br />
thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I also am looking to get Tae Ew Chain leggins for an upgrade.<br />
But atm Im using Decayed Chain Links. I like them a lot mostly because of the Saves. They are cheap to get too, usually 1.5kpp to 2.5kpp.<br />
They arent far off from some of the other Decent leg armor.<br />
