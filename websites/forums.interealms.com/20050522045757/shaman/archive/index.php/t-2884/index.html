<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dunno....MAYBE its just me, but I cannot fathom why anyone in their right mind hunts in luclin its the most ****ty exp I have EVER experienced and imo is only good for drops.<br />
I kept getting told that the grey was wonderful...lol my ass it is I'll tell you this I may have been getting the you gain exp message, but whadya know it just wasn't there. The only zones I haven't tried yet are FG and Katta, I doubt i'll be suprised either.<br />
I hate luclin for the most part and as far as im concerned it should have never been released and should have a warning label that says ..&quot;Buy this if you like wasting money..HEY you bought the others might as well&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Grey used to be really nice xp when Luclin was first released. But the AE groups got it nerfed fairly quickly, because not content to just get good xp, they had to pull 40+ mob trains to AE for xp, gaining levels or multiple AA points in what must have only taken them a few hours. :P<br />
<br />
Admittedly that was only the very best of the AE groups, but because of things like that, Verant added on something like 10 or 15% to the HPs of all the mobs in the zone, as well as making some that are unrootable/unsnareable, and generally raising the resist levels, and (I suspect) removing an xp bonus that was there before.<br />
<br />
FG is decent xp, although you need to have a 60th level puller to get single shrooms reliably. The Deep isn't bad xp either, although again you need a fairly beefy group and/or a chanter.<br />
<br />
Ssra Temple is supposed to be good xp, although I havent tried it yet myself, and again requires a fairly high level group.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert, up on the mesa pulling Revenants, isnt bad xp either, and is doable at a decent rate at 55/56.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had a friend go from 55 to 60 in no time in Katta.  Like a week or so it seemed like.  At 53 I seemed to be getting decent exp in Fungus Grove while grouped with mostly 56+ people.  Course, the next night it seemed the exp had slowed quite a bit with a slightly different group in the same place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Olavf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The reason Luclin EXP sucks is because the mobs have so many hitpoints you can't kill them fast. it is all part of Verant's new &quot;slow down the play&quot; strategy.  all creatures of the same level everywhere in EQ give the same base exp amount. A level 50 creature in kunark gives the same exp as a level 50 in velious or luclin or the old world. (not counting group or dungeon bonus)<br />
<br />
if you want raw fast exp and dont care about loot, The Hole is by far the best zone in the game.  20% full group bonus and 25% dungeon bonus make leveling almost twice as a fast. Just be sure to have an evacer and an enchanter with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Baz got very good exp in Grimling Forest from 50 to 53, but the loot was the worst I have seen anywhere for mobs of that level.<br />
<br />
Katta/Seru should be better, as I believe they are &quot;city zones&quot; without the racial exp penalties.<br />
<br />
Got excellent exp in Echo at 50 and 51 killing the taskmaster and his skelly slaves.<br />
<br />
quit going to ME - I think I netted close to zero experience there in 24 hours or so of play time, dinged 52 eleven times, nostly there.  My advice - if your group hangs around a zone line, disband!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mushrooms in FG and the mobs in SD die very quickly ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For level 12-25, Paludal Caverns in Luclin is the fastest XP in the game, bar none.<br />
<br />
For level 25-32, Needlites in Echo Caverns are just about as good.<br />
<br />
I have not found a great XP zone for 32+, but FG is decent, and the loot in ME and Akheva makes it worth the trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes...pickup groups in ME...tend to be...bad. Great loot in that zone tho, lots of classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm still looking for this elusive fastest exp to 60 place as well. I'm 58 with epic/jbb. Katta bank stuff dies fast.  I'm in powergaming mode right now and want to be 60 as quickly as possible (Can only play a couple hours a night, but want those to be productive).  I can duo with a 60 rogue who is pretty stacked with equipment.  (epic, Horn of Hsagra, 1250ac)  We do mushrooms in FG a lot, and we massacre those keeping 2 patches down at a time.  Perhaps I've just hit the point where I have to suck it up and accept 1 blue an hour. Chardok has been good solo (haven't done it a ton), Ogres/Trolls in neriak were good for my monk solo.  <br />
<br />
When playing with the rogue at the bank in Katta we were killing 12-15 per round with him assasinating around 25 percent of them. Stuff was just dying. The (Luclin stuff has too many hps is just flat out wrong)  CERTAIN luclin zones/mobs do. I'd never kill in Maidens/etc, except for loot.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to go anywhere. I don't care about loot although plat drops would be nice to keep the porters happy and keep me gaining towards my savings for torpor/malo<br />
<br />
I'm really thinking of going to HS basement but hate the idea of the CR there if something goes wrong.  Karnors basement is decent sometimes but stuff can be light blue there.  Just rambling mostly at this point and pushing to 60. <br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HS basement is easy to CR out of.  Stuff at zone in wont follow you down so just levi/IVU and drop over the ledge.  Best zone ever to grind in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Two spots not mentioned that are very good exp. Akheva Ruins and The Deep. <br />
<br />
Akheva is moderately camped on fennin, maybe one wizard kiting at zone in or a monk soloing and maybe one group in norht hall and one in east. Loot is pretty much just junky centi weapons but the exp is golden. I regularly do this with friends as 5 melee and one healer (me) and we keep entire east room and most statics / pats in both halls up to rockman area clear. Exp is simply nuts. Only maybe in Seru have I seen better exp but that place is a damn deathtrap if you actually go inside and don't camp zoneline.<br />
<br />
The Deep - I have had less exp here but you can camp fiends and shrooms at zoneline. Would reccomend duoing with a melee partner here as shrooms have a ton of hps and are immune to poison so killing is sort of slow. Exp gain is very noticable per kill. And with a single group you can camp deranged underbulk and get the no component lev spell if you are bored.<br />
<br />
Ssra which was already mentioned is really good but you can get yourself in trouble quick with single group if you get multiple elites. I highly reccomend FD puller here !<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert - Plateau kill reavers which a lot are still blue at 60 and seem to be decent exp, maybe since they are casters? The red aliens are a pain in the ass since they have that freaky 200+ dd proc that can sometimes proc 3-4 times in a row. Would reccomend root and rot on these, they can be pretty resistant too.<br />
<br />
ME and The Grey - Poopy exp, trains, and the chance for a few nice rare drops (15 ac 20 wis gloves come to mind).<br />
<br />
<br />
Tenebrous Mountains - vampire fort here is fun, can be done with shaman/melee partner and will be amix of light blue to blue. The named have a ton of hps and are casters but seem to drop blue diamonds very frequently as well as a few decent items. finding a good pull spot outside castle is essential as the pathing here is beyond bad. You can kind of crawl up and down in castle some once it gets broken but there are a few flying pats with fairly fast respawn so if duoing I'd reccmoned pulling to left or right of castle zone where wolves/bats do not path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I love Luclin.  Grey, FG, SD all have very fast exp.  Where did you hunt in The Grey?  I usually try to kill 2 at a time, letting 1 rot while tanking the other with pet.  <br />
<br />
Best exp I've found in the game is in FG...I wouldn't be surprised to find it nerfed one day.  Getting crowded there now though...becomeing the next stop after VL :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We did one of the caller quests the other night in FG, was a blast and great exp.<br />
<br />
Got a few good drops as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The big blow to the Grey wasn't really the beefing up of the MOBs or the additions of the magic-immune rockfiends. It was the reduction of the ZEM to 0.65 . That's just as low or lower than even the Dreadland ZEM, I think which is abysmal.<br />
<br />
It used to be much better, given it was an 'no-breathing' zone.<br />
<br />
The day they nerf FG is the day they get smart and give a mana pool to the 'shrooms and add a mana cost to their stuns and slows. Until then, the 'shrooms will still be ridiculously easy for their level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">try 60bard/shm in fg, oh, and make sure you have all the shrooms :p <br />
(bard ae songs+slows+epic+the occasional torpor+constant 6-7 shrooms)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I always like the Hole for good experience (did I just write that?).  Big exp bonus, stuff dies fast and it's a good place to farm iron oxides for our guild potter.<br />
<br />
The only problem with the Hole is the getting out part.  I'll never understand why Verant makes zones that are hard to get out of, and then expects people to go there to exp!<br />
<br />
A porter or tanks with gate potions are a must here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree that the Hole is great exp and I too cant understand why they made it like that. Its a huge zone that could handle many many players and they WOULD come if it was easier to get in/out. As it is now most of it goes to waste.<br />
<br />
On the topic of Luclin exp - FG is good, Scarlet is good in places, ME toilers are good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">slightly off topic (sorry)<br />
<br />
having only recently found out that cities dont carry the racial penalty[2 quick lvls in hhkeep followed]<br />
<br />
i was wondering does COM follow this rule?? as tanks can be bound there is it a city?<br />
<br />
in wich case (its an outdoor zone) u can use a horse there.<br />
<br />
ok as AB leading female ogre shaman, i suppose i ought to go to 60, even tho i am also leveling up a vashir twink: ogre shaman kills dorfs in vel for money, where as my katt is gonna be on cov faction so i can get SS mq from the guild bank, and go on tov raids-  being KOS to cov with my ogre, the guild has sugested i dont join them in tov :(<br />
<br />
comments....?<br />
<br />
ps   being the ONLY female shammy post 50 on my server, i have not seen ANY vel chain helms for female ogres.<br />
I am dying to see a what they look like....i assume they are NOT the same as the male ogre helms???<br />
<br />
erm... are there 3 diferent versions? dorf  giant SS  helms?  for ogres, or did lazy verant give em all same graphic?<br />
<br />
btw a GREAT look for ogre shamns is the new Engraved Royal velium field plate...its dark blue, and looks like ur wearing a cobalt bp !<br />
twining this with the 2hb from vel that looks like an axe  keeps the nuubs at bay while selling in the tunnel :)</div></div><hr />
