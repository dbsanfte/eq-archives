<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering if the people who had donated to keep the site ad-free for 6 months, back in November, would be getting part of their donations back now?  Since the banners are up, that means IGE/Yantis is now paying the server costs, right?<br />
<br />
I couldn't donate this drive and at the time, I was already donating my time as a moderator and the keeper of the website.  So perhaps you have already made arrangements back with the donors, just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh, jeez!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">this is a good topic to bring up. i'm not one to ask for my donation back. i figure the money i donated (which i will never do again) was used justifiably to keep this site and our community alive. <br />
<br />
down with the &quot;Deliver Platinum&quot; Banners. <br />
fact: smut banners make more money and aren't nearly as offensive =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think its wise to consider that it does actualy cost cash to keep this site going and those donations went to do just that. <br />

No offense Hen, this isnt directed at you, but asking for your donation back is nothing but a insult unless it was a absorbent amount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I simply asked if people were getting their donations back, since they are no longer needed to keep the site running, now that the IGE banners are up.  Perhaps that answer is yes, perhaps it is no.  I didn't ask for anything back, did I?  As I said, I did not donate this donation drive.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the negative rep bumps folks, much love.  Sorry you find my question so offensive.</div></div><hr />

Like i said, i wasnt directing my reply at you specificly, cause i know you didnt ask for anything back. <br />
<br />
As far as anyone giving you negitive rep points cause of this post, i have 2 things to say.<br />
<br />
#1 You a moron for giving Hen neg rep points and you obvious havent a clue about who she is and what she has done here<br />
<br />
#2 Do we all see how stupid the rep system is?<br />

Peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, I feel betrayed. I trusted Sunmoon enough to give him money because he said he was going to use it to support the site for 6 months without ads. I believed in that cause.<br />
<br />
I hate IGE, I hate the idea of the site being supported by a company like that, but I've been pretty neutral on the boards, because I realized the donation drives were stressful and this was an alternative to subscriber donations. I also really didn't mind the idea of Sunmoon making an extra profit for maintaining the sites and dealing with the stress for so long.<br />
<br />
I honestly didn't think the ads would appear until they were NEEDED to pay for the site. The donation drive was complete 11-21, the site is paid for until May. The money won't be refunded to Sunmoon by the hosting company so I am really upset that half the money that was donated by subscribers was basically thrown away. $900.00... POOOF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think this was a matter of awkward timing.<br />
<br />
Donation drive is completed and the pieces are set for the boards to function as normal.  Then the wild card suddenly comes in -- IGE.<br />
They offer Sunmoon a deal he feels is right and he accepts it.<br />
<br />
While I cannot speak for Sunmoon, of course, I think where we stand now is: the donations were applied and the deed is done.  I'm not sure if Sunmoon even could refund the money due to legal reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If he uses the donation money for the site (server upgrades, fees, whatever) then the money that was donated is still being used in good faith.<br />
<br />
However, asking if  donations will be refunded, (especially publicly) is in poor taste.  If it was something you wanted to know, it was better done in a PM.<br />
<br />
If you didn't donate, why even bring it up in a public post anyway?  Any intelligent person would know what to expect with the question.  So innocent or not, it opened a door many were wondering about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The money won't be refunded to Sunmoon by the hosting company so I am really upset that half the money that was donated by subscribers was basically thrown away. $900.00... POOOF.<br />
<br />
So who gets how much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think publically asking for your donation back is a little tasteless, but I think a private PM would be completely justified in this situation.  People donated under the impression that their donations would keep this board add-free until May, and that end of the deal wasn't kept.  Not only is there now an annoying banner, it is for a company which most people are at best apprehensive towards, and quite a few vehemently hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm not saying I necessarily want a refund, I just hate all our money got wasted.<br />
<br />
He could tell IGE to go away until May.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Morrighan-VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">But it didn't get wasted!<br />
I'm sure Sunmoon bought some beer with it. Or maybe some more jewellery for his SO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Artebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, here's something to consider:<br />
<br />
IGE is paying Sunmoon for advertising on these boards. The amount he receives from them is enough to pay for the operating expenses of the boards, plus some profit for him. In theory, the money he gets for the operating expenses, he would have to simply pay out to the ISP. However, since the donation drive covered those costs through May, it means that he's able to pocket that money for the next few months. Looked at it another way, he is pocketing the money that the donors gave.<br />
<br />
So yes, he should have the money somewhere to refund, or at least be receiving it over the next few months.<br />
<br />
Now, this community (and the ranger boards) can decide that you don't care if Sunmoon keeps the money that was donated to pay for the costs of running this board. Or that money could be used to pay for other things to benefit the communities, maybe server upgrades or whatever else. Or that money could be refunded. The decision as to what happens to that money is between Sunmoon and the communities. However, Henora has a valid point in bringing this to everyone's attention; it would be dishonest of Sunmoon to not acknowledge what's going on here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sometimes business deals can't and won't &quot;just go away&quot; until you're ready for them. You have to strike when the iron is hot.<br />
<br />
Anyone who says they would have done differently, you're either kidding yourselves, or don't understand how 'wheelin-n-dealin' is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">look at it as a bonus for sunmoon for having provided this wonderful service to the ranger and shaman community over the years.<br />
<br />
If it werent for the fact that ige aquired yantis no one would probably care.  I have to give sunmoon the benefit for the doubt that he did not know about this aquisition.  <br />
<br />
For all i know Sun could have just sold the whole site to ige and make alot more money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Easy solution to IGE ads...<br />
<br />
www.mozilla.org (Download)<br />
adblock.mozdev.org (Download)<br />
Right-click Image, click &quot;AdBlock Image&quot;, click &quot;OK&quot; a few times and *POOF* ... all gone. No more disrespectful companies.<br />
<br />
While I realize hosting costs aren't cheap and even my own funds are too low to donate even $1 to anything at this point in time, I refuse to see or even support any company that violates the copyrights of another to make a buck.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;ad free for 6 months for all donators&quot; in November, didn't have the funds then, don't have 'em now, but if I did and suddenly, 2 months later... here's ads, I'd be rightfully irate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">its not about getting rid of the adds, its that these people were LIED to, extracted for money, and then Sunmoon's end of the contract was instantly broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">its not about getting rid of the adds, its that these people were LIED to, extracted for money, and then Sunmoon's end of the contract was instantly broken.<br />
<br />
 Whew, that's a wee bit melodramatic, isn't it?  When the donation drive was taking place the IGE deal wasn't even on the table.  Nobody was lied to as far as I can tell.  The circumstances of class-centered boards changed with the sale of EQdruid and EQbeastlord and Sunmoon took advantage of the situation, obstesibly to provide a better service to us, the shaman and ranger communities.  While it may have been more &quot;tasteful&quot; to wait until May to begin the advertising, we also don't know the nature of the contract between IGE and Sunmoon.  Perhaps, as Val implied, this was the only time the opportunity was available; the advertisements needed to begin immidiately in order to finalize the deal.  Who knows.  Moreover, we don't even know whats become of the donations.  Maybe they've gone into server upgrades, perhaps they're going to the upkeep of the site until May and Sunmoon is making some profit from the advertising until then. (which seems more than fair to me, given the amount of time, money and effort he's put in to the thankless job of keeping these two boards functioning.)  Until we have all the information, we really are in no position to pass judgement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">IGE LOL<br />
<br />
You would think that 10,000 cash for a board would be x14 = 140,000 vs 10,000,000.<br />
<br />
The people who owned the boards got suckered, they should of pushed for 100,000 K.  I bet they would of got that.<br />
<br />
Go Go Sellout, glad I dont buy virtual plat like a sucker.<br />
<br />
And to think, I was going to donate cash to my favorite board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Henora has been a long time supporter of this board. Her wisdom and input have been valuable time and time again. She has given her time here as a moderator for free.<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether or not you agree with her point of view, and regardless of what you think of both her and Sunmoon's actions, please keep in mind that Henora has earned the right to be treated with respect. <br />
<br />
Personally, I wouldn't give a flying fornicate at a rolling donut if sunmoon chose to advertise porn or cheap chem &amp; bio weapons. <br />
<br />
I just don't click on the ad. <br />
<br />
I think that Henora's question was a valid one. Although I would have used PM or perhaps moderator's forum, I am sure Henora was aware of these options and chose to go public.<br />
<br />
Personally, insofar as I know, I think that although previous donations have been spent on actual running costs, and have never made allowances for Sunmoon's time and effort. Whether or not Sunmoon deserves to keep the money for doing what needed to be done to provide this service over so many years, well, I guess that is your call....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sunmoon isn't keeping our donation money, it was already paid to the hosting site to maintain Interealms for 6 months.

I paid my money for an ad free site for 6 months, that's what I want to see. It was my respect for Sunmoon and his disdain for Yantis-like companies that made me trust him enough to send real life dollars his way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
494 x 197 isnt that big,<br />
<br />
I can't comment on the other stuff cause I never donated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">While Henora may have put a lot of time and effort into modding this site, she quit being a mod and I beleive over this issue.  I saw this public question as another way to push her agenda regarding this issue, since she didn't even donate herself.<br />
<br />
My thoughts on this:<br />
<br />
Sunmoon was offer to sell the whole site.  He didn't.  <br />
<br />
Sunmoon ASKED the community before accepting the offered advertisements and money.  He was forthright even telling us that it was IGE before accepting the offer.<br />
<br />
I do not recall anyone making the stipulation that the adds should not go live until May when Sunmoon approached us all.  As a matter of fact, many people told Sunmoon in that thread that he deserved to make some profit after all this time.<br />
<br />
When Sunmoon started this board, he did not do it to make money.  For a long time he has had to BEG for help to maintain the site.  He could have just cashed in.  He chose not to.<br />
<br />
Thank you Sunmoon for respecting us as a community enough to be honest and forthright with us, you didn't have to consult us, but you chose to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">&quot;Nobody was lied to as far as I can tell&quot;<br />
<br />
Sunmoon told people that if they gave him money in the donation drive, the Crucible would be ad-free for six months.  It's been less than six months, and we have ads.  How is that not lying.<br />
<br />
Sunmoon has a moral obligation to return at least half (since its been about three months since the donation drive, I think) of the money to the people who donated it.  This should not be too difficult as he almost certainly has records of the donations, if only for tax purposes.  If Sunmoon doesn't return the money he is taking advantage of the people who most supported the Crucible (well, besides the moderators that is).  And that's pretty low.  However, I hope Sunmoon will do the right thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm sorry you think I have a hidden nefarious agenda here.  :(<br />
<br />
Regarding my position as moderator, I respectfully disagreed with the decision that was made and so I stepped down.  End of story, there was no campaigning on my end.  Everything I said to Sunmoon on the subject can be seen on the thread he posted asking for feedback, I believe I wrote one sentence.  There was no seperate discussion for the mods than there was for the regular users.  <br />
<br />
My only purpose in posting was to ask if the money was going to be refunded to the donors.  You have no idea whether or not I tried to contact Sunmoon privately or not.  The fact is, it has never been a private matter what the donations have been used for in the past.  Several people asked me about this issue and I told them, rightly, that I didn't know anymore about it than they did.  So if others want to know, why not answer it all in one place?  I have never commented on what Sunmoon does or does not deserve as a reward or payment for running the servers and I am not commenting on it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Sunmoon has donated considerable time, effort and dealt with various feeble attempts at strikes at his integrity, character and honesty over the years. He has dealt with the pissing and moaning here and at the Glade, and the only thing he has asked from us is a donation from us to help maintain board costs.<br />
Yes he did a post asking for donations to help by his fiance an engagement ring, and to be honest I didnt see anything wrong with it then and dont now.<br />
The bottom line is that yes he promised not to have banners after the drive, but I am betting that IGE's offer was time limited and that he had to make a decision fast or it would be withdrawn.<br />
The money was donated in good faith, and in that good faith he used it as promised; now the server hosst wont give him a refund, nor do I expect him to offer it.<br />
Bottom line: dont donate something if you ever want it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Sunmoon isn't keeping our donation money, it was already paid to the hosting site to maintain Interealms for 6 months.

I paid my money for an ad free site for 6 months, that's what I want to see. It was my respect for Sunmoon and his disdain for Yantis-like companies that made me trust him enough to send real life dollars his way.<br />
<br />
You have to realize it is the same money. You say that the money went towards paying for the bandwidth. Of course it did. Now what about the revenue from the adds? He has payed for the message boards until May with our donations. That means he gets two and a half months of revenue from the adds that does NOT need to be spent to pay for the website - let me rephrase that, the money is going into HIS pocket.<br />
<br />
Your donations went into his pocket. Not directly, but instead by totally paying for a site that is making revenue off of advertisements. Can he get a refund from the provider? of course not. Could he use the money generated from advertisements on the site the VIEWERS are paying for to refund donations? Of course yes. Is he? No.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I didn't donate, I would be REALLY pissed off right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">All that comes to my mind:<br />
<br />
Welcome to the real world, folks. If you are so offended with Sunmoon making some money out of the deal, stay away.<br />
Your complains sound much like the people asking SoE to repay their monthly fee when server are brought down for patches. Shush.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The people who accept crap like this and say, 'that's just how it is in the world nowadays' are the very people that are responsible for letting the world get to be this way.  <br />
<br />
It was wrong of Sunmoon to accept money/ads from IGE before honoring his end of the deal when he was soliciting donation.  You can try to explain how Sunmoon deserves this or that for all his hard work, but it's completely irrelevant.  We were asked to donate to KEEP THE BOARDS AD FREE and we did and covered 6 months of costs.  <br />
<br />
I'll give Sunmoon the benefit of the doubt and say he's using any cash he gets from IGE to upgrade the sites.  new versions of software, faster server, whatever...  It STILL doesn't matter.  People donated money specifically because they wanted to support their community and keep it ad free.  <br />
<br />
I don't see any refunds as likely or feasible really.  I can understand Sunmoon taking the bait with IGE even, although I disagree with it.  What I can't understand is why he didn't at least make sure to honor his end of the bargain with the people who made this community what it is. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I wonder what sunmoon is buying with the money he gets from IGE but isn't using for bandwidth costs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">On a side note. I dont recall many people objecting to the banner when Sunmoon told us about it. I remember 2 or 3 people strongly objecting to it, but for the most part we all kinda shruged and said &quot;whatever&quot;. We all said we would like there to be no banner, but if there must then we would support any choice he makes.  Where is the support now?<br />
<br />
<br />
I stand by my choice. I dont like the banner, but i know what it means to the webmaster of this site. Its not so he can make money off our traffic, its to pay for the webhosting. I would though ask Sunmoon one question.... How about considering another banner ? It doesnt have to be part of EQ to go up there, there has to be something else you can put up there and that we can just randomly click on so you make enough cash to run the site.<br />
<br />
Is that possible Sunmoon ?</div></div><hr />

Erm, just leave then T'harkis. I don't understand why all of you &quot;leavers&quot; feel the need to post such dramatic exits. This place was free, it is still free, you come here by free will, and you leave when you want. You can't get much better than that.<br />

We have also has this big push for improvements to the Shaman class and I think it's valid that the IGE banner is hurting our reputation as being a legitimit forum.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Making comments about Henora's not donating this time around is laughable and pathetic - considering it would be a WHOLE lot easier for me to shell out a few bucks than to put in the kind of time required to moderate a forum with this much traffic.  Unless you've ever moderated a forum of a couple hundred members or more ... you have NO idea.<br />
<br />
And for those who did shell out a few bucks - and now think they have some kind of vote about what goes on around here... When did Sunmoon declare this a democracy?  He asked for input about the ad (was that a mistake, in hindsight?).  Are all of you people standing on your soapboxes and screaming at the top of your lungs of the opinion that there should never be such a thing as a divorce?  I mean, you SAID &quot;till death do us part&quot; - you should OBVIOUSLY stand by that.  Oh, things change, you say?  Stuff happens.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, kids, you say things FULLY INTENDING do to what you've said.  Then, somewhere down the road, things change.  And the people around you can be mature about it, or they can freak out and spaz like a bunch of 7 year olds who missed their Ritalin for the day.<br />
<br />
Yes, probably Sunmoon should come out and say some thing or another.  Of course, I don't know if *I* would come out into this den of vipers and say ANYTHING until things got calmer.  (Kudos to those who managed to post something reasonable, whether it was indifference to the idea or the desire for an explanation)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quite simply, I have always paid the site in 6 month blocks. It allowed me to get a better price for the server. I contacted the provider and asked if I could get a partial refund if I moved the server before my six month period and they flatly said no, that was part of the contract.<br />
<br />
Even if I could get the money back, who would I give it to? How do I determine which or how much of the 170+ people get a specific 45.5% of the donation back.<br />

To do so is, I feel, unrealistic. I'm very sorry one or two of you want it back, but there isn't anything I can do about it at this point.</div></div><hr />

This is an excellent page, it isn't cheap to keep it up, if that little banner up there pays for it then so be it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Henora, I don't think that you have any hidden agenda.  I think that you have a very OPEN opinion on the subject, and that this is just another part of that opinion, since quite honestly as you have admitted this doesn't actually effect you personally.<br />
<br />
That doesn't diminish the amount of time that you put into moderating this site, it just means that you didn't donate and the refunding of money does not effect you either way.<br />
<br />
I do think you have a strong bias when it comes to the subject of the ads and this site (and having a bias doesn't always have to be bad, I personally have a bias against convicted murderers, that doesn't mean it is a bad bias).<br />
<br />
IF Sunmoon were going to be giving money back and IF it were possible to do so, does anyone honestly think that THIS thread was going to accomplish it?<br />
<br />
To me, and this is my opinion, it is an attempt to again voice peoples discomfort with the ads in another way, and to make it uncomfortable for Sunmoon.  If that was not the intent, then that was the way I, a neutral party, with very neutral feelings about subject saw it.  <br />
<br />
I didn't even notice the adds until it was pointed out, since I log in, hit the posts since my last vist button, and ignore the rest of the site.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>michael strong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">While Henora may have put a lot of time and effort into modding this site, she quit being a mod and I beleive over this issue.  I saw this public question as another way to push her agenda regarding this issue, since she didn't even donate herself.<br />
<br />
My thoughts on this:<br />
<br />
Sunmoon was offer to sell the whole site.  He didn't.  <br />
<br />
Sunmoon ASKED the community before accepting the offered advertisements and money.  He was forthright even telling us that it was IGE before accepting the offer.<br />
<br />
I do not recall anyone making the stipulation that the adds should not go live until May when Sunmoon approached us all.  As a matter of fact, many people told Sunmoon in that thread that he deserved to make some profit after all this time.<br />
<br />
When Sunmoon started this board, he did not do it to make money.  For a long time he has had to BEG for help to maintain the site.  He could have just cashed in.  He chose not to.<br />
<br />
Thank you Sunmoon for respecting us as a community enough to be honest and forthright with us, you didn't have to consult us, but you chose to.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">For those who donated, thank you.  I didn't donate.  Nor have I ever donated to this site.  I have donated to Graffe's as my main is a wizard.  Graffe's turned IGE down cold, which makes me proud to be a supporter of the wizard community.  As to the refund, it is a totally legitimate question.  Sunmoon has addressed it the only way he can, and that's that.  I view the entire ordeal as irresponsible.  Not necessarily deceitful, but before he accepted IGE's offer, he knew he had roughly 3 months left on his obligation to the community.</div></div><hr />

And, to be honest, sometimes I do go to supersales - because it (sickly) amuses me to see how much cash fools will pay for plats.<br />
<br />
I don't really understand the point of this thread...if the issue has already come up and/or been dealt with in PMs, what's the point of bringing up an issue that has no solution?  If the money has been spent and can't be refunded it surely can't be returned to the donors, eh?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Thorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Hey Valgoth, you are quite wrong. I in fact DO know how business works. I also would not have taken the deal as it stood at the time.<br />
<br />
More over I dare say there is possible legal ramifications from his actions. He asked that people donate to help keep the site add free for X period of time if a specific goal was met this would come to pass. Under the pretext that this person was in FACT going to be true to his word people donated money to him. There may be cause to argue that he took money under false pretense, and that he is liable for the difference.<br />
<br />
He could have brokered a deal with IGE and stated he was obligated to keep the site add free until such and such a date and after that time the new adds would be added to the site. The deal could have been struck well before the date and waited until such date to begin displaying the adds.<br />
<br />
Please do not tell me that anyone who says they would not have done the same does not know how business works. This is how business is conducted if your are self serving, and uncaring about outstanding obligations. If you lack the morality to be a man/woman of your word you make one deal, only to jump in bed with the next person who offers a better one. Is business done this way in American and the world? Certainly. But don't tell me that because I don't do business this way I am ignorant.<br />
<br />
Personally I think it was sleazy, and it was low. It was self serving and nothing more. I personally would have closed my doors before I would ever sell out people who willingly donated their earned money to me because they WANTED to help me out.<br />
<br />
There were a number of options here,  the path that was taken was the wrong one in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

I am sad to say that I feel like this site is now a dead man walking. When IGE dries up and blows away, or simply pulls support, what are the chances people are going to donate in the future? Slim is my guess.<br />
<br />
I totally understand Sunmoon's reasons but I feel that once you open the door, even a crack, the damage is done.<br />
<br />
I think the soul and integrity of the board has been compromised. SoE will never deal with us the same way again (not like it ever mattered some might say). I also know bandwidth doesn't grow on trees.<br />

What I do personally find wrong is the fact we still had 2 or 3 months left from the donation drive where we were promised this would keep the site ad free for 6 months.<br />
To all you who are knocking people who are complaining/quitting because of  the IGE ads will you please ****.Wasnt long ago on this very site that there was countless posts about the cleric/chanter combo in Seb on all servers and how bad they were for the game etc.<br />
Its companys like IGE etc that causes this to happen just remember that.<br />
Leave Henora alone she did what she thought was right and she has done more in the past for this site than most of you on here ever will.<br />
Also having IGE advertising here WILL NOT stop Sony from looking at these boards they may well use it as an excuse to ignore these boards but hey up until now theyve pretty much let these companies do what they want.<br />

<br />
I believe that Sunmoon should have made at least an announcement as to what was going to happen, as we are a close community and we do care about our site. <br />
<br />
I do not agree with condeming sunmoon for this error for more than just one reason. Look at it like this...Sunmoon could have gone the way of many other EQ class boards and just handed everything over to one of the most hated people in EQ, but didn't. Sunmoon is still in control and adds value to this site. The banner displayed is a relatively small one that stays at the top of the page and doesn't interfere with the site except to remind us that Mr. plat is out there.<br />
<br />
The money made from the add will benefit us in many ways to come, I'm sure. As a matter of fact, I'm thinking of writing a scipt to have it hit that add several thousand time a day from a whole scope of IP's provided there is a per click pay off(working for an ISP has it's advantages). I kind of think it is ironic that we can utilize that little banner to fund our site and make it better and make IGE's ill gotten gains support something actually good for the game whether he likes it or not.<br />
<br />
So, you might not want to strike out against sunmoon so quickly and he has given you an opportunity to increase the value of the site and take a stab at IGE at the same time.<br />
<br />
If you just can't handle the little add up there, you could always block the ige.com domain from your browser and never think of it again.<br />

He is talking about the horrilbe negative attitude that has taken control of this board.  We shaman have become the biggest group of cry babies I have seen on any class board, and I visit almost all of them (due to my 6 alts).  <br />
<br />
Grow up people.  I don't know if it is due to frustration because of the perceived neglect of the Shaman class by SOE, or if people are just burned out and looking to rant, but the negative treads have overcome the positive, informative ones by a huge margin.<br />
<br />
Personally, I feel this tread is absurd.  Screw all of you, it's his site, he can do what he wants with it, and if you don't like it, don't come back, period.  I think he handled the issue well, and gave everyone a chance to speak up prior to making his decision.  Your donation was voluntary, and no contract, implied or otherwise, exists because of the donation.  You paid it and you get access to the site, end or story.  So please, just let it go.  If you are that unhappy, then start your own, player driven site and let's see if you last one week as the moderator.<br />
<br />
Can we please get past the whining about GoD, an expansion that is not even live yet, and all whining in general, and get back to addressing issues and topics which will make us better players and more of an asset to the EQ community.  The biggest problem with Shaman (and all classes) are the piss poor ones that are currently playing that have no clue on how to play their class and give us all a bad name.  That hurts us much more than the lack of any heal or dd.  Let's do something to fix that problem by keeping this site positive and informative.<br />
