Need info on how to improve my damage with my bow.<br />
Do I need to increase my dex? I’m using the trueshot and I know a better bow would be nice. But I only do damage of 20 to 30 and crit of 44 and 5?(buffed). Does not matter what arrows, cheap or the best I can make with fletching of 130. Archery is at 160. And what would be a good way for me to get a better bow. Qwest or buy?  PS: First character so money is hard to get.  Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

As far as getting a better bow, the best way is to buy one, loot one, or have one made.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TheTorpid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I actually purchased a Shissar bow in the bazaar for 100pp.  Stats are like 20/35 0.00wgt,  better stats than the Trueshot.  With my archery skill at 153 and 5dmg +3dmg bonus arrows my normal hits are around 21-25 and crits like 51(once in a blue moon) or so.  Kinda sucks but I'm getting used to the idea that archery can't really but used for actual dmg dealing... untill you get the Trueshot discipline and or tolan's bracer or have a good mage friend that you group with regularly(unlimited arrow supply).  Untill that point its mostly usefull for pulling only... at least for me, I can't carry enough arrows/parts to amount to any really useable dmg, and I have tried.<br />

Of course I'm only up to 35 atm so I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />
