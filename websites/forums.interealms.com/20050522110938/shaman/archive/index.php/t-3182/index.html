<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did my last two fights in CoM on Friday.  <br />
<br />
Was kinda hairy because someone attacked Neh before I turned in the ring.  Mem Blur wasn't working and well a couple people had to gated out.  I was Lucky I had overkill in the zone because we were farming Jade Reavers (got two to drop too).  <br />
<br />
Otherwise was flawless, if a boring last fight, two mage pets =forever when you are doing nothing.  Did die in the encounter but only because Rak was up, and in a bad place when we got there, so I Stood and took the death with Pride.<br />
<br />
Thanks much for the advice found here, it was a priceless resource.</div></div><hr />
