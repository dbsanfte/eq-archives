<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys. Not that I can even go into any of the Planes other than the Plane of Knowledge, being that I'm to low of a level yet, 29 shammy by the way but I've been reading that you have to be at least level 46 to get into them. My question is lets say you get into the Planes as a level 46 and get killed and dropped back to level 45, how would you get back in there to get your body or would you? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can't do much in PoP zones at 46 anyway.  Wait until 50+ at a minimum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont even think about it till 51 with your new slow spell.  And regrowth at 52 makes a big difference as well.  I should only take you a couple weeks to get there if you really push.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once your in the planes you can get any type of res even a revive and get back in. Back in the day we had a lvl 46 rogue that died a few times and ended up at lvl 45 by the end of the raid. He could get resed back in just fine even being 45 after the res. With that said I'd say you'd need at least 51 for our upgraded slow and a reasonable chance to land spells and not get resist.</div></div><hr />
