<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ever notice how all the towns are empty anymore? I was looking up my SK's 52+ spells and noticed that so many spells are in PoK now, that there is no reason to go to home town. I kinda rmemeber back in the day when i would tradeskill or just wanna be home and fish or something, i would go to halas and there would be borthers and sisters running around and it was just fun to be in a place where everybody knows your name ( norm !!)<br />
<br />
Seriously though, i think it would add alot of fun to the game if there were alot more quests from the home cities, things that found in everfrost or permafrost if it was out of halas say. Maybe even they could be made to be a alternative experience resource for people that are just tired of grinding in Pop DL 3.5 for the day or something. I think this is a easy way to not break anything, add culture and depth tot he game, while giving people of all levels to progress through the game in a more fluent way, where EXP gain was not a punishment, but a smooth transition of the game.<br />
<br />
Like i said, its kinda sad to go to halas and be alone. Anyway, just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not certain about this, but I think the tribute system is hometown based.  Should bring more people back &quot;home&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If they would make Plane of Knowledge level restricted like every other plane, that would keep people a little more closer to home. Especially at the lower levels when they need to learn their way around. Nowadays they just click on that stupid book in their newbie ground and go where ever they want and maybe only learn half a dozen zones as they level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as i can see it the hometowns has been dead since release. It was a little bit better back before Luclin came out but just a little.<br />
<br />
Even before expansions there was little enough reason to visit the hometowns since you could manage all your trading to the most crowded zone. Unless you happened to hail from either Neriak or Freeport or Greater Fay that is.<br />
<br />
Still, i would love a game like everquest that took hometowns more seriously.<br />
<br />
Are there any MMORPGs out today that do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Enough about the home towns, yer making us Trolls jealous.  Curse those damn frogs!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they want to make home towns busy places they have to enforce racial differences and not have central meet up locations, or put in new areas. You would have to make everyone commute to thier home town to do any tradeskilling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Certain cities are better for certain TS's (Halas and brewing comes to mind), but....<br />
<br />
1) The Trolls need their own place. Heck give them the Outpost in the OT - the prices are outrageous there anyway - those DE's need sum &quot;Barshin !! &quot; <br />
<br />
2) Quests (Hometown) similar to the 10th Coldain Ring only with penalties if you screw up. Not that say Neriak shuts down for 2 hours - but that Neriak shuts down until somebody gets the thing RIGHT. Of course you would have to have good faction to start it (The mini-war) in the first place.<br />
<br />
3) Mini-wars where PVP is involved (On Blue servers) for a very short amount of time. Say for example the Ogres decide they want Rivervale (Can't imagine why - maybe to eat the Asslings) - well the battle in Kith is PvP enabled (All normal Kith MOBs are despawned) and people can help on either side as they see fit. <br />
<br />
4) Instanced LDON-type dungeons near / in each city where you can earn faction positive hits for whacking MOBs. (Ini addition to loots and some sort of LDON points). This would REALLY help with the cudgel quests. Say 1 + Faction hit with each Cabilis (or whichever town) faction.  At 50 MOBs a dungeon - it would take 160 Dungeons to get to Ally (iinm) - so not unbalancing and hey - in a sense it's free.</div></div><hr />

Actualy im in high favor of giving trolls a home back. I dont think its right no more to stuff you in with those arrogant DE's. Trolls bring something special to the table if you ask me and they need their own dwelling. Im really suprised they dont have one yet.<br />
<br />
Plus my troll SK is starting to miss home ;)<br />
<br />
After my recent time questing in OT for the hammer, i have to say, the outpost would be a GREAT home town. Its already got a stone, its definetly a evil place, hell it even has a boat, how cool is that? There is definetly something unique and fun about the Outpost in OT, between the undead running around and the good old dragoons partolling the zone, it would be sweet. The only thing it lacks is a newbie area, which i think is a issue. Plus i guess its in kunark which means you need the expansionm to make a troll now, i dont know if SoE would be willing to do that. Most races that exist before luclin are based in norrath. Though i guess since now Kats and Lizzies arent, it might work.<br />
<br />
Anyway, OT gets my Vote, just throw in the rat quest and a few low level mobs just outside by the golem on the skyfire side and it would work kinda well i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm tellin' ya, the trolls are going to take over Freeport. Humans got 2 hometowns - they can spare one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Freeport is to nice and clean, i mean what troll would wanna live there. As far as my SK is concerned, i can tell you he would definetly think the place had 0 character. Though, if they let loose the evil part and dirty the place up, then it might get fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I, for one, would not mind having some old-school pvp with some trolls outside Freeport, preferably both parts in cloth armor and bronze weapons at lvl 9 or something :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe thats how trolls could level up till like 10 or so, they all kill each other lol.  PvP till 10 then move out in the world ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I used to spend probably 2x the time I did in the &quot;world&quot; in Grobb, that was the best city imho, although the hookers in Neriak are pretty interesting too.  I knew that city like the back of my hand. Sure, it wasnt all that big, but it was MY town! I could go there to mess around and knew very few people would bother me. I used to sit on the throne in grobb and tell the younguns I was the king ( and to a level 1, a 55+ Shaman buffing you is King =P ) I would love to get Grobb back, but just a place to call my own would do. Hopefully the spiritstone would go to that new location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hrm, there's a thought.  In EQ2, if I remember all this right - there are only 2 cities, Freeport and Qeynos.  One is good and one is evil.  It's 500 years after EQ1.  It seems like Trolls could easily take Freeport (I can't remember which is evil, but I think it's FP) in preparation for that storyline.<br />
<br />
It seems like the uselessness of hometowns is just one more symptom of the disease that's eaten the character out of EQ.  There used to be a reason to see your hometown, know your way around, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The only brothers and sisters I remember meeting in halas are the lvl 1 beggers.  Toss em some buffs and they find someone else to try to beg plat or items from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah I agree, I'm tired of sleeping on the couch in the Dark Elves basement. Give us our frickin city back.. or better yet.. give us Upper Guk! They kick us out we kick them out!<br />
OT wouldn't really work, as cool as the place is, since if you do any kind of adventuring in Karnor's you screw your faction there, which I found out waaay too late!</div></div><hr />
