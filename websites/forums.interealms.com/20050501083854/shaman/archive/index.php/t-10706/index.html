<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Still at work and can't check this myself, can anyone tell me what the new weight is for the Spiritstones?  Not that it's important but I'm just curious.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since they said more inline, I'd guess it is close to Faithstones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks, just looked up Faithstones and they are .10 wt.  That'd be great if ours go down to that (or even close).  Jumping down from 20wt. to .10 is a huge jump and one in which I will welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they're at 0,1 but....they don't port in same place....ridiculous !!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i heard the troll one port to nek now but do the others as well.  i have the iksar one - now wondering if it still goes to FoB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pulled this off of eqtraders.com:<br />
<br />
- Changed the weights on Spiritstones to be more in line with Faithstones. (Spiritstones were changed from weight 20.0 to weight 0.1 to match the weights on the cleric faithstones. Additionally, ogre and troll shammies, please note that the Spiritstone of Innothule is now Spiritstone of the Banished, and it ports you to Nektulos, not Innothule. We expect to see the storyline explanation for this change &quot;soon&quot;)<br />
<br />
Sounds like the storyline explanation has already been outed by the good folks at shadownight.org (Read bonestomper's thread on Grobb being PK'd)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Damn..<br />
spiritstone for ogres ported me right to a merchant :\<br />
<br />
I don't want to go to neriak.. bastards!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Trolls now start in Neriak Foreign Quarter. Ogres are still in Oggok. Looks like Frogloks overran Grobb and kicked the Trolls out. Ogres need a new spiritstone for themselves now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>camibella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gahhhhhhhhhh wheres mine go! Jeez I need to get off work early this is an emergancy ;)<br />
<br />
Pardon me.. Office manager X I need to go home to check where the port spot of my spirit stone has been relocated to... :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bet someone at sony thought changing the weight on our spirtstone made up for slow mitigation and affliction nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>camibella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So is this what they did?<br />
<br />
Hold a shiny object up in one hand to distract<br />
With the other hand come around the back and SMACK YOU in the HEAD!!!<br />
<br />

<br />
Good gimmick!<br />
<br />
Oh what the hey! WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Shinny Objects! my Spirit Stone weighs less AND I can make a new medicin bag!!! Umm can I stick the new med bag in my charm slot? that would make me happy :) :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh my, use your brain. Port to neriak with stone, zone to Nek Forest, use book to PoK, use book to Feerott, BINGO.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

Oh now look what you've done!<br />
<br />
/wave goodbye to jbb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am an Ogre!  There is no reason I should have to zone 3 times to get home with my Spiritstone when EVERY other stone takes the caster to their home temple.  Zek forbid you don't have PoP and have to trek across Antonica to get back home.<br />
<br />
They finally gave us an Adamantite vendor in Oggok so Ogres dont have to run back and forth to Neriak and now my Spiritstone is a worthless piece of junk.</div></div><hr />
