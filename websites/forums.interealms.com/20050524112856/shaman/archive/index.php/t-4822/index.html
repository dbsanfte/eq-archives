Awhile back a druid friend of mine said that that sit tick med thing is a myth, an illusion on your mana bar, similar to when you have the fake aaryonar AE from being out of LoS but close enough and you appear oom but really have more...<br />
<br />
I asked how he came up with this theory and he said druids had been using something similar to canni dance, but with quad kiting. They attempted to get that sitting meditation tick when kiting around 4 mobs, yet in the end it resulted in casting the same amount of spells as if they had just been running(I am not sure as to how thoroughly they tested it). Well with the new UI in place and the ability to see your mana % figured it might be easier to tell. Anyone heard anything about this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know it used to work as the Druids you spoke to described it, but from what I can tell it is currently possible to run around, jump, turn, etc., catch the med ticks, and see that mana actually put to use when casting spells. What used to happen, I recall, was that you'd see your mana bar go up, but as soon as you cast a spell the bar would drop way down (the mana from medding wasn't really there). I just went in and tested it, though perhaps I wasn't doing it properly, and it appears that you can now move around and med all at once.<br />
<br />
Even before, however, I know that cannidancing did work as long as you just stood straight up, cast Cannibalize, and sat down. If you moved or turned between ticks you lost the med mana.<br />
<br />
Hope that made sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have another question about canni dancing. My shaman gets various results for some reason. Sometimes, I'd get half a blue per canni, sometimes, I get maybe 1/5 a blue. My mana pool did not fluctuate during that time. Note that when I am getting that half a blue, it occurs in a string of cannis. Same with the 1/5 of a blue. Same buffs/equipment on me for both times. Can someone clarify?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
