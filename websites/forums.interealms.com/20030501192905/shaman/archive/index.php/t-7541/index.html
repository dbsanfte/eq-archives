<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yeah, I know...that title makes you just say, &quot;Well, DUH!  Haven't you figured that out yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
I recommend not practicing alchemy if you're doing in hopes of greater potions later.  Alchemy has continuously been a very low priority for Verant.   Unless you really need to make SoW or DS potions for people, the rest are a waste of time and money.  Don't think about shrink and growth potions anymore...you can get something from a tinkerer that do both of those.   Gates?  Get one of those new PoP belts.<br />
<br />
Let's look at the history of alchemy here:<br />
<br />
They swore up and down that alchemy was working in the game, because they'd insta-create a shaman and test it.  It wasn't until later when someone there actually made a some lower level shaman and leveled that character that they found out it really wasn't working.  That tells me NO ONE there was playing a shaman.  Shortly thereafter, the first alchemy went in.<br />
<br />
After some complaints about the way that first round of potions worked, alchemy was revamped.  The first set of alchemy potions was taken out, and it was replace with the second round of potions.<br />
<br />
There were some really big complaints about the replacement potions too.  The majority of potions aren't sellable to people mainly because of the negative effects of them.<br />
<br />
So, Verant kicks in more potions....but they're not NEW potions, they're the OLD first alchemy potions put back into the game.  There are a couple of new potions in there, but nothing all that interesting.<br />
<br />
PoP comes out.  One new item discovered:  Quintessence of Knowledge.  It's a low level item that is needed for a gating belt.  Nothing else has been discovered, unlike the massive amount of new things that were added for the rest of the tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Verant considers this a very low priority.  <br />
<br />
We need to start seeing things like BOOKS in the game that give us a hint of what to do, rather than make people do all two-herb and three-herb combines.<br />
<br />
We need new potions without negative effects, and more interesting effects.<br />
<br />
We need to have better buy back rates.<br />
<br />
We need a reason to skill up to 180.  Gate potions are largely obsolete considering the number of gating items out there.<br />
<br />
For a tradeskill that REQUIRES you get to 60 just to top out at 180, it sure should offer a better pay off than it does.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Ah well....had to vent.  I started a shaman a long time ago because the thought of this tradeskill sounded so great.  I'm bitterly disappointed in how Verant has treated alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Annabrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Join the club, I have invested over 30k Plat to this worthless &quot;Class feature skill&quot; and have been horribly dissapointed. No, disgusted with this Trade skill. We Shamans were given this Class Tradeskill to help with the balance of the Shaman class. PAH! Balance my sweet patootie! Alchemy is a horrible waste of time and money. SoW potions have become so useless to the people running around with all the new movement speed items that they hardly ever sell anymore, and if they do, I usally need to sell them for a 10-20 plat profit only. With the rate I sell them, and the low return I get on them, I only made an 80 plat profit in the bazaar after 11 days of trying to sell the potions. Thats enough to make ONE more potion, but I am still in the hole becuase I have 6 more potions I haven't been able to sell.<br />
<br />
VERANT do something with Alchemy it has the ability to be SO very usefull. You have let down every Shaman that has ever invested money into alchemy. I have spoken with a few shamans that like the way alchemy works, and to these fools, I say &quot;Never invest your money in anything, because you obviously have no eye for value and no mind for utility.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Horen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Man this skill was a kick in the pants....  there in nothing that I want to make any more.  Should have saved all that PP I dumped to get something nice.  <br />
<br />
thx Verent!!!! sow's where to expensive to sell at cost to start with... i'm about sick of this!!<br />
<br />
go enchanters ...that's where the PP is at.  100 per kei with a group cast at 600PP a cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am broken hearted over alchemy, and have not bothered to go above 180. There just doesn't seem to be any reason to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh, there are books for alchemy, Sold in PAINEEL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hm.  I'll have to check out the Paineel alchemy books.  I've pretty well neglected Paineel over the years.<br />
<br />
Ever since I started alchemy, I've considered it an extension to my spell book, albeit an expensive one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I cant remember the exact building, but I know it's the shop that stocks Bread &amp; milk, and go all the way upstairs (my Erudite SK was useful for something after all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You left out the change they made to new Alchemy when they cut the price of herbs in half.  <br />
<br />
Not only were they so out of touch with the value of these potions that they were originally double the current cost, they are STILL of only marginal use even after the price cut.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maybe it is supposed to balance our class by REMOVING the obscene amounts of pp we can generate by soloing those uber plat dropping mobs........<br />
<br />
I now regret ever having wasted any cash in Alchemy.  The only use I have for it is making SoW and Shrink potions for my alt ogre warrior princess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Similar story here,<br />
<br />
Took alchemy to around 80. When I saw it cost me nearly 3k to get from 50-80 skill and then what was available to me for going higher I just gave up.<br />
<br />
I can make SoW, DS, EB, Lev and Shrink potions for my twinks or guildies and 80 skill is as far as I am going until I see some reason for taking it higher.<br />
<br />
I don't even particularly mind the cost of raising skill to 180 (did it with an enchanter and it took me 2 days and 15k to get from 0 to 250 skill) but at least let shaman have something that people want from raising this tradeskill.<br />
<br />
You have to be lvl 60 to get to 180 skill, would it be hugely unbalancing for a person who has to be lvl 60 AND ALSO A GM in a tradeskill be able to sell something other people want and will pay for so as to make a reasonable profit. Enchanters can get to lvl 60 and then make 1000's of pp an hour from selling KEI in the nexus/bazaar.<br />
<br />
I see bakers/potters/tailors/smiths/tinkers GM's raking in money hand-over-fist from their time and effort spent getting to GM. Wowee, as a shaman we can sell SoW potions for 20-30pp profit (for 10 !!!!! - 2-3pp each) plus a few other minor potions people very occasionally want.<br />

<br />
A report from EQ Traders says that Alchemy is &quot;off the table&quot;.   They might adjust some of the negative stats on potions, but otherwise, they're not going to do anything with it.<br />
<br />
What a shame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would love to hear the reasoning behind this statement... Working as intended? Too low a priority? Think it is fine as is? Don't care?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Phace Paintt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Taken from that thread on EQ Traders:<br />
&quot;They said they are looking into removing level cap on alchemy (but probably not poison making).&quot;<br />
<br />
What is the idea behind this?  I see this as hurting the potion sales as anyone with a Level 1 twink could work the skill and make their own potions.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully I am mis-understanding what that statement means.<br />
<br />
Phace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>PolarAxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nope, you're reading that right.  It's exactly what it means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If alchemy was not level based<br />
<br />
I hope what this means (and i think you are misunderstanding it)<br />
is that it will be more like poison making.. where with poison making you cant train it til level 18 or whatever.. but then the skill is based on your level like your other skills like swimming.. so if alchemy was modified to match, then it would go like this-<br />
<br />
Level 24 shaman 0 skill max<br />
level 25 shaman 130 skill max<br />
Level 30 shaman 155 skill max<br />
level 39 shaman 200 skill max<br />
<br />
Then (if it follows poisonmaking, and assuming the trivials were moved around or more items introduced) you wouldnt be able to raise your skill again until 51.. and then at that point it would be 5 pts per level to 60.<br />
<br />
So level 51 shaman 205 max<br />
Level 60 shaman 250 max (and a trophey maybe?? :) )<br />
<br />
I hope thats how they change it.. and not make it like tinkering where you have an innate 50 skill and then at 16 you can raise it to 250</div></div><hr />
