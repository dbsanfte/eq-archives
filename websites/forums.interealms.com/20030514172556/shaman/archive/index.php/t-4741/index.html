<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for some advice from you veteran shaman concerning the path to the King in Old Seb…<br />
<br />
I have a 56 shaman and have been getting some good exp groups in Seb and last night was invited to make a run for the King, a first time for me. Our group eventually consisted of 60 Warrior, 60 Cleric, 60 Rogue, 59 rogue x2, and me. Some folks were having some questions about the ability for us to get to the King without a chanter as it seemed they had doubts about my ability to park the higher end mobs on the way there. Well, it turns out they were right as we had to zone after clashing with the level 56 shrooms near the lower level zone out. I couldn’t get root (level 14 spell) to stick, which helped getting us trained, and was having some problems getting slow to stick and even getting agro at times to pull the mobs away for a park. I eventually got myself out of the group due to the obvious need for a chanter and the fact that I felt I was bringing the group down due to my level and maybe skill. My questions:<br />
<br />
Is it a death trap to make this trip to the King without a chanter? If not, do I need to get a couple more levels under my belt before I can effectively root-park in this situation or do I just suck. Any advice on getting to this camp or in parking higher end mobs would be great. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you had a run o' bad luck.  I single-grouped chanterless once down there at 54.  Others were 54 druid, warlord, assassin, cleric 56, SK 55.  The path to the King was not a problem at all.<br />
<br />
I've never had to fight out, though.  All the groups I've been in have had some form of evac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it could be possible with a bard.  King is preety much a joke now with ssra and CT.  The exp is nothing to brag about at all either.<br />
<br />
I remember a time when king was thought to be near impossible.  Where several groups could go down and fail on it easily.  Hearing &quot; King on CR&quot; was a common thing. /sigh the good ole days.  Back when seb was hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I regularly trio the king camp with a paladin and ranger, so no I don't think enc is REQUIRED. (especially with a clr)</div></div><hr />
