<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Awewa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wanted to be there by your side.<br />
Wanted to open my heart wide.<br />
I wish I was the one you need.<br />
The love inside me that you freed.<br />
<br />
But instead I値l just fade away.<br />
Face to the wind, nothing to say.<br />
<br />
Wanted to be there when you cry.<br />
Wanted to teach you how to fly.<br />
I wish I was the one you need.<br />
Wanted to be the one you breathe.<br />
<br />
But instead I値l just fade away,<br />
And pray for another day.<br />
<br />
Wanted to be there when you call.<br />
Wanted to catch you when you fall<br />
I wish I was the one you need.<br />
Instead of you I壇 let me bleed.<br />
<br />
But instead I値l just fade away,<br />
You always wanted it this way.<br />
<br />
Wanted to be there and make you feel.<br />
To turn your aching heart to steel.<br />
I wish I was the one you need.<br />
On my strength I壇 let you feed.<br />
<br />
But instead I値l just fade away.<br />
In my heart you値l always stay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
full of hate, about to burst,<br />
This world is a cruel and unusual curse.<br />
The preps the nerds and all the rest, <br />
Day after day are put to the test.<br />
Will you pass or will you fail, Just hold on, grip the rail. Sooner or later the sun will have to shine,<br />
Until then, on your fears and faults the devil dines.<br />
He'll drain you of your happiness<br />
And leave you empty and depressed.<br />
I hate you, you hate me reminds me of my family. <br />
One hateful kid will but a gun, take it to school and have some fun.<br />
The lying, hating, cheating and decieving,<br />
No thank you I don't want it, I'll be leaving.<br />
I'm walking thgough that open door,<br />
And forever forgetting this evil horror.<br />
Six feet from freedom of this place,<br />
You see the door, its shutting in you face. <br />
You have failed, you did not pass, <br />
But now the devil can kiss my ass. <br />
I'm tired of his fucking shit, <br />
I'm giving up, this is it. <br />
This will be the last time for everything,<br />
Soon it will be gone, like a dream.<br />
The hate will slowly vanish, <br />
Like a kiss, soft and full of passion.<br />
The last step you walk and breath you take, <br />
Will be far from everything and so close to fake <br />
In a minute it will be gone, you will be gone, No more the devils little pawn. <br />
This is it, you can do it, or maybe you can't. You've decided you want just one more chance.<br />
The hate you had always kept inside, Is now flowing like a powerful tide.<br />
Hate for yourself, for what you have done,<br />
Its too late now, you can not run. <br />
Give in to the pain, it will quickly diminish,It feels like your head is being squashed like spinach.<br />
The last sound you hear, is an evil cackle, <br />
Then you fall, like you've been hit by a full blown tackle.<br />
The job is done and the devil is pleased,for finally at last he has been released. <br />
For so long he's been in you, making you hate,<br />
And like a true blonde would, you took his bait. I have one thing to say,<br />
Try looking at it in a different way.<br />
Now its over, the devil will move on, <br />
The only thing I fear, will I be his next little pawn?</div></div><hr />
