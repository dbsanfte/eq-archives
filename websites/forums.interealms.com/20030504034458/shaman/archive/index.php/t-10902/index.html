<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's a lvl39 spell.  Drops only off one mob (that I know of).  The mob is a serious under-con.<br />
<br />
Is it worth it to pony up and buy it, or just forget it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wouldn't worry about it until you're at the stage where you start taking on Luclin Boss mobs.  By that point you'll be able to solo the Great Saprophyte with ease.</div></div><hr />

No, it's not worth it to camp Remove Curse - it's a fairly rare drop off a slow spawning mob that doesn't do a whole lot for you.<br />
<br />
I've killed the Great Saphrophyte 6 or 7 times, one spell, which I turned into guildfund in hopes that someone would find it useful.  Still don't have it scribed.<br />
<br />
Now about him being an undercon - did I imagine that whole epic rogue thing?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at lvl 60 i tried to duel box him with me and a 60 druid...it was a dumb idea since i could have soloed him with either, which i later did.<br />
<br />
anyway, don't pay for this spell....the camp is easy and personally he has dropped it every kill for me and the others in my guild who actually camped him.  just wait until your a higher lvl (since you wont use it at any lvl below 55 imo).  the spelll is worth getting and you will use it when you start taking down named luclin+ mobs.</div></div><hr />
