<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, there's a dozen great threads on this board on how to spend you AA, but I couldn't find anything on here that discusses the fastest/best/most logical way to just get that damn cool tag next to your name so that you can get a lil respect when LFG.<br />
<br />
If I'm to understand it right:<br />
<br />
Baron = 6 general AA<br />
Venerable = Baron + 12 archtype AA (18 total)<br />
Elder = Venerable + 24 class AA (42 total)<br />
<br />
I have Run 3, Regen 3, MC3, Can5, MGB, for a total of 32<br />
<br />
Now, without spending AAs on Alchemy Mastery and Rabid Bear (which most agree are basically a waste for the raiding/xp grinding shaman), is QB3 the only way for me to get Elder?  Is there any other combination that will be useful and get me to Elder faster?  I don't mind getting QB3, but there were so many other AAs that make more sense to get first, it's just that I'm kinda hung up on having that Elder tag.  Any advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Umm..how long did it take you to think up an excuse to brag to us? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
I don't think he was bragging.  I viewed it as an honest question, as I had a similar dilemna awhile back.  I went SCR1,2,3 &amp; SCRM before getting Elder myself.  The title wasn't that important to me, and I didn't view QB3 as worth the investment.  SCRM was worth it to me, though getting to that point was rather tortuous.  :p <br />
<br />
Your only other choice off the top of my head is investing in QB1, QB2, then Pet Discipline.  I would also put Pet Discipline in the Rabid Bear/ Alchemy Mastery category for (lousy) utility &amp; value.  This would get you there 3 points (I think) faster than using QB3.<br />
<br />
If having &quot;Elder&quot; above your head is that important to you , get QB1, QB2, and then Alchemy Mastery for the fastest route to your last title.  That's the fastest route.  It took me 61 points, and I don't regret waiting.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have I think 66 aa, and am no where near getting the Elder title.  The archetype and pop stuff is just sooo much more useful.  It could be a long long time before I lose the Venerable disease.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm too lazy to brag Csin, I'ld rather be grindin.<br />
<br />
It seems my worst fears are confirmed, I suppose I'm gonna be a quick buffin machine just for vanity's sake.  I agree that there's better AA to make me a well rounded shaman at this point, but I think that it's gonna end up being QB3 next for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would get Elder by SCR3 and SCRM which seams far more usefull then QB3.  The Elder title over the head is kind of nice but having torpor heal 1800 instead of 1200 is nicer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">elder means jack **** when lfg.  people look first by level, whether they know you, and guild. aa title is RARELY even considered. that being said, i have almost 80 aa and no intention of spending points on USELESS SKILLS for my elder title.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">pet mastery is a worth while AA to me... when i use my pet to tank and he dies to Enrage i wish i had that AA.<br />
<br />
alchemy is a waste.... Rabid might be fun on a pvp server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why pushing for Elder?  Might be better off getting QB2, SCR3, then SCM for elder title.  It'd take a while longer...but you'd be more effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Rabid sucks , 5 wasted points IMHO , i dont really notice anything much better then a self buffed/hasteing can do. Seems like the disease proc doesnt even proc that much if at all sometimes. Im really disapointed with this and cant see why anyone would spend points in hasten. I think personaly this is a AA that does need to be worked on slightly. I would like a melee upgrade to us , but i would accept it if RB was just useful. whats wrong with being able to melee increadibly for 3 min every hour , is that really overpowering ?<br />
<br />
Sorry , had to get that off my chest ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm pushing for elder purely for vanity Gwain.  Useless or not, I'll just get QB3 just to make people think that I went and got a gajillion more useful AAs before i went for QB3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is no GOOD way of quickly getting Elder.  However, the shortest path with your current skills that is also the most productive would be:<br />
QB2, Pet hold.  QB3 would require three more points than pet hold, and if you get a Haste IV item, totally unnecessary.  Pet hold, on the other hand, no matter what people may say about it, is useful.  One of those things you won't know how useful it is until you start using it.  Our pet is quite formidable outside of PoP.  If given two weapons, avatar, and SLTW it compares to a lvl 59 necro pet.   Pet hold makes doing stuff solo (with pet) so much easier.  <br />
<br />
OK that's all I got for ya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I find I am typically the only shaman on a raid, and after getting QB2 and a Haste of M item, I discovered I love Quick Buff (and wish I got it sooner).  I don't mind buffing, but it can be a long chore on a full raid.  Shaving almost half the casting time might seem trivial, but it really is very nice.  And 3 second Torpor/Quiescence is just plain heaven.  When I had to bump my Haste of M range item out for maximizing some resists on a raid I immediately noticed the casting difference, and missed it greatly.<br />
<br />
QB = not wasted points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">mm, I got my Elder title finally after almost 90 AA, that is after finish SCRM, I have canni5, GB2,MGB and been waiting long yo done other aa then go SCR and SCRM, who care about elder title</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">QB3 is well worth it, get your 3.0sec topro/qui and title</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going for SCR3 currently, and then SCRM for my Elder title here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well really do what you like. Title is more for fun than anything else, and comes in time (got my title at 100aas...). But dont buy silly things like alchemy crap or rabid bear for sure. Pet hold suck as well. Go for QB and SCRM for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spiritz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Both QB3 and SCRM own.  Anything that lessens the amount of time to cast a spell owns, and SCRM is one of the best AA's I've gotten so late in the life of aa's.  Being able to heal yourself 100% after a can5 with one torpor/Q cast makes it worth it by itself.  Not to mention 9 min FA's etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The BEST way to get elder (even if not the fastest) is to get QB1 and SCRM (which, of course, requires scr3).  Wasting points just to get elder is simply just a waste...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">QB2 and pet hold imho.<br />
SCR is ok, but not worth backtracking over if you are in a hurry to get the title.  Do it later . . . after SCM3, ND3, CA3, etc.  Hell I still haven't done it.  I've only got SCR2, but I find that coupled with my hat gives me an 1800 hp Quiescence pretty much every time.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I thought everybody ran around with /showname 1. I know I do :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm at 45AA<br />
<br />
To get Elder, I'm currently working on SCRM (only at SCR2). I didn't want to gimp it out by getting alchemy mastery. Don't think I'll be getting many other arch abilities after SCRM. (have mgb/can5/qb1) Probably go back working pop abilities.<br />
<br />
I want puppies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am with Genine -<br />
I am always confused when peeps refer to their (or others) last names or titles.  I spent maybe 5 minutes wondering if I would like a last name when I hit 20, then forgot about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would have to suggest QB2 and Pet Discipline.  Anybody who tells you that pet discipline is not useful has not considered the ability in very much detail.  When a mob enrages, you can instantly make your pet stop attacking.  This is great when soloing or when grouping with tanks that do not turn the mob.  In addition, when combined with /pet guard me you can actually control the positioning of the mob during the fight (to avoid adds).  As if that were not enough, you can even use pet discipline to prevent your pet from running around when it gets hit by an AE.  There is really no end to the usefulness of this AA ability.  At 5 points, its a bargain.<br />
<br />
I would avoid QB3 though -- you can get QB2 + a spell haste item to hit the maximum.  I'll get QB3 someday, but for the moment Haste Of Mithaniel is more than good enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm doing MGB, SCRM, Canni5, and QB1... that means you need another 12 in SCR3 first, but it still seems pretty cheap for elder title from the rather limited class specific aa we have.  Screw bear and alchemy mastery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I did alchemy 1 for my elder back then, regreted but it only 3 aa anyway.<br />
<br />
I like QB 3 and never regret it, however it created some bug when u canni5 + Q right after, you will get recover time not met often; while u wont see it if you only have QB2 /bonk VI coding.<br />
<br />
and btw my computer suck even I use cable,<br />
to reduce lag in raid /showname 1 is my best friend, who cares what title you have I see everyone as their first name only like the day back in Crushbone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Don't have a haste IV item, but QB3 makes for 3 second torpor and 13 second khura's focusing... they make a significant difference in my game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Having gotten my Elder title not long ago (Canni V + MGB + SCRM + QB1), I can tell you I've been congratulated by guildies a few times, but no one else shows any impression.<br />
<br />
Seeing another person with a class title, I look for their abilities during the group, but I don't have much higher expectations over someone with an archtype title. Play ability matters more, and for all you know they could have 12 or 120 archtype AA points. Would you rather have a competent player with 18 AA, or a dorkwad with 55 AA ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I would rather have a competent player with 55 AA then a dorkwad with 18 AA. ;)<br />
<br />
I also have found that people hardly care what class title you have but I very much like having Elder over my head, and their is no question that my distribution of AA points has greatly improved the power of my character, and his utility in a raid.  I must also say that I still enjoy scaring the clerics in pick up groups with my Can V activations.  I am not sure when this minor amusement will pass but I have found some clerics are so compulsive that even after a carefull explination they are still unable to refrain from healing me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I got elder title at 98aa.  I also have /shown 1 set so I don't see titles anyways.  <br />
<br />
If it makes you feel better go for it.  Kinda petty if you ask me, but a lot of the game is petty anyways.</div></div><hr />
