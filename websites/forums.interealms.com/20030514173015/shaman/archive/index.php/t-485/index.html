<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mjod Eaglehart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
Just wondering if an Ogre can do Lynuga's Gem Quest in the Swamp (for the Hoop, Midnight Mallet, ...)? Or must one be a Troll? I've read contradicting posts elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Mjod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Umelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a few quests for Grobb faction. <br />
<br />
Gather all the fire bettle eyes you can and turn em in to a Troll who makes lights for the guards.<br />
<br />
I dont rember the name so hail the trolls and follow the text. He is off to the right after you zone into grobb, sortta behind the Priest of Discord. <br />
<br />
There is anothe quest for hehe meat. Not to clear on this one but its given out by a cook nead the mass of dwarfs cooking in the middle of a open area.<br />
<br />
Sorry I couldnt be more exact. Hope it helps though.:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mjod Eaglehart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unfortunately there are contridictions out there concerning this quest.<br />
<br />
I think the quest yields the following faction adjustments:<br />
Broken Skull Clan got Better <br />
Shadowknights of Night Keep got worse <br />
DaBashers got worse<br />
<br />
If this is correct, Lynuga is on Broken Skull Clan faction, which is independent from Troll Shaman, Shadowknight, and Warrior guild factions. So even if an Ogre could do Troll newbie quests, I don't think it would help. But thanks for the suggestion.<br />
<br />
If my info is incorrect please let me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how about just make a troll/mule?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My Troll did a lot of the Grobb quests and Lynuga conned dubious to him, yet she still gave him the quest (I think it took about 20 rubies to get the hoop). You should be okay as an Ogre unless you've done tons and tons of the Grobb quests, as I believe you're correct in that she's on Broken Skull Clan faction.<br />
<br />
Best way I found to do this is to find her in the swamp, hail her, bind there, and then run to Grobb to buy a Ruby. Gate back and turn it in, and then run back to Grobb to sell whatever you get and buy another Ruby, until you get the hoop. I calculated that I spent a little over 1kpp for the hoop, which is pretty good (though I know I might just have gotten lucky). Also, if you're adventurous, I'm sure you could attack her and lead her to the Grobb zone line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pulling Lynuga to the Grobb zone might be a bad idea. Broken Skull Clan and Da Bashers are enemies, so the guards might kill her. I have never tried this though.</div></div><hr />
