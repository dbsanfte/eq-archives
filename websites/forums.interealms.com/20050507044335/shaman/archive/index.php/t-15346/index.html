<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kusai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, I got a problem that I have been aware of for about 4 months now, but until recently, it has really gotten on my nerves.  Here is my problem.<br />
<br />
I have a lvl 65 Troll Shaman.  I have problems with him running up cliffs or steep hills.  For example:  In Mons Letalis I would run down one of the little canyons and try to run up on the other side, and I get half way up and I can't move up no more.  I have to wiggle to the left and right and look up and keep on trying and trying to eventually get him up.  Now I have a lvl 65 Monk, using the same computer and same Custom U/I, and he runs up those cliffs or steep hills like he is Carl Lewis in the Olympics.  <br />
<br />
Another example, I was in the Deep and I fell crossing the invisible bridge.  Got rezzed on the bottom, medded up, rez effects gone, and I tried to follow the cleric up the cliff on the other side of the bridge.  The cleric zoomed up with no problems.  I couldn't do it.  I had to kill myself, and have someone move him via corpse run.  I think this is not normal.<br />
<br />
- I am using run mode when I try to go up and also try walk mode.  I look up also to try to get it to work.<br />
<br />
- Kusai's weight is way below his max limit.  for example his weight is at about 68 stones but his max limit is 180 something and if I have a Str Buff on it can be in the 200's<br />
<br />
Also, with the same character, I can cast SOW on him and my group members, and they all run faster then me.  I have no lag.  I just move at a slow rate while running.  <br />
<br />
What can I do to fix this?  Please help me in this matter.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a stoopid SOE programming issue. Just change yourself to a bear and you will be a Carl Lewis on steep hills lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The way the character models are built affects how steep something can be that you can walk up.  Trolls can't walk up super steep stuff.  Dark elves don't have any problem from what I can tell.  Iksars don't either.  Bears don't either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Its a bug that affects all large races.  Shrink or any illusion form (bear, wolf, etc.) should fix it, as will casting levitation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah this is a real hassle when my guild is OTM to ssra.  I was stuck crawling through the canyons and trying to make my way up the slightly less-steep canyon walls, while my guildmates where all blowing past me, running straight up the walls that I myself could not scale.<br />
<br />
Then I bought levitation and my problems were solved.  It's a bug with large race models, appearantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for posting that - when im in Plane of Storms and coming out of the water from the forrest I cannot get out of the stream - the banks are two steep - Never really thought about it til you posted.  And it ticks me off to no end that I can cast sow and im always the slowest person around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I have that problem coming out of the water in POS as well.  Although I have never noticed being consistently slower than others.  Some days my human wife is slower than me, some days faster, who knows why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Same PoS river issue here.  I just started using Levitate/ion there.  Still irritating.<br />
<br />
IIRC, Shrink also let me pop out of the stream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Outdoors, I'm always shrunk to get the flipping horse head out of my way - this definitely solves the climbing issue as handily as bearform.</div></div><hr />

There is a ramp to get up to the top here :)  just fyi hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are missing the point here.  I once fell off the invisible bridge also.  As an ogre, I just couldn't run up the steep cliffside to get to the bottom of the ramp that leads out of the pit.  I also couldn't levitation myself ( damn deep ) and raid force was about to move to burrower.  Once I shrunk myself I had no problems getting to the bottom of the ramp out.<br />
<br />
I would love an AoN for those situations, but unfortunately they are too expensive on PvP servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Least the shaman always has shrink. I 2 box an Ogre warrior and have fallen in the chasm in the Deep with him and couldnt get out. Fall hardly even hurt but there was just no way to climb out, even with all the helpful small folks trying to show me the way. <br />
<br />
Ya really want to try fun enter Nadox from Gunthak at the lava river and swim though the lava. Most folks can then climb up the wall to the top, but not an unshrunk Ogre, and when ya picked up 2 or 3 of them damn elementals on the way cause Invis dropped, and have to try to melee them while swimming under lava its gets real fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've had that lava problem.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to memorize a spell while swimming in LAVA?<br />
<br />
For the longest time I couldn't figure out why everyone but me could get out of the lava.  Eventually I ran back to the zone in, killed every one of the elementals on me, shrank myself, then I was able to get out fine.  What a pain!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">edited NM already said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kusai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Phew, I feel much better now knowing others have had the same problem and using shrink and Bear form help.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.<br />
<br />
Oh by the way, I sent an e-mail to a techrep at Sony, and he or she has a long list of things they want me to send them from my files.  Maybe they can do something.  Or maybe they just blowing smoke up my .......<br />
