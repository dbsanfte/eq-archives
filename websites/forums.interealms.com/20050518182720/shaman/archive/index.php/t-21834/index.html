<br />
 (from the update thread) They are considering adding a whole other line of abilities for clerics, like making them nuke for 6k on undead or stuff or make them turn into a warriortype when fighting undead so that more people will play clerics, but they had no definitive answers for that.<br />
<br />
Finally, it all becomes clear.  A class is BALANCED if an acceptable number of the playerbase plays that class.  Therefore, since everybody and their brother has a 65 shaman PL'er/buffbot, the shaman class will never get a glance from the devs.  Of COURSE we're balanced, there are LOTS of people logging on shaman characters.<br />
<br />
It's never been more clear to me that the only thing that will ever make an impression to these people is the 'end billing' button.  And even then, I wouldn't be surprised if there are more shaman bots at this point than mains, and even that won't make a dent. <br />
<br />
Yep, I'm discouraged and bitter.  Nope, apparently I can't seem to let it go.  Because I would dearly like to log back in and continue tromping through EP's with my guild.  I'd like to tromp through content with my friends.  But I'm just too sick of feeling like dead weight to a raid or a group.  If fast-paced is the name of EQ now, I'd like to be able to do appreciable damage, useful healing, or important buffs/debuffs.  Anything.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to draw attention to the post above, as it was a bit buried in the other thread.  Maybe if everyone cancels their account (or stops playing their shaman) for a month (they don't wipe characters, you know) something will finally happen.  It's a pipe dream, but it's MY pipe dream.</div></div><hr />

That's the problem.  To many peole are seeing this and saying that we are fine.<br />
<br />
In this content we are fine, BUT later in the EP and GoD especially we can't heal.  And still post revamp using a charmed pet in tipt/vxed the mobs die in 20-30 secs so slow doesn't matter that much.<br />
<br />
I've tried to keep a 10K+ hp tank up in vxed, and couldn't do during dps spikes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ahhh Vxed. Basically I slow while the pull is still incoming with Balance and then wait the whole fight for the pooka to break charm. Is throwing in a Velium Strike worth it? No. The fight isnt long enough for one nuke for minimal damage to do anything worthwhile. All I am in vxed is Malosinia for a pooka pet. Which class is overbalanced ... Shaman or Enchanter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If the problem is that they judge balance issues by the number of people playing a particular class than we probably do look balnaced to them. Problem is is that most shaman these days are alts (ok mine is, but i understand whats wrong with the class, and in terms of involvement with the community I could care less about the ranger boards/issues) and all they do is slow/debuff. I need my shaman to heal, slow, dps and buff, and hes lacking in all areas in my opinion, either in speed, efficiency or production. I can't kill fast enough, med fast enough, buff hps enough, slow fast enough etc.</div></div><hr />

  Your kidding right, about slow doesn't matter that much?  In a 30 Sec fight when it only takes 1.5 secs for you to cast Balance, you can mitigate damn near half the dmg.  This makes a happy tank AND a happy cleric.  I have been spot healer in GoD, but even if we get a crit heal for 2600 thats doing only enough to keep up with dmg.  I LOVE playing my shaman and my pally.  The real problem is ppl getting bored then complaining about how it sucks and not doing something within their own means to make it better.  Control what you can control and don't worry bout the rest.  If you are sad or unhappy playing your shaman/shaman alt make another charecter and see if they are fun.  Heck my pally is only lvl 20 But at lvl 5 he had his Soulfire and Ghoulbane, courtesy of My Shammy.  I am gonna use him as what I like to call a Trophey Alt  He will have his epic at 46 and that is where he will stay.</div></div><hr />

I could not agree more.  While we're &quot;happy&quot; for what we can do for the groups in GoD, I have this feeling that the group's impression would be different... &quot;We could do more if we had a chanter/cleric instead&quot;...<br />

<br />
Of course your right Bludletters the other 500 people posting here are wrong.  The reason for so many alts was prior to PoP Shaman were a pretty solid solo class.  After PoP we started seeing the balancing issues and alot of the shaman have left that doesn't mean they deleted there character just means they don't use them other than to buff and powerlevel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where are you killing in GoD anyway?  In KodTaz even my crit heals are a joke that doesn't do diddly.  Not to mention the mobs that don't mitigate my slow go down so fast to the other classes' DPS that I might as well not slow them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Reason the Shaman class will not improve?<br />
<br />
Ahh, let's go WAAAAAY back in time, say 1999-2000 era.  That lil thing called &quot;Alchemy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remember how it was &quot;working as intended&quot;? Remember how for months Verant (remember I said WAAY back) said all was good? (Abashi was PR dude back then).<br />
<br />
Finally like the Pentagon Papers, the illusion was broken when after MONTHS of comprehensive testing, Verant admitted that Alchemy was broken. (I believe ShowEQ aided in unconvering the conspiracy)<br />
<br />
Since then Shaman have been on the short end of the stick expansion after expansion.  For some reason Shaman are not well liked or well thought of. (Witness Brenlo's comments about the biggest whiners in EQ, I suppose he's never visited Druid's Grove).<br />
<br />
Institutional mindset my friends, passed on from Dev to successive Dev.</div></div><hr />

So many people have 65 shaman and shaman alts because while we were growing up during Kunark, Velious, and Luclin we weren't completely useless.  We could step in as a healer, and fights lasted long enough to make use of our DoTs, and stat buffs were worth a $#!+ (barely).  We were a wanted class.  I remember one day while playing my monk in Dreadlands.  We needed a replacement for someone, and a group member insisted we get a shaman because they had SoW, and they could stat buff, and they could slow, and they could haste, and they had DoTs.  I realized then that people wanted us.  I createed my shaman very shortly thereafter, and never looked back.  Hell, this was before Luclin.  'Course, that was then.  Now, people'd rather get a BST or an ENC, since they do our main job almost as well as us, and offer more than we do in other areas.</div></div><hr />

In truth, I'd love to be happy for clerics that they're getting another useful line of abilities but yes, the truth is I'm feeling a little left in the cold by SOE.  <br />
<br />
Still, I'll swallow the bitter pill and smile and just be happy for Clerics if this comes through for them.  If we'd like to see our class improved for the better, let's try not to drag other classes through the mud while doing it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I really do think that this hate is not serverwide.  It only spreads to maybe a few of the servers, maybe most, but def. not mine.  I have never had a problem getting asked to help in a Vxed/Tipt group, and I've easily (with less than steller tanks) been the backup healer in Ikk group trial 1 - 3.  I have successfully completed all three of them at least once, and the third one 10 times as the backup healer (stupid random BiC piece not dropping).  <br />
<br />
Most of what I see though is that people here are complaining about stuff that they haven't even seen or experienced yet, or have minimal exp with it.  Of course the first time that you run through Vxed you prob aren't going to be able to handle the duties that well.  I've seen the best of clerics let the tank go down there plenty of times from damage spikes.  I've also main healed there for two hours when the damn cleric slacked off and got himself killed and we elected to just fight our way back instead of removing ourselves.  <br />
<br />
In regards of just being a malosinia bitch to a group with a chanter in it.. well, what role do you think that everyone pulls then?  Every dps group has nothing on the pet, so therefore they shouldn't even cast their spells, cause they can sit there and not waste the mana while the pet chews through the mobs hps.  The ranger/druid is only a snare bitch just making sure that they resnare whenever the pet breaks charm.  The tank doesn't really have to tank, since the pooka can tank better than him and has twice as many hps.  The cleric just has to watch the pet to make sure he doesn't die to enrage or something.  And the chanter just has to watch to make sure he/she doesn't get eaten.  By your words.. only the chanter and cleric is really needed in Vxed/Tipt.  Personally, I think that not slowing them isn't helping anyone, cause the second that you dont' and the charm breaks.. now you have two unslowed mobs running around camp with prob no one on CC.  Either way..I don't go into trials thinking that I'm worthless.  I may not have the best dps there (btw.. outside of Tipt/Vxed.. chanters are worthless other than for CC.  They do not have any dps for trials and if you don't have any worries about needing CC, then we and beastlords are far better off than they are).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As I said in a previous post, 3 yrs ago, my 36 Shaman was a great toon. Today, a 36 Shaman would get killed in a duel by my old toon. Same leveles, different day. The Shaman has been nerfed to the point of uselessness. I used to get asked to group all the time back then, even at lower levels, now, only twice have I been asked to group, and that was only because I happened upon someone dying in a solo fight and healed and buffed them enough to finish the fight and win, even though my heals barely kept up with the damage being dealt. 30DPS twice during the time it takes me to cast light healing  for 30Hp just goes to show that Shamans are a dying class. I am fast begining to believe that SoE is deliberatly trying to kill off the Shaman. if thats actually is the case, then they need to say as much and get it over with. I'll end billing, tell them to kiss my lily white rear and find another company who will be interested in taking my money and giving me a toon worth running.<br />

Ok, assuming you do not get resists and assuming you do not get aggro - and both of these are huge ifs - then you get to &quot;mitigate damn near half the damage&quot;. Doing less then the cleric next to you, when you do not have his fast heals, can do less on your own, have worse buffs and less utility is by definition worse.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ever since Nixx first posted extensive play by play on his solo dragon kill in Velious, the game has been swamped with shamans.  Shamans were really fairly uncommon until then.<br />
<br />
Because of the massive influx of shamans into the game over a period of years now, and the ability to trade and sell toons, it really doesn't matter much what Sony does with shamans from this point onward.<br />
<br />
Not that they intend to do anything anyway.  <br />
<br />
But unfortunately, they have no motivation to bother.  (No short-term monetary reasons that is -- the only type that appear on their radar screen.)<br />
<br />
It takes very few active shaman per guild to support a raiding guild, and much of their tasks can be automated, that is, &quot;botted.&quot;  The fact that many shaman have quit playing floods the market yet further with buyable or borrowable shamans to use as bots or instantly just pick up and play at high level, fully flagged.<br />
<br />
The truth is, the game has reached a state where shamans are so plentiful and at the same time the need for them is so completely trivial that people won't need to make any new ones for a very long time -- perhaps till the end of the game's lifetime.  Nor will they need to be much improved or developed; they merely need to be botted to pick up any particular spells that might come along.<br />
<br />
Sony won't be impacted by how few shamans start up or by how many of us quit, just like they haven't been by how many have quit already.  There are acres of old accounts out there for guilds to farm, and new ones adding to the shaman acreage every week.  And by design, a little is already plenty.<br />
<br />
So Sony has no pressing reason to make the shaman a character of equal overall utility to the other classes now.  There's therefore little chance we can expect fixes or improvements of any significance, because without that utility, what is there to improve or fix that really matters?  What falls apart that matters once you trivialize the class?<br />
<br />
By design, the shaman &quot;problem&quot; was a problem that neatly solved itself.</div></div><hr />

The difference in players, and what they do makes it harder for them to balance the high end, without imbalancing the middle.<br />

What I want is to be effective in a group again. An asset to my friends when they play. Rather than knowing I could do a better job playing Pana  but choosing not to cause I am selfish and want to enjoy my shaman. <br />

sure theres a few minor problems here and there but if u think your useless then u not playing a shaman as well as u could.<br />

<br />
I am almost personaly insulted by that.  I know how to play my shaman.  I am a very good shaman in fact.  I once thought the same way you did; 'Quit your bitchin people, shammies are fine'....then..one magic night while bored out of my mind a friend asked me to do GoD. I got a glimpse at what all these people have been saying, we are sorely in need of some TLC from the Devs.  Please, do some research, read other posts, play in GoD...before you tell people they dont know what they are doin or to stop 'bitching'.  It wasnt and isnt all bitching...there are more threads about good suggestions and helpful stuff rather than the few that are pure rant.<br />
<br />
AND, the bitching that there is..is usualy not unfounded and is usualy well deserved by the people because they feel like they have been screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ever since Nixx first posted extensive play by play on his solo dragon kill in Velious, the game has been swamped with shamans. Shamans were really fairly uncommon until then.<br />
<br />
Because of the massive influx of shamans into the game over a period of years now, and the ability to trade and sell toons, it really doesn't matter much what Sony does with shamans from this point onward.<br />
Not that they intend to do anything anyway. <br />
<br />
But unfortunately, they have no motivation to bother. (No short-term monetary reasons that is -- the only type that appear on their radar screen.)<br />
<br />
It takes very few active shaman per guild to support a raiding guild, and much of their tasks can be automated, that is, &quot;botted.&quot; The fact that many shaman have quit playing floods the market yet further with buyable or borrowable shamans to use as bots or instantly just pick up and play at high level, fully flagged.<br />
<br />
The truth is, the game has reached a state where shamans are so plentiful and at the same time the need for them is so completely trivial that people won't need to make any new ones for a very long time -- perhaps till the end of the game's lifetime. Nor will they need to be much improved or developed; they merely need to be botted to pick up any particular spells that might come along.<br />
<br />
Sony won't be impacted by how few shamans start up or by how many of us quit, just like they haven't been by how many have quit already. There are acres of old accounts out there for guilds to farm, and new ones adding to the shaman acreage every week. And by design, a little is already plenty.<br />
<br />
So Sony has no pressing reason to make the shaman a character of equal overall utility to the other classes now. There's therefore little chance we can expect fixes or improvements of any significance, because without that utility, what is there to improve or fix that really matters? What falls apart that matters once you trivialize the class?<br />
<br />
By design, the shaman &quot;problem&quot; was a problem that neatly solved itself.<br />
<br />
This should be bronzed and sent to the SOE corporate office.  Very well stated and I think a valid concern that everyone is realizing.  <br />
<br />
Does it even matter discussing things that are wrong?</div></div><hr />

I completly disagree with person view of shaman. I my time of play shaman l have out, a few things on my own. I did my homework, and fought to see for my self why people said what they said. I wasn't understanding so l did my homework and found that Shaman are usless to the higher-upper end of the game. You think shaman are fine why dont you tie me to a chair and show me how you do it dude. IT the people around that are good. In GoD l have found that   why even slow the mob down the Allien mob is dead or on its happy way there before my slow casting nuke can be casted. So, l though umm something l doing wrong here. I asked my grow what my rule was, They said &quot; spot heal with the cleric.&quot; and &quot;Keep the buffs following&quot;. Great and just a buff hore in god. What a waste of a class. So told them they need a beastlord ( because we have a enchanter in the group allready) Next thing l know a beastlord was in and l was asked to leave for the beastlord, then wanted the beastlord crack. YEA, that spell which is fast becoming there &quot;KEI&quot; of the POK. I know my happy butt sitt in POK waiting on a group since l refuse to do GoD, and I the raids have all the shamans in them or at least the ones l have seen. SOO in the end, the shaman were made for fights that are there anymore. the longer the fight is the better chance we have at becoming usefull. Fat chance in Hell, SoE is going to make fights last longer. Is come down to the fact that shamans are love by those who have sweated it out over the years, playing though the hard times, and hoping for something Positive to come there way. Is has yet to come or the lack of quiltly bonus has not been there. SO many are tired of &quot;waiting and see&quot; thats is just high time to move on, EQ2 is looking more and more like something l would try or play just start over with a class that l have yet to play (which is a short list BTW). I love my shaman and sweated it out over the years and I see NO light come at the end of the tunnel. Just my hubble thoughts. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">No offense but if you feel useless in a group than you arent doing something right. I dont care what people say in LDON etc.. or single group situations im just fine i can keep my group alive i can dot nuke send in dog etc... shamans are master of nothing but jack of all trades wich was known from day 1 if you read up on shaman at all... Now of course there are issues that need to be addressed at raid levels etc. But i never feel useless in a group cause i keep myself busy doing something.<br />
<br />
I have been main slower / healer in LDON groups that finnish in 30 minutes and im not even elemental yet. Granted the rest of my group was /grin =P<br />
Have you ever tried to be useful when MOBs die in literally 10 seconds or less, malosinia on the pet is handled by the magician, haste is handled by the enchanter and literally all you do is throw our pathetic heals?<br />
<br />
Have you ever tried to take over for the cleric who went afk for 2 minutes, chain spammed Tnarg's on the tank only to have him die anyways? Closely followed by the cleric returning and effortlessly keeping the monk up while he rezzed and buffed the tank.<br />
<br />
Have you ever realized that the boss that wiped your group three times now would have been trivial with a second cleric instead of you?<br />
<br />
Have you ever stopped to add up our buffs against beastlord buffs in a group setting?<br />
<br />
Have you ever tried to do damage to MOBs that last at best 20 seconds?<br />
<br />
That is what GoD has been like for me.</div></div><hr />

Sure says the d00d using Time's Antithesis and most of the best loot that Time has to offer, sure the game is good to you. The rest of us hacks have to worry about spell gem refresh time, cant spam click Slow if we get a resist and dont have nearly 7k hit points unbuffed in case we get a resist and get aggro.<br />
I have been in the game for 3 1/2 years now. I remember getting tells across the continents for groups when it took an hour to get from Qeynos to Freeport and God help you if you needed to get to Kunark. I am an excellent shaman, I can maintain FA on 7 or 8 tanks/pets not including myself or my pet as the timer, I slow, main heal and FA/DPS with nukes dots etc in LDONs, I main heal in BoT and tactics...hell I even pull in Tactics when I get a wild hair up my kilt. <br />
You know what though? It takes more talent, more knowledge, more time to learn the class than it does for other people to learn how to be a cleric, be a chanter...the only class that requires as much attention (more so really) is a bard.<br />
Sure were nice jacks of all trades, in the current environment though that is not a good thing. Specialization is where its at and in case any of you missed it, were not special any more.<br />
King of Slow? add in mitigation and thats negated.<br />
DoTs? necros have us beaten down and they can simply FD when they get aggro from a crit, we have to stand still and take the beating hoping that the tank gets a taunt off or the mob dies before we do. God help ya if the crit happens again.<br />
DPS/heals/nukes/buffs that matter, its all over the boards. From high end to low end were all feeling it now, its a trickle down theory now. Once the high end starts to experience something, then the low end starts to feel the crunch. Like my grandfather always said, **** rolls down hill son, trick is to not be at the bottom.<br />
Sadly, we are at the bottom now, and there is a huge ball comin our way.<br />
<br />
Edit: I really really hate the implication from your post (and others posts) that essentially tries to make me feel like if I am one of the people that complains that I must be a crappy shaman. That really really gets under my skin. If this were a less polite board I would tell you where to go, draw you directions on how to get there, and then would be nice enough to pick you up in my car and drive you there myself to make sure you ended up there. But since this isnt that sort of board, have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

If I do a Tipt/Vxed run I have several choices about playing style. A melee does not, a clerics does not.<br />

Everything you say is true Swobu, and I agree Shaman have the ability to adapt to situations, but think about this:<br />
<br />
A group increases it's efficiency by a large amount in all of those zones by adding a class that can deal out large amounts of DPS, adding a Druid or another cleric, vs. adding a Shaman to the group.<br />
<br />
This is the issue, not the utility abilities of a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Swobu Bomwat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I agree with you, but imo, it depends a lot on the group. <br />
If you have an enchanter, yes the need/use for a shaman is very small if not non-existant.<br />
But I have done several M1,M2 runs and a few Ikkinz expeditions with no enchanter, and there I was very much valued.<br />
<br />
Grouped with two wizards once - after a while I stopped casting malos, but they pleaded me to start again, cause their nukes hit way better with malos.<br />
<br />
I think the big issue here is that we need  to be wanted. If we aren't wanted, we feel useless and lose the interest of the game.<br />
IF that is the issue for many of you - go visit the pally, sk, necro, mage board and feel their pain also. Many of them feel useless and unneeded also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">But in generel, I am a happy shaman!<br />
<br />
So you say that we can adapt to situations. True. But in everything you listed you are a total gimp. In all those situations there is another class which would be far superior. So you fill in open spots with some weak talents. If you are happy with that, fine for you. I can tell from reading this board that most shaman are not.<br />
Oh, by the way, did you ever raid as the 3rd or 4th shaman? I don't think so. But maybe you feel useful then too, landing (crappy) nukes on corpses for example, or seeing a dot go for 2 ticks, or drop a crit Tnargs on an offtank and not even see his HPs move.<br />
<br />
Stay happy on your little island.<br />

If we have a chanter with pet, I will just use a rain and a nuke.<br />
And be the very worst option for the group. If you are doing damage the group would be better of with any class but a cleric (who would deal the same damage you do but also offer emergency heals, stuns and rez).<br />
<br />
Mybe its only 2300 damage, but so what? The pathetic tank we have doesn't do more damage either.<br />
a) yes he does<br />
b) of course he is actually tanking. Thats like saying the enchanter is not doing any damage when his pet outdamages the entire group.<br />
<br />
If I am the CC - I load up MD and use my AA root for assist pulling, use my new GoD slow for fast slowing and throw in a fast poison nuke in the end.<br />
When you &quot;do CC&quot; you are outdone by<br />
- druids<br />
- clerics<br />
- rangers<br />
- enchanters<br />
- bards<br />
- situationally necromancers<br />
- wizards<br />
Being able to root is not a shaman exclusive ability.<br />
<br />
If we have a group with low dps I am even more happy, 'cause I can now use bane, rains AND a nuke before the mob is dead.<br />
*shrugs* I can not. In 5 player groups without an enchanter I might get a bane to run for full. Like 1 in 10 casts. Of course in a 4 healer group you might actually come close to paladin damage. Unhasted paladin damage that is. And no, I am not exaggerating.<br />
<br />
Once upon a time we were a SLOWING class only. What people forget now, is that we are not only slowers anymore.<br />
We have utility that no other class in EQ has.<br />
I believe you have that backwards. We used to be a healer that could also slow and do damage and we used to have above average utility. Since then we did not get a single new utility spell. Every other class got several. Oh, and we can no longer heal decently.<br />
Tell me, how do we have more utility then clerics or druids or enchanters? And what utility do we have that &quot;no other class in EQ has&quot; ?<br />
<br />
I have a girlfriend who play a warrior. We have duoed since level 1 and have had many hours of fun. But can she solo anything that cons close to even? I can probably solo Zlandicar (didn't do it myself, but I know it has been done by shamans)<br />

Well, if you are content soloing in 5 expansion old content, sure, play a shaman. But do not tell me I have no right to complain because you can solo MOBs you left behind years ago.<br />

I get no greater joy than putting together a group to do something with the NON optimal classes, and being happily surprised with the results.  <br />
<br />
I don't care that I can solo Velious dragons.  That was a few expansions ago.  I'm not placated by the fact that I have a theoretical function in new content (malosinia ho).  Yes, I'm demanding, I want to be quick on my feet, and thinking fast -- LIKE I ALWAYS USED TO BE.  It used to MATTER that I was *always* on my toes.  I used to save the group, from time to time, with my quick reflexes and experience.  No, I wasn't the only one.  But it happened on a regular basis.  I'm happy when my friends get to shine and save the day, but the reason I stuck with shaman for so long was that I got to do it, too.  <br />
<br />
Not anymore.  If I want that feeling I have to play with people under level 65 and/or without the 250 or so AA that I have.  In other worse, I have to backtrack through content in order to feel like a hero.  <br />
<br />
My heals aren't dramatic.  My slows aren't dramatic.  Some of you may or may not recall the days when both were.<br />
<br />
But I digress.  This post was made with the assumption that the majority of this community feels that the class has been gimped-over-time.  I just wanted to point out a reason given by a dev that this won't be corrected.<br />
<br />
At the very least, it's convinced me not to ebay my account, whether it'll give me a sense of closure or not.  The least I can give back to the still-playing shamans is one less buffbot to fluff the numbers.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong.

<br />
CANNI !!!  We have a pet, altho we are not a pet class.  We can Heal, altho we are not a healing class.  We can Buff/DeBuff as good as others and in some case not as good as the class intended for that buff or debuff.  What makes a shaman a shaman later in the game is the ability to fill many rolls.  While we may not be as powerful as the class intended for the job we can get it done in MOST cases.  You wouldn't ask that a running back be able to throw the ball as good as your QB, but in the right situation he could get the job done.  Canni gives the ability to do alot of things more efficiently then other even if it is not as effective.  You guys see the glass as half empty, I see it as half full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I find it odd that Kod'Taz was used an example...I actually feel balanced in Kod as opposed to other zones.<br />
<br />
Even pre revamp slows are highly effective, and are typically mitigated on named to lower effectiveness.  I've actually duo'd several mobs with a low end EP geared warrior with solid aa. (ie sub 10k hps buffed, and 1800ac)<br />
<br />
The named are easy to slow and in the encounters Balance + Daluda's = Cleric without issue there.<br />
<br />
They key is if our slow + 450HPS = 1100HPS of a cleric.  If those numbers even out then shaman from a healing perspective is more than viable in that particular group if healing is required.  Add additional hp buffs, a quadding proccing dogdog, FA, and even a dot or 2 and shaman are effective in the zone.<br />
<br />
As we now know for certain GoD was tuned for level 70's, so with a current 65 cap you are expected to have a healthy does of AA's and Foci to be effective in the zone.  And while I agree that Shaman have severe issues in many zones in GoD, namey Ikk and up and upper level ele progression, prior to that we can make a definite difference.<br />
<br />
If you want to feel overpowered again however go to Ferubi, slow lands for full on everything except named and they only partially mitigate...its a heady experience after being in GoD to once again manhandle a zone :)<br />
<br />
I think its important to remain focus'd on issues that pertain to issues our class currently does have problems with, as it pertains to content, so our assertions don't lose cohesion and SoE doesn't relegate our concerns as nothing more than petulant whining.</div></div><hr />

Being able to regain mana we would not need to spend if we had efficient spells faster then toher classes is not a shaman strength.<br />
<br />
We can not catch up to druid healing with cannibalize, not even in a fight of infinite length.<br />
<br />
We can catch druids in damage by using cannibalize - after two hours of chaincasting.<br />
<br />
The same goes for pretty much all of our abilities.<br />
<br />
We have a pet, altho we are not a pet class.  We can Heal, altho we are not a healing class.  We can Buff/DeBuff as good as others and in some case not as good as the class intended for that buff or debuff.  What makes a shaman a shaman later in the game is the ability to fill many rolls.<br />
Being able to choose what to suck at does not equal class balance.<br />
<br />
Canni gives the ability to do alot of things more efficiently then other even if it is not as effective.  You guys see the glass as half empty, I see it as half full.<br />
If I can choose to heal half as well as a cleric or deal half paladin damage no amount of mana regeneration will help me. If I could do both at the same time and then use cannibalize to keep doing it <br />
a) longer then other classes<br />
b) if those other classes would actually run out of mana<br />
then I shaman might have a role to fill.<br />
<br />
As is our mana regeneration is utterly irrelevant, slow mitigated into uselessness and our healing and damage capabilities are not nearly enough to let us pull our weight.</div></div><hr />

Basically what you have said is that a QB should be able to run the ball like a half back, block like a full back, blitz like a line backer AND be able to cover a reciever like a corner.  We know that this isn't the case ever.  You have a job and that is jack of all trades.  Adapt as required and stop crying.</div></div><hr />

Good to see we do not attack our own in this &quot;war&quot;<br />
<br />
May I suggest you get a clue Bludletters, no player in a game should be required to adapt to have the same fun now as 3-4 years ago.<br />
But then what do you know about the high end game, looking at your profile you just left BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">You know, playing a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; class is like using a Swiss Army knife.    While you can do many things with it, it can probably do maybe 80% of what a specialized tool (like a screwdriver) can do, but it will also get the job done in the end. <br />
<br />
In reality, other classes (craftmen) would rather have a specialized class (tool) in their group, as opposed to using the swiss army knife.<br />
<br />
It always leaves me the feeling that we're just getting into groups because &quot;they couldn't find anyone else&quot;.  Some of you might get into groups better, because of your relationships with friends and guilds.  Yeah, I get that feeling that I'm the bastard child in some groups that I am in sometimes.<br />

No, I just want my abilities to add up to the same 100% all classes get.<br />
<br />
If you can heal 50% of a cleric or do 50% of [insert DPS class here] damage you are useless.<br />
<br />
If you can heal 50% and do 50% damage you are useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">I do not understand the notion that shamans are currently well balanced because we can do many things poorly.<br />
<br />
This falls in line with my comparison of shamans to farm tractors in a different thread. <br />
<br />
Shamans can do many things given enough time.  So can a farm tractor.  Hitch a wagon to a farm tractor and one can conceivably do anything with it, from get groceries, take the kids to school, go club hopping, or pick up the new sofa.  With a farm tractors traction no amount of snow, mud, or almost any other road hazard could be a danger.  However the speed at which a farm tractor can operate makes it impractical for day-to-day chores.  A large four-wheel drive farm tractor with a wagon is too cumbersome to operate in crowded traffic, and an absolute danger to others on fast highways.<br />
<br />
The shaman is a very strong class in the long term.  But what good is it to be the one in the party with the most manna left if one's heals are too small, one's dots are too slow, one's dd is too small and slow, ones rains are always resisted, or one's pet is dispatched in a single round?  Any long-term advantage is insignificant, if one is unable to contribute meaningfully in the short term.<br />
<br />
There was once a time when we were true jack-of-all-trades, in the sense that we could heal in most situations, or when our best dots were considered significant damage.  We were strong enough in the short term to pick up the slack in many roles, and pull things out of the fire.  Our rapid manna recovery combined with our ability to do things poorly did make us balanced, then.  But now, all too often, cannibalization, plus our poor quality skills just means that when the party dies, were the corpses that had the most manna left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may suggest anything you wish, that is the freedom of the internet.  Doesn't matter if I just left BoT or just looted a TA off of Saryn in PoT.  Don't base your superior attitude on a webpage I may not have updated in 2-3 months.  Also why does the &quot;End Game&quot; have to regulate how ALL other shaman play the game.  Grats on Qvic Ya'll now what can you do?  Oh yeah wait on the next expansion.  There is no pleasure for me to blow thru content just to say I am first.  Could I?  Sure just like anyone else who wanted to spend 12 hours a day for 5 years playing a game, or doing anything for that matter, you should be very good at what you do.  Me for the first few years payed like that, then I took a year off.  Now in the 3 months since I have been back I have gotten over a hundred more AA then when I quit a year ago because of real life, bought a house, changed jobs, school etc.  The whole point is that would you continue to pay someone to do something for you if they didn't do it the right way?  Hell no!  You would hire someone else to do that job or you wold do it yourself.  You would adapt to the situation that was handed to you.  For crying out loud, stop the whining and either quit, ie take money from SOE, which is where the real power is, or Shut up about it.  It is a tired subject!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">A very accurate measure of both the level of positive intent and of the intelligence of a poster is whether you see the word &quot;whining&quot; in his posts, and how early, and often.  <br />
<br />
It's also one of the best indicators of someone's lack of ability to form an argument or communicate it persuasively that name-calling even gets on the agenda, much less becomes a star player.<br />

Oh, and to heck with it, just for fun... &quot;What makes a shaman a shaman later in the game is the ability to fill many rolls&quot;<br />
<br />
I agree, but what kind of rolls?  I need to find this out right away.  Egg rolls? Jelly rolls?  Hot cross buns?  Because I feel like I'd be of much more use on the catering staff right now rather than actually helping in the battles.</div></div><hr />
