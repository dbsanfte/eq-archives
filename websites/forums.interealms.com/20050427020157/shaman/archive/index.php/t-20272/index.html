<br />
Good idear ? ...... not realy ...... <br />
<br />
damn - 90 % the mobs resisting my SLOW ( turgur`s insects ) <br />
i cant believe .... <br />
<br />
Normal i cast MALO  and than i SLOW ... <br />
 1´st resist<br />
 2´nd resist<br />
 3´ed resist ...  okay .. at this time the mobs are on 30 % of live <br />
                      and the SLOW is not realy helpfull ;)   <br />
<br />
I have no AA´s atm and i Canni like hell  to get manna back ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
i tryed with MALO &amp; CRIPPLE and than SLOW ... same result :( <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe i make something wrong ? or is that the curse of lvl 62 ;) ? <br />
<br />
thx for reading ... my Gihalenquis is better than my english  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had no problem slowing in bot using malo and turgurs at 62. Maybe ya just had bad luck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah it's just bad luck.  It always seemed streaky to me, I'd have bad luck on one night (with malos) and done just fine the next.  What makes the difference is whether or not you're getting beat down after failed slows.  When you're dying it makes the resists seem alot more dramatic and numerous.  If you've got nothing better to do with your spell gems mem up malosini/a as well.  Malo(s), slow, malosini(a) if resisted.  I always have one (or if lucky 2) gem to play with.  Seeing as you probably don't have some type of avatar up and you don't have Bane yet, malosini would fill that slot up nicely, especially in a caster heavy group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thormo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi you shouldnt have any problem slowing in BoT as long a syou malo them first. You will get resisted sometimes. It happens that some mobs are more resistant than other and thus you can be resisted multiple times.<br />
<br />
You also have to be sure to see that your malo wasnt interrupted. One common reson for beeing resisted multiple times is that your malo got interupted for some reason without you noticing it.<br />
<br />
Keep on trying Bot =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Persevere and you should do ok. If there's a bard, ask them to sing oos/hos to help debuff on inc.<br />
<br />
Intersperse slow attempts with malosinia - its low aggro and will help get resists down further.<br />
<br />
At 62 without any AAs mana will be tight in a fast group, just focus on getting stuff slowed. I wouldn't bother with cripple - the difference it makes is probably not worth the mana cost vs just casting a nuke as stuff dies fast (unless its a low level melee heavy group perhaps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Even at 65 I go through streaks there of mobs that refuse to be slowed. Just keep malo'ng each mob and hope the group doesnt notice that you haven't managed to slow the last 5 or 6 mobs. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you stick to the earth wing (south) you should have less resists than in all the other camps as well.  i don't even bother with malo there unless it's a kriger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I was 62, I dont remember having that hard of a time on slows.  If your slow is constantly getting resisted, try doing Malo, Malosinia, then Turgurs.  Should get easier at lvl 63 tho.  Krigers are still extremely resistant at lvl 65.  I usually have to go with Malosinia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">when I was 62 I got alot of resists.  I would mem malosinia and malo, and sinia after a resist, waiting for slow to repop.  I noticed a huge decrease in resists in BoT, from 62 to 65, and I grouped there consistently all thew way.  Almost all of it was in the earth wing (south)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">62 is a tough level to try and get consistent slows happening in bot. I found that to lock down slows to around 90% or better on the first try that I had to malo, then malosini and then slow. Keeping mana up doing that on every mob without canni5 was alot of work. Just get levels and it starts getting easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I died a lot at 62 in BoT.  Two slows would bounce in a row after malo.  A mob would gate.  The mother of all trains would pass by, then, like a really ugly tide, return to snack on me.<br />
<br />
Went back recently at 64, didn't die once in 8 hours or so.  :confused:<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I spent a lot of time in PoV, the castle at PoD, Veksar, Torg, Droga, and LDoN's.  Perhaps it was the gear and spell upgrades, but I think it may just have been bad luck  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>sturmbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think  its best to go to LDON - so i can make exp and mybe i got some nice argues - ma&lt;ybe that pushes me up alittle bit ... <br />
<br />
thx for all infos-tips etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did BoT at 62 fine with malo followed by tugurs.  The Kriegers and bosses resisted noticebablly but still do at 65 wilt malos instead of malo.    You would have an eaiser time if you have a chanter tashing as well.<br />
<br />
One point though.  You would get XP just as fast in PoV with a decent group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If most of your group is having dificulty with the giants you might wana try heading up to the court yard and killing the stormriders.  Port is locasted on the platfrom behind most of the minibosses and is easy to invis long as the minis arent up. also port in spot is safe just be careful not to agro the storm watchers.  <br />
<br />
The storm riders are actualy easier kills and pulls than the giants and dont resist much.  You wont get any named for loot but still have good loot for common mobs including spectral parchments and lots of diamonds and tradeskill drops.  they are great xp and easy kills, not alot even know about them so camp isnt hard to get.  The court yard is even big enough to acomidate 2 average groups.<br />
<br />
You other options is obviously ldon,  not as good xp but better loot if you take the time to build up points.  for as often as your likely to win good drops in bot you can easily pick up a few thousand points in ldon at your lvl.  If your not in a heavy raiding guild i would stick with ldon for a while and occasionaly find planes group, if your guild is raiding alot you might just want to hit the xp and worry about gear later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sturmbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Now, <br />
<br />
(DING) in 63 it looks better! 70% slow works fine. <br />
Some Mobs resists 1-2-3 Times but 3 from 10 mobs <br />
going down slowed :) <br />
<br />
Time for an other &quot;EXP&quot; location i think ? OR should i stay<br />
in BoT (?) - the exp seems to be good - and the loot is not bad;)  <br />
<br />
Maybe someone has Infos about &quot;getting into Tower of SR - without <br />
 a Raid-Guild?  <br />
I heard there should be a way to do &quot;mini-quests&quot; ? /confused<br />
<br />
THX for all answers and helping hands  !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">BoT is great xp, the other place to look into getting access for is PoTactics. You've 2 choices:<br />
<br />
1) Raid MB in PoI Factory<br />
2) Collect the 4 different &quot;quarters of a diaku emblem&quot; from diaku in the desert area of PoS, turn these in to get &quot;quest access&quot;. This means you can xp in the zone, but it doesn't give progression beyond it.<br />
<br />
Tactics has some nice soloing spots but you'll want level 65 and some AAs first. You won't find pickup groups there like you do in BoT, but if you can put a group together yourself, xp is on a par or better than BoT and you get the chance of some ornate and SP drops and a few other goodies.<br />
<br />
For Sol Ro you need to be in a serious raiding guild, there are many many PoP bosses you need to kill and there is no quest access for Sol Ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There is no quest for Sol Ro.  Only access is by Planar Progression.<br />
<br />
I used to duo a lot in HoH with a Pally friend of mine, or he would box me in places like BoT, Sol Ro, etc.  <br />
<br />
Healing is simple with Q and blast healing once slow sticks.  It is a challenge if we have multiple adds, but the adds make the camp so much more fun :P<br />
<br />
The nice thing about HoH is that there is not a lot of people there - well, when I was on Karana, it was dead a lot of the times.  Usually, someone would be aggro kiting the GY, and there might be a group in SE basement or Hero 1/Hero 2.  It is mostly a bring your own group type of zone because of the lack of people.  I love the xp there, and I think it is better than BoT.  No trains, no idiots spamming ooc, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At 62 with Malo I have very few issues slowing, sure I can get a string of 2-3 resist on a bad day but over all they dont resist all that bad IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">BoT is great EXP, but a few mobs like the Militis (sp?) are highly MR resistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Branwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When I was in my lower 60s I noticed that some wings of BoT are more resistant to slow than others.  One wing, in particular, gave me trouble.  I don't remember which one, unfortunately.  Anyway, I tried Malo, Malicious Decay then Cloud of Grummus.  It's more work, lands later and isn't as good as Turgur's but it helped.<br />
<br />
But like most have said here already, leveling is the ultimate key to getting less resists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...<br />
i tryed with MALO &amp; CRIPPLE and than SLOW ... same result <br />
<br />
hmm something smells with these 2 pieces of text I quoted.. first at 60 I was slowing fine in bot and I didn't have malo, 62 with malosinia was just insane for me... <br />
<br />
2nd cripple will NOT help you land turgurs any better.<br />
3rd MALO will not help you land grummus OR MD any better!<br />
<br />
try standing closer =b</div></div><hr />
