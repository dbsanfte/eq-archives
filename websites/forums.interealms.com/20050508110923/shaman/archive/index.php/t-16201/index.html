<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>azsmod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently hydra'ing (dual box or whatever the term is called) a 65 shaman and 45 necro.  In the past, I'd just simply buff the pet and let the necro solo.  I just noticed though at level 45, I can begin to partner up with the necro.  That way, I can use all my offensive spells and best pet without worrying about outdamaging the nec.<br />
<br />
However, the experience my necro gets seems to suck when grouped with the 65 shaman.  Is the level difference to great?  Is there some sort of penalty in the necro for being partnered with a 65 sham?  Or am I just hunting in the wrong zone?  Right now, I took the necro to katta so both will actually get exp.  The guards are all almost LB to the 65 shaman.  I would think that a duo will reap better experience than solo with the new changes?  Anyway, just looking for advice on whether I should just allow the nec to solo or group.   Or perhaps, I should find another zone, like POP?  <br />
<br />
Well, thanks in advance for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd continue PLing the necro until at least 55 when you can take him to tier 2 in PoP and then start grouping up.  Xp will be bad for both otherwise because you're fighting stuff that's bad xp for a L65 and won't give much for a L45 because the L65 takes so much of the xp.  As long as the necro does 51%+ of the damage he will get full xp, so by using your pets, nukes, dots, etc... you can rapidly speed up the kill rate of the necro.<br />
<br />
I basically did exactly this when PLing my sk up to the point that he'd be useful tanking for my shaman in places where they'd both get good xp.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,</div></div><hr />
