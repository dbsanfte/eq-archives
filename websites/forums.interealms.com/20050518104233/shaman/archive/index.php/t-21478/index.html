<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I'm 65 and have about 36 spent aa's and 2 saved.  So far I have Run3, Regen3, MC3, Canni5, SCM1, Critnuke1 (for kicks), Critheal1(can't remember name), Spirit Call1, and VP1, hmmm, I think that is it, not sure.<br />
<br />
OK, here's my question.  I don't raid much at all, so I'm not so worried about SCR or SCRM too much.  I'm looking for the fun and very efficient aa's that won't take forever to appear useful.  This is what I'm looking at now, but having trouble prioritizing:<br />
<br />
- Quick Buff1&amp;2 to make my Q cast faster (just got Q last night.  Woot for me!), as well as, other buffs.<br />
- SCM2&amp;3 because I'm noticing more fizzles in the game lately.  Maybe it's just me though.<br />
- Combat Agility3 so I can start working towards Lightning Reflexes.  I hear this is very good once you higher in the ability.<br />
- Crit Doting.  I really question the effectiveness of this, though it looks like fun.<br />
- VP2&amp;3, Wow, I really love this ability even at level 1.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't raid very much at all due to time constraints, but I want to be an effective, but FUN shaman (thus buying spirit call so early).  Thanks for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Radiant Cure 1<br />
VP3<br />
then work on LR5 (CA3)<br />
<br />
Just my suggestions.<br />
<br />
If you have mana issues then get SCM3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You said you're not into raiding -- that's cool of course! -- which means you are into soloing and grouping. I'm going to go based on that assumption.<br />
<br />
Were I you, I would first finish off to SCM3. The mana savings was definitely noticeable, and that was one of my first AA's. Then, I would go for ND3 (more HP = good), and then through SCR and SCRM (lots of AA's, but more ticks of Q = good). I would make SCR, at least, a priority. SCRM is icing on the cake. I'd also make Radiant Cure, at least level 1 of it, a priority (curing group = good). Once you have these under your belt, THEN I would look at getting QB2. I don't have CA3 or LR, so I can't comment on those, but for me they're a ways on down the list yet.<br />
<br />
Also, since you seem like you're more into solo/group content, I daresay the pet AA's would be good for you (Pet Affinity and Suspend Minion ... I could be wrong, I've only had a few sips of Mountain Dew yet). PA allows you to /pet hold, and SM1 will allow you suspend puppy and then recall him in-zone. SM2 (I think ... where's my caffiene) will allow you suspend/recall him in-zone with his buffs intact.<br />
<br />
It would also be a good idea to read through the AA thread in the Medicine Cabinet, and see what other folks thought of the AA's you're thinking of getting. You're going to get a lot of different responses, but keep in mind nothing here is written in stone. In the end, it's still YOUR shaman and YOUR style. This is all just advice, so don't feel obligated to do it a certain way.<br />
<br />
/bow<br />
<br />
EDIT: Completely forgot VP. Yes, I have had little to no caffiene. :p I would work through to VP3. VP3 is on my priority list, since VP1 is an AWESOME AA ability. I think I might have been confusing in my caffiene-deprived state, so here's a list: SCM3, ND3, SCR, RC1, VP3, CA3, LR5, pet AA's, SCRM.<br />
<br />
Second EDIT: Corrected myself based on Thunder's post about Suspend Minion. Please excuse me while I go plug myself into an IV machine full of caffiene. Is it noon yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">RC1 and VP3 for sure.<br />
<br />
Raid Schmaid, SCRM for extended Q - 6 tics instead of 4. Also helpful on haste and FA. <br />
<br />
SCM3 for reduced mana cost on every spell you cast. <br />
<br />
Not exactly WOW! aas, but excellent investments.<br />
<br />
EDIT: does Suspended Minion allow you to zone and then recall the pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't raid much at all, so I'm not so worried about SCR or SCRM too much <br />
<br />
One of the first I got after CannV, simply for the fact that it extends Q making it last longer and more powerful, the best spell we get, and we use almost constantly.  The added bonus was that it also extends every other buff I cast, especially nice for the short spells like SLtW and FA.  I wasnt a big raider then either.  Its expensive, but glad I knocked it out early.<br />
<br />
Not sure of any I find particuarly 'fun' but I like to start with abilities I use most often over things like LR even though I find them nice (no need to blast me for saying that, I dont get agro on every single pull and LR doesnt save my life as much as things like SCRM extending my Q every time I cast it, or CannV every 3 mins, SCM saves mana on every spell I cast, etc).<br />
<br />
Just depends on how you play your shaman as well, if you solo all the time or are your groups primary puller and you get hit a lot, you may find LR much more useful than I did for a long time (though I almost have it completed) who groups mostly and doesnt have bad agro issues.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: does Suspended Minion allow you to zone and then recall the pet?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, no, suspended minion does not allow you to recall the pet once you zone.  Level 2 simply allows for buffs and equipment to remain during suspension.  One of my BST friends had the same question, so he tested it while I watched.  Zoned out, no doggy.  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">fyi SCM does not reduce fizzles contrary to some descriptions, it reduces mana cost akin to specialization. Which is okay too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SM1 will allow you to zone with your pet. SM2 (I think ... where's my caffiene) will allow you to zone with his buffs intact.<br />
<br />
SM1 lets you put your pet away (suspend) but it loses all buffs and weapons when called back.  e.g. Need to go invis but dont want to lose your pet.  If you zone you lose the pet.<br />
<br />
SM2 lets you put your pet away (suspend) but it KEEPS all buffs and weapons when you call it back.  If you zone you lose the pet.<br />
<br />
I got it because it is nice for farming.  Create your pet buff it give it some weapons and then suspend it.  Invis up and go to your camp spot.<br />
<br />
Also you can use it to have 2 pets ready to go.  Create a pet buff it give it some weapons and suspend it.  Create another pet.   Now you have one pet active and one in your back pocket just incase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does anyone know how ND actually works?  I understand that it increases your base HP . . . but . . . a 10% boost to my HP adds what?  250?<br />
<br />
Does ND apply to added HP as well?  For instance, if I have items which take my STA to 280 do the HP gained from the STA also accrue this 10% bonus?<br />
<br />
I think I must be missing something somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i dont know how to quote on these forums, but GRATZ ON Q...use it, love it :)<br />
<br />
I personaly  would go like this: SCR(extra ticks of Q=Good!) &gt; RC1(at least that way you have 1 rank under your belt) &gt; SCRM(more ticks of Q=VERY good, and not having to cast FA as much is great too) &gt; SCM2/3(saving mana is GOOD) &gt; RC2 (because it does help a lot in certain zones/LDoN) &gt; Healing Adept (i think its the Improved healing AA, that is VERY nice too.  never know when that extra lil healing boost will help)....after that maybe start working on combat, dmg spells, or finishing the AA Like RC or something....<br />
<br />
I dont have any combat aa yet so i cant comment on that, nor do i have any damage aa yet either (im a raiding shammy so i've been working on things for raiding mostly)  <br />
<br />
I hope the info helps, if even just a little bit.  gratz on Q again its one of the best spells (imho).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does ND apply to added HP as well?<br />
<br />
ND applies to all &quot;worn&quot; HP, and all stat buffs, aka stamina.  It does not apply to pure HP buffs, like focus, po9 and symbol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was afraid that many folks would say go ahead and put in the time for SCR and SCRM for the extra ticks of Q.  Guess I'll have to grind it out.  I'm a little unsure of Radiant Cure though.  Doesn't it do the same thing that Blood of Nadox cures?  Granted, it is mana free, but I find that those cures are very situational and can't really justify the aa points for that yet.  If I understand it correctly, that is.  ND is also on my list, but not just yet.  VP2 I'll keep high on my list and as much as I'd like to have suspended minion, I don't farm places solo very much, but when I do, I find I can rootrot them with Bane and Anathema just as well currently if I don't feel like towing rover around with me.<br />
<br />
Question though, at what point in SCR do I get an extra tick of Q?  I have a crafted shield that adds 20% buff extension, so will SCR1 + the shield give me an extra tick or do I need SCR2 or SCR3 to see it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">RC takes off stuff nothing else removes selectively, aka the stuff like malos that makes you annul yourself to get it off otherwise.  Couple of healers with RC3 in a group and you're amazed how many AoE effects you can remove.<br />
If I remember correctly, the buff extension items (non-time, especially the shawl and shield) don't work with Q due to the basic duration of 24 sec.  You need the SCR series to get the extra ticks.<br />
I never went past VP1, but a lot of solo shaman like it at VP3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would go for SCM3 and ND3 first.  Those two are the most noticable.  Then RC1 and CA3/LR5 or SCR3+SCRM last.  Those two require alot of AAs.  Is one tick of Q really worth 20aa when you dont have that many AAs to begin with?  It's only 350hp more.  Nadox only cures effects with disease/poison counters.  RC can cure alot of other stuff that Nadox cant (mala, tash, curses, etc).  Pet buff/suspend/hold would be near the bottom of my to get list (right above rabid bear).  It's not too useful.  QB1 is also nice, but QB2/QB3 starts to get really expensive and not be worth it as one of those early AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was afraid that many folks would say go ahead and put in the time for SCR and SCRM for the extra ticks of Q.  Guess I'll have to grind it out.<br />
Although Q will show the biggest return for the extra AA, your other buffs being extended will also net you large mana savings and will save you rebuffing grief.  For group and solo shaman this is a significant AA path to follow.<br />
<br />
<br />
SCR3 nets you an extra tick on Q and SCRM nets you two.<br />
<br />
After SCRM, I recommend VP3, ND3, then CA3, then LR5 for casual gamers.  The nice thing about ND3 is that casual gamers are frequently restricted in accessable gear and you'll frequently need the extra HPs, especially with cann5.  VP3 is amazing for soloing and good for grouping depending on your group makeup.  CA3 and LR5 are very helpfull at keeping you alive in some situations where you might otherwise get aggro and die from the mob love.  As for RC1, a usefull and easy AA to get if you group alot and fight casters (especially those bastage shaman and chanter mobs;)).<br />
<br />
Anyway, do what you think is fun, but you could grind out 200AAs easy and still think of something that might really help out your game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">RC3 will remove root and snares as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">RC can cure alot of other stuff that Nadox cant (mala, tash, curses, etc<br />
<br />
Not to nitpick, but just for accuracy, Blood of Nadox can cure Tash.  I will normally use Disinfecting Aura instead of Blood, but I have both just in case.</div></div><hr />

How much would you pay for a +250 HP earring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Less than 12 AA's.<br />
<br />
But since it does more than just base HP, its gonna add a whole lot more than 250 HP for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">A good example.  I bought a +40 HP Augment type 3 in N. Ro camp.  When I applied my Hit Points went up by 44.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok, I'm officially in love with ND now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sudedor:<br />
<br />
/shrug.  Your first post indicated that you didn't see the value of ND3.  I tried to put it in perspective.<br />
<br />
I'd pay 12AAs for +250HP gear every day, and 2x on Sunday. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Recently a friend of mine who also has a 65 shaman, but uses my 65 shaman to PL his warrior stated he noticed a huge difference between his non LR5 shaman and mine. He was quite impressed by it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Another vote here for SCRM.  The effect on Q, SLTW and FA make it an early must have AA, whether you raid or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Guntak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">ND3 and Crit Affliction3. With Crit Affliction 1 I crit on almost every cast of bane. I can't wait for Crit Aff 3. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said, I don't raid very much at all due to time constraints, but I want to be an effective, but FUN shaman (thus buying spirit call so early).  Thanks for any suggestions.<br />
<br />
Quick buff 1 and 2 are definitely nice and a good option altho probably wouldn't be my first choice. I'd also personally never buy qb3. I'm personally at almost 400 aa's and still don't have qb3. I don't see any reason to since spell haste + qb2 = close to or over cap. Since I personally consider spell haste a must have focus I don't see any reason not to plan on having it.<br />
<br />
SCM 2 &amp; 3 would probably be my first choice. The mana savings is definitely noticable and is very useful especially when soloing.<br />
<br />
If you solo alot I'd probably look at finishing off VP pretty soon. Free root that on alot of mobs almost always lasts full duration makes root doting pretty easy. <br />
<br />
Crit dots- Definitely could be handy if you mostly solo but it's also REALLLY EXPENSIVE like most god aa's. Off the top of my head i wanna say it's 5/10/15 aa's for 30 total aa's but I might be wrong.<br />
<br />
CA/LR- is definitely nice and can really save your rear. If you solo mostly I'd put this down the list especially if you've got VP since you shouldn't be getting hit.<br />
<br />
ND- Kinda depends on what your gear is like. Now a day's I'd probably say wait. If your hps are low enough self buffed that cann v is impossible or risky then definitely get it. If like most people your geared up well enough that you can fairly savely cann already i'd wait. More hps is always good but if you don't need that extra to be able to cann safely it slides down a few notches.<br />
<br />
Radiant cure- I'd definitely buy the first level of it. 2 points is cheap and it does several things that Blood of nadox doesn't. It doesn't take a spell slot, it cures curses and it can cure items with no counters on them like malo, root, alot od druid/necro dots, etc. First level is definitely a bargin and should be an early pick imo.</div></div><hr />
