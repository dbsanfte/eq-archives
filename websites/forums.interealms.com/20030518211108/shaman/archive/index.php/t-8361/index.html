<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a Mootogo Focus Staff:  <br />
(1H Blunt)  Damage:  12   Delay:  28   Ratio:  2.33   Weight:  1.0 <br />
Skill Mod: Channeling +5%, Wis +8, Int +8, Mana +25, SvsD +8, SvsP +8 <br />
<br />
I am wondering what it would regularly go for, I have looked in the bazaar everytime I have been there and no one has been selling it. So I come here to the boards to ask the people here for their wisdom.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks :)</div></div><hr />

Sorry if this disappoints you, but I think of your little Mootogo Focus Staff as nothing but a Happy Meal toy for a shaman.  As in, a boobie prize that would make you smile if you looted it, but not something you are going to actively seek in the /bazaar.<br />
<br />
The ratio isn't anything to shout about.  The 5% channel I really don't see as being something to spend money over, since shaman should already have a high Channeling percentage.  The svp/svd resists are good, and that coupled with the 8wisdom are where most of the item value is derived.  If it had 8 STA +25hp as well, it would be worth more.<br />
<br />
You didn't post all the details about the item, such as which classes/races can use it, so I'm basing my PC purely from a shaman perspective.<br />
<br />
Speaking generously , I would say that staff is worth 500pp-1kpp.  Probably less.<br />
<br />
In comparison, a Tash stick regularly sells for about that much on my server last time I checked.  That's a USEFUL situational toy for soloing shaman.  The Togor's stick is also a USEFUL blunt that I'd possibly purchase for that amount (maybe more).<br />
<br />
This is a midrange blunt weapon for pre-epic shaman in my opinion.  I'm sorry if that's bad news for you.   YMMV.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, its just that it was given to me by a friend quite a while ago and  I am starting to look for a pericing type weapon and wanted to know the adverage price of my stick i have.<br />

Thanks for answering.</div></div><hr />
