<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have played EQ since it was released and have numerous 60+ characters, for all its faults this is truly a great game. This is not another &quot;quiting&quot; post but recently my addiction has reduced slightly which is annoying me. In a moment of weakness I bought SWG, its a very different game but its still not as good as EQ, very little social interaction or grouping, it might as well not be online.<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried any other MMORPG that beats EQ in long term appeal? Does anyone know of a MMORPG that hasn't been released that has the potential to better EQ? Do you think EQ2 will do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Horizons and ff11 have the most potential atm, the biggest hyped mmorpg following eq is WoW and maybe eq2. Also other ones like Dragon Empire but heard little about it really. <br />

<br />
<br />
  **** not even!!  I don't know FFX1 but I do know Horizons, and its a piece of crap that holds about 2 minutes of interest.<br />
 Theres alot of posts on Monkly business saying that FFX1 is losing its attraction after about a month.  <br />
  So no there's nothing out there right now with EQ's staying power.  Here's a few I've played, either Beta or bought.<br />
 DAOC<br />
Planetside<br />
Anarchy Online<br />
SWG<br />
Horizons<br />
AC2<br />
Earth and Beyond<br />
Eve<br />
<br />
I'd say the only one that held my interest for any amount of time and I still have fun playing once in a while now is, AO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, this is the best out there.  Why it was the first and all others are replicants of various parts of EQ but not the whole.  Also, my mind is tainted because this was the first 3-d mmorpg i played.  I did muds, i've tried a few of the above but came back after a short hiatus.  I dont see myself leaving again no matter what the promise of a new game is because I feel I will disapointed once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe that EQ is the best MMORPG around atm, and will be for quite a while, not sure if even EQ2 will beat it :)<br />
<br />
I have tried other MMORPG like Anarchy Online, and I just didnt find them as fun, or &quot;addictive&quot;. In my eyes, EQ will always be the king, it was the first MMORPG for me, and might well be the last.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's been said a thousand times already, but our only prayer is in Blizzard's hands.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SWG Might beat EQ in another year or so, personally i might move over once Ships and space combat is in (maybe a year or 2).

From all my reading, and seeing the screenshots, WoW may well be the next thing to up the ante in terms of gaming fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes<br />

But not for long me thinks. Im placing my bets on WoW, i dont think EQ2 can bring it like EQ1 did. If people wanna start a new then i see them moving to a new game before they come back and try eq2. I know i am alteast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes imo eq is the best out at this time I seriously doubt anything coming close to eq in the future either. Maybe wow but we'll see I have my doubts..... I bought ff11 and have played since the release. It has no potential to beat eq. It was a really great game for a while but it lacked the depth I was so used to in eq. I have pretty much quit playing it. My biggest problem with that game was the arrgo system. I played a blm and I always seemed to get arrgo even if i casted late in the fight. ff11 is so inflexible on group structure it drives me nuts. You have to have a White mage and you have to have a provoker (warrior or warrior sub-taunts) You can pretty much add classes after that but the problem is that 5% of the player base plays the most important and neccesary class whm. So getting a effective party going is like winning the lottery. ff11 just didnt offer a diverse grouping experience in eq you can combine many combinations of classes and fight your battles in many ways. And you cant really do that on ff11.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've gotten bored with EQ and quit, but for various reasons have ended up playing again.<br />
<br />
EQ has a lot of things wrong with it IMHO, but it also has some things that are right.<br />
<br />
Things that EQ is horrible at:<br />
<br />
Class balance.  EQ has always had the worst class balance of any major game I've played. The game with the best class balance IMHO is Shadowbane.  But then Shadowbane was built with PvP in mind and EQ was not, so class balance is critical to one, not the other.<br />
<br />
Tediousness.  Things in EQ have gotten better from the &quot;old days, when I was camping for the bear-pelt in the Lich caves.  There are a lot of times where I waste time in EQ trying to get a drop from something that is green and supposedly common, but just will not drop for the life of me.  I'll give DAOC the nod for the most game play with the least amount of tediousness.  <br />
<br />
Horrible PvP.  I know that PvP is not for most people, but EQ's horrible PvP is the reason why I quit and played DAOC and Shadowbane.  There are so many glitches, graphics bugs, and as noted before the class balances are horrible in EQ, especially compared to Shadowbane. <br />
<br />
Slowly becoming a FPS.  This may be really subjective, but many things about the current game play bug me, because they are too easy.  I guess my choice of quitting the game for a long time, (after Kunark) then coming back to it shades my perspective, but man things are too easy.  With no effort and 500pp I can outfit my twink with equipment that would have made my 52 shaman drool back in the day.  Movement from point to point is a breeze.  This game is beginning to feel like Dungeon Siege in some ways (great graphics, game play that does not require skillful play).<br />
  <br />
Things that EQ is great at:<br />
<br />
Improvements.  This is EQ's strength.  Comparing game play of EQ back when it first released to today, EQ has obviously been constantly changing and improving.  My friends were always trying to get me to play EQ again, talking up how cool the LDON were, or how neat the new planes were.  I have to say I can see where EQ took the good ideas of other games and added them to EQ, and occasionally (LDON) came up with some really neat ideas on their own.  None of the competition that I've tried is at the level of refinement that EQ is.<br />
<br />
Large player base=your friends are on EQ.  This is the reason I usually end up playing again after quitting EQ.  Many of my friends are playing EQ, so if I want to socialize with them, here I am.<br />
<br />
I have strong hopes for the Warhammer themed online game.  But I guess I'll have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

Get a clue, folks--EQ is attractive because PVP isn't required in any form to advance in any way. With every other game I've looked at, PVP is required at some point in your progression as a character to advance: DAoC, SWG, UO, etc. As long as designers refuse to accept the fact that people want a PVE game, not a PVP game, EQ is going to remain the most popular.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">EQ has done something that I have yet to see any other game do.  It allows for class diversity within a group.  In DAOC, which I played for over a year, I would log my Hero on, and try to find a bard to group with.  If I didnt have a bard, I would go tradeskill or play a lower alt or something else; it just wasnt worth the effort to play if I didnt have a bard.  In EQ, no single class can make or break a group.  A cleric is nice but not required for an average XP group.  I've won many LDoNs playing with 5 tanks/hybrids and my shaman as healer/slower.  My warrior has grouped just as well with Chanters slowing instead of Shaman.  EQ has enough skill overlap that no group ever requires ONE specific class to be successful.  DAoC hasnt figured this out yet, FFXI hasnt figured this out yet.  SWG was smart enough to avoid this with a smart training system, but then screwed up on enough other things, like content.  And ranged vs. melee combat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't know FFX1 but I do know Horizons, and its a piece of crap that holds about 2 minutes of interest.<br />
<br />
well, horizons may not hold your interest but it's certainly not a piece of crap.<br />
<br />
i've been playing it for about a week now (interspersed with writing a final paper that's due christmas eve.  sweet.  :rolleyes: ) and it has a lot of potential (not the paper, it's doomed i think).  the biggest complaint i have (and generally see) is that the world is underpopulated  (NPC-wise and I haven't had a chance to explore to find any dungeons) and it's obviously still in its early phases of release (occasional crashes, some laggy parts, etc.).  that said, the game is pretty fun, or at least i've been having fun in it.  it has a cool spell system (no more medding for mana), melee combat is far more interesting than in EQ, the graphics are far better than EQ's.  tradeskills are so far better in Horizons than in EQ it boggles the mind (and doesn't hurt the wrist at all!!)<br />
<br />
For those of you that didn't play EQ at or near release, Horizons is doing much better than EQ did.  i have been disconnected twice now from Horizons.  I can't tell you how many times I was discoed my first week in EQ because I can't count that high.<br />
<br />
the newbie introduction is MUCH better than EQ.  Hell, people didn't now how to even QUIT EQ when it came out.  I finally managed to get '/quit' to work and used it for a while because I didn't have a clue what the 'camp' button did.  On about day 3 I tried it while my warrior was pretty badly hurt after a solo fight and thought maybe camping would help me regen hps faster.  it obviously didn't.<br />
<br />
is the content lacking?  yes.  but the game has only been out for two freaking weeks.  EQ has had almost 5 years.  i don't know yet how well it will hold my interest, but as of now i'm having a hard time writing this paper because I keep thinking about what I'm going to do next with my cleric/blacksmith.  i can't tell you the last time i was actually excited to log into EQ.  it's been a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gorgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">While the original Diablo was a good game, Diablo II was a major dissapointment for me. I finished the game and then uninstalled it, while Diablo remained on my hd for months.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has shown they can make some good games but ALL of them so far have been hack fests. WoW may just be the EQ killer but I've heard that many times now from many games and they have yet to deliver.<br />
<br />
No other game except EQ has remained on my HD for over 5 years. It's not perfect by any means but it still keeps me playing.<br />
<br />
Hype does not a good game make. Look at SWG. Beware of the hype.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I went from The Realm to EQ to DOAC back to EQ.<br />
<br />
PvE in DAOC is booring. I cannot think of another word to better describe the monotonous &quot;over and over&quot; with occasional &quot;***&quot; thrown in that is DAOC. <br />
<br />
PvP in DAOC is a lag / zerg fest. If you want to get away from that and go 1-1 in Darkness Falls(A dungeon accessible to all three Realms) well, you are either: a) In a stealther GROUP, b) Buffed with a buff_bot or c) Realm points for the people in a) and b). <br />
<br />
I don't want to cast dispersions on anyone, but the people I've seen who did not like PvE in EQ could not handle PvE in EQ. Whether it was connection, speed of game or a combination of other factors - some people seem to be overwhelmed by this aspect. So they move on. (I have some friends who I REALLY hope don't read this post). <br />
<br />
I have some friends now in Horizons. I WANTED to be fired up by the game so I asked them to tell me what was so darned exciting about it.<br />
They couldn't. Sure it was great crafting, but heck, you can craft in EQ. And I don't know about you - but I don't play a game to hit 'combine.'<br />
<br />
Somebody much wiser than me once said: &quot;There's always something to do in EQ.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
*grin* i find a lot of the PvE in EQ fairly boring as well.  Its why most people I know call xping &quot;grinding&quot;: it's no fun.  sure there are fun encounters and a few fun parts of PvE but most of EQ is pull mob, kill mob, rinse, repeat ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
Somebody much wiser than me once said: &quot;There's always something to do in EQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
ask warriors if they feel the same way ;)  <br />
<br />
seriously, though, there didn't always used to be things to do in EQ.  i remember sitting on my arse for hours on end trying to get into a group in sol B and guk.  does anyone else remember the group lists in those zones?  good god, sitting up at the top of the dead-side ramp waiting for 3+ hours so I could grind xp for 90 minutes at best was horrid.  quests at the time were few and far between.  those that did exist were fairly trivial.  i had tons of friends who sat at level 50 for months, bored out of their skulls because all they could do was clear PoF.  again.  and again.<br />
<br />
fortunately, EQ was successful, so Verant could continue to add content.  RoK helped a TON. it had the first real end-game content: Veeshan's Peak.  also, epics went in which gave the big questers some real quests to do.  then SoV came along with some more very high-end content (ToV and Sleeper's Tomb).  it was at this point that EQ really always had something for someone to do: high-end content for guilds to aspire to, solid quests (epics, shawl, coldain ring, etc.) and a good assortment of dungeons to explore.  2 expansions and 2 years after the initial release.<br />
<br />
unfortunately, EQ players have been spoiled by the now-sprawling, content-rich world of Norrath.  Expecting the same from every new MMORPG is unreasonable. EQ has been in development for probably 8-10 years now.  competing with that right out of the box is a monumental undertaking: a company can't afford to spend 5-7 years developing content for an unreleased game.  they have to put enough in to get the game released, then add it as quickly as they can afterwards.<br />
<br />
yes, after a good time on the market, some may fail to produce like EQ has.  But, at two weeks into its life release, it may be a bit early to lay judgment on Horizons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are absolutely right.<br />
<br />
The reason companies keep trying to introduce PvP into MMORPGs is that its 'easy'.  There's less need for the company to design and code a sophisticated PvE environment if interest can be added to the game simply by allowing PvP.  The most challenging, most unpredictable opponent is always going to be another player.<br />
<br />
However I've not yet seen a game where PvP doesn't degenerate into &quot;player who doesn't want PvP getting jumped by malicious little 11yr old griefer&quot;.  What works very well in a FPS, where a character has an expected life expectancy of 5minutes or less, doesn't work very well in one where character life expectancy can be measured in years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>osoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I find the pve grinding in eq just as boring as the pve grinding in daoc. <br />
<br />
I see no difference in it with the exception of LoDN.<br />
<br />
Big PVE raids are not my thing and are a carrot on a stick for loot whores imo.<br />
<br />
What brought me back to EQ this time around is the latest expansion od DaOC which basically turned DaOC in to a EQ clone. Not good for those of us who actually enjoyed the RvR aspect of the game which is its strong point that could use work as well.<br />
<br />
All my friends at work and lots of my relatives are still so hooked on eq its not even funny. They wont quit. Im here until eq2 and im going to try wow out. EQ is a great game but I really dont care how high my shammy is when eq2 and wow come out im gone. My friends and relatives all are so stuck on how much &quot;work&quot; they put into their character. <br />
<br />
I put 1 year into my original shammy when daoc released I went to daoc and didnt think about eq for a second. I spent 2 years in daoc and when it became daoEQ I hit the cancel button and didnt think twice about it. My character was about as strong and on top of the game as it gets. It wasnt &quot;work&quot; to me though it was a game. <br />
<br />
If my friends werent all playing eq I wouldnt be playing. I really enjoy all the new changes even though alot of old school masochist types complain alot about it being &quot;dumbed down&quot; I think the changes are great. <br />
<br />
EQ 1 has a looooooooonnng life ahead of it due to the addiction of its players. The game is all about loot and the people love it for it. I see people playing eq 1 up to 5 years in the future cause of the &quot;work&quot; they put into their toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The initial problem that all new MMO's have had is a lack of content.  EQ has had a long time to build a big world with lots of different and unique areas, mobs, spells, skills, etc.  A new MMO will be limited in most of these areas unless the time is taken before release.  <br />
<br />
Horizons promised this in their 1st revision, but didn't deliver because the original design was scrapped.  Even SWG had some of the same issues and it was built by Sony.  You would think they would have learned the lesson.  Unfortunately - &quot;You would think&quot; and Sony don't mix.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has the funding and hopefully foresight to fully develop the game and world before release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't played as many as you, but I did enjoy AO as well. That was if you made it past the first 6-8months after they released the game. something like 60% uptime if I recall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Aemon said exactly what I wanted to say, hes right. Eq is a evolved game and expanded game. It also has an established community which new competitors don't have. I think it also had the fortune of being the first real 3d online persistant game. What is possibly the end of eq is that eq is an old engine and that new games will be more customisable, more updatable, less restrained by the programming of the past. So when a game which comes up with a simarly successful formula it will capitalize on eqs market.<br />
<br />
I do think ff11 and Horizons still have potential, because they are new games. Well ff11 new to the US, not to Japan. And Mmorpgs are never finished, therefore they can still add features which will entice people over. Its whether they can generate the amount of money to do that though, and being able to sustain it. <br />
<br />
I think pvp does have an appeal, but its not really a majority appeal compared to the other features of eq. I mean people DO play on pvp servers in eq as unbalanced and crappy as it is.</div></div><hr />

Has anyone tried any other MMORPG that beats EQ in long term appeal? Does anyone know of a MMORPG that hasn't been released that has the potential to better EQ? Do you think EQ2 will do it?<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, EQ is the king and it'll take something really amazing to challenge it.<br />
<br />
Asheron's Call is very good.  It has a different approach for most common MMORPG concepts (character development, magic, guilds, etc).  When I quit my first EQ run I played AC for about a year and a half.  Ultimately the fact that AC is so exploit ridden (and the devs seem to condone if not encourage it) that it makes battlenet look secure caused me to leave.  That and the fact that DAoC released.<br />
<br />
DAoC is very good.  Best PvP implementation ever in an MMORPG, IMO.  I don't care for PvP but the RvR of DAoC is much more widely appealing than random PKing.  I joined DAoC the day it opened and played it for about a year and a half.  Ultimately I got sick of the DAoC devs developing more and more sideshow content (housing and crap like that), adding more PvE content, and adding epic PvE content - while ignoring and failing to refine the RvR that makes the game unique.  I got to the point where I figured, if the game is gonna be centered on PvE, and I spend most of my time PvE, then why play DAoC with it's semi-decent PvE implementation when I could return to EQ who is the king of PvE?  So...now I'm in my 2nd run with EQ and having a blast.<br />
<br />
In both AC and DAoC it seemed like the more those games were expanded and 'refined' by their devs the worse they became.  Particularly with DAoC where pretty much every little tweak the devs do can drastically affect the PvP balance, which is the most important part of the game.  Some EQers may argue that some of EQ's patches and expansions have changed the game for the worse, but I would argue - I think EQ has grown nicely and only become more and more enjoyable.  The strength of EQ has always been PvE content and over time they've developed it into a mind boggling assembly of quests, critters, events, flag entry zones, instanced dungeons, cities, connection zones, and much more.<br />
<br />
Nothing else released since EQ is really worth mentioning, IMO.  I'm not even gonna waste time trying Horizons and FFABCDEFGXIIIVXXIII doesn't appeal to me either - great console games...I can't see it as an MMORPG.  I also don't want to join a game that's been running for a year in another country - that completely spoils a big part of the enjoyment of starting a new MMORPG.  I had no problems rejoining EQ in progress since I had previous experience with the game...but if I were to join a new MMROPG I want it to be brand new.<br />
<br />
I have high hopes for WoW and EQ2.  By the time either of them releases I will probably be ready for a break from EQ.  The trend that I see in recent MMORPGs is to ignore the things that've worked best in the successful MMORPGS and to develop something off the wall in hopes of capturing people's interest.  Many recent flops show that this may not be the best dev path for games that take lots of time and resources to develop!  From what I've read it looks like both WoW and EQ2 are looking more to leverage the best of the best while adding some new twists from devs that have proven themselves capable of producing FUN games.</div></div><hr />

WoW will probably be the last nail in the EQ coffin for me, unless it really sucks the goat.  As it is, for the past few weeks I've on logged EQ in a fit of extreme boredom, except for patch day (get my bard's disciplines, try the casino, look at some spell effects, log off).</div></div><hr />

I'm convinced PvP can work, but it just hasn't been done correctly yet.  DAoC came pretty close but screwed it up with all their balance altering sideshows.  I think most people have a bad taste in their mouth over PvP that degenerates into little more than gank-squad quake.  I hope to change that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Competition is growing as EQ has set a new attitude and land mark on MMORPG’s. The competition has taken notice and most certainly would like a piece of the market. I believe that EQ will in time find some stiff competition; it will be interesting to see how EQII affects the projections.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Above all else, I think EQ's greatest strength is in it's community.

So unless a new MMORPG comes out that can convince EQ players to leave en mass, I think anybody trying to start something new is going to have a difficult time. This will probably be true of EQ2 as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Unfortunately no MMoG now can stand up to EQ. I played/&quot;Beta tested&quot; the following:<br />
<br />
SWG: Hyped to death. Buggy. Unbalanced. Massive grinds. Not to mention, it feels like a random Sci-Fi game, no Star Wars feel at all.<br />
<br />
Anarchy Online: Had trouble keeping client up for 30 min. Fast uninstall. Although instanced stuff has good future.<br />
<br />
Earth and Beyond: Awesome storyline, great concept. Very nice graphics, ok quest engine, very horrible grind. Oh and lack of content.<br />
<br />
DAoC: Very bad EQ clone with PvP. The game has no &quot;goal&quot;. Not to mention if I want to play a necro, I rather do it on an EQ server where I can twink the crap out of it instead of playing a blatant ripoff: aka Cabalist on DAoC. Oh and 40+ levels make EQ old school hell levels look like level 1. Oh and PvP is constantly broken with the &quot;Class of the month syndrome&quot;.<br />
<br />
Asheron's Call: Good game. Not my type.<br />
<br />
Ultima Online: Best MMoG, period. It's very aging though.<br />
<br />
Shadowbane or Asheron's Call 2: Social or military experiment that went horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
So what's good to look forward? IMHO, only one game poses a sizable challenge for EQ, and it's WoW. And that if it has a lot of content on launch and it's stable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ofcourse one thing your forgeting. Time has passed and more people are bored with EQ then before. Nothing is going to crush EQ out of existence over night. But WoW has the potential to rival it and maybe even over shadow it.  FFXI is pretty much doing it already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I played on Diablocheatfest.net, Meridian 59, Ultima Online... moved on EQ since its release.<br />
<br />
All 3 was good games, I had a lot of fun playing them but each time the fun was annihilated by the PvP system.<br />
<br />
I came on EQ because PvP is NOT needed at all (too bad that Origin made its non-pvp world way too late).<br />
<br />
And until another non-PvP MMORPG come out, I won't move from EQ.<br />
<br />
I don't care if Horizon or WoW are greats, if any kind of PvP is needed to play, count me out.<br />
<br />
EQ is maybe not perfect (I'm still waiting to see a perfect game anyway ;)), but at least I'm still having fun playing it after 5 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">EQ has 2 MASSIVE advantages right now in the MMORPG market. Polish and Content. <br />
<br />
For all the whining about server issues, character balance, bugs, etc, there is NO denying that EQ is an extremely polished game. You want bugs and server problems, log into ANY new online game during the first month and you will think EQ is the smoothest thing since VooDoo. <br />
<br />
As for Content, EQ has had almost 5 years to build it. If the Original EQ was put up against any of the other contenders, it would probably lose. But at this point, EQ is just too huge to have any real challanger come its way. It has done a pretty darn good job of going from &quot;Naggy and Vox&quot; to &quot;Quarm&quot;, IMHO. <br />
<br />
EQ is far from perfect, but for all its faults, its still the king and will remain so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">SWG Might beat EQ in another year or so, personally i might move over once Ships and space combat is in (maybe a year or 2).

<br />
SWG was not released in a finished state. That will be its downfall, because they won't keep the player base happy long enough to get it finished. <br />
<br />
The success of EQ is directly related to Verant's work on the front end. They released a fully functional, finished game world on DAY ONE. (well except for rogues) One could still buy and play the original EQ from lvl 1-50 and have a good time. Everything added since that time (good or bad) has been gravy build on the solid foundation of the original game. <br />
<br />
SWG did not do this. A year for space travel? Come on, thats like EQ not having magic in game for a year after release. I predict that EQ2 will have just as bad of a release as SWG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I think pvp does have an appeal, but its not really a majority appeal compared to the other features of eq. I mean people DO play on pvp servers in eq as unbalanced and crappy as it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think PVP has an appeal to a small, but vocal, minority of players.  I personally do not like it and will not play any games that have any form of PVP that isn't completely voluntary and I won't play any games in which PVP is required to access any content.  Which pretty much means I don't play PVP games.  I can't think of any other online games off the top of my head that don't include PVP, so there aren't any other games I am interested in atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">One other quick point: for whatever reason, game designers out there just seem to be unable to get/accept the message that the VAST majority of online gamers do NOT want PVP (just a quick look at the subscription numbers should make that clear). Get a clue, folks--EQ is attractive because PVP isn't required in any form to advance in any way. With every other game I've looked at, PVP is required at some point in your progression as a character to advance: DAoC, SWG, UO, etc. As long as designers refuse to accept the fact that people want a PVE game, not a PVP game, EQ is going to remain the most popular.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really have to agree with this.  I think there are niche markets for PVP games, as well as other types of games such as roleplay required/enforced.  But I think the majority of people want something that is PVE, like Everquest.  The only thing I am aware of that is even in the pipeline that is not PVP is Everquest 2.  So those of us that dislike PVP have few choices.  I think a lot of designers aren't thinking about it from a making the most money standpoint, but I believe some of that thinking is required if you are making a commercial game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">PvP has a niche depending how PvP game is designed. For &quot;throwaway&quot; PvP or short setup PvP there is a huge market: every First Person Shooter. For RPG based PvP, or long term developpement character wise, there is no market for PvP ... not many people want to play the victim. That's why even DAoC implemented dragon raids and more engame non PvP content. I forsee Shadowbane &quot;consolidating servers&quot; in 2004.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention about their game content that has Norse gods and mythology!<br />

All of my close friends in EQ (for the most part) have quit or are near quitting and are playing FFXI.  This is pretty much a no brainer for me and I highly doubt I'll be returning to EQ.<br />
<br />
As for EQ2 I have virtually no interest in it.  <br />
Although there's a lot of things I love about Everquest, I think it really comes down to nostalgia from back when the game wasn't completely figured out and the community that exists still (atleast in a lesser manner).  <br />
<br />
From what I've read/seen on old guild messageboards etc, no one I know will be going to Everquest2.  WoW from everything I see (even though there's the argument that it's overhyped) is going to be the EQ killer.<br />

<br />
AO was functionally finished with all zones and all basic activities in game. The GAME code was buggy as sin and totally unstable, but the game world was for the most part complete. I played AO from beta through its first year, and this is exactly why I think AO is currently thriving with a committed player base. But the bugs and instability in the initial release of AO almost killed the game. <br />
<br />
EQ was released in a fully functional state, AND it was released in a massively more stable form than A0. Bingo, EQ has a massive lifespan and a dedicated player base. <br />
<br />
I do agree with multiple posters than any form of PvP in an online game really ruins the game. First, it is extremely difficult to balance PvP and PvE abilities. Second, PvP attracks scores of griefers, and third, PvP allows the devs to skimp on content relying on &quot;pvp interaction&quot; to take up the slack (just like DAoC).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which leaves me with EQ. Warts and all, the combination of things that make up the game suit me. I don't think it is the end all, be all of games for me but it is better than anything else around. <br />
<br />
That isn't to say it doesn't have its faults, all games do. When people quit DAoC, FFXI and whatever other game, there will be lists about how it is evil incarnate, just like the ones by former EQ players.

<br />
Horizons has no PVP.  The original version years ago had PvP, the version created by the new design team that is out now has no PvP at all.<br />
<br />
I was in Beta for Horizons for over 6 months, I think it has a lot of potential but it just should not have been released.  Given another 6 months of additional content and work it could have been a great release.  It is fun, and has a lot of cool things, but after the 6 months I beta'd and leveled multiple characters up after each of 5-6 wipes I'm just not interested in playing at this time.   Its hard to compare any game being released to EQ,  EQ has had 5 years to add tons of content.  I'm hoping Horizons can last long enough to add the content it needs to make it a great game, it has the potential to do so imo.<br />
<br />
Maybe I haven't read enough on WoW but its just not got my interest yet.  The game I'm waiting to hear about is from Sigil Games.  The team of people they have is amazing.  Most all of the original designers of EQ are there and a ton of big names from the industry.  They could produce the next generation of game.  I know its been said about every game, but considering the people that are at Sigil actually created this &quot;next generation&quot;, I don't see why they couldn't create the next one.  They certainly have the talent and financial backing (Microsoft).  Considering Microsoft just dumped AC, which could never really beat EQ, it wouldn't surprise me if they were giving Brad McQuad the backing to create their own EQ.  They certainly are spending the cash needed to bring in all the talent they have. Unfortunately thats going to be a while till release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">What was it about Warcraft and Starcraft you did not like? Or are you speaking of their online attempt at Diablo?<br />
<br />
Blizzard are all about fast and short term gratifiying games, an mmorpg needs to have that 'suffer in hell' element to keep the player going for the carrot longer, its half the reason EQ is burning so many people out now.  And I simply don't think Blizzard will be capable of working that in.<br />
<br />
UO had it with the constant threat of pking and dog eat dog world, EQ had it with various things ranging from CRs, to faster than sow red cons, FF has it (Perhaps too much so for the first 15 levels) with fragile players and mobs you'll learn to hate quickly enough.<br />
<br />
On a side note, holy hell finally saw someone needing GM assistance in FFxi as they got stuck somehow in Kazham, a few minutes after hitting the help button, they were sorted promptly (by an English speaking gm putting an end to that rumor), good support obviously isnt that hard =P<br />
<br />
Oh and regarding FF's style, Windurst (The Taru/Mithra city) and the character creation animation sequences are impressive but very very jap anime and annoying as hell in some regards (I'd pay money to be able to kill the damn taru in Windy), but elsewhere its fine, The city of Jeuno is absolutely incredible the first time you see it and is easily the most stunning mmorpg city I've seen yet.</div></div><hr />
