<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there's a ton of these posts but there isnt a single shaman in my guild except me! :eek: <br />
<br />
 I think I am getting incorrect advice, everyone is telling me to pump up my wisdom.  Well, my wisdown is now 190 in bear form and I still never seen to be able to keep up with my spells. It takes me forever to regen, even with canni. <br />
<br />
I'm so frustrated! :confused:  I recently was told that 'Hitpoints are God, AC is Jesus, and Wisdom is the Pope'. Is that the direction i should be going in? Check out my magelo and see what you think, it is a link in my sig. I do NOT have a ton of cash, but I am willing to listen to any suggestions. Thank you all so much in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will notice MANY threads on this subject, and most fi in right with you. I agree with ac/hp over wis, and 5/55 or 6/65 ac/HP rings would be far better than the 6wis ones. That is one of about a million suggestions you will find (try a search)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Okay, these are just my suggestions for your gear, it is very good gear for level 41 (much much better than what I was wearing at your level).  <br />
<br />
Face - ditch the platinum ruby veil.  Relatively cheap options are the enshrouded veil (might be a bit more pricey now that it has a III focus effect) and the bone mask of the jarsath.  Arctic wyvern veil (shaman only) is another option.<br />
<br />
Ear - instead of gold black sapphire earring, how about an electrum black sapphire earring?  Adds 2 AC and has 35 hitpoints, 25 mana.<br />
<br />
Neck - two good options are the ivory neckpiece from Chardok (I'm still wearing one at 60!) or the player made imbued ivory necklace that is Tribunal only.<br />
<br />
Rings - velium fire opal.<br />
<br />
Wrist - rune etched bracer, fine (what level are you? magelo says 41).<br />
<br />
Platinum armband - must go.  Replace with anything.  JB arms would be good and relatively cheap.<br />
<br />
Gloves - must go.  Replace with anything.  Crystal chitin and coldain skin gloves are excellent and sell for around 3K.  That's kinda pricey but they both excellent long term goals.<br />
<br />
Serpentine bracer - Okay, now I'm beginning to think this is a joke.<br />
<br />
Back - back slots are tough<br />
<br />
Belt - nice<br />
<br />
BP - nice, might want to consider a long term goal of a regen bp<br />
<br />
Legs - not a bad choice, shaman leg choices are pretty limited<br />
<br />
Boots - GEBs are high wis but low AC, consider JB boots<br />
<br />
Shield - Sarnak Battle Shields are becoming very reasonably priced on my server.  Clay guardian shields are VERY cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">couple of quick suggestions..    try to get a mask like crystalline spider eyes and some velium fire opal rings (6ac 65hp) ..   maybe a clay guardian shield too, ac 25 50hp shield if i recall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do your epic for Boots and Shield.<br />
Get crystalline eyes for face slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AC, HP, and WIS are all nice, but they're not your most important stat.<br />
<br />
Your most important stats are Regeneration and Mana-free damage.  Think about it, the more mana you have, the more time it takes you to med it back... you are looking for a way to get your mana back faster- and that's what regen is all about.<br />
<br />
Here are my recommendations:<br />
<br />
1.  Get an iksar regen BP.  5 hp/tick = 3000 hp/hour = 1500 mana/hour (if you're a cannibalizing fiend.)<br />
<br />
2.  Alternatively (if you can find a reasonably priced one) get a fungi staff.  They definitely have limitations (they snare you, the effect needs to be reapplied every 5 minutes, and it doesn't stack with regen spells) - but it's mana-free Regrowth... 9000 hp/hour = 4500 mana/hour.   Stacks with the iksar regen BP or fungi tunic, too.<br />
<br />
3.  If you spend a lot of time outdoors, get a horse.  Get the cheapest horse, and turn the models OFF.  Turning the models off allows you to cast SoW on yourself without it being overwritten by the horse speed effect (and you don't have to look at a horse-head all the time.)  While on a horse, if you are standing still and not auto-attacking, you are medding.  Even while standing.  Even while casting.  The ability to med while standing/casting is huge.<br />
<br />
4.  Your longer-term items are (of course) the JBB and fungi tunic.  <br />
<br />
The good news is that you have some nice items to sell.  Ditch the froglok BP, Efreeti boots, and Earring of twisted leaves - you'll get good money for all of these.  You could probably get nice money for your leggings and belt, too- replace them with something cheap (ry'gorr, totemic, or jarsath if you can get it for legs..... spider fur, crystalline, etc. for the belt.)   Replace the boots with cheapo JB boots (few hundred plat) and the earrings with Imbued Golden Ivory Earrings (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4930) (super cheap and super nice- 100 pp each or less).  Use the resulting money for an iksar BP, horse, staff, whatever.  Remember, Regen &gt; Stats.<br />
<br />
A couple other recommendations that won't break the bank:<br />
<br />
Ditch the chrysoberyl talisman and get a Black Alloy Medallion (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6020) - stats are pretty good, it's cheap (couple hundred PP, you might even break even on this one), and it will make every spell you cast under level 44 cost 10% less mana.  That's a good thing!<br />
<br />
Ditch the plat ruby veil and get an Arctic Wyvern Mask (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5289) - you might even make a few plat on this deal.  You get a nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask.<br />
<br />
Replace your charred guardian shield with a Clay Guardian Shield (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1137) .  You can probably break even on this one.  You'll lose 9 WIS, but gain 15 raw AC and 50 HP - this is a good trade.  A general ratio for deciding on equipment is 1 WIS = 1 AC = 10 HP- according to this the char guar is 19 points, the clay guar = 30 points.  :)<br />
<br />
Replace your platinum armband with JB arms.  18 AC &gt; 3 WIS.<br />
<br />
I've tried to make the equipment replacements basically pay for themselves by slot- or at least come close.  I agree with Gloriana that the serp bracer and paw gloves need to go, but there aren't alternatives that won't set you back money (JB gloves for a few hundred and a totemic/ry'gorr bracer for a hundred are probably your cheapest decent alternatives.)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thank you guys so much! i guess what i wanted really was verification that i needed to go in a new direction. i think the ironic thing is i've thought about buying many of these items but was talked out of them by non-shaman guildies. off to do a little shopping!</div></div><hr />

Close.<br />

<br />
1) You're trying to regen back a lot of mana.<br />
2) What spells are you casting and on whom?  <br />

<br />
Any other Shamans on your SERVER?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As you gain in levels, you will be getting mana back faster via canna.  You only have canna 1 or possibly 2 (if your guild helps you out a smidge) and that's only so much mana per wince.  Regen BP will help that out some as you'll be able to get hps for nothing.  Don't cast more spells than you have to, as a pull comes in, tag it with slow and look for adds.  You're not there to do damage, you're there to prevent it.<br />
<br />
When everyone is talking about regenning mana hand over fist, they're talking about the higher levels, I still remember the 40s and how slow it was.  Another thing to keep in mind is how often you're getting hit and how hard.  Every time a mob beats on you, that's mana you've gotta regen the old-fashioned way.  If mobs are cleaning your clock too easily, upgrade your HPs and AC.  If they agro on you &amp; don't do too much damage tell your tank to pull harder things :)<br />
<br />
Have a monk or tank bind wounds on you while you cannabalize, this will let them experience the joy of mashing on buttons to get mana as much as you do.  Have a cleric toss a celest heal on you if they have the mana &amp; you're low or if the druid is running high on mana (yeah, yeah.   I know.  As soon as they have it they nuke with it but there's some good ones out there) they can share the mana by hitting you with a heal.<br />
<br />
Get levels, it will get easier.  Regrowth and canna 3 will greatly increase the rate you get mana back.  Being able to take a few rounds of hits and not have a significant impact on your health will help you get mana back, too.<br />
<br />
Hang in there!<br />
