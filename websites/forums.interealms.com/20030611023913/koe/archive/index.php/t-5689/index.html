<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Welp, died 3 times last night due to the dragon.  Got 2 hours of sleep.  Went to work this morning and had a tire blow out on me 2 blocks from home.  Auto shop in town has none in stock and don't know when they will.  Spare is kinda squishy and I don't own a tire pump to drive 30 miles to the next auto shop.<br />
<br />
How's everyone else's day going? :)</div></div><hr />

last night at school i was dropping a friend off at his car when he goes &quot;hey! you got a flat tire!&quot;  so after 45 minutes of 3 degree weather we get it changed and i'm off towards home.   I make it maybe 5 miles of my 30 and the donut tire deflates on me...<br />
<br />

<br />
Goin into the tire shop where i had to have it towed last night in a few minutes to get new tires put on it (they were worn out anyway)<br />

Four hours is plenty of sleep...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tuberok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Four hours is good, six better when the derned highway is backed up from black ice and my morning drive turns into a 2 hour marathon.. Getting good at learning to snooze while driving.. Hey, that must mean I am finally settled into Chicago! :)<br />
<br />
Look forward to seeing you all later!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rooknight</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My drive to work isn't so bad.  So instead of sleeping on the drive i usually hold off till i get to work.  Got this place under my desk with a rolled up sweatshirt as a pillow and extra head phones to block out the noise my boss makes in the next cubicle, blah, blah, blah.  my only worries now is that it is getting hotter out and mechanics want almost 2k to fix my air conditioning.  hey, now that i think of it, maybe i can put a fan under my desk too....<br />
<br />
Hope everyones day is good,<br />

<br />
I sympathize....some lady in a mini-van gave me a choice this weekend.  Let her crash into me while she was busy on her cell phone or take a curb head on -- I chose the curb (hoping to avoid it) and now get to spend some money fixing my car up.  It's sure not a good week for tires.<br />
<br />
Really sorry I missed the fight last night -- unfortunately, early nights in the week are tough play nights for me.<br />
