<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So how do you reliably reset an instance? I thought you could do it by exiting the instance, have everyone disband from party and then log out.  That didn't work last time we tried.  Anyone have a method that works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Disband, reform under a new leader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Disband, reform under a new leader.<br />
I swear we tried that, but every time we'd walk into the instance we'd get a message &quot;You have entered an instance that is not your own, you will be transported to bind in 60 seconds&quot; or something similar.  We'll give it a shot again tonight- thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about trying this: -&gt; Disband, log out to PW screen (two statues guarding the gate), re-log in, then form up?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what we do and it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've db'ed from grps and that has always worked. Even if it's the same leader.<br />
<br />
One time I did about 5 Cathedral runs in one night under the same leader and never had problems. Although the other ppl in the grp changed from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My instance experience is limited to grouping once in WC and soloing in RFC (had a couple quests I needed to tie up), but here is my experience.  I could not end an instance solo.  I'd split a few linked mobs pulling them to the zone in, but only damaging one, zone out, zone back in and he's waiting there for me, same instance.  I logged out and quit at one point thinking I heard my daughter wake up.  She goes back to sleep, I log back in and the entrance was still broken, no respawn.  Based on this I believe the instance is largely tied to the leader and that changing the leader is key to resetting the instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The leader has nothing to do with it, its the party itself.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, I did an instance with 3 people til we were done with it.<br />
<br />
Then later I did the same instance with a different person as a duo.<br />
<br />
I was the leader in both cases and I never logged out between runs.<br />
<br />
The only reason to assume that this doesn't always work is due to some bug.</div></div><hr />
