<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The reason I am asking is because I want to know whether or not to get my aaxp up to canni 5 now or wait till 60.<br />
<br />
I am level 55 right now and I know that level 60 is incredible with torpor. However, I can get about 1 yellow of alt xp in 40 minutes. The mobs I am doing will be green at level 60 and that is why I want to know if it is feasible to get xp as fast or faster solo (sometimes I don't have enough time to group/duo so solo is the only option).<br />
<br />
If I do stick with AA will get run3, regen3, mc3 and the 9 points waiting for canni 5 which I believe is 27 points all together.<br />
<br />
Your advice is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are you in Soupy's secret place Buuk? If so thanks as I was wondering if it was still good alt xp at 55 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you can really get AA that fast then by all means get at least run 3 and regen 3. It will help you level later on.<br />
<br />
Personaly I am 59 and have malo grinning at me from the bank. There is no way in hell I am stopping till 60:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Something you might want to consider is putting AAXP at 90%... ie 10% goes to normal xp.<br />
<br />
Guildmate of mine has been plowing through PoM for weeks trying to get cards. He 2boxes a cleric/warrior duo. He noticed a faster total xp gain with 90/10 compared to 100/0 per mob.<br />
<br />
Of course if your plan is to get the AAXP asap then 100/0 might be faster, but if youre into optimizing total xp gain 90/10 might be worth trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, the mobs are tougher and you have to slow down a little in the exp department at 60.  However, you are talking about a great deal of experience to get 23 AA points.  Canna 5 at 60 is nice (not there yet, myself), but the level 60 spells are VERY powerful.  I would say that you shouldn even consider doing AA (aside from PERHAPS run 3) until you hit 60.  Your power and versility go up SO much at 60.  You turn into a mana machine (if you have torpor of course).  I would not recommend getting the AA exp first.  Get to 60 first UNLESS you don't think you can get the spells like torpor, malo, bane, focus, and pox.<br />
<br />
On a good note, canna 5 is only 5 points according to eqcastersrealm.com!  That's only 23 points, not 29!<br />
<br />
6 total for run3 and regen 3 (3 pts each)<br />
12 for mental clarity 3<br />
5 for canna 5<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok I have a question and hoping someone can answer it.<br />
<br />
Lets use Soupy's Secret Spot for an example. :)<br />
<br />
Buuk Gains 1 yellow of AAexp per 40mins at 55.<br />
<br />
I gain 1 yellow of AAexp per 50mins-60mins at 56.<br />
<br />
Now why is this?  We both kill the same mobs but of course more con light blue to me then dark blue compare to Buuk.<br />
<br />
Now I was told when it comes to AAexp the con does not matter, you still get that same amount of fixed exp the mob gives, light blue or dark blue.<br />
<br />
So that saying for example the paticular mob that gives 1000exp will still give 1000 exp no matter the con, is this true?<br />
<br />
This is what I was told but now it seems false, if this is false I am prepared to kill myself just to get more AAexp as I am only 2 blues in 56.<br />
<br />
Could anyone clarify this please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Scurg, what you were told is not true.  Just like in regular XP, you get zero AAXP for killing a greenie, and some fraction of normal XP for killing a light blue.<br />
<br />
If I had a pocket cleric, I would probably keep very little buffer in 60 so I could play at level 59 when soloing.  There are a lot of places at 59 where you can find ~5k hp mobs that are almost always dark blue, but they all seem to go mostly light blue at 60.  There is a significant increase in the HP of true blue mobs at 60 and not much of an increace in killing power (on low blue xp mobs).<br />
<br />
Of course, there could be a spot that fits the bill that I have not found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Scurg, there are a lot of factors here.  It depends on whether you're soloing, what equipment you have, how fast you kill, what buffs you have, etc.  He may have KEI up and a fungi and a JBB and an epic, etc.  Exp at 60 may seem slower as the mobs tend to have more HP and die a bit slower than they do at 55--however, they give more exp.  You are killing different things.  The base exp you need for AA points at 55 is the same as at level 60.  The speed for AA exp isn't all that different for various levels in good groups either.  I was in a group of 6 level 60s last night, and I got 1 bubb and 4.3 blues in just under 2 hours.  It would probably be about a bubble an hour at that pace.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't go killing myself just yet!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hmmm, 5 AA blues in 40 minutes at 55? damn!<br />
When I solo shrooms in fungus grove I can muster around 5-5.3 blues an hour without clarity but with massive canni/torpor/aegolism. This is solo. Am I doing something wrong? <br />
<br />
If you do manage to get more than this solo as a shaman at 60 please do tell how/where, would die to know. Note, please do time your exp instead of relying on a hunch, people have a nasty tendency of overstating the actual exp they get :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chutoi,<br />
<br />
This is soloing the same mobs, their are 5 pops, speed in killing them can make a little difference but I doubt he is killing any faster then I.<br />
<br />
I have a JBB, Epic and Iksar BP.  This is why I am comparing myself to Buuk, we doing the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How fast can I get AAexp?  Let's see, the best group I was ever in was a 60 war, 60 chanty, 60 cleric, and two 60 rogues in Cazic Thule at the planks.  Warrior pulled.  I jumped an entire AAexp point in just under 4 hours.  <br />
<br />
CT has the best exp of any other zone.  Providing you can safely and swiftly kill the denizens therein.  At 60 with 100% AAexp, I was getting about a quarter of a blue per kill in a full group.  <br />
<br />
I did some solo there and came up with other numbers.  I killed a warrior lizard and got almost a half blue.  I killed a warder lizard (tuff, quite challenging) and got almost 2/3 of a blue.  <br />
<br />
I did some duo there and found out this.  With a necro partner also lvl 60, I still got half a blue for a kill there.  So methinks there is a cap on the total exp you can gain from a kill in that zone.  Since the exp didn't noticeably change from a solo to a duo kill, I think it's more profitable to duo here than to solo.  Things will die more quickly with more safety and you will gain exp faster overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes I do it at soupy's place. I have JBB, iksar chestplate and no epic. However, I do have a horse, and a horse &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than those in here IMO. Since I use JBB and I have to tank anyway. It is like FT 20. I can do slow, ebolt and JBB and regen all my mana by the next time the cycle of spawns is over. <br />
<br />
I will get baron at least then probably just level. As nice as this AAxp sounds I think it will get quite boring and more levels will give me newer options if nothing else. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the input )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Linora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm not sure if canni 5 at lv 55 is such a great idea.  How many hitpoints do you have? Canni 5 takes 1924 hps.<br />
<br />
At level 60 I have barely enough hp unbuffed to use it. Even with focus and sta I dont have enough hps to use it comfortably with mobs in camp/solo.<br />
<br />
Just a reminder if you are in a group even if a melee is on the mob if you use canni 5 and drop to low hps (couple hundred) the mob will instantly agro on you, and probably kill you unless the cleric is really fast.<br />
<br />
If you are soloing I would never ever use canni 5 in a fight without torpor, root is not something I will trust my life with.<br />
<br />
So pretty much at lv 55 canni 5 can only be used to decrease down time, will save you a few mintutes but it is really worth the xp then? You could prolly make lv 57/58 in the time it takes to get that many aa. <br />
<br />
(and yes canni 5 is only 5 aa points)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">class abilities are 59-60... he can only save up the points, not buy c5.<br />
40 mins is good tho, i think 35 mins or so is my record(i usually run around with koadic's tho)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Best AA xp? See if you can get youself in an AE group as the puller heheh 3 blue every 16 mins. *sigh* I've only done it once but that was the best exp I've ever seen - feels like cheating though because you dont really do anything but run into a room full of mobs and run back to the group. rinse/repeat until they start the nuking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>DarkBringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sorry, but I think it is pointless to discuess how faster you can gain a blue/yellow bubble exp.<br />
<br />
Solo? Group?Where you hunt? Who do you group with? Group member's class, level, equipments? How do you kill? When you play? Crowd or Empty?<br />
<br />
Yes, CT is very very good exp. but what can make you better exp than a AE group? I had saw a AE group clean all mobs from OS D1/D2, b3, zone out, b1 until almost all mobs at zone in. Pull pull pull, AE AE AE, move to next camp, pull pull pull, AE AE AE, move...</div></div><hr />

<br />
My Bad. I am not answering your question, but did it as a general reply to others' post.;) <br />
<br />
I dont think you can get Cann5 in lv55, since it is a class AA skill.<br />
You can store the AA point, but not gain it until lv59.<br />
<br />
In the other hand, I will try to give you my experience. Although it does not answer you question, too. :p <br />
<br />
I have not got my cann5, I have not a Baron title even. I was somewhat frustated recently, since I join raids everyday. Trust me, you will not like 5 full groups waiting in line for your Group Focus full. You will not like cann4 as you was in exp group. When I got cann4, I feel very sastify. It was great, double performance than cann3, what can I ask more? Now I know what I will ask. <br />
:p <br />
<br />
If you solo most time, Cann5 is not good. You will not have enough HP to risk it in combat. Even after combat, low HP aggro is terrible.<br />
<br />
Find a Torpro for yourself first, it is my 2 cp. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">a yellow per hour is just about right for FG.  with a horse in an outdoor zone, you can probably find a little better spot than FG.  toilers in ME come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Man I despise FG (nerfed too much for my liking and the large number of idiots that live there these days) so I went and found another place to solo if I want fast AA exp at 60.   Basically I do the legionnaires at zone in of Sanctus Seru:  1/4 blue roughly per kill, 6K hps give or take a few pts, drop up to 22pp per kill and are easy to do.  Once they are cleared I move up to the perimeter for some quick kills till zone in repops.   I was doing about 1 orange per 1.5 hours and gaining some nice katta faction to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Your above the curve at 40minutes for AA. I would milk it for as long as you can stand it. It's even better at lower levels.<br />
<br />
Level 60 gives you fun new spells and tons of new options, but for experience grinds you still end up averaging 45-60mins most of the time solo. That is including having all your spells and good gear. Blue targets just ramp up difficulty way to much at 60.<br />
<br />
Having Canni5 at 60 helps increase your kill rate, but only then can you actually approach the 40min kill rate again at 60.<br />
<br />
Plus gettting regen3,run3,MC3 is just going to increase your exp rate for the next 5 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, I de-leveled yesterday, I commited suicide hehe and I am not just shy a pixil of hitting 56, perfect.<br />
<br />
That said I am not gaining AAexp alittle quicker, about 45mins per yellow.  I will continue racking up the AA exp until I have 5 pts ready for Canni 5 for when I hit 59.<br />
<br />
The 2 blues I lost can be gain in 2 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>dominan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmm... i'm also at that spot. I'm getting 1 orange and 2 blue an hour of Normal exp at level 49 grouped with a 49 monk. I have epic/fungi/jbb and monk got fungi/tstaff. And we're only doing the 5 spawns.... Once i hit 50, i'll try doing some AA just to see how much i get per hour. I don't know if i can solo all 5 spawns tho since i can't single pull. Oh yeah, The dealers are higher level than the nobles... and they're doubious not compare to apprehensive before i started hutning here.... they'll probably become kos in a few days, anyone else having trouble with them?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">For fast xp, has anyone tried doing the hardest Caller Quest in FG in quadruple mode using AE?  IE handing in 4 barrels at once to spawn 4 callers.</div></div><hr />

Once past 54 I didnt find it any faster xp than numerous other spots about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Fastest AA points I have gotten:<br />
<br />
About 4-5 Blue in 10-11 minutes or about 1 Hour an AA point.<br />
<br />
Know another method of doing around AA point in 2 and half hours.<br />
<br />
In any case, I would say you need to get to 60, 60 is the power level for shammies.  59th shaman is like 1/4 to 1/5 of 60th shammie with his spells.</div></div><hr />

Milk it as much as you can stand. Keep gettin aa at 55 til it gets boring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">&gt; How long does it take you to get 1 AA xp point at 60? <br />
<br />
when I was 56 and solo Raptor, I got like 1 yellow per hour with 4 spawn, or up to 1.5 yellow for hardcore 6-7 spawn<br />
<br />
now, I am 60 and grouping and got onyl 3 blue an hour at good spot, like Velk Village/pit/frenzy, or Seb D1 and D2,  it really bad and very bore to solo at 60 without Topor to fill downtime. wish I get enough AA while solo Raptor at earlier level, <br />
<br />
I been ask around many friend and they say that is very good AA exp which comparable to AA group at Seb, but that is before VI nerf solo exp bug<br />
<br />
Raptor is very very good exp spot, better than HS (HS little better but Raptor is safer and need only regen/haste/levit/sow boot as buff and 10m with 20%hp can start next pull )</div></div><hr />
