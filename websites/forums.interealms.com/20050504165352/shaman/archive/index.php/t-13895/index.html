<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I always thought that your racial xp penalty does not affect your AA bar.  I've been told different recently.  I'm an Iksar, does my 20% xp penalty translate to my AA bar also?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No. It does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to back it up, no, penalties to not apply to AA. ITs based of level 51 experience ratios as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is this true even when splitting exp between normal and AA?  I've always heard that racial penalties apply to AA if you split your exp.  I've never tried to test it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just one question I've got, is: How do you guys know for definite that it is this way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a similiar question. I remember I was grouped with a buddy who's race gave an exp penalty. We were in the same group, and were the same level. our AA bars did NOT increase at the same speed. There's no way to explain that, considering we were both going 100% aa, unless there was some sort of experience modifier that is in fact applied to AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just one question I've got, is: How do you guys know for definite that it is this way?<br />

<br />
This question has come up before, though i have no way of testing itmeself since im a barb and have such a small penalty that it would be hard to test it, it was found that the racial penalty is not &quot;supposed to&quot; apply to AA. if it is then it might be something we need to /report, unless it was a stealth nerf ?<br />
<br />
Might be worth checking out again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Testing this is really easy.  Takes a non-penalty person and a penalty person in group (both at same regular level).  Both set their AA EXP to 100% and tell one another what their current AA EXP level percentage is.  10 mobs later, if their level percentage has gone up exactly the same, you have your answer.  If not, it will be obvious after 10 mobs.<br />
<br />
I suggest you try this and if it in fact shows that there's racial penalty, you BETTER camp on SOE's door.  The added extras you get from penalized races is so small at the level that you would be doing AA EXP, there's no justification for racial penalties in AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been there, done that. Grouped with 2 warriors level 65th (same group), 100 percent xp to aa's. One a gnome, the other an ogre. They were comparing the xp gained and their aa xp was definitely NOT moving at the same pace.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So I guess the next question would be, is this a bug or is it intended?  I guess since it seems that aaxp is based on level 51 experience, maybe there was no other way to code around it and give the same xp rate to all races.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd guess that there is definitely an aa penalty, I get 6-6.5% aa (100% aa @ 65) per PoV golem, and 7% per PoS frog, as a Troll.  I routinely hear barbs in the crucible channel mention getting 7% per golem, 8% per frog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is this true even when splitting exp between normal and AA?  I've always heard that racial penalties apply to AA if you split your exp.  I've never tried to test it though.<br />
<br />
You get a set amount of xp from a kill no matter how you decide split it. All the slider does is determine which of your 2 xp pools the kill xp goes into.</div></div><hr />
