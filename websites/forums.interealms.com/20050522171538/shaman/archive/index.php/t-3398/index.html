<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any shaman tried to solo their way to and thru the Army Behemoth in City of Mist to get the Strange Ocre Clay drop for Canni II?  From Allah's board, seems like the temple to right of entrance is best place for this.  Checked it out briefly last night, but wasn't fully prepared for the adds and had to gate out.<br />
<br />
Any tips for trying to do this solo at 52?<br />
<br />
Here is a long excerpt of what I gleaned from the message boards on finding the Army Behemouth:<br />
=======<br />
I spent over 11 hours in there the other day helping a friend get the Ochre Clay. Both times I've gotten the clay, the Army Behemoth had spawned in the room under the temple. I would suggest getting your group to single pull the room under the temple stairs until it's clear, and move in and keep the room clear. You'll probably have a better chance of making it spawn that way. We spent a lot of time killing the mobs at the top of the stairs and I think that was a waste of time. <br />
======<br />
So far the only place I've seen this spawn is in the middle of the zone, though I haven't spent huge amounts of time camping CoM and only seen it twice. <br />
=======<br />
After zoning in to CoM, run along the bridge and keep moving ahead into the zone. The first courtyard that joins the bridge has the round water pool. Next area going deeper has a huge roundish building in the middle of it with a long house on either side at the far end. Behind the round building and between the two long houses is a small 2 story temple type building. It is inside this building that the 2 Army Behemoths I have seen were. There are two mobs inside this temple and both agro before you can open the door so be careful. Also DON'T use any area effect spells near it.. there can be a lv60 NPC inside (it doesn't seem to be agro) sometimes as well as the two mobs. <br />
<br />
There is plenty of space in front of the two longhouses just on either side of the large round building (the goo house its called?) for a group to camp comfortably. Just be careful of the terrible pathing in CoM :)<br />
============<br />
Zone into CoM, go through first Large unlocked gate you see, hang a right, go straight until you see large stairs/terrace leading up on your left, do not go up these, however, you will see a small hallway leading to a greyish door, go through this door, and straight through an identical door, follow ramp around and up until you come to room where behemoth spawns. ITU or something might help, unless you have a group to clear the way. There is only one behemoth in the zone at a time, dropped clay for me first time.<br />
=============<br />
At Shaman's Crucible, they say go over bridge, bear right, and at the top of some pyramid structure is the Behemoth.  You can cast on it from there, to bring it to you, once you have cleared the yard, though this sounds like an excellent way to start a train. Don't know, haven't tried it, but there it is. Was going to start working on it, but seeing as the MOb can be 44th, I am waiting a bit. Best suggestion might be to advertise and ask to loot the quest item.<br />
 ==============<br />
camped city of mist for two days now. Once with a guild raid and once with a group camping stables.   Both times I was on for four hours.  No sign of behemoth in zone. Best bet was told to stay in stables. Until he spawns there. If anyone else know of another way please post it. 8 real time hours. This is pathetic. Lvl 45 Shaman Rodcet Knife server. I will be to level 54 by the time this thing ever spawns to drop it then I could care less about the spell. Not to mention fighting over it with other shamans that need it. This should be a faster spawn. Or at least tell us if there is a place holder for it so I know where to camp. Its hard enough to get people to camp it let alone stay there for hours and hours.<br />
 <br />
I have seen him spawn in the temple, one the bridge leading to the reavers, somewhere in the tower as there was a raiding party going through and they were using OOC to target.  So I am guessing he can spawn anywhere a golem can. I usually camp an are for hours and he will suddenlt spawn.<br />
==============<br />
Just wanted to post some info that the strange ochre clay you get off these for your shaman canna 2 quest is tradeable.  Meaning if you hunt here a lot and you notice a bunch of people on a reaver / lord hunt, you could probably beg them enough and walk away with your clay. <br />
===============<br />
Army behemoth spawns rarely in other places like stables, etc but probably only once a week if that. Typically spawns with the other lvl 40ish mobs in the castle where the reaver(s) spawn. Probably spawns skyward as well but most raids dont hunt there. <br />
<br />
Edit: lvl 54 now and still use canna 2 for prolly 2 more lvls. Canna 3 fizzles way too much. I have both, I just prefer canna 2. Also one of these spawned in the temple on the right side of zone the other day at the bottom where there are 3 spawns. MAKE SURE you don't go upstairs in the temple without an army of enchanters. There are about 8 spawns up there, half of which are lvl 40-43ish, the other half are lvl 36to 39ish. <br />
<br />
Edit again: still using can 2 at 55, can 3 still fizzles too much even with maxed alt and spec alt. Also these guys spawn most frequently at the 2 gazebos outside the castle at the west end of the zone.<br />
 =============<br />
Been camping in CoM for about a week, in the left corner just zoneside from the arena. If that doesnt make sense, zone in, cross the bridge, through the gate, through the CY, left at the T and into the corner with all the damn ferns and crap. My friend was pulling from all over, CY, CY wings etc. We saw this guy twice, hits hard, was red to me at 40, and resists a lot, even after tash'd. Malosi fixed that though.<br />
<br />
I pulled from the stables area for most of level 40 (about 12 hours or so?). In all that time I saw the Army Behemoth once. It spawned in the easternmost room of the stables, in the NW corner, at the foot of the ramp that leads up to the raised section of room in south half. Only one sighting, I know, but hope this helps. <br />
(Addendum: Was hunting Mist again tonight at level 45 and again saw the Behemoth in the easternmost building, this time at top of ramp. My bet is it can spawn at any of the 3 spawn points in this building.)<br />
===============<br />
Temple/Stables: <br />
<br />
To the right and left respectively of the courtyard are higher level areas that include some higher lvl mobs: Spectral Courier, Greater Warboned, Greater Plaquebone, Wraith, Army Behemoth, Mist Golem)that are about 4 lvl's higher on average than the courtyard/bridge pulls. <br />
<br />
NOTE: It is possible if timed right to pull the Bridge/Gate/Courtyard/Stable/Temple area within a 20 minute cycle if you have a full lvl 50's group that is well balanced.. almost non-stop fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Getting to the temple is easy. Especially if you have ivu potions.<br />
<br />
'Course, now that they fixed the floaty 'sploit, dealing with the trains you might cause is a might harder. ;)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the behemoth can pop anywhere that a golem can pop. I've seen him in the stable before, when I was camping the reports for my epic. He's no harder than any other mob there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually found he spawns the most up by the castle where the two sets of triple spawns are on that bridge.<br />
<br />
It is possible to get all the way there with using the underwater tunnel and careful running through spawns. Lev helps a lot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I soloed alot of 52-53 at the Gazebo area by the locked door.  The Army Behemoth popped several times while I was there.<br />
<br />
As far as getting there, it's really easy.  If you are SoWed (and why wouldn't you be?) you can outrun aggro in CoM.  If you aggro something near the entrance, you can run past the goo house to the back of CoM and camp out.  Be sure and bind at the entrance.  That way if something happens you can gate back and zone to avoid causing a train.<br />
<br />
You will get great exp. in this area as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I spent about 5 hours camping that temple with a group and never saw one behemoth.  I was lucky to get the clay for free from a Reaver group that was there at the time.  Since then I have been on 3 different reaver raids for our guild and we have gotten half a dozen clay's.  In my opinion your best bet is to try and squeeze into a reaver raid group.  Not only will you have a chance of grabbing the clay but your basically guaranteed to run into Lord Ghiosk and you can grab your three books from him for your epic.  Also pages you need for the step before Ghiosk will drop randomly on mobs spawning around the reavers that need to be kept clear.  Plus helping some folks on a reaver raid and making friends is always good to do.  You never know who will be around when it's time to take out Rak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">maybe it's just my stupid luck......but:<br />
Every time i'm in CoM for xp or whatever there is strange ocre clay as a ground spawn in the stables area.  if you head towards the stables and make a left you'll go under an arch way and past two rooms.  ahead is a ramp with two spawns on the ground and one on the second floor (up the ramp).  anyhoo at the feet of the mob on the right (lower area) there is always a ground spawn and i pick up...you guessed it: strange ocre clay.<br />
<br />
The area i'm talking about is basically the very lower right part of area &quot;6&quot; on the EQ Atlas map.  Later on i did kill an army behemoth and attempting to loot the clay lead to a lore item message.  No one else seems to be posting this so i hope i didn't just get lucky in a fluke...lemme know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">WOW.  Maybe Verant decided the quest is too much for a lvl 39 spell and added this ground spawn.  I will check it out and report back soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got my clay last night with help from 54 druid.  Behemoth spawned as one of the 3 mobs on the little stage down inside the temple.  54 druid could not single pull him, so we had 3 to deal with.  I killed the behemoth myself no problem, but the adds would have been pretty risky for me solo.<br />
<br />
Probably 5 min after that kill, I went up the ramp inside the temple and found another army behemoth in the room at the top of the ramp, along with other spawns.<br />
<br />
By the way, if you look for him in the temple, be sure to go in the little room to left of stage and pick up the ground spawn high scale icon for the shammy epic.  No mobs in that room, but you need to clear the stage or invis past stage mobs to get in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Seems that he's pretty mobile spawn.<br />
<br />
I've found him several times in the little house in the center past the &quot;goo house&quot; between the two longer houses..it's a small building with columns.  He was alone each time, and that area is VERY easy to reach without fighting: Just swim underwater to the goo house, and jump out to the door (long swim the first time..bring your EB and your water wings)</div></div><hr />
