<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend of mine (bard) pulled statue and got pullstealed.. Here is the discussion with a gm about it:<br />
http://www.oci-cats.com/salorm/loxos1.bmp <br />
<br />
Is this correct of the GM? And when did this rule come into the game? If a guild pulls mob_001 to there camp and I cast additional slow on it and my Main Tank AE Taunts mob_001 so he turns to us,are we then right cause we have the most aggro anyway? <br />
<br />
This is in no way a flame against any guild or anything, thats why I took away the guildnames involved. This is just a question if this &quot;rule&quot; have been in the game a long time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually I believe the ruling is if mob is ENGAGED don't touch it. I have trouble believing this is a GM. You might want to follow up with a diiferent GM, or even send email to Customer support. <br />
<br />
Playing a Shaman I can take away a mob from a tank at just about any point I want. I guess that means they don't have &quot;Full Aggro&quot; hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wontonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the guide or GM had said it clear, that &quot;proximity aggro&quot; is over rule by &quot;melee agro&quot;. That means, who ever first damaged the mob, or cast a spell directly on the mob has the right to finish off the mob, unless they wiped, then others can move in.<br />
<br />
In your case, the bard clearly stated that he only aggro the room, but he didn't shoot at the statue directly to land the first direct attack. When the statue is pulled pass the other raid force, their melee/caster landed a direct melee attack on Statue and gian agro. Since they landed the FIRST DIRECT ATTACK on statue, they become the rightful raid force to claim statue.<br />
<br />
That'd been VT's policy for quiet a while. I know it isn't fair, and a lot of raid force isn't very happy about it. But wasting your breath argue with the GM won't get you anywhere.  :(<br />
<br />
Edit: Sarlom, Use the example you listed in your post. If their puller didn't land a direct attack on Mob when he pull, and you cast a slow on the mob when it ran pass your camp. You became the first to land a direct attack thus the mob become yours. It is a KS in most of the players' eye. But if they bring the case to Verant they won't do a thing about it.<br />
<br />
If your Tank use AE taunt when the mob run pass you camp, but their Monk turn around and throw a throwing weapon at the mob and landed, Then even if the mob ran into your camp they can call GM and say you KS them.  As long as they have the log to proof their monk landed the first attack. Since as the GM said, &quot;proximity aggro is over rule by melee agro&quot;, AE taunt is proximity aggro, and a throwing weapon did damaged the mob is Melee aggro. So they win, you lost if this is the case.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whoever gets the first hit in has it.  If the monk &quot;tagged&quot; the statue with a shuriken before your bard did any damage it was rightfully theirs by SOE's policy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hiho,<br />
<br />
this is a bad ruling IMHO. The only way to find out if the bard pulling really did have &quot;melee aggro&quot; would be to melee aggro statue yourself.<br />
Now: Even if he got melee aggro you just might outdamage him. This would have been stealing the mob and you would get a warning (and maybe more).<br />
<br />
If you don't apply any &quot;rules&quot; and just go by the stuff that happened, most will agree that this was in fact kill stealing. It's very clear that you cleared the way to Statue and did pull him not by accident but to bring it to your raid force and kill it. Only way to avoid those situations is to talk with the other guild(s) involved and try to prevent such a thing for the next time.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<br />
&quot;1. You may not steal kills.<br />
<br />
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission.<br />
<br />
The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy. &quot;<br />
<br />
I could find no mention of melee-agro vs proxi-agro.  I would say Statue was yours due to the fact that it was agro'd and you were prepared to deal with it.  GM botched that one IMO.<br />
<br />
If someone can find other information, feel free to correct me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree, that seemed like a bad ruling on the part of the GM.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as someone said, its much easier for the GM to tell you to f off rather than help. I have seen so many GMs make up &quot;rules&quot; on the spot to avoid dealing with the players. The best thing is when they start to contradict eachother's &quot;rule's&quot; and you point it out to them, they will simply tell you, Have a nice evening and goodbye!  :D <br />
<br />
I'm sorry that this happened to you, it happens to the best of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think they try to get law students to be GM's now.  They seem to want their GM's to:<br />
1.  Say as little as possible, while using as many words as possible<br />
2.  Maximize problem resolution time while minimizing game impact<br />
3.  Refer to PNP and EULA as many times possible, without having to actually read either agreement<br />
4.  Apologize as many times possible for not being able to help the customer without actually learning your job or proposing changes to company CS policy, gameplay or quest resolution</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First to Actively Engage is pretty much the only rule they even think about considering, in my experience... and with reason.  Mainly this is in effect, I believe, to prevent people from kiting a mob around and claiming that they have exclusive rights to it.  i.e. Lodizal, Gorenaire, etc...<br />
<br />
Now in this particular case, it's damn ****ty of whoever did it to have swiped your pull, since you apparently did have a force in place, but GMs will rarely do anything about that sort of thing after the fact.  IF the GM was there and witnessed what happened, I'd be sorely dissapointed if he didn't force the other guild to back down but that's the breaks and why many guilds petition in advance when racing for a mob.  The downside to that is that they often just force a roll on who gets first shot and any ideas of a fair race is blown since it's all up to chance and the RNG at that point.<br />

That's the general idea of KS. However, things get more complicated in real world so Sony had given their GM some specific guide line on how to handle these kind of incident. <br />
<br />
If follow the rule above, what if a monk is FD pulling trying to split up the pull? The mob isn't fighing or pursuing anyone, so it's up for grab?<br />
<br />
Now, I am not trying to say what happened above isn't KS. It looks very much like a KS to me(thou I can't firmly say it, since I'm not there and don't know anything except things posted above). But what I'm trying to do is remind those who don't know, that this is the rule GMs will follow. Better let your puller know about this and remember this when they pull. Do something, some form of damage if possible to scure the pull rather than wasting your breath argue with the GM after the Mob had been KSed by other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I view it as a KS, I'm sure most players view it as a KS, and apparently by the last person's post, the rules seem to say it was a KS. But, the GM didn't feel that way, so you got the shaft. But, I don't know about anyone else, I know I always make sure to do some damage to the mob so people know it's taken, and because the aggro will hold more than prox aggro. If you ever spent time in Rathe, you learn why, as in if anyone sees a giant at 100%, it's getting attacked, whether you have it slowed, or rooted, or whatever, unless you do some damage first (and quickly too), it's getting taken from you. Don't make it right, but that's the way it goes at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;What you did was not a pull. They did not steal your pull.&quot;<br />
<br />
And in the pnp its stated: &quot;Kill stealing is defined as the killing of an npc that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission.&quot;<br />
<br />
So judging by pnp, it was 100% a kill steal, since the statue was pursuing the bard to a prepared raid force.<br />
<br />
Melee agro over proximity agro...that's bull**** imho. Whoever is the first on the actual agro list has the right to kill the mob, if he's prepared to kill it.<br />

This is just mind-bogglingly asinine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Giffaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This Stuff about Kill stealing has come up alot for me in the Needlite room, in the echo caverns. I get in to heated talks with other players about &quot;camp stealing&quot; vs &quot;Kill stealing&quot; I have found that many people have a limited understanding about what &quot;Kill stealing&quot; is.  I got in to a fight with a &quot;Drood&quot; who was powerleveling his alt. I had been in the room for about an hour alone, then this &quot;Drood&quot; shows up and has his &quot;alt&quot; attack some of the needlites that where respawing. I thought this was rude, but was okay because there is no such thing as a &quot;camp&quot;  I can't clame the whole room, just clame the Needlilte that I hit first or had chasing me, that one was mine. That worked till the 3d one, I cast slow on the needlite on the far side of the room and it was comming at me, I started to cast my DD spell, and the &quot;Drood's alt&quot; came over and started to melee it, I pointed out that he was now Kill stealing my kill, and he told me to get lost because he was here first and that if i DD he kills again (remember i was casting a DD spell while he attacked so my DD when off just a few sec after the first weapon hit, this was after my slow was on it) any way, He told me he would report me if I did this again because I was the one Kill stealing him.<br />
<br />
After a heated debate it turned in to a free for all trying to fight for the bugs, I gave up because I play the game to let the stress out from work, not make some more for myself after hours.<br />
<br />
I have seen the quote the PNP states about  Kill stealing,  it is a shame that some times spells that make agro are not seen, not all spells that are cast on the creature cause damage, but the creatures don't seem to care they chase/attack you just the same.<br />
<br />
I see it like this, I could be wrong, but if I was in a store shoping, and some one came in and I wanted to fight them for some reason, I could walk up to them and smack them on the head and then the fight would start, or, I could just get close and then cast some nasty saying in their direction about them and they would then come after me and fight me, the end is the same right ?<br />
<br />
(i have been playing since the release, I have not played every day or for weeks at a time, and I have only made it to levle 40 as my high, so remember that I have never seen the end game nor do i pretend to, I just wanted to share a moment that was a kill steal, that I think I would have lost if it went to a GM, by the log that was posted above)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think this simply boils down to what's verifiable by a GM. A melee attack, casting a spell etc directly on a mob will produce a msg that would be logged and can be verified by a gm going threw the logs. On the other hand pulling another mob in the area to aggro the room or proximity aggroing most likely doesn't produce a msg thats logged and/or not enough information to prove that you aggroed first.<br />
<br />
Yes what the other guild did is pretty crappy but sometimes it simply boils down to what you can prove and with out a direct interaction with the mob in question you can't prove you where the first one to engage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Such a situation is already covered in the writen rules :<br />
<br />
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission.<br />
<br />
Please note that it says &quot;prepared to engage&quot;, not &quot;preparing to engage&quot;... so the lone druid kiting Lodi around waiting for his friends to zone in isn't prepared to engage, he is merely preparing and as such has no claim under the rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Was once told that to be considered 'engaged' with the mob you have had to do actually damage, via spell or weapon, OR have 'attempted' damage, aka swing and miss.  <br />
<br />
There are two sides to this rule.  The obvious downside being the KS that was stated above.  However the 1st damage rule has also worked the other way around when some one has 'pulled' a mob, had it aggro and run, w/o doing damage, but with attempted damage, to have it 'stolen' via proximity/social aggro.  Can go both ways.  <br />
<br />
It's just some people use the PNP to twist it to fit their purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kaedae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">*shrug* We've personally had it go either way, especially with highly social mobs such as the statue. If you have bards pull often they ought to invest in the boa****ll bellow aa, it's a random 10-50 damage dd w/ a 0 sec stun that's instant cast w/ a 300 someodd range. pretty decent for situations such as these especially if this is a GM you have to deal with rather often.</div></div><hr />

I have actually no idea how many boards its been posted on as its not my guild who got screwed. I just wanted to hear what rules there was for a pull and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Cant really decide wether or not this is a KS without knowing more facts about it tbh.  Reading the logs is irrelevant as the view from the bard is always going to be one sided, and therefore you cant see what was happening with the other guild.<br />
<br />
Also, we have no idea of the make-up of the 35 odd people?  Did they have all the classes needed? They could well have been trying to kite with the bard whilst waiting for more.  Especially if they didnt have enough healers etc for AoW attempt.<br />
<br />
I would be less cynical over the logs here, but I have seen too many guilds pull ****e like that and use bards to aggro mobs just to stop another guild with a proper raid force from having the mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tarradar has it right though, most likely DMG can be verified in a log, where as proximity aggro cant be.  <br />
<br />
P.S  On a side note, on Veeshan the lead gm has stated that if a guild kills vindi, they have rights to staute idol aow etc, and they treat it as a spawn cycle much like cursed and AL.  GM is probably in the wrong here too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Dannymay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">okay here is how I see it<br />
obviously the 2 guilds involved had cleared their own side of arena and was both pulling toward statue.<br />
lets say guild A is on left side, Guild B is on right.<br />
<br />
This much we can asume because to me knowlage thats the only place people pull the statue.<br />
<br />
Guild A decides that in order to win the race they will pull all of the statue room including guards and trash mobs. Thus ending the race and giving them the mob yay guild A. Errr no.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me tell you a little story.<br />
I have seen this rule before and it does exist, same thing happened to me a looong time ago when I was in burning woods at the giant fort, that named poped that drops treeweave, cant actually remember its name off top of my head aint been there in ages.<br />
Well I play a necro at the time lvl 56 pushing close to 60, and there was a druid there maybe around the same level not sure.<br />
<br />
Anyway I go in and see the named at the back of the room in the hut at the back on the right (excuse me if u dont know the zone). Well there is only a few mobs in there so I target the mob next to it and pull with snare, I end up getting the named and 2 anciants and an arbor. Np really i can handle it. So i get them out of the fort first comes the anciant and the arbor while the named and my snared mob is stuck in the wall (they will warp on me soon).<br />
<br />
So i get a snare on the 2 mobs running at me and then wait for the other 2 to pop on me, only the other anciant comes.. hmm strange I thought. so I get them under control and go back and to the right of the fort there is the druid root dotting the Named. BAHHH /petition this drood stole my mob!!<br />
<br />
Back in these days customer service was alot better and so within 10 mins we had a GM in front of us. He came up with the same thing, as far as he was concerned I had go the named as an add, I did no damage to it and so it was assisting the other mob and not as such agro on me. /boggle<br />
<br />
As it happened the druid told me the named only droped an opal and so I didnt care really, and after that me and that same druid became good friends and PLing my new main a few month later :)<br />
Happy ending, hes now one of my closest friends.<br />
<br />
But the point is the rule is there, and its there for a reason, the reason to stop people pulling tons of mobs in order to grab the one that can drop the ph4t l3wt.<br />
<br />
Not nice how it worked out for guild A, and guild B was not exactly playing Nicely (but not breaking the rule). I think guild A and B should be locked in a room and forced to play nicely. make a statue roter or something :))<br />
<br />
AOW gimp anyhow, my guild just killed RZ, we pwn joo all!!</div></div><hr />
