<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I've seen several people mention this bug where the raid system causes crashing to desktop or being unable to pull up the raid window. I had this problem myself, any time someone passed any leadership or looting abilities to me I would crash to the desktop. They made some changes to the UI and did not bother to tell those of us that use custom UI's. You can either load the default skin or fix your mod by doing the following (NOTE: I'm at work so I don't have the exact source to look at, these are just the things that changed you'll have to compare to the files in your default skin directory for the source code to add):<br />
<br />
EQUI_animations.xml<br />
You'll need to add the following animations if they don't already exist:<br />
a_checkboxnormal<br />
a_checkboxpressed<br />
<br />
<br />
EQUI.xml<br />
You'll need to add the raidwindow and raidoptionwindow to the list.</div></div><hr />
