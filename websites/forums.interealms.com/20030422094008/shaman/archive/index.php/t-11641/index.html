<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubdaink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I'm new to these boards and new to the shaman class.  My shaman is currently level 19 and twinked slightly (800hp, 440ac, 165ish wis), and I like him way better than my other characters.  I think I'll be staying with him for a long time.  I'm gathering some money for some future upgrades for him, I was thinking a Fungi staff (the must equip version of it), a horse, or a JBB.  I know I should eventually get all of these, but which should I get first?  Also, would an Ikky regen BP effect  stack with fungal regrowth? (don't have the BP yet, also plan to get that soon).  Any info would be helpful, thanks :)<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
also had a question, when your on a horse, can you cast that form of the bear spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Of the items you have listed, the Horse will help the most : Siting mana regen while standing/casting in outdoor zones is godly useful. And it will help you imediately upon purchasing it. Buying a cheap gluepot (8-9k version) is the best money any casting class can spend. As to using it with bear form : unfortunately, that is a no-go. Horses only work with the various models that you turn on under options before loging in (and with skeleton form).<br />
<br />
Fungi staff isn't nearly as good as it used to be, since they nerfed/fixed the stacking bug on it. It will stack with the Ikky BP effect. It won't stack with the regen spells you can cast on yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The JBB won't function till level 45 so you can comfortably put it on the back burner for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Getcha the horsie and the Ikky BP.  Thats what I got to twink my shaman in the 30's and man does it change your life!<br />
<br />
Once you get Can and Regen, sit on your horse and downtime=0<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ubdaink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Got the tan rope horse and an Iksar regen BP.  One of the complains with the horse is, HP dosn't seem to regenerate as if your sitting, is this supposed to happen or are horses bugged in some way?</div></div><hr />
