<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elessar Elfstone</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can honestly say I've been having a blast with this new expansion. The storyline is cool so far, although reading further into it, it seems completely bugged/messed up which sucks, but is cool so far. I'm not just killing a big god/monster/guardian for no reason, there's usually some motivation behind it for some reason or another.<br />
<br />
The best for me so far, has been learning the fairly challenging encounters and adapting to them as a team. Our first attempts on Aerin'Dar, Grummus, Terris Thule, Manaetic Behemoth, and Jeplak all were unsuccessful, but we always rezzed up and killed em the next try or soon after. Terris Thule was probably my favourite fight so far, loved the surprises in the fight. All the fights have been pretty fun, and somewhat innovative initially, but once you learn the encounter the fun is kind of lost :( . But thats the nature of this game I suppose. I cant wait to try out some of the stuff in Drunder, as well as the other zones we've opened up.<br />
<br />
The parchment shortage is kind of stupid, causing a lot of friction, but that will go away with time thankfully. ;)<br />
<br />
So anyways, how are you all enjoying The Planes of Power?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kohpry Mossarrow</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish the PoJ trials were more like the hedge maze flag quest in Nightmare, but that's probably because I'm an officer and just want everyone to be flagged for PoS and PoV already and be done with it.  We still have some people who don't play as often to push through, and unfortunately when they do log on, we tend to be in the middle of a raid.  :(<br />
<br />
Wish the gnome in PoI would stop poofing, zone agro would stop being messed up, or the zone itself crashing whenever we go and try to get the other half of the guild flagged, that annoys me, too.<br />
<br />
Other than that, it's been pretty good.  My personal favorite for zones right now is Storm, though we've also been messing around quite a bit in Terris's lair, too.  PoP's been beneficial in another way, in that it's easier to nab Velious and Luclin bosses because people are distracted by the new expansion.  Considering we've competed with about eight other guilds to some degree for said-mobs, that's a nice side-effect of PoP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shooteneq1</div><div class="date">12-08-2002, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">our guild is really enjoying PoP as well. Some of the flags are a time sink but pail in comparison to getting emp and VT key. Loot has been nice and the fact alot of it is tradeable is even better. i really like the idea of the scripts where only a certain amount of people are able to do the flag. prevents zerg and actually makes people use skill and strategy to do things. Also with all the new high lvl zones it has really freed alot of zones up and has stopped alot of the non stop head to head clashes between guilds on servers. i dont know about everyoen elses server but our we have 3 guilds that have killed emporer. as you can imagine we woudl all bump heads alot. now that pop has been out i cant remember the last time we all clashed over a target. everyday is a raid day now as theres allways somethign up and that in itself has made pop very enjoyable</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daesun</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the fact that most of the warriors that make it into PoV/PoS actually have decent enough gear to hold aggro, unlike the ones LFG in the first tier planes.  :)<br />
<br />
The positive side of that is that I get to demonstrate how root aggro works.. hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I first got to PoP I was amazed, I liked it. I got it a bit late so a lot of the initial info such as how to get access to Plane of Valor and Plane of Storms was already spoiled and I got my flags pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
With access to PoV experience came quickly and it wasnt too long before I was level 65 and had all my 61+62+earthen root spells. Since I had been slacking in the AA department I figured I'd grind exp at bit more to get AM3 and such. That didnt take too long either, but made me sick of PoV.<br />
<br />
I then fooled around a bit in pick up groups in PoI, PoD and PoN, but quickly found that the experience I got there was so laughable compared to PoV, so that fun didnt last very long.<br />
<br />
I decided that to get my level 63 and 64 spells I would have to gain access to Halls of Honor, so I started working on the access quest, I knew it would take a while to complete so when opportunity presented itself I leeched a flag off my former guild's Aerin'Dar kill (with permission of course).<br />
This was right after the Windblade nerf, but that didnt bother me too much, I just wanted my spells. I then found it insanely hard to find pickup groups there, due to the fact that so few(3 guilds at the time) people had access, and of course they mostly made their HoH groups in advance which left little room for me. I went there a few times with friends and once managed to get into a pickup group. I got two spectrals before the final nerf and havent seen one since. Add to that I wasnt exactly lucky and got Earthen root(again!!!!) and Nature's Rebuke. I rarely come there <br />
anymore, it just doesnt seem worth it.<br />
<br />
Next zone up was Plane of Storms, and I must say I have really enjoyed this zone too. The variety of mobs is nice and the loot aswell. I found out about the drops from the flying turkey thingies and finally found somewhere I could get upgrades to my equipment with just one group. I then proceeded to lose every random on several cloaks and one belt. Then they nerfed it, so bugger, too late...again.<br />
<br />
I still like the zone and is currently working on my Bastion of Thunder key, though I doubt I'll get it, and if I do, I probably wont really have a use for it, since from what I hear you need more than one group to do anyhting in there.<br />
<br />
At the same time I'm also working on my Crypt of Decay key and Plane of Tactics key using the quest methods, but from what I can tell it will be the same as Halls of Honor. Going there once in a while with friends but unable to get any sort of pickup group there.<br />
<br />
That's enough babbling about my journey in Planes of Power with the conclusion being that if you arent guilded then PoP have little to offer in terms of long time enjoyment and I suspect that it wont be long before I get tired of the game. Possibly also has something to do with that fact that being a powergamer and unguilded doesnt mix very well.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

Better then that Vex Thal shard crap:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaysenn Stormra</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trials are annoying the bejusus out of me. New zone XP is nice, drops are a little crappy, and I'm thinking they're going to have to do a load more CT style zone conversions once PoS and PoV start filling up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bronwyn Stormcaller</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild pretty much stopped raiding once PoP came out - everybody became obsessed with levelling again, and being only in the mid 50's, getting groups with them became difficult.<br />
<br />
Then of course getting groups without them's always been a pain.<br />
<br />
Now the lovable guild leader's stepped down, we lost direction, and people are leaving.<br />
<br />
I'm a little bitter about PoP - the port-books are nice, but not worth losing a great guild over.  I'm still baffled over how it all happened.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aizle</div><div class="date">12-10-2002, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far PoP has been great as far as I'm concerned.<br />
<br />
However, I think that I'm glad that I waited a while before buying it.  Mainly so I could read posts here about reactions to it, and plan accordingly.<br />
<br />
The books are just plain awesome.  It's so nice to be able to reasonably get somewhere without pestering every druid and wizard along the way.<br />
<br />
The exp in the 1st tier zones is how exp should be IMHO.  The exp is fast enough that the occasional deaths aren't the end of the world.  The corpse repop to zone in is just awesome and encourages you to take some risks and explore.  No evil CR's is a good thing.  The fact that &quot;phat lewt&quot; doesn't drop much in the 1st tier zones is a good call, peeps are there for exp grinding and move on when they are done or want loot.  I really haven't seen anything in the way of griefing or loot camping so far.<br />
<br />
At this point, I'm one of the higher level toons in my guild at lvl 60.  Because of this and other posts about how much of the old world greens out at 61, I'm doing %100 aa until more of my guild catches up to me.  Therefore, PoP is a great spot to grind some AA's now and then, but I can still hang out with guildies at old haunts and get exp.  Overall a good mix at this point for me.  I sympathise with those that grinded to 65 immediately and now don't get any exp from hanging out with their guild.</div></div><hr />

Done flagged for CoD,HoH,BoT. I kinda like BoT, something about killing giants i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanandrin</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trials are being a  bitch.  Plain and simple.  My guild can't seem to find the right combination of people to get anyone flagged and its starting to piss alot of people off.  The rest of us think its cool, but it really has screwed the old world hard core.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corilleous</div><div class="date">12-11-2002, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoP is a lot of fun and a nice change of pace.  Looking forward to seeing what else is out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xzar</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is by far my favorite expansion yet. It really brings the group aspect of the game back. I really got sick of seeing so many bots being used for duoing/plvling aa's.<br />
Raiding is alot more difficult, and enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renwin Everfool</div><div class="date">12-14-2002, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a few  thoughts to this expansion.<br />
<br />
1) I like the fights, the mobs, the graphics<br />
2) I hate the spell drops<br />
3) I hate having to do keys and flags for every freakin zone.<br />
<br />
Verant suckered everyone so smooth its funny. They wanted to make it seem like there was no VT key quest (Or a  ST or VP key quest even). Its there, its just broken up into a zone-by-zone ladder. Its still a freakin time sink if you want to get to the end of the expansion super zone. Camping shards sucked..but so does camping weak 2nd tier spawns to get to the 3rd tier, or completing keys to get to the flag for the next tier, followed by another key for another flag, ect.<br />
<br />
Its the same old junk, but done differently. I try not to think about it, but its lame. Oh well, graphics are nice. /shrug<br />
