Instead of going without any facts, like you have, I'll prove why shamans are doing quite well in PoP.<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryn, Blood of Saryn, new focus, new pet, new haste...  if you were hinting that the new PoP AA for shamans are lame, I agree; rabid bear reduced by 12 minutes isn't anything amazing. However, the good outweighs the evil.<br />

<br />
You are a tool.<br />
The fact that our &quot;New&quot; focus costs an ass load of mana to cast, appears to be single target atm, and only have 50hps more than Krags, means its ****. Oh I guess you missed that... <br />
Why DONT YOU get the facts first you no talent for a flaming whore...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Close gandalfh, it's Velious +5% effect.<br />
<br />
Kamfool, have you actually looked at the new focus (not to mention the new stat buffs)? You really think it's something to be happy about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I stand corrected. Focus of the Seventh has been changed yet again. It's now something around 580 HP 70 str 60 Dex 1800 mana and it's group version now. That's much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh look, guess who's right again. Surprise.<br />
<br />
Jing, I don't like the idea of stat buffs, however they are useful because the cap will be raised.<br />
<br />
Icklymuk... &quot;Why DONT YOU get the facts first you no talent for a flaming whore...&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't want to get mean here, so I'll just quote you. We're all friends, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lucy shows, 544, which is a little more than 100hps more than focus. Sorry its nothing to write home about. Lets not mention the screwed up time on this spell, as it stands.<br />
8pt increases in our stat buffs?<br />
I can nitpick our current spells to death, which they deserve, but its nothing that hasn't been said in 5 other posts by now...<br />
<br />
Again I stand by what I say...<br />
<br />
kamfool1 care for some pudding?<br />
<br />
What fo7should be...<br />
<br />
600hps<br />
75str/Dex/Agil 55sta<br />
2hour duration<br />
1700 mana...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Our new spells do suck.  I will STILL use the old group spells to buff people.  I suggest we get some useful ones.<br />
<br />
Khuras still is the best.<br />
Primal essence is better then agi buff (adds stm)<br />
AC buff is ok but capped so its pointless after a point<br />
Wheres our regrowth upgrade<br />
Wheres our cripple line upgrade<br />
Wheres the REAL DR slow at 75 percent????????  After Malo, OOS, Tash, your tugurs almost always lands.  <br />
Wheres the real upgrades to fire/cold/magic on duration?<br />
Wheres the real meat and potatoes????<br />
<br />
You wait to 64 for a new dot<br />
You get a new DD at 61 which is sub par<br />
You get a crap 65 torpor upgrade which... is crap, now if it healed 600 per tick for 5 ticks.... THATS what we need.  As it is at 65 the mobs hit so hard our lv65 ultimate healing spell is maybe one swipe of a end game mob, and you give us 24 seconds to heal that?!??! please<br />
<br />
I am truely disappointed in the shaman class compared to a wizard.  Seems that manaburn = EQ nowdays.  <br />
<br />
Wheres our LURE DOTS (always land)<br />
Wheres our LURE SLOWS (always land)<br />
<br />
This is what I want.  LURE dots and LURE slows.   Think verant can make this happen?  Peak my interest with more then +8 pt upgrades to stats and a snareless torpor and a DR/PR buff that lasts half as long and still is ass.  Please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You want nothing but upgrades, huh? How about equality? Druids were meant to be healers and pure hitpoint buffers, second to clerics; they are. Improved PoTG and Tunare's Renewal have shown that. Shamans were meant to be debuffers and dotters. They are, as shown by improved Malo and the PoP dots, specifically Blood of Saryn, which does 53 dps alone. Your insults are baseless and hold no water. I'm sorry that your debating skills are limited to that of uneducated scum.<br />
<br />
Instead of trying to improve an already balanced class (in my opinion, anyway -- I don't whine about everything), how about trying to fix broken classes, specifically magicians? Summoning rods isn't fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1) Magicians rock.  They can outdamage anyone when paired with a priest.<br />
<br />
2) Druids don't deserve to heal more efficiently than Shaman.  Torpor was always king.<br />
<br />
3) Shamans DoT look a lot better on paper (well, they are better if you can land them) but in fact get resisted a lot more.  Druid DoT get -100 to resist (see http://lucy.fnord.net/) while Shaman get a big fat 0 on their resist checks.  Necros get -200 to resist on their pure HP DoTs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm talking about raiding magicians. A magician in an exp group does a ****ton of damage with their pet and nukes and all that. Really, I think that they're one of the best classes outside of raiding. However, mages have one key function in the high end: summoning mod rods. Look straight up, summon hundreds of mod rods, die, get your corpse dragged somewhere, get rezzed, CoH 50 people, and summon more rods. That's how it was before the VT patch anyway, but I'm not sure that the current situation is better than the former. If you want to get more in depth about magicians, say so, but this is a shaman forum...<br />
<br />
Uman said &quot;Druids don't deserve to heal more efficiently than Shaman. Torpor was always king.&quot; I disagree. Torpor and kraggs are much different than Tunare's Renewal. Torpor is a heal over time spell. Druids don't have one. That means that, while torpor is on a character, a shaman can also cast another heal. They supplement each other very well. The more common arguement is slow. Slow, however, is resistable, and causes the caster to get aggro. In addition to resists, there are slow immune mobs. However, one class can't be fit for all situations.<br />
<br />
Imagine taking a group of 1 warrior, 1 wizard, 1 rogue, and 1 shaman. All four characters have very good equipment and over 100 aa points each. That's my standard group. We can clear all of juggs and trak's lair, including the reets, because a shaman plays many more roles than just a druid. Now imagine a group of the same classes, except replace the shaman with a druid. Not only would your melee be lacking haste (assuming that both of them don't have an eyepatch of plunder, which is only 20% haste), but you'd also be lacking a key element to all groups: healing power. Druids don't have enough mana regeneration to keep up against unslowed mobs all the time, even with the new heal. A shaman does. Infact, most of the time, I was above 75% mana and tabbed out reading the boards instead of playing my character. Why? Being a shaman is cake.<br />
<br />
About shaman dots and their resists. I agree, the spells are too susceptible(sp?) to being resisted, however that's the way it always has been and, unfortunately, I don't expect it to change. However, shamans have resistance debuffs to cause other spells to be resisted less... things like root and other spells, besides dots. While a druid may be able to dot a mob to his heart's content, the wizard beside him is getting resisted crazily because a debuff isn't in. The shaman can cast sini and both spells have an advantage.<br />
<br />
So, until next time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, actually the point was to add a little humor. Maybe I have a twisted/sub-standard/off-base/whatever sense of humor, but I thought the dinner reference was funny :p <br />
<br />
<br />
Although, I have to admit, I am a little disappointed at how the thread immediatly (IE, first response) sunk into flames and personal attacks.<br />
<br />
So, what would you like for dinner? :D</div></div><hr />
