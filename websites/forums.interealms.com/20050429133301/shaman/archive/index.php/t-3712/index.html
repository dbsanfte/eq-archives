&quot;It's had an excellent few weeks overall on the Test Server and we'll be running it on the Live servers in an optional mode until we're satisfied with it. We'll give details about how to turn these options on in the patch message.&quot;<br />

I can not click on spell icons, hotkeys or the pages in my spell book.  If I right click I get the little info submenu, but can not choose any of the options.  I can however click to resize my windows and mouseover works.  Sigh.    And I liked the new menu if for nothing else the extra spells per page in the book!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone know any others? I would have thought there would be a forum or two up by now with people disscussing how to change stuff.<br />
<br />
Ive got a few issues I need to sort out and I'm sure I'll figure out how to do it eventually, then I'll be happy.<br />
<br />
- The windows all felt too bulky so I changed my res to a higher one, the windows are a better size now but /chatfontsize isnt sensitive enough to give me a font size I can read comfortably. /chatfontsize 4 is too small and 5 is huge :/ Hoping theres a way to change the font or fontsize in the xml.<br />
<br />
If not then I'm going to have to find versions of windows that are less bulky and go back to my old res. This might be tricky, the spell gem bar is far too big for me to put it where I like to have it (bottom of the screen to the side of my chat box) when in a lower res, its bordering on too big in a high res :/<br />
<br />
- I adjusted the size of the buff window and locked it then had a hell of a time trying to click on it to get a cursor to adjust it again, had to change res a few times to be able to unlock it. Doh<br />
<br />
- I thought I was getting clever and could remove the ornate borders on the chat windows - well I did manage to remove them but then I couldnt select the window on its sides to resize it so had to put them back :/ I dont like those scrolls on the chat windows at all - I will find a way to get rid of them!<br />
<br />
- I downloaded the slimline inventory from the url above, its nice but I need to make it wider as whoever made it didnt count on having xxxx/xxxx HP - it doesnt fit :/<br />
<br />
Edit: aha! Ive noticed someones added a Compact Boxes set on the Complete Sets page, that looks like it solves my scrolly borders aversion, woo!<br />
<br />
Edit2: updated url of that site, had the old home page linked to start with</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with everything you said, Seredith.  What's the point of NAMING the chat box or the buff box?  Takes up valuable screen real estate!<br />
<br />
There are lots of things to love though, the ability to hover the cursor over your buff to see what it is, no more right clicking!  Of course, I despise the fact that if you leave your cursor over your can IV spell gem, a blue box pops up informing you that it's Can IV.  Or, if you leave your mouse hovered over someone's name in the group box, you get a large blue box giving their name and the percentage of their health.  I can see why that might be useful, but I'm not a big fan of obtrusive stuff.</div></div><hr />

If I remember right their is a switch for pop up's ... would imagin that you would just have to remove the popup from that item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The entire new UI is designed to be as obtrusive and bloated as it possibly can be.<br />
Has good features but even at 1024x768 the spell icons are still too large.<br />
Then again all I wanted was the 8 page spell book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the only impressive thing VI acomplished with the release of the UI was figuring out how to get bazaar to support over 300 players at once.  This was not worth waiting 9 months after they worked on luclin for at least 2 weeks before they shipped it.  There was absolutely no reason what they produced took that long, at all.  Unfortunately VI doesn't give a damn about it's customers cause they've got the best game on the market, and it doesn't matter how bad they treat us, cause we all keep paying for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I personally like the new icons.   I like how there's a &quot;dreamcatcher&quot; over the sheild for shaman hp line buffs; clerics have a half-red heart with a hand for their hp buff; resist buffs are much easier defined (flame over shield for fire, snow for cold, etc.); endure breath has lungs... No more 7 yellow shields.   Things are much more defined.   Yes, it'll take some time recognizing everything, but overall it's good.<br />
<br />
The only thing I don't like is the gem for the Canni line.   I miss the blue head.   KEI buff is also something else that doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
On Test, the spell gems were odd shaped and squishy.  Very hard to look at.   I'm glad they inflated them. <br />

Now they need to include /hitsmode as a chat box option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the BEST change I've found so far:  Right click on the top bar of a window, and go to Alpha.<br />
<br />
You can then set the level of fade and normal view for each window.  <br />
<br />
Moce windows I have set to 0 fade and 0 normal so they are invisible.  My chat I set to 50 on both.  (Basicly re-creating the semi-transparent chat screen of the old UI.)</div></div><hr />

I'm sure they will fix it. That seems to be a somewhat popular card as it is and it would be a pretty stupid idea for them to ignore the problem completely. And don't forget. This is just another &quot;beta&quot; step for the new UI. They stated that they wanted to test it out on a wider range of people. And they did make it optional so you can still go back to the old UI if the new one isn't working out for you at the moment. I know lots of real life friends that wont use it because for some reason it lags horribly when they go to the inventory. This was a problem I actually had, until i upgraded to Windows XP and then I never had the problem again.</div></div><hr />

You can make a chat box that weeds out everything but melee attacks.  I haven't figured out if you can make it so you could have seperate windows for yours and others attacks though...</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I load the new interface I make it all the way to the character selection screen.  I select Tawnay and &quot;enter world&quot; and then get almost immediately booted to desktop.  Happens every time, the same way, without fail.    When I turn the interface off, I can get in fine.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love it when they update things but, my computer knowledge is pretty limited and they make these things almost impossible to figure out for someone like me.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas that I can test out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I like the New UI a great deal. I think the Spell Icons are much more concise and the image gives a better representation of the spell does. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">one of the best changes to EQ by far is the FULL SCREEN SPELLBOOK!<br />
<br />
i so hated having to go to windowed mode to get spells.....this is a dream come true. and it's great that you can have 2x8 spells per page instead of the old 2x5.....although it took me like 20 mins to re-arrange my spellbook :p <br />
<br />
by the way, does anyone know how to turn off the stupid fade? i don't want it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">One of my guildmates summed up the new spell icons with this statement: &quot;The new spell icons belong on the Carebears instead of in EQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought that was pretty funny.<br />
<br />
I like the new UI overall, but there's some things I'd like to change. I want my 5 spells per page back!! I had my most used spells memorized by what page number they're on. Is this possible to change? Anyone have a link to download it?<br />
<br />
Also, if i cant get the original 5 spells per page, I want the old spell icons back or if possible, both back the old way.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I can't stand the way the new inventory is laid out. I've seen someone that customized it to make it look like the old inventory. I might have to download it.<br />

Well the used spells.  I would just clutter the non used spells in the back of the book.  How many pages does the new one have? there as plenty of space in the old one available.</div></div><hr />

Ya, but the old spell book had the spell icons arranged in an X (2, 1, 2). Doesn't this new one have 2, 2, 2, 2? I'll check into it.<br />

You can adjust the faded and normal values to the same thing. <br />
<br />
Right click on the window you want to change and it should be part of the second option down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The new UI makes lower resolution screen modes quite difficult to use, in addition to it's other drawbacks.  However, I think one of the greatest feature of this new UI is it's extreme customizability.  If you don't like how the new UI looks, it'll only be a matter of time 'till someone comes up with one that works well with lower resolution screens, or looks like the old one :)<br />

A  few people in my guild complained of something like this.  It sounds like quite a few people are having this problem so I would expect it to be fixed soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'm using a Geforce 4 Ti 4400 and when I tried the new UI in &quot;Single Layer&quot; sky mode, I was getting some frame ghosting on background scenery, and mob animations.  I switched back to double layer and they went away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Well, after playing around with the new UI on every continent and with every char (anybody else notice that your window configuration is unique to each character?  Love it!) I HAVE to give this a major thumbs up.  Yeah, they dumbed some of it down .  &quot;group.  target.  hotkeys.  chat&quot;--are we really in need of the labels?<br />
<br />
Spell icons are making sense after a short period of time.  Nice that there are more of them, and some of them look unique (Talis Jasinth / Serpent) so far.<br />
<br />
The bazaar and trader functions are nothing short of orgasmic... particularly after filling in several missing spells from 55,6,7 for 1.2k total.  /drool /twitch.  (BTW, Luna:  thanks again to you and your guild for the offer of Howler!)  My baby gnecro and ranger both similarly benefitted.<br />
<br />
I was amazed that the bazaar on Bristlebane (an old and crotchety server at the best of times) was able to support a load of 507 people at one time.  Verant even provided K-Y jelly and a shoehorn so we could fit them all in.  Lag on my main PC was not as bad as I expected it to be.  On my #2 box, it was still not quite what I'd feared it would be.  Practically no lag increase until the sheer volume of lemmings--er, characters--jacked skyward.<br />
<br />
Hated redoing my spell book, but I am once again happily hotkeyed.<br />
<br />
I had NO graphics problems at all with my Ti 4400, or on my older MX2/400.  In fact, Creative Labs issued updated drivers that I installed on patch morning... and...<br />
<br />
MY MUSIC WORKS AGAIN!!!<br />
<br />
Now for my one question:<br />
<br />
Anybody else want to reach out and STRANGLE the people who zoned into the bazaar and completely ignored the bazaar's new welcome message, and instructions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Birus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I overall love the new ui. Yes the spells will take some time getting used to and so will several other things, but i had to do the same thing when using the old full screen. However the only problem i have had with the new ui is my framerate has bin a bit slower. I haven't really had bad lag, just my framerate is kinda slow and my mouse is slow too and it really bothers me lol. I hope they fix this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I must admit that I do like the new UI but I'm currently looking to:<br />
<br />
a) reduce the non-critical flab (reduce the size of the windows, remove unneeded titlebars)<br />
b) find a way to make the inspect item box appear and disappear as quickly as before.  I don't want to have some box in the middle of the screen by accident whilst trying to slow a high level mob. Yes I know that you can make it vanish quickly but I don't want to click again.. also the fact that the pointer over the window resets it's time to disappear... extremely annoying.<br />
c) I've spent a couple of hours reorganising my spell book - that means I'm getting used to the spells.. but I think there is going to be some great shaman ui skins soon thanks to those blessed by the artistic spirit.. not me then :)<br />
<br />
So all in all great.. but there is some responsiveness/behavioural traits that are extremely annoying when in combat etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Anyone figured out how the stink you find out how much time is left to &quot;un-gray&quot; an AA ability hotkey so you can use it again?  It doesn't work like it used to.  I sit there and pound on the Canni5 key but I never get a message telling me how much time is left until I can fill my mind with the sweet sweet mana I crave at the expense of my lower extremeties.  <br />
<br />
Also my buddy's Dire Charm hotkey also will not give the time left and neither will my MGB hotkey.  This is quite annoying to say the least.  <br />
<br />
That's the major gripe I had with the new UI.  For the most part tho it's a stunningly good change.  <br />

One other minor issue . . when dememming spells if you left click and then right click on them, the buff hangs on your cursor until you pound your mouse a bit.  That's annoying.  The only good way to demem spells now seems to be right clicking once on them.</div></div><hr />

My 2cp on the new UI - I love it. It takes some getting used to, and it took me a couple of hours to arrange all the windows and spells how I wanted them. But overall I'm very impressed.<br />
<br />
To the person who asked if you can change spell icons - the answer is yes. The spell icons are stored in the &quot;UIFiles&quot; (I think that's what it's called) directory inside the EQ directory. All the graphics are TGA (targa) files, and the icons seem to be grouped together with several in one file. I'd make a copy of the entire &quot;Default&quot; directory, and tweak the files in the copy. I assume by changing the setting in the EQClient.ini file, you can change which skin it loads - ie change the &quot;default&quot; to the name of your copy. If that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

Well crap then!  What could it be?<br />
<br />
When I load the new interface I make it all the way to the character selection screen.  I select Tawnay and &quot;enter world&quot; and then get almost immediately booted to desktop.  Happens every time, the same way, without fail.    When I turn the interface off, I can get in fine.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love it when they update things but, my computer knowledge is pretty limited and they make these things almost impossible to figure out for someone like me.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas that I can test out? <br />
<br />
Tawnay, did you read the followup they posted about enabling the new UI in EQ and then camping? Apparently it was causing crash bugs like yours, and they just recommended making the change to the eqclient.ini file manually.  Check your .ini file and see if NewUI=TRUE is set under your [defaults] section.  May not be the problem, but all I can come up with as I run a Ti 4600 with new UI no problems.<br />
<br />
Good luck. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Ive managed to fix quite a few of the issues I had from my original post thanks to all the wonderful people out there sharing mods and skins.<br />
<br />
- Bulky windows and chatfontsize. I havent heard of a way of changing fonts or sizes (other than chatfontsize) so what I did was to use a less bulky skin and went back to a lower resolution. Everythings neater and I can read the text ok, hurrah!<br />
<br />
- losing control of the buff window - havent locked this window to avoid losing the ability to get menus on it again, simple solution!<br />
<br />
- chat windows and those annoying borders - a skin sorted this out for me, as I suspected, yay!<br />
<br />
- Inventory and HP, found a nice mod that puts HP in the player window, lots of them about now. Only problem with this seems to be that once you have HP in one window it wont work in another. So the inventory I have now shows 0/0 HP. Oh well, cant have it all.<br />
<br />
Ive found out which files you need to copy to get another character using the same window positions, tinting etc. UI_charactername_servernumber.ini in the default EQ directory. Copy it, change the character name.<br />
<br />
If like me you hate the texture and want to be rid of it for good even on those windows that you can't turn the texture off of then the graphic files you need to edit are wnd_bg_dark_rock.tga and wnd_bg_light_rock.tga<br />
<br />
Much happier overall now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Oh for Birus with the mouse being too slow, have you tried speeding it up? Theres probably something in options but I used this:<br />
<br />
/mouse 1 (slowest) to /mouse 5 (I think its 5, fastest) <br />
<br />
If like me you're anal about getting your windows all lined up then pop the mouse down to /mouse 1 while youre arranging them, then whack the speed back up, much more control!<br />
<br />
Another top tip, have a play with /viewport - its great! If you wanted to have your stage stop in the top area of your screen and a black area at the bottom of your screen (where you probably have chat boxes etc) then try something like this:<br />
<br />
/viewport 0 0 1152 620 <br />
<br />
(this is for 1152x864 res, adjust depending on your resolution)<br />
<br />
First two numbers are the anchor in the top left of the screen so 0 0 means your 'stage' is anchored firmly in the top left. Second number is how wide, last is how tall.<br />
<br />
To put everything back to a fullscreen effect use:<br />
<br />
/viewport reset<br />
<br />
edit: the viewport thing can be a bit tricky to visualise but its great for those stuggling with getting the transparency right on chat windows, so heres a pic:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">If you change the aspect ratio of the viewport, does everything get distorted? Or do you just see a different amount of the view?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, that's interesting, Seredith.  How would you edit them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Anyone figured out how the stink you find out how much time is left to &quot;un-gray&quot; an AA ability hotkey so you can use it again?<br />
<br />
If you right click the ability you will see two numbers...the one on the left is a static indicating refresh time....the one on the far right (you might have missed it) indicates how much time remaining and is dynamic.</div></div><hr />
