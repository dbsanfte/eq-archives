Ogre. Big, Fat, Stupid, a modicum of common sense. Can use JBB and can't be stunned from the front.  Look pretty cool in Totemic and other armor. (Old models - my opinion)<br />

Clerics sucks imo to play. Its just like watching other people play. All you do is sit sit sit and oh sit. Hit your heal tank macro button every so often and go back to sitting. I dont see how people can have the patience to play clerics...they have to be one of the most boring class to play. Next to mages of course...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So then I CAN play a troll shaman without falling far behind exp wise?  I like idea of fast regen coupled with canni.  So now the question is, is exp penalty for trolls really huge or no?  And could a troll shaman play a secondary healer well?  I like being shaman for healing but also the abilty to do complex tasks as well, such as doting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
aka Stun Immunity :p <br />
<br />
I think the confusion is this:<br />
<br />
As I understand it, there are two components to &quot;stun immunity.&quot;  Ogres cannot be stunned from the front AND their spells are not interrupted when they are bashed.<br />
<br />
When most people think of &quot;stun immunity&quot; they think only of the first component, immunity to stuns.  Because frontal stuns are fairly rare, this does not seem like much of an advantage.  However, if they also are not interrupted from bashes, this is a nice little racial ability to have.  Fully half of my interrupts in some fights come from bashes that do not stun me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As I understand it, there are two components to &quot;stun immunity.&quot; Ogres cannot be stunned from the front AND their spells are not interrupted when they are bashed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Uggok for peets sake you are being  anal.<br />
<br />
What do you think is interupting the spells? The BASH *IS* the STUN, thus interupting the spells.<br />
<br />
Because frontal stuns are fairly rare<br />
<br />
You are kidding right? They are not that rare at lower levels.<br />
<br />
Bah enough I am done.. you are wrong..please move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Targar, relax.  I think you misunderstood me or I was unclear.  I was just trying to clear up a misconception that a lot of people seem to have (as evidenced by this thread).  For Pete's sake, there are a lot of Ogres who misunderstand what frontal stun immunity does.  I was only trying to say two things:<br />
<br />
1- A lot of people think that &quot;immunity from frontal stuns&quot; means only that Ogres never see the &quot;you have been stunned&quot; yellow message when they are facing the mob.  <br />
<br />
2- They are wrong, because Ogres also don't get interrupted on bashes where you do not get the &quot;you have been stunned&quot; message.<br />
<br />
I think it is understandable that people make this mistake.  The most natural reading of the words &quot;stun immunity&quot; is &quot;immunity to stuns&quot; not &quot;immunity to stuns and also by the way bashes are also stuns even though they don't say 'you have been stunned' and don't actually stun you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I had made this mistake until someone told me otherwise, so have tons of people.  It comes up every damn time there is a thread about Ogres.  All I was trying to do was clarify.  Why you felt the need to jump on my ass about it I have no idea.<br />
<br />
As for the frequency, I can only speak of my recent personal experience.  I get interrupted from bashes all the time, even by very low greenies.  I get stunned (from the front) very rarely.  I honestly have no recollection of stun frequency at low levels, I will take your word on it.  However, I seriously doubt that low level shamans get &quot;stunned&quot; nearly as often as they get interrupted from bashes.<br />
<br />
In any event, it is a nice racial ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Uggok is right.<br />
<br />
play a non-ogre caster, and you may see this<br />
<br />
Mob bashes YOU for x points of damage<br />
Your spell is interrupted (in red text, immediately after the bash)<br />
<br />
if you're more unlucky, the bash may also stun you, which will of course interrupt spells. but a bash can also just immediately interrupt a spell you're casting - and this doesn't happen to ogres. the only way melee can interrupt is if you get hit enough and don't make your channeling luck roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Atropos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm a level 60 ogre shaman and I get my spells interrupted from being hit, kicked and bashed from front.  I don't get stunned(where you can't move) from any melee attacks taken from the front.  It all comes down to making the channeling check.  Sometimes I regain my concentration and continue casting other times my casting is interrupted.  Say what you want but ogres are only immune from the stun effect of a frontal attack but their casting still can be interrupted from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It all comes down to this.<br />
<br />
Ogres are immune to melee stuns from the front.<br />
<br />
-AND-<br />
<br />
Red interrupt messages mean you are interrupted with no chance to save.<br />
<br />
Ogres NEVER get red interrupt messages from melee as long as you are facing your enemies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That is what I was talking about...thanks for making it clearer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I logged 200 days as an ogre shaman and I had a blast.  The stun immunity is a lifesaver, and to this day in every MMORPG I've played since then I *STILL* make sure to work my way around a group of mobs to get them all in front of me.  As an ogre shaman, I've been trained in lower sebilis by about 12 - 15 big frogloks, backed myself into a corner and managed to gate.  I've also gated out of Sebilis with Trakanon himself pounding on me.  Just make sure you're facing whatever you're fighting and it's a great boon.<br />
<br />
Of course, at higher levels, regen really helps too.  I haven't played my troll shaman up high enough level to really find out yet, but as an ogre shaman I had no trouble tanking old wurms and elder wyverns in skyfire while my pet, and dots took 'em out.  Also, JBB was nice since no frontal melee stuns.<br />
<br />
IMO, it's a wash, but I do think the ogre shaman has an edge on tanking and melee'ing for their pets while still being able to cast reliably.<br />
<br />
Besides, and I know it's a long way off, but once you get Torpor and Cann 4, troll's regen rates aren't such a huge benefit vs. melee as they had been.   Ogres have a tougher time of it lower levels without regen, but endgame I think it's too close to call.  Personal preference.<br />
<br />
Iksar can't use JBB, but get better armor from hate, and not much competition for it.  (least it was that way a while back).  I dunno much about Vah Shir, but I don't think safe fall &gt; regen OR frontal melee stun immunity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just one more thing.<br />
<br />
As has been said before, ogres can still be interrupted, sure.  Anyone can.  But the biggest difference there is that if you're interrupted, you can start casting again immediately.  If you're stunned, you can't move OR CAST again until that stun wears off.  Sometimes that can make the difference between life and death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">so stun immune and 5% less exp penalty evens out with trolls regen?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Ogres are awesome and chances are you'll like them more than Barbs. They have just 5 less starting wisdom and +50 more str and sta. Unstunnability from the front is a big plus. The exp penalty isn't as bad as Iksar or Troll so you may/may not notice it. <br />
I say Go For it...I like Troll more than Ogre because of regen but both Troll and Ogre are pretty sweet and better than Barbs IMO. <br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
As for Clerics (YUCK!) they are BORING, BORING, BORING, and more BORING. They are bonafide buff whores.....and healers. They sit on their a$$ the whole battle and can't regen their own mana without chanter buffs. Sometimes they nuke....NO PET, NO INVIS, NO COOL DOTS, NO SOW, NO CANNIBALIZE, NO CANNIBALIZE, and they can't melee for sh#t ! They can't solo too well either. Did I mention no cannibalize ? Oh they can't haste either. I'm probably leaving some other stuff out too but I can't think of it. <br />
<br />
<br />
PROS: <br />
They are always desired for groups and high end encounters. They can stun casters (big plus), and they can rez. Best heals in the game...pretty good nukes. Pretty nifty buffs.<br />
Other than that I wouldn't want to play a cleric after being a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What is funny is that I have only seen this posted once here in this thread.<br />
<br />
Backing an Ogre shaman into a corner and casting. I have done this many times against mobs, especially Jugs. I back myself into a corner and start slowing if I gain agro. Alot of times I will throw slows to get the agro off of an ENC that is trying to Mez. Once I gt into the corner I can channel 99% of the time, through just about any hit, and never get stunned. The clerics just need to keep me alive. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ogre 15% exp penalty is far worse than the troll or iksar 20% penalty, and they will level notably slower than either of those races -- they will level by far the slowest of all races.<br />
<br />
This is because immunity to stun is great for vital situations like ToV or really big mobs where if you're the only shaman and you get wiped out, it's big trouble, but not nearly so incredible for normal experience mobs or soloing.<br />
<br />
Regen at lower levels will rocket your health back up, and at higher levels, your regen rate increases, but it &quot;feels&quot; less dramatic.  <br />
<br />
Still, after a kill, an ogre will sit around for a very long time compared to an iksar or troll.  <br />
<br />
My ogre shaman wore an iksar regen breastplate, which is only 5/6 per tick, and the difference between wearing that and any other chest piece besides the fungi was like night and day.  He could actually GAIN hitpoints in many fights once a mob was slowed.  And 5/6 is a pittance compared to innate regen like trolls and ikkies get.  When my ogre shaman put on a fungi, it was astounding how little time it took him to get health(and therefore mana) back, and wonderful that he would often be full health and mana or close to it after a fight.  Take the regen off -- ouch.<br />
<br />
Same with my human and iksar monks.  The exp penalty was a joke considering how much regen negated it.  The human had maxed bind wound skill and poured points into BW at every opportunity; the iksar barely bothered with bandaging until in his teens, and put almost no points in it.  Yet still he was ready to go ASAP and much safer in fights because that regen was always ticking away.<br />
<br />
Regen is godly to both shamans and monks, and having an innate regen shaman or monk makes a huge difference.  <br />
<br />
You REALLY feel the 15% on the ogre; on a troll or iksar, you not only don't feel it, you feel great about how quick you're ready to go again.  Any non-regen race who has ever swapped in and out of a regen BP will know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Of course, the more you solo, the more you notice how much it sucks not to have regen, and the more you group in _balanced_ groups, the less regen matters, because your personal regen or lack of it will become less crucial.  You will notice the exp penalty more in groups than solo, because you won't have incredible regen making up so much of the negatives of a bad exp penalty.  You'll just feel the exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Once you get 60 and torpor, stun immunity is by far the best ability to have; with torpor and canni 4 (and eventually cann 5), neither mana nor hitpoints are really a problem -- at least not one than regen can solve.  It's all very easy.<br />
<br />
It's just that the first 59 levels are so much harder. ;)<br />
<br />
I would recommend ogres to people who know they'll be in the game long enough to get torpor and really love playing shamans, or who can afford a regen BP.  But if you already have a main active EQ character, I wouldn't start one without having bought at least an iksar BP first.  Life will be dramatically easier with regen -- it's like night and day the difference it makes.<br />
<br />
If you're just a casual player or don't know how long you will stick with the game -- inny troll is the easiest choice, and probably is in general the best shaman.  It's the one most people would have the most fun with, since regen keeps you moving, not medding, and the troll is strong and can use JBB.<br />
<br />
If you really like ogres, they're excellent shamans, but it takes torpor to overcome the incredible advantage that trolls are born with.  As are iksar -- but that's another matter.  And -- you will FEEL it when you have to sit on your arse all day after a kill as a non-regen race compared to how easy you have it when you yourself are a walking fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
Regen is king, until torpor, when it becomes trivial.</div></div><hr />
