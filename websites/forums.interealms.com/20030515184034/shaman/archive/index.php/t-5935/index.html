<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">omg that looks like an awesome spell! You're sure it's a real spell? NPC only or something? I wanna open up a can o' woop ass on a frost giant with my gnome.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Can o'Whoop Ass has this spell as instant click, but it seems not to have any effect, except the /em..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehe just looked a raw data, all levels listed as 127 and mana cost 0, self only hehe. What i want to know is there used to be charm listed at int caster guild in W freeport as shaman usable at level 61, wonderif they are / did change that or would we be able to use it at level 61?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Charm was once shaman usable - in Beta I think.<br />
All Charm scrolls ahve showed shaman on them, but had the level raised to 61 as a way of say &quot;just kidding&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that there will be a level 61, VI will either have to change the scroll/spell or lotsa shaman will now be able to scrib/mem/cast the spell.   <br />
<br />
But I think it is not a very powerful Charm.  Anyone have any info on the restrictions on what level mobs it will affect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I remember finding a druid port scroll (one of the velious ones) that listed shm w/ level 61. I always wondered ...but with druids now getting better heals, maybe we do get ports )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just ran and looked at the spell vendor yesterday, they removed shm from the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ya if you see a spell labled lvl 61 .. that means they have removed it from game <br />
<br />
pre kunark .. if you saw a spell labled lvl 51 .. they removed it from game <br />
<br />
slowly phase em out <br />
<br />
so atm if you see a 61 lvl spell .. its being removed .. <br />
<br />
i imagine that once pop is out any spell labled 66 will be the new number for discountinued spells<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway .. this spell is a right click offa no drop.. not sure where it from, was hopeing yall would know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">These were handed out at a GM event about a year and half ago, not sure what the event was but there are only like 1 or 2 per server (the servers that were live back then).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was there when they went out on zeb...<br />
<br />
The effect was similar to avatar with some haste added for good measure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think one of my pals in a different guild got a copy or can or whatever the hell it was given out as, it sounds like one of the Dev's got real drunk one night and had some fun... :)</div></div><hr />
