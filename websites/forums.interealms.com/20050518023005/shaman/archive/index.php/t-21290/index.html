<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Brenlo has reposted the stickied thread from this forum (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=761) in a thread which he desires us to utilize to make a &quot;top 10&quot; list of items we want fixed.<br />
<br />
  For those of you saying he is not opening lines of communication, or wondering if any Devs have seen this thread, here is your chance to give your feedback and be relatively certain that he will respond to or at least see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He may have only seen it because it was linked earlier in that thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a good start.  That said, I hope someone addresses the differences between burst damage and DoT damage as DoTs tend not to run full course.  More comments on aggro generation might help too.  Lastly, more comments that bring the perspective that it isn't so much that the class is broken, but that the game has changed and made the class less effective for that content.  I'll see if I can post there tonight.</div></div><hr />
