<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fellow Shaman,<br />
I know that I'm no leader of the Shaman community. I'd sure like to see some uber shaman take this up, but still I can't stand by and watch this anymore without taking action!<br />
<br />
After years of watching alchemy erode into what it is now. Years of spending mass plat, the breakdowns, the explanations of how sad tradeskills in general and particularly our class tradeskill has become. Here's where I personally am at on this:<br />
<br />
I'm willing to be banned to make a statement! <br />
<br />
If you are as pissed as I am, then lets do this:<br />
<br />
On Tuesday, November the 18th, beginning at 9AM (EST) lasting until 9PM (EST) Shaman of all levels will stage a STAND DOWN at or around the Plane of Tranquility stone in the Plane of Knowledge on all Servers. <br />
- We will bag our main hands, save for our Alchemists Stone. If you have the tradeskill trophy, please wield it for this event.<br />
- We will /join serverwide.standdown:warrior<br />
- We will /petition and /afk the same message: &quot;I am a Shaman. Hear my plea. I demand a statement be issued concerning Alchemy vs The Other tradeskill balancing and Illusion Guktan potions be fixed in an emergency patch. Until then, I will stand here and wait.&quot;<br />
- Any GM communication that originates should be directed toward serverwide.standdown:warrior which will be moderated by whining leaders of the warrior crybaby community.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to use your Main, then create a newbie Shaman to do the STAND DOWN. If your friends want to join the cause, encourage them to also create a newbie Shaman. Use all your accounts, turn-out is important for this to work!<br />
<br />
If you are in support and will join the cause, please respond and help spread the word! <br />
<br />
Various EQ News sites will be notified of the STAND DOWN on Friday the 14th.</div></div><hr />

Whats a little wrong about these types of protests is that you have to be LOGGED IN TO MAKE THEM.  Each and every time you log in to EQ you send a clear message to SoE that says &quot;Im still going to pay to play your game no matter what you do or do not fix.&quot;<br />
<br />
As long as people still log in and still pay every month SoE can dag their feet about fixing almost any issue like this.  Warriors have been needing a significant upgrade of some sort for years, and it still hasnt happened yet.  Why?  Cause people are still willing to play warriors in spite of their current state.  Alchemy has been unweildy since its introduction to the game, but people still make and play shamans, and Id probably bet you that 99% of the shaman out there did NOT make a shaman because of Alchemy.  Im sure more that half of the shaman currently in the game have never even tried alchemy and could care less if its broken or not.  <br />
<br />
While I can agree that it would be nice if Alchemy was tuned up a little.  But the type of 'protest' that you are trying to organize will most assuredly not get it accomplished.<br />
<br />
/Feedback every single day.  Send them emails every day.  Get your friends to /feedback and email too.  'protests' in game will probably do nothing but annoy other players and possibly get you banned.  If you want serious consideration given to your plight you MUST take it OUT OF GAME.  Make it real to them.  Take it to their In-boxes and /feedback bins.<br />
<br />
In any case, if you do decide to go forward with this Sit in, good luck to you.</div></div><hr />
