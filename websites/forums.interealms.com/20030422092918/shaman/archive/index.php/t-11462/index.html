<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vermicide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow Shamans, I am Vermicide a newly created shammy. I was wondering on decent equipment for say around 50 level. Also solo spots to 39, I must say that I am really enjoying him so far and can not wait to get him up there in level, have seen what we can do from a guildmate of mine and am most impressed. I am not a newbie to EQ, I do have a main of good level. Look forward to learning and playing my char. :D</div></div><hr />
