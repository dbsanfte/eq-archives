<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">PoS/PoV.  Anyone know anything about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The trials in Plane of Justice will get you flagged for PoS/PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know that.  My warrior is flagged, my shaman isn't.  I've heard about a quest alternative to the trials, and I was wondering if anyone here knew anything about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there is mutiple &quot;quests&quot; to get in PoV/PoS<br />
<br />
they are all in PoJ if remember right and they are all trials. Im told exec is the easiest , so thats what i did and now that ive passed ive never looked back.<br />
<br />
So yea , there is other ways , but they might be even harder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nevermind.  I realize there are multiple trials... execution, hanging, strangulation etc, but the context this was mentioned to me in had this &quot;quest&quot; as seperate from the trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not to my knowledge no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe you are thinking of the HoH quest, not PoV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">99% sure the only way to PoV/PoS is one of the 6 trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Heimdall Azureguardian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't even know if it exists.  I was arguing with someone about how much trials suck, and they kept throwing this quest in my face, so I figured I'd ask around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phlegma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've heard of the quest too, info I've heard on it is that it's unsolved.  That's all the info I've been able to find out too.  Not where it begins, or anything else.<br />
<br />
There's another way to get in to PoS/PoV that passing a trial.  Just as there is another way to get in to CoD other than killing Grummus.</div></div><hr />
