<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kellz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am level 48 Barb. Shaman.  I, nearly, always am grouped with my husband who is about a 1/2 level behind me in exp.  He is a Dark Elf Enchanter.<br />
<br />
Consistantly, he has been getting less adventure points per win than I have been getting.... even when the 1/2 level difference in exp has us as the same level.<br />
<br />
For instance, last adventure we did last night, I got 10 points and he got 9.... and we were the same level.  He seems to always get one point less than I do per win.<br />
<br />
It sounded to me like everyone who is 65 is getting 51 points per win.<br />
<br />
What is determining the number of points you get ?  Level ?  Race?! Class?  <br />
<br />
It sure doesn't make sense to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level determines points recieved.  cant explain why you and your husband would be get different point totals if your the same level, thats pretty strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Numbers I know for sure:<br />
<br />
51 at level 65<br />
47 at level 63<br />
12 at level 54<br />
3 at level 34</div></div><hr />

It sure doesn't make sense to me.<br />
<br />
It can be confusing.<br />
<br />
A level 65 person in a normal level Adventure will get 51 points for success when the average level of the group is 63.00 or higher.<br />
<br />
If the average group level is 62.99, the 65 players will get ~34 points from memory.  The rewards scale rapidly downward every so many levels lower.  The amount of reward given is determined by the Adventurer's level and the average level of the all the players on that Adventure.<br />
<br />
I'm sure someone could figure out the exact formula, but I'm honestly too lazy to work out the math myself.<br />
<br />
It would be discouraging to be the exact same level as someone else and not get the same reward.  I would imagine (guessing here) that the formula uses a numerical value for the individual's cumulative experience total instead of just using their level for the formula.  <br />
<br />
Such that dinging at level 48 you might have 1 gazillion cumulative experience points.  Halfway through you might have 1.1 gazillion points and at 1.2 gazillion points you would ding 49.  If that's the case, the formula could work out (probably with some rounding involved) that two people the same level could be just under and just over the threshold for getting 9 or 10 points.<br />
<br />
Even if that's the case, it would still be frustrating.   :(  Incentive to level isn't it? :p <br />
<br />
Also, for more information about common questions concerning LDoN, I highly recommend consulting Rorgg's guide (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16505)  which has been stickied in the new <br />
&quot;Medicine Cabinet&quot; (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/forumdisplay.php?forumid=25)  forum.<br />

Take care,<br />

<br />
Generally, it appears your points are based on your level compared to the level of the dungeon you are doing. The level of the dungeon you are doing is determined by the average level of your group. <br />
<br />
But there are some inconsistencies still. The first dungeon I did with my main (65 shaman), we had mostly 65's except the cleric was 61 and we had a 59 druid (average level 63.3 rounds up to level 65 dungeon). I got 51 points for the win, but one of the other 65's said he got 52. Why he got 1 more point than the rest of us 65's, I have no idea.</div></div><hr />

 I got 51 points for the win, but one of the other 65's said he got 52.  <br />
<br />
On one of the adventures I was on, when killing a named I received a single adventure point for it.  I was shocked and didn't say anything except to verify that my spouse (sitting a few feet away) did NOT get a point.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is for every named or not (only happened to me once), but that may be what happened.  Does your friend remember if the text message said &quot;you receive 52 adventure points&quot; or if he merely did the math after the fact and saw he had gained 52 vice 51?<br />
<br />
This will be interesting to figure out eventually once we have more data points to construct more than the anecdotal stuff we're chatting about here.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It sounds like there is a total number of points set at creation of a dungeon. If that number is divisible by the number of players (scaled to lvl), then each player (of the same level) will get the same number of points. If it's not divisible, someone will receive less points. <br />
<br />
eg: dungeon a is created and set at 7 points. 6 players complete the dungeon. 1 player receives 2 points, the rest receive 1. <br />
<br />
This would also explain the points awarded on completing a mission after the first time limit is up. At lower levels only 1 player in the group will receive a point (ie the dungeon is set at 1 point for failure).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been 61 for most adventures (just dinged 62).  I have gotten 44 points twice, 32 twice, 31 twice and 30 twice.  The 2nd 30 point # Was my only win at 62.<br />
<br />
It's strange.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is the correct method for the point system. I did a couple adventures on a lvl 55 twink recently, and for one I got 21 points and another I got 18. The first group had a higher average level than the second. I also did on with my 65 shaman, and recieved only 49, due to the fact we had 2 lvl 60's in the group</div></div><hr />
