<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, i'm building a new P.C. to play on, as my current one is lagging WAAAY behind.  To give you an idea:<br />
<br />
Pentium 3<br />
GeForce 3 64MB<br />
512 RAM<br />
<br />
Yeah, ouch.  I used to have a really nice P.C.  Sadly, I had to sell it after graduating from high school to pay for college (about a year and a half ago.)<br />
<br />
So, i'm going to be pretty much just gaming on this machine.  I want it to be able to handle anything.  My budget is about $2,500 (not including monitor, speakers, etc.)  The $2,500 is only for the actual computer, so I can go wild :)<br />
<br />
So far, what I had in mind was....<br />
<br />
Motherboard: <br />
Intel D925XCVLK D925X Chipset (4)PCI (4)DDR2<br />
<br />
Processor: <br />
Intel® Pentium® 4 Processor 550 w/ HT 3.4GHz 1MB Cache <br />
<br />
Video Card: <br />
NVIDIA® GeForce™ 6800 GT 256MB DDR3 w/Digital and S-Video Out <br />
<br />
Hard Drive(s): <br />
2 x 120GB Seagate® Barracuda 7,200 RPM w/8MB Cache<br />
<br />
Memory (RAM): <br />
2GB Corsair® PC3200 DDR2 667MHz<br />
<br />
Sound Card: <br />
Creative Sound Blaster® Audigy® 2 ZS High Definition 7.1<br />
<br />
C.D. Drive One: <br />
Lite-On® 16x DVD-ROM Drive (48x CD-ROM)<br />
<br />
C.D. Drive Two: <br />
Plextor® PX-712A 12x DVD±R/W Drive <br />
<br />
Power Supply: <br />
Ultra 600Watt ATX® Power Supply <br />
<br />
(I've also got a floppy drive for it, but didn't think it necessary to mention.)<br />
<br />
<br />
So, thoughts?  Opinions?  Suggestions?<br />
<br />
I'm really at a loss on what to do about a computer case.  I do a lot of LAN parties, but I need something big enough to house the two C.D. drives, two hard drives, and the large amount of fans i'll need to keep the thing cool.<br />
<br />
I thought about moving up to the 3.6 CPU, but i've heard it has overheating issues.  I'm also told the GeForce is running a little hot, so I want to make sure I have plenty of cooling power.<br />
<br />
A large factor in the case is appearence.  I'd REALLY like this thing to look like the monster it really is.  I really like the cases with the cut-out sides.  I've also seen some with LCD screens on the top of the case to control the fans and monitor internal temperature.<br />
<br />
I just really don't know any quality case manufacturing companies to consider.  I'd really like some personal imput / experiences.<br />
<br />
Anyways, tell me what changes (if any) you would make to the machine, keeping in mind my budget.<br />
<br />
Thanks :D<br />
<br />
<br />

Oh, and if you see that there is something I missed (especially to do with part compatibility), let me know.</div></div><hr />
