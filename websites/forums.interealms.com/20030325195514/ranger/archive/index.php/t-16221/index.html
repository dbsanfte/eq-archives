<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yecna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally checked out Velks lab last week- decided to write a little hunting guide.<br />
<br />
On the first floor of velks lab their are 3 main camps: Lr( left room) MR (middle room) and RR(right room). Here you are mostly fighting spiders. Xp is slow but steady, about a blue an hour at 58. THe first floor mobs are actually very easy and i could solo them well if i wouldn't go LD every 30 minutes :) Incase of a bad pull the exit is very near. Loot on the first floor is ok- quest gems are semi rare, silks are very common fior the shawl and blocks of velium drop very often. <br />
<br />
The next camp which is my favorite camp is the TS, or top shelf. You sit on the ledge and pull spiders but you also have the chance of getting 3 named whihc pop once every 45 minutes or so. THis camp can be a little more difficult so make sure your in a pretty strong group before taking down the names. Their are 3 names: Crystal eyes, A frenzied velium broodling, and  frenzied Velium stalker. Crystal eyes is a wimp- hits for 120 max, not much hp, drops crystal eyes common, which is a nice face mask and Crystal Chitin Gauntlets. A frenzied velium broodling has a bit more HP than crystal eyes but hits for about the sam. He drops Silver Chitin Handwraps common, and Silver Chitin BRacer rare. A frenzied velium stalker is just as easy as the other two and drops Venemous Axe of the Velium  BRood, and Ring of Frost spiders. In one 4 hour night i saw 6 named pop- 2 Silver Chitin Handwraps dropped, 2 crystal spider eyes, a venemous axe of the velium brood and a ring of frost spiders- not bad for one night :)<br />
<br />
Last camp is UD- upper dogs. YOu fight kobolds here. It is strongly suggested that you have a strong group with 55 + tank, cleric, and enchanter. The Kobolds are hard to pull single unless you have a lvl 60 tank so an enchanter is important. The koolds hit hard and have lots of HP so be careful. Also, they can complete heal so make sure your cleric stuns when they begin to cast. You should also makesure you fight them close to the fake wall because the other kobolds will heal them. THeir are some named that pop here and i was very fortunate to win a Barbed Ringmail for Tpos Icepaw, who is easily taken with my group.<br />
<br />
Well, their you have it.  In one week fighting their i got 2 yellows, Silver CHitin BRacer, Barbed Ringmail, 8 or 9 quest gems, a bunch of crystalline silk threads, tons of blocks of velium, and a lot of fun. Enjoy!</div></div><hr />
