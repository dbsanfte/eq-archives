<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree krakster.  Once you're 60 with torpor the fungi is less important; especially if you're XPing AA's and get Cann V first.<br />
<br />
Malo is nice but 90% of the uses are raid-level targets.  I'll use Malosini when XP grinding since it debuffs more, usually lands, and has low aggro if it doesn't.</div></div><hr />

I would say buy neither, just continue grouping/grinding to 60, then consider purchasing Malo at that time as prices can only come down with Malos entering the game.  Purchasing Malo is always an option, and your particular style of xping will reveal whether its really essential for you outside of a raid situation.<br />
<br />
As for Pox, you'll find that you use Utlor more at 64 then Pox due to the root breaks, and again Pox prices fluctuate based on the availability of Utlor.<br />

<br />
If u solo alot more than grping, i would get pox, its lower dps, but since you don't have access to the non root breaking dots, its still nice, especialy since all of our dots stack</div></div><hr />

<br />
any thoughts?<br />
<br />
You will use malo all the time.  In non-pop exp groups its nice, in PoP groups its necessary.  Tier 2 mobs can whack you for 700 a shot, and a bounced slow will get you agro.  Malo then slow will land slow 99% of the time with no resist on exp mobs.<br />
<br />
Malosini has the same chance to be resisted as slow.  You can bounce it several times before it sticks.  True, the agro is low on a bounced malosini... but you arent doing your group any good by delaying a slow that long.  Once you get the hang of casting malo as soon as the mob is in range and slowing as soon as the gem refreshes, you can have a mob slowed (with minimal agro) the instant it reaches your group.<br />
<br />
As for malosini after slow lands.. mages can cast malosini too, let them contribute something  :p <br />
<br />
As for the original question... Pox vs Malo:<br />
<br />
Get both, but hold off on buying them and let the prices drop.  You can scribe Pox at 59, Malo at 60.<br />
<br />
Pox is very useful.  If you are soloing, Pox + Epic, + puppy while you tank will kill nicely.  In PoP where tanking is risky, its not as useful.  Thats where you want the new dots -to root and rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Let me start by saying, i did not read any of your reply posts, and here's why...<br />
<br />
Malo/Malos are what make the shaman class a MUST on raids if you ever want to land slow (on mobs that you can).  I can't even begin to explain how must have this spell is (which pox is by no means a must have), in case you didnt know Krae, Malo/Malos are unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Buy malo now, it's rare enough that when you hit 60 it may take a week or 2, or longer, to even find it.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I had a fungi on my first shaman a couple years ago, but don't have one this time around and I can honestly say I don't miss it.   With what once would have been considered uber gear back then being so cheap now, KEI, horses, and virtue there really is no need for a fungi imo.  Malo is much &gt; than a fungi (even if you cannot cast it yet)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Malo is godly, dont you dare not get it :)<br />
<br />
I use malo on every pull to this day, im sorry ive tested it, the mana i save by not casting , i lose by bouncing slows once in a while. and bouncing slows is unacceptable in some situations. Pox is not that important , i almost never use it accept soloing tougher mobs. almost never on XP or duo , always on raids though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would without a doubt get malo as soon as you can. <br />
<br />
I have hunted in tier two and tier three zones since i was level 56.  At first it was easy to slow them, but for some reason as i grew in levels i got more resists.  And when you have mobs hitting you for 500, a bounced slow will most likely cause the mob to make a beeline for your shaman arse and unless you have good tanks and an on the ball healer you will possibly die.  <br />
<br />
With malo, however you will barely get a resisted slow at all.  You may use up more manna in slowing but IMO its a lot better then the alternative which is re attempting a slow thereby getting even more aggro and of course a trip to your bind point.  Not to mention that malo is an absolute necessity on high level raiding.  Pox on the other hand while its a great spell and rare as hell, wont change your gaming the way malo will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm only 34 at the moment, but I've been searching for Malo on Mith marr for a VERY long time now. I only saw it once, for 80k (yeah, right ... keep dreaming, buddy!) int he past few months. Even the research components are rare as hell and never seen. I have my higher level friends who farm Ssrae keys always on the lookout for me, and other friends who promise to help me kill Kunark Dragons to let me know if they get a copy to drop. <br />
<br />
Buy Malo now. Pox won't be anywhere near as useful. I know Shaman who didn't get Malo until 62 or 63 and swear there was at least a twofold improvement in their abilities to land spells since getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not sure about your server prices, but on Torv Malo is now very common that the price is about 20K with malos between 30 to 45K.<br />
<br />
As for Malo being a must have for PoP grouping ... I dunno. I still do not have either spell (but a friend just bought me a copy of Malos woo hoo! ) and I did just fine slowing mobs in Tier 2.<br />
<br />
Yes on raids I am gimped but for normal exping not really an issue till you meet that &quot;uber&quot; mob that resists like the plague!<br />
<br />
Edit : Oops! forgot to answer the question. Think you need to decide that based on what you want. Do you think you want/need to slow mobs immediately or have the option of more dmg alternative. <br />
<br />
Also I would wait to buy the spells till a level below it's use unless you see yourself hitting level 59/60 very fast or that those spells are hardly ever offered for sale on your server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Bouncing 2 slows means about 30 seconds before you get the mob slowed. Even if you or the primary healer don't catch agro during that time, it's still gonna be painful.<br />
<br />
I'd call the choice a no-brainer. Pox isn't useful unless you solo, and even then I'd rather have malo. Malo means you can hunt places with a less than optimal group because you will get it slowed quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Let me put it this way. In my old guild i had a good friend that never got malo. I would watch him have to do too many corpse runs in BoT while i was sitting LFG or just goofing around or in a group. He was dying cause he was bouncing slows too often and getting aggro. Mean whille me and my malo/malos only gets aggro when i desire it.<br />
<br />
It really is a big difference in aggro, mana usage and clerical healing ( i.e. mana ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Malo rocks.  its zero aggro.  and basicly your gonna land your slows unless you get the bad roll of the dice.  In XP groups i keep malo up over slow.  I normaly slow first if bounced then i malo.  if i am spending the time to debuff the mob i am gonna spend the extra 2 seconds to make sure the debuff its resisted.<br />
<br />
malo is very very very good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kydan_EMarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Malo owns, I use it every pull. I got so sick of bouncing Malosini's I just had to buy it.</div></div><hr />

Pox is VERY resistable and that's its major problem.  I haven't found it to be an excellent soloing tool, because of that.<br />
<br />
Great price on Malo, BTW  :)</div></div><hr />

Afraid malo is unresistable, in 2+ years that Ive had it, it has never been resisted, maybe you had malosini memmed or something and didnt realize it.  Even things that are impossible to debuff give the message that they are 'uncomfortable'.<br />
<br />
Malo is much more useful that pox.  Pox gets resisted so much and like many others suggested, I almost always lead off with malo before slowing incoming mobs, makes the job much easier.  On my server at least, malos has caused the price of malo to drop quite a bit and Ive seen quite a few copies for sale at 25k or under.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>SimcimaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Don't listen to these people that say don't get either or wait till you're 60 and then decide.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Those prices seem a bit out of whack. On Xev, Pox is usually around 13k, Malo around 60k.

Don't buy pox unless you see it real cheap.  It is not that hard to get, mine dropped off the Emporer.  You are MUCH  more likely to see Pox drop than you will Malo.<br />
<br />
There is no way to express HOW useful malo is, especially in POP.  Virtually no aggro, and helps you land slow first time almost every time...which is essential at those levels.  I use it soloing, grouping, raiding, you name it.<br />

Regarding Pox, its a great spell, I use it lots when soloing, but its not something thats makes a Shaman a Shaman. No one is going to invite you to come kill a mob because you have scribed Pox, Malo on the other hand...<br />
<br />
Edit: I get much more use out of Malo than just raiding. When soloing in Umbral Plains I generally always Malo, because 1 Malo costs less than 2 resisted BoNs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that's what they said when LoY priest research came out.  Prices would drop, they didn't happen.  I had Malo and Torpor banked and sold them because I thought that the prices would drop when the priest research came out.  Guess what happened, I hit 60 and didn't have the spells.  So I had to waste time in Bazaar and in the auction channel tyring to get Malo and Torpor.  Finally got them and paid the same that I paid for them the first time around.  40k for topor and 30k for malo.  I also don't think that their will be a big influx of spells from VP.  They made it easier to get out, not get in.  So get Malo and have it banked.  You'll be alot happier when you're 60 and can scribe it than if you're 60 and can't scribe it cause you don't have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Didn't read the whole thread so I apologize if I am restating something but, if you are leveling slowly (took me several months to go from 55 to 60 pre-PoP) I would hold onto the cash. Prices may drop when more research components drop and heck, you might get in a emp group in sebilis some night and get it to drop. If you are leveling like mad and will be 60 in a couple weeks, I would say go ahead and buy them. If you do a lot of grouping and very little solo, I would buy Malo but if you are mainly soloing I would go ahead and get pox. If you have torpor and pox/bane, you will be able to solo alot in tier one. Malo helps there but pox will be used all the time.</div></div><hr />

Retention is the rarest word on the game.   I've only seen one ever.  I was /auc for it everyday every 10 minutes since research came out.  My whole server just about knew who to look to sell to if they got that word.  (People did pity me after so long)   I finally looted the damn thing myself in SSRA a few days ago and scribed malo later that night.   In fact I'm fairly certain I'm the only shaman on my server to get malo from research.  (never once saw the spell for sale in bazaar either).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I almost never slow anything anymore without malosing it (or malo before I got malos).  Fighting in the elementals, a slow resist will almost always get you smacked around, and the mobs will resist fairly often even with malos on it.  <br />
<br />
And...I know that the agro from malos a mob is not supposed to get you agro, but tell that to me again after Mith Marr beat my ass the other day after the warrior with BoW lost the agro to me before I even tried to slow.  Oh, and don't even think about malosing in PoAir until after the mob has been engaged by at least one tank.  The first time that I went there, I was doing what I could to get them slowed quickly, and I've never seen someone die that many times to just casting malos on the mob.  I was taking agro on just about half of the mobs that came in before i even cast slow (this was even after the MT engaged by shotting arrows and also by hitting the mob once he was in camp).  <br />
<br />
There are certain places I know that I can get away without maloing the mob.  This being (at level 65 that is) VT, any PoN/D/I/J mob, and certain things in PoV if I'm feeling adventorous.  When I'm slowing in VT...any of the non six-armed dudes I will usually just throw a slow on them right off the bat..but any six-armed beast depending on how many are in camp and their name...I will malo them first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">47) Get your spells when you can. Don't quibble over small amounts of plat, especially when dealing with key spells like Cann IV, torpor, malo (although Cann IV isn't that rare, it really kicks Cann III in the ass). All other spells, including Bane of Nife and Pox of Bert, qualify as nice to have, but not key. Plat is replenishable,finding rare spells for sale isn't so easy. Don't miss your opportunities.<br />

From the tip thread stickied on the top!  I still believe this is true, always buy core spells when you can.  Sure, you may get it cheaper/easier later on, but you may not.  <br />
<br />
Malo and torpor are key spells, period.  <br />
<br />
I finally got Quiescence recently.  Boy, that's a nice spell.  Still Blood of Saryn and Fo7 to go....</div></div><hr />

Also, there are people out there who will tell you that buying Malo and Torpor is a waste, and that you should wait for Malos / Q instead.  They couldn't be more wrong.  Torpor and Malo will open up the game to you so much more than you could ever imagine.  Remember how awesome it was getting your first Cann and your first Pet spell?  Multiply that by about 10 billion... that's now good it gets.</div></div><hr />
