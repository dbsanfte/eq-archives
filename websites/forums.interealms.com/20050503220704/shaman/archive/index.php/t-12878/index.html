<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, all.  I'm brand new to your board.  The Crucible comes highly recommended, and I certainly need some help.  =)   I'm a level 47 Shaman who has spent 99% of her life duo'ing with a Beastlord.<br />
<br />
My goal is to hit 50 as soon as I can, but more than that I want to be a great shaman.  And who better to ask than all of you?  I'm not happy with just levels, I want to be a key part of any group I join.  <br />
<br />
I looked over the board and unfortunately didn't spot the answer to one of my current annoying questions:  where can I solo at 47?   My solo experience is limited to one or two nights in EW at Korrigain's hut.   I know this is one of those questions that makes people's brain's bleed, and I'm really sorry.  But if you have any suggestions I'd really, really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Thank you, and it's nice to meet you all.  =)<br />
<br />
Edit:  Ok, so I'm blind.  I just saw the whole section devoted to places to fight at various levels.  Sorry.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can see from your equip your nicely kitted out.<br />
<br />
At your level i was in the ****, couldn't find a good solo spot and started a pally( right when LoY came out so he was my nw frog), twinked him out and leveled him to 23, got bored quit him (play him now and again when bored though).<br />
<br />
What i found was that in echo (was soloing there from 44+) that the underbulks were getting poor exp and repop time wasn't worth it but i pressed on and finslly dinged 48. Once i did i moved to the TM room in echo, wow. This is a great spot, at least 1pct per kil (1.5ish ticks) and it repops just in time. I didn't go here beofre 48 becuase i couldn't handle it but my gear was/is not as good as yours. Basically get to the ent of TM room in the outer TM (this will all make sense when you see it) run past all the underbulks and fiends, shouldn't aggro if your good at staying out of there range. Once your at the ent its a matter of skill to pull. You can't pull them single at this point so what you do is root the nearest skelly (left or right) and his friend will come, let your dog tank his friend slow it, dot it and then movr back to your rooted mob and slow him. Then move back to the doted one and melee some. Once dead move onto the other one. btw Taskmaster will pop once per cycle as he resists all poison/disease spells. Method is slow to pull him, root let dog tank land a couple of nukes till about 40m then melee, wait till hes about 2red hp nuke him some more then just let pet finish off when he runs. <br />
<br />
PS Sorry if non of this makes sense, really tired here, its 1am almost. If you don't understand just know this, go to TM room in echo and kill everything<br />
<br />
PPS Grab a c3 also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks.  =)   I went to Echo... unfortunately, the TM is pretty much perma-camped.  So I tried some gnomes (fast little devils, but I beat them finally).  Unfortunately I can't single pull anything.  haha.<br />
<br />
So the search continues, though I'll keep trying Echo now and then and see if I can't get the camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd head to City of Mist. It's not the easiest place to solo, I don't think you're guaranteed single pulls at that level but it's a nice quiet place to work on your skills like handling an add while solo, pet control, etc. Nice thing is that the mobs there don't run and you'll have to hit the zone anyway if you ever want your epic. Might as get your pages while all the mobs are still blue to ya. Dunno if you can handle the courier spawn spots solo at that lvl but definitely doable if you can find a partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Having just come back to the game I solo'd from 36 to 53 in about a month and I think 47-49 was the slowest stretch.  Everything in the best places is either turning LB or multiple adds.<br />
<br />
I mixed:<br />
Task Master's room in Echo - As an Iksar the slaves were ally and didn't agro when i tackled the TM, who was a fun challenge.<br />
CoM - Pulling from the open area just over the bridge into the semi-safe spot between east &amp; west courtyards, even as they start to con lb the xp isn't too bad.<br />
OT Plaguebones - Not sure why people praise that camp, seemed very slow to me even when I was killing everything in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was at the spiroc camp in Timorous Deep at that level. They were pretty easy, and good exp if I remember right. At 50 though you should solo the Nobles in HighKeep(If you don't mind a faction hit that is.). Nobles give awesome exp at 50 - at 54 I was getting about 1% per kill I think. Excelent for AA's too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Angua</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you, everyone, for all your input.  =)  I'll put it to good use!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I killed the gorlas? (I think thats the mobs name) in dreadlands from about 47 to 52.   There are two caves with these white apes and as you gain levels (blue up to 51 or 52 I think) you can kill more of them.  One cave is in the center (just west of Karnors) and the other is just south of there on the zone wall.  They are fairly easy to kill and if you time everything right you will rarely get an add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you have stoicism CoM should be cake solo at your level.  Very good ZEM and no runners.  Take advantage of it while you can.  You will also get your epic drops (the six scroll things), and often people come to kill reavers so you can get the books from Lord G.  Should make a level about every 3-5 hours depending on how aggresive you are and your gear.  If people aren't killing reavers then you will probably be only one in zone.</div></div><hr />

I second CoM, it is awesome ! I'm currently there at 48 and the experience is very nice, even with my 20% exp penalty. <br />
Head to CoM !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another vote for CoM. It's a great exp zone, mediocre for loot. Even if you get a drop, they don't sell for as much as they used to...but stuff still drops so excruciatingly rare. Also might try some LoY zones. I was getting decent experience at 47 doing the Drunken Pirates for the Stoicism quest in Dulak and was netting about 1k pp per night.<br />
Scarlet Desert is OK also. Lots of mobs to choose from. Decent loot if the named ones start popping which can net you some good cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Com is awesome..I believe I wrote something about pulling in CoM up to 50 a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
I also seem to remember HHK nobles being a nice comfy place to pull yourself up those last few levels through.  A great place to grind if you need to go AFK a lot.  I believe the thread on this was written by SoopyPoopy (the infamous for some reason I haven't learned yet..), and it was damn nice exp even for an old-world zone.<br />
<br />
Try searching around..pre-PoP people used to share more information about the earlier levels.</div></div><hr />
