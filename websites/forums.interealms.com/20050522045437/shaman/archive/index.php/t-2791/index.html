<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">tonight while prepping for creator fight, he cast ancient scourge of nife on a guild mate (who got pretty owned heh). anyway, couple that fact with this snippet from eqnews.txt:<br />
<br />
- NPCs no longer automatically get free access to rarely dropped spells, such as Garrison's Superior Sundering and Funeral Pyre of Kelador.<br />
<br />
so perhaps its a rare drop from creator (didn't drop tonight)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the shammy who sold me my jbb CLAIMs he got it of a luclin mob(forget which atm), but of course i have no proof, so you'll prob jus think its another &quot;my girlfriends roomates golfcaddy&quot; type thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly I don't think it is dropping.  If it was we would have heard something by now.  It's just a dot, not something other guilds would horde over and keep secret.<br />
<br />
Where in the blue hell are Levitation and Everlasting Breath?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seems as though you must not check the SPELLS forum too often hehe. Levitation comes from the Deep off of I think it is called Enraged underbulk. Just one mob drops the spell in the whole game. As for the EB spell, it comes from some named vampire in the vamp castle in tenebrous. Unfortunately, he seems to drop it as a rare thing, he is an uncommon spawn, and the only people that kill there are people killing there to get the spell it seems hehe. The vamps there are not a very fast spawn, there isnt alot of them, and they are terrible experience with many of them even being green or light blue. However, they hit damn hard for their level, some flurry, and they have that 200hp lifetap thing IIRC. Anyhow, it isnt a spot that lends itself well to the people who would probably love to hunt there, so only way you are likely to see the spell is to gather some friends that don't mind being bored to tears while getting super crappy exp, and go camp it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm one of a few people I know who have spent some solid time camping the vamp castle, and none of us have ever gotten the spell drop.  Friend of mine camped it for weeks, insane hours, didn't get the drop.  There are some interesting things about that castle, but they are so rare that you really have to want to be there just to be there.</div></div><hr />
