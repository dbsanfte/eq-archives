<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally put togeter my magelo, now im looking for some suggestions please. I am an Iksar lvl 53 and have about 14 days played on the character. I dual box a lvl 62 Cleric so i do melee.  I know I need my epic but have been leveling so fast as to not having the time to start it. <br />
<br />
My magelo:  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=542088 <br />
<br />
Will take any suggestions, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">really depends on your budget... if youve got the cash i think a fungi is the best thing you can buy, espeically if youre tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bakaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get a velium black sapphire necklace and a diseased war mace. That will give you an extra 130 hit points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Other suggestions:<br />
<br />
saprophyte eye --&gt; Earring of the Solstice (7-8k on Rodcet Nife),<br />
<br />
giant scalemail sleeves --&gt; crystal chitin arms (2-3k) or hardened grey flesh sleeves (5-6k)<br />
<br />
one of the bracers --&gt; Coldain Military Bracer for Extended Affliction III (no drop - do a search on this board for the quest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the help!!<br />
<br />
<br />
I went ahead and got the Earring of the Solstice, and another Glittering ring, this puts me at 248 wis.  I know the wis is a little high and need to replace some items with just pure ac, going to look into them arms next once i build a little cash again.  On a plus i keep driving forward through the lvls.  Could always take more advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stamina and resists are the only real weak spots I see.  I would prolly ditch one of the glittering rings, the shoulders, the shield, the neck, Goranga, and maybe the gaunts.  Possible replacements could be a Shadel ring, Barbed Dragonscale pauldrons, SBS, Sabertooth Amulet, Bathezid idol, and Coldain Skin gloves.<br />
<br />
Best way to upgrade IMO is to slap stuff in your Magelo and find out what suits you best.  Having a L62 cleric always by your side dramatically effects the type of gear you will need and you may never fight anything that has a manapool.  Things like resists are useless to some players simply because of playstyle.<br />
<br />
Just look at where and what you fight to get a bearing on upgrades. :)</div></div><hr />
