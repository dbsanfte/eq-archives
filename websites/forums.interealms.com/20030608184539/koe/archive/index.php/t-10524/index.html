<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">BTW you can read this any time on my bio on my magelo profile. So glad with magelo 2.0 it's actually a window with a scroll bar, before you really couldn't read the whole thing. Will update this every now and then, like once a month I guess, I update my bio regularly whenever I complete a quest, get to a spell level, or something important happens like level 46 which is plainar level.<br />
<br />
P.S. Rizz if you have the exact date you got your epic, let me know. Also if anyone know what wedding that was let me know who it was and what the date was, I didn't ever write down the specifics and have bad memory. Also if Rave or anyone else has the break up date of FoL, for some reason I don't have that in my records either. Or if one of the officers has the day I became a recruit (same day). Think it was in October 2000. If there are any spelling or grematical errors let me know. Also if anyone has any other suggestions or events that I haven't added that you know of when it happened let me know. With all the questing and progress recently I've been updating it a lot as you can tell. Hope you enjoy the read.<br />

I have always been torn by the ways of my people. I don't blame them; they were enslaved by the Ring of Scale for hundreds of years. After the death of our beloved king, our social structure has turned more tribal again and we even fight amongst ourselves. I hope that in the future we can work past our differences and reunite as the honorable race we once were. Until then, I shall work to become an adept in the ring of the Scaled Mystics and perform the duties the Temple of Terror gives me task on. Above all, I will defend peace, honor, and humility. When the time comes I do hope to kill both Cazic-Thule (for corrupting the minds of our people with his evil ways) and the head of the Ring of Scale (for enslaving our people for so long). <br />
<br />
June 27, 2000 - Upon the age of emergence, I chose the ancient art of the Shaman as my calling. To the Temple of Terror I sought the head Shaman to admit me into the Scaled Mystics. <br />
<br />
July 5, 2000 - I was honored with my first set of good equipment thanks to the helpful Lady Varya of Fellowship of Light (Fires of Heavens currently). <br />
<br />
July 21, 2000 - After reaching the 15th circle of wisdom, I was admitted to the Fellowship of Light by Officer Lady Varya (Fires of Heavens currently). Lord Avalanche was our guild leader and I still look up to him today (Cestus Dei currently). <br />
<br />
September 20, 2000 - After achieving the 20th circle of wisdom, I was honored with my surname Serpentine. Upon that time I was offered the Jade Chodikai Prod by my friend Aranuil of the Fellowship of Light (Keepers of the Elements, until recently Primus Exodus currently) as a present for receiving my surname. <br />
<br />
October 2000 - After Lord Avalanche left the Fellowship of Light for a new calling, Aranuil tried to keep us afloat. Unfortunately we really couldn't hold together without Avalanche and almost everyone from the Fellowship of Light (including myself) applied to join the great guild Keepers of the Elements. <br />
<br />
November 21, 2000 - First time I've ever left Kunark and the first time I've stepped upon the continent of Antonica. First time I've been on a guild raid. I didn't get a lick of experience the entire night, but I helped the group with my shaman buffs. I learned many valuable group tactics including being a distraction so that others may live in my place. In both Upper and Lower Guk I had a great time as a recruit with Keepers of the Elements. <br />
<br />
January 1, 2001 - I joined the ranks of Keepers of the Elements. From this day forward I shall take the honorable Kilap as my mentor and Lord Rizz as my guild leader. I also made my first pieces of Cabilis Scale armour upon this great day. <br />
<br />
January 4, 2001 - Finished making my first full set of Cabilis Scale. <br />
<br />
January 18, 2001 - Second time I've been on a guild raid and the first time I've visited the ice continent of Velious. This is also the first time I've entered a city other than my own home of Cabilis. The Ice Dwarves were very nervous to see me, but since they are so removed from the actions of my people, they are unaware our reputation. The raid took place in the Crystal Caverns, a wondrous place filled with the magical energy flowing from the ice, commonly known Velium. <br />
<br />
February 4, 2001 - I achieved the 24th circle of wisdom and mastered the 6th circle of power. <br />
<br />
March 2001 - Lord Rizz completed his quest today for his epic weapons. Also, thanks to Venomblood of KoE, I received my first pieces of Mystic Scale. <br />
<br />
March 2001 - Attended my first wedding today in Lake Rathe. I met a lot of the officers and higher members of KoE for the first time today, including Lord Rizz. <br />
<br />
May 7, 2001 - I achieved the 25th circle of wisdom and therefore have begun the path of the alchemist. <br />
<br />
March 17, 2002 - I achieved the 30th circle of wisdom and am specialized in the circle of Alteration. I now also control the awesome power of the form of the bear. <br />
<br />
November 11, 2002 - I achieved the 34th circle of wisdom and am now a spirit caller. I control the power of the great wolf spirit! (This is a great personal goal for me and one of the happiest days of my EQ life). <br />
<br />
November 20, 2002 - I finally have defeated the Undead Crusader for the last time and collected all the Skulls of the Caste of Bone Bretheren. After giving them to Crusader Quarg, he sent me on a quest to collect the skulls of Crusaders of Rok Nilok. These skulls where actually given to me by Lord Avalanche a long time ago, so I immediately gave them to Mystic Dovan to receive my Iron Cudgel of the Prophet. <br />
<br />
December 21, 2002 - I achieved the 39th circle of wisdom. This is an important step in my growth as a shaman and now able to harness a vigilant spirit as well the greater poisons to inflict upon my enemy. Most of all, I now have the ability to cast Chloroplast which will aid me and my companions in our journeys. <br />
<br />
December 22, 2002 - After receiving a nice Collapsed Mixing Bowl and Collapsed Spit given to me by our tinker Xunil, I was able to quickly learn the skill of baking all the way up to be able to be called a master (143). <br />
<br />
December 23, 2002 - Today was the first time I visited Lord Nagafen's Lair. I was not brave enough to face him, but spent quite some time decimating the minions of his fiery lair. This is probably the first dungeon that I felt it absolutely necessary for everyone in my party to be shrunk. After being in vast open dungeons of Kunark, Velius, and Luclin, this dungeon was very claustrophobic. <br />
<br />
December 26, 2002 - Today was a very good day. So many thing happened that where a first experience for me. The evening started by making a trip to my old hunting grounds of Field of Bone, there I went to the old marauder cave to get a little revenge. Luck may have it upon one of their deaths, a lesser spirit was summoned. After explaining to it, that this poor Iksar had threatened my life, the spirit spoke with me further and gave me a tiny gem to give to a barbarian in Freeport. This is no easy undertaking because I've never been to free port, just heard stories of it's vastness from my wife. After taking a trip to the tunnels through the Plane of Knowledge, I found this Barbarian and gave him the gem. He led me to the Jade Tiger in where I spoke to 2 greater spirits who then instructed me further on where I shall proceed in my quest. Tonight was also a great night because I went to Karnor's Castle for the second time and not only was this the first time I've truly grouped with primaries of KoE, got plenty of xp and experience, but also was awarded my first no drop loot on a raid, three pieces of Jarsath Scale.<br />
<br />
December 27, 2002 - Today started off by heading to Erud's Crossing and meeting with Ooglyn, a female ogre shaman. I gave her the gem that the greater spirit from Freeport gave me. She then instructed me to follow her into the waters and to wait for the spirit to appear. There were a lot of people who tried to trick me or persuade me to leave both with /tells as well as spirits of the water. I held strong and received the next gem in my quest from the greater spirit.<br />
<br />
December 28, 2002 - Today I started my day by proceeding to the Rathe Mountains to smite out Tabien the Goodly and Glaron the Wicked. I promptly took envy, woe, and marr's promise to the sentinel spirit in West Karana. He too gave me gem to mark my progress and instructed me where to go to further my quest. Then with the helm of Thrug, Soriis, Moonshae, and Row's cleric, I was able to journey into Mistmoore Castle, defeat the advisor and promptly defeat the Dire Wolf of Mistmoore. I then proceeded to journey to the Emerald Jungle where I turned in the pelt to the Sentinel Spirit there to receive my Black Fur Boots. Lastly, today I also met with Galdon Vok Nir and he reconstructed the skull of Dai Nozok. I then promptly returned both skulls of Di Nozok and Dai Nozok to Heirophant Zand to receive my Iron Cudgel of the Channeler.<br />
<br />
December 29, 2002 - Today I continued to work on the 6th cudgel quest of the Scaled Mystics. I was successful with alchemy in mixing A Potion of Swirling Mists form components gathered across the land. I also reluctantly had to kill a poor iksar slave which after giving to Atheling Plague, and defeating Clerk Doval, I received the 2nd skull of the sisters of scale. I then proceeded to the Lake of Ill Omen, where I killed the Sarnak Dragoon and returned the Dragoon Helm to Klok Sargin. He then informed me that the 3rd skull of the sisters of scale was held by Bruiser Noz, who I had to smite out as well to get the skull. Several times throughout the day I returned to Dalnir, but was not able to give the Potion of Swirling Mists to the Coerced Chaneller.<br />
<br />
December 30, 2002 - Finally was able to give the potion of swirling mists to the Coerced Channeler who gave me the first skull of the sisters of scale. I then promptly returned to the Temple of Tower and returned the skulls to Hierophant Dexl who was lazily relaxing in the temple of tower's basement. He went into a trance and apparently a spirit that was channeled through him thanked me for returning the skulls and gave me this lazy hierophant's Iron Cudgel of the Hierophant. To continue my quest I must enter the dungeon of Charisis, though I do not have the key so set out on a journey and with the aid of Jlove Fizzboom, we vanquished both the Sarnak Chancellor of Lake of Ill Omen and the Necromancer of Kaesora known as Xalgoz. I now have the key to the Howling Stones.<br />
<br />
January 1, 2003 - Today I decided to follow up on the instructions given to me by the Sentinel Spirit on the 28th. I traveled into the City of Mist and began to search for the lost city of mist reports. I had them almost all collected, when I was invited to help kill Lord Rak. I didn't know the significance of this at the time, but on our way, I found the last of the City of Mist reports. Amazingly, we also fought Lord Ghiosk, which to my surprise had 3 books which had more information about the downfall of the High Scale and the City of Mist. While also in the City I found an Icon of the High Scale left on the floor of a temple. Once I am brave enough to face Kirn, I shall present this to him in means to learn the truth. Since Trakanon's Teeth was near by, I decided to hunt for the Froglock Hunter and Forager to complete my key to Old Sebilis.<br />
<br />
January 2, 2003 - Today I achieved the 44th circle of wisdom. I now have the ability to hasten the speed of my comrades' attacks with Alacrity. Also, I now am wise enough to be able to have high level spells cast upon me.<br />
<br />
January 12, 2003 - Today I visited the Great Oowomp today and gave him Greyish Bone Chips, Crushed Dread Diamonds, Yun Shaman Powder, and Strange Ochre Clay. He then rewarded me with a scroll of Cannibalize II.<br />
<br />
January 15, 2003 - Today with special thanks to my guildmate Thrug Soulbasher I achieved the 46th circle of wisdom and I was able to enter the plane of tranquility. This is an amazing achievement that I never thought I'd ever achieve.<br />
<br />
January 16, 2003 - Today I bought my first horse today. She will be my faithful companion until the day I recieve and ornate bridle, if that day ever comes. Her name, Epona.<br />
<br />
January 18, 2003 - Today was the first time I've visited one of the planes (appart from Tranquility and Knowledge). I was invited to help with a hunt in the clockwork Plane of Innovation. Today I also recieved my first armour upgrade that dropped while grouped in the planes, a Large Smoothmetal Torque.<br />
<br />
January 26, 2003 - Today with the help of many friends and guildmates, we helped my good friend Tarachi Yfantis complete her epic quest to aquire the great Ragebringer.I have always been torn by the ways of my people. I don't blame them; they were enslaved by the Ring of Scale for hundreds of years. After the death of our beloved king, our social structure has turned more tribal again and we even fight amongst ourselves.
