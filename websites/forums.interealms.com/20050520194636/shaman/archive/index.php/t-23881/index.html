<br />
this is something i would like, as capes dont exist (even tho we wear them *shrugs*)<br />
<br />
give it an extra slot that it can be worn so that it read <br />

Actually, I haven't carried it for a long time, since I got my sprinkler in HoT ( which was several upgrades ago).  My proudest part of that epic came when SOE allowed us to change that silly Prophet (&quot;The end of the world is coming&quot;) title to Heyokah!</div></div><hr />
