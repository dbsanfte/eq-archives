<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hardback</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lvl 58 Iksar Shaman with Epic <br />
<br />
I need to get 60 and was wondering where the best place to solo was for my level.<br />
<br />
I hear Katta guards are great but I do not wish to hose my faction with them.<br />
<br />
I will do Seru gaurds in a heart beat but I dont know how to solo in that place I can get a map its just I see named mobs roming and a huge agro range and a 5 min spawn time and im KOS<br />
<br />
Any advice??<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had pretty good luck soloing zone-in/out in Chardok from 58-60.  I'd imagine it'd go pretty fast now that 59 is no longer a hell lvl.  Plus the occasional SBS and whatnot isn't a bad bonus. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Take a 60 Warrior, 60 Druid and yourself into Chardok Mines - let the druid use animal charm on the dogs down there (we even charm pull 3-4 mobs), use root  for mob control and the new druid and shaman heals work extremely well.<br />
<br />
Shrink the druids pet dog - makes it easier to see which is the pet. Also get the druid to use his 70% haste pet buff on the dog.<br />
<br />
For a faster group, use another druid, Monk and wizzie - bards also work for non-stop pulls. Grab a KEI before you go down there and just run the mines curcuit.<br />
<br />
You will not need to be level 60 I slowed easily at 59..<br />
<br />
Most fun we've had was with dru, 2 shm, war and a sk - taking out 4 ancients on the bridge with adds :) <br />
<br />
Paralysing Earth is *the* best crowd control lol..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless you've done an enormous amount of faction work, Katta guards already hate your guts.  There are also some guards in the vampire Nathyn's house that don't hose Katta faction anyway.  Other good spots would be Chardok, Scarlet Desert plateau (I hear anyway, never hunted there myself) and Sol B (LDC and, at 59, Imps/Freeti).<br />
<br />
Seru guards are likely too tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Chardok was VERY good to me.  I soloed there mostly and landed tons of exp.  With KEI and PotG at 59, I could &quot;solo&quot; the gate for decent exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">at 58 I'm doing SD. Rev and Trojeg are about 1% per 5 kills, one blue per 20. I have horse and JBB and go non stop. You can pick up quite a bit of seelable loot off the named too.<br />
<br />
I've tried Umbral, doable, just takes everything you got. Gonna try undead in ME next, maybe that will be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HOLY...Carr, druids can charm down there??  I go there frequently with 60 sk, dru, shm (me) and many times a rog.  Ohhhhhh...sweet must try.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chardok and HS are the two most underestimated zones in EQ.  pulling the entire fort of chardok is very good exp.  Pulling all of HS south wing is better than d1/d2 exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well d1 and d2 have always sucked in my opinion hehe.  Ive never liked seb xp except juggs now post-xp change patch.  Was in illis and oh man it was terrible regular 60 xp now.  Just aweful.  Barely even a blue an hour if that.<br />
<br />
Chardok however is good no matter where ya go usually, mines preferred, but just solo up and down the lev hall or down to the bridge through fort and back up again.  Observer can be tricky (he likes to use rains) but great xp solo/duo.<br />
<br />
Howling stones the mobs are a bit low level now.  I dont like it much anymore but still a very nice spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i did 59 when it was a hell lvl.  i would partner the shrooms in FG with a 56 necro and the xp seemed to move...who knows now :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did 58 in Jaggedpine, a blue an hour.<br />
<br />
Will try katta next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uusal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Grey was good for my bank account and my exp bar. Snakes around the temple give decent exp and golems around the temple spwan named that drop very sought after items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone done any rockfiends solo in the Grey since the exp patch?  I soloed there part of 57 and could kill the rockfiends but they were tough, took about 5 min each.  I know they're still dark blue at 60 and am wondering if the exp patch might have made the time per kill worthwhile for me now at 58.  Dual-wielding dogdog will probably speed things up a lot too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can confirm a blue an hour in Jaggedpines with KEI cast on me.<br />
<br />
Can also get some ok cash loot as rares. Loot goes from that zones FS to 71p lore armor stuff vendor sellable. The rare loot is 500 to 900p items you can sell in the bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Only the Gnollish Ring of Sorcery sells for a K, the others sell for around 150-250. But they do sell. Wish they weren't lore though.<br />
<br />
I'm done with that zone. I did it far too long and now I'm sick of it, and at 59, things are too lightblue. But it was nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>zymral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">would have to tell ya the scounds and archers in echo caverns are an awsome solo camp i get a blue and 250pp an hour there!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I duoed the castle in Velks with a monk a week ro so ago.  Spent about 2 hours in there and got about 10% of level 59.  We camped in Velketor's throne room, and the monk pulled 2-3 at a time.  Once they were slowed, it was easy (oh, he was using a tstaff, which made a big difference - especially with HoS/Dex stacking being bugged again).<br />
<br />
We didn'tbreak in there as a duo, we were part of a group - so I don't know if its doable as a duo.  Don't see why not, the most we took on during the break was 3 mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i might try that . got tips ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Scounds are easy. I can single pull them at level 59.<br />
<br />
These is normally my pattern.<br />
<br />
1. Get on the rock and slow the left archer. Send in 2 dots of your choice. This will get you summoned to the top. Kill and then start on the second archer. <br />
<br />
2. levitate down or jump and kill the 2 scounds in the front of the gate. <br />
<br />
3. Pull and kill the 2 scounds across the cavern in front of the other building.<br />
<br />
4. Go down the middle hallway and swim into the room with the 3 skelletons. I root the middle one and pull the left skeleton. I generally only get one skeleton at a time. kill all 3 skeletons.<br />
<br />
5. Head back to the archers and med while they respawn.<br />
<br />
6. goto step 1<br />
<br />
The scounds and skeletons drop 3-6pp each.<br />
the archers drop 2 Bows worth 23pp each.<br />
<br />
I generally start and end each night by killing the archers. thats nearly 200pp for about 15 minutes of work. This is where i get my KEI money each night.<br />
<br />
The exp is not great imho. Exp in the grey, chardok etc is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hardback</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yeah I have been doing Echo cause <br />
1. ITs close to vendors and bank and very easy to get to<br />
2. I make about 100pish per round I clear mobs have 25 min timer so 100p every 25min<br />
3.  Chardok is always camped<br />
<br />
I am 4 blues from 59 <br />
hopefully I can finish off 59 and start on AA points<br />
<br />
And Kattana Gaurds are only Threating at moment need to kill few more seru guards to get to Non-KOS but almost there <br />
I wanted no-KOS cause of EB item (which I already have organs for) and Bane sheild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lindorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">PoM if you can figure a way to get there. AIW is great xp, and perfect shami solo spot. No adds, pulls totaly controled. Uber armor probably takes a friend or two, but good plat from each keel too. Not many people there these days so easy to get spawn. Just dont die unless you have access to a cleric. I get a blue bub of aa with each kill.</div></div><hr />
