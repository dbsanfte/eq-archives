<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I browse around a few EQ sites and came across this thread (http://fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10151) on the FoH forum.  Post number 3 or so by Furor mentioning that Sunmoon got jacked.<br />
<br />
This the same Sunmoon that is our benevalent host?  And how did he get jacked?  The topic of the thread is class sites and forums selling out to Yantis and IGE, possibly due to a chance that SoE might legitimize RL sales of in game stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe he's referring to the IGE ads that Sunmoon has accepted for putting on the crucible / ranger sites to generate some revenue and cover costs (plus a little extra).  I think at one point there was some altercation involving Furor on the ranger board and he was thus banned, and just ranting in his typical fashion about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">same sunmoon<br />
<br />
hes just saying he thinks he sold adspace too early<br />
<br />
furor is just a bitter person</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, but selling ad space is different than selling the whole site.  One's cool, and the other is not.  Apparently Furor thinks Sunmoon sold out.  Wonder who's laughing now?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Man, it must be hard to be a 12 year old boy forever....<br />
<br />
But seriously, if he hates it that much, dont go there. (of couse if he's banned, he no longer has a choice hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Furor just likes to jerk out his manhood and compare it to people, nothing constructive to say there, just move past it and shake your head in wonder that an adult can really behave that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep heard that too.<br />
But reading Furors rants gives me the impression he is the sort of person who says that so people say &quot;We're not worthy,dont go etc etc&quot;<br />
You always get some little idiot who will say Furor is such a l33t dood (whatever that means) and Furor is the sort of person who will milk it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm just actually read Furors posts.<br />
Boy is he ever a bigger ******** than i gave him credit for.<br />
Ah hes heard Sony will sell chars etc.Doubtless 1 of his close buddys at SOE told him this ?.<br />
&quot;Oh Sony you pi**ed me off by making Time to hard for me and my uber guild to do in 10 mins we had to work at it instead of zerging it so im going to leave you for WoW and try andd piss other people off so they quit too&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
<br />
PS<br />
As for Sunmoon being a &quot;board Nazi&quot;.Yer havent you all noticed how hes always on here banning people and censoring stuff (heavy sarcasm)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edited to put stars in pi**ed as board didnt blank it for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just reading his posts on the first page of that thread, Furor appears to be saying that Sunmoon acted foolishly in agreeing to the (presumably explusive) advertising deal now, because Furor believes that SoE will soon legalize account sales, which would mean that Sunmoon could have made a lot more money by waiting until then to sell the ads.  He does not appear to say that Sunmoon sold the site.<br />
<br />
Personally I disagree with his prediction.  I could see SoE selling pre-levelled characters and uber gear itself, but if it did so it would actually become aggressive against Yantis/IGE/etc because they would be directloy competing for $ (right now SoE does not care much about them because account sales probably actually makes money for SoE by keeping accounts active when original owners quit).<br />
<br />
It is also reasonable to infer that Furor was offered the option to sell ads or ownership of his boards because they get an enormous amount of traffic, and the he turned them down.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of reasons to flame the guy if you want, but find one that is somewhat legitimate.</div></div><hr />

Hmm 1st posts he talks about IGE and Yantis offering 5 figures for these sites.<br />
2nd post talks about sunmoon selling too early not mentioning anything about Sunmoon only selling advertising space.<br />
So yes that to means says that he thinks Sunmoons sold the site.<br />

Yep, Furor is a sad human being.  Everytime I read anything he's posted I just feel sorry for him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have any idea how meny times a day he gets asked things like that? Basically he said that if SOE didnt fix items A,B,and C. He was &quot;going&quot; to quit. Well gess what items A,B,and C got fixed. While he has his own way of saying things. In the end he dose make the game better for everyone. When he takes up a cause it is something that needs to be fixed. He maynot be very tactfull but he dose get the job done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats very true.  As much as I don't like Furor, he does get things done, and you do have to give him respect as a raidleader.  The tactics FoH and Afterlife pioneer are the reason that many guild on other servers find any measure of success. <br />
<br />
He's still an ass though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">He maynot be very tactfull but he dose get the job done.<br />
It was raining and I wanted it to stop.  So I went outside and cursed at the skies until the rain stopped.  I wasn't very tactful, but I got the job done.<br />
<br />
Seriously, Furor is just some guy playing a video game.  I sincerely doubt that Sony really cares anything at all about him or his opinions.</div></div><hr />

False.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's probably smarter than 95% of us when it comes to an on-line computer game.  When you look at the relevance of that, he's actually dumber than 95% of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">He prolly is, but I'll bet 95% of us have seen more sunshine than him in the last 4 years, and 95% of us have less throbbing veins in our foreheads that poke out on a daily basis, so it's a wash.<br />
<br />
I wonder if that 5 figures includes decimal points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Furor is smarter than 95% of the retards on this board especially the people flaming him.<br />
 While I agree that he is very knowledgeable about EQ, I felt the need to reply after I read his post.....<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully, Sunmoon already got jacked. Couldn't have happened to a bigger ******** and board nazi.&quot;<br />
<br />
THIS takes the cake and in all his snide humor I cannot believe he can't see himself calling the kettle black.<br />
<br />
To anyone who actually believes that Sony Online Entertainment or their subsequent Devs were shaking in the boots in fear that Furor would quit.....guess what....your fooling yourselves....trust me.<br />
<br />
SoE knows full well that it would take more than a revolt from one player(albiet with a semblance of influence) to make the majority part with characters they've invest -years- of time into.......<br />
<br />
I see players posting here(who have posted for years) complain on and on and on and on and on about what they feel is unfair-broken-boring-yadda yadda with this game...but take a step back and you'll see yourself....most of them still play.....think about it.<br />
<br />
I have alot of respect for Sunmoon and had to post due to the the irony of Furors quote.</div></div><hr />

we know Furor had a gun to your head when you typed that. I wonder what he's going to make Ceno say to this?<br />

Snugglenutz,<br />
<br />
What diference does it make how many times he gets asked a question?  So that makes it right for him to be a jerk, huh?  I'm not looking for a flame war here, I was just stating a brief encounter I had with him.<br />
<br />
Hell, maybe his daddy taught him that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what makes him a jerk in that situation? That he didnt take the time from setting up a raid or something to answer your inconsequential question. That is first off none of your buisness. And irrelvavent in that it happened over 6 months ago. Hell I myself would have ignored you for a question like that. So would most people and I am willing to bet that you yourself have in the past. He who lives in a glass house and all of that...<br />
<br />
Has for your last bit any one that has ever read one of Furor's flame posts someplace. KNOWS that is not that case. He will raise bloody hell when he feels he needs to and sometimes just for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I sure would hate to defend Furor because I've read enough of his cry baby &quot;I'm gunna hold my breath till I get my way&quot; posts.<br />
<br />
But dude... because you asked him why he didnt quit and he ignored you, THAT is your basis why he's a jag off?<br />
<br />
He's a jag off for a million reasons better than that.  I'm forever AFK w/o putting afk on.  And when I'm running 2, 3 or 4 chars at once stuff slips by.  I cant tell you how many times I've said to myself I wanted to send a tell to someone I was talking to before and I hit shift up to respond to him when I start seeing all these other names of friends that have obviously sent something to me that I missed.  Do they say &quot;Man that Gorgos ignored me, he's such a jag off!&quot;  No, once again... I'm a jag off for a whole lot more reasons than because I ignored someone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Didn't expect all of this to happen.  My apologies for starting a big war.  I was just curious what he meant about Sunmoon, and the reference to the sites being sold.  At the outside I expected some conversation about the idea that SoE will sell stuff in the game for real money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The fact that the mere mention of Furor's name incites this much debate is proof that his influence IS far greater than your typical EQ player.<br />
<br />
Dunno about the current crop of Devs, but considering that Aradune invited Furor to a private viewing of whatever it is that Sigil is cooking up now... To me that says that at least the former developers did listen to his opinions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Dont forget the walk throug for WoW that he got to. Or the wright ups he has been allowed to do. If you want to see the other side of the coin so to speak where Furor is concered. Or if you just want to find out more about the WoW classes click the link below. While talking about the classes he also tells a nice little story. Sinces it is the guild sight the wrights ups are listed has 3-2-1. So you will have to scroll back to read them in order.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Smashz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just an FYI Snugglenutz but Furor was standing around doing nothing like most us waiting for a port to the new zones because most of the old zones were down, like they have been for the past few days.  I really don't know what your problem is but if someone asks me a question in RL I answer them and don't ignore them, but yeah I forgot, this is a game and everyone is sitting behind computers so they have an excuse to be rude, impolite, or outright *******s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Sciek,<br />
With all due respect I dissagree.  Just because someone is well known doesn't mean much.  He's famous for being such a tool plain and simple.  I really dont know why some people act like he isn't the worlds biggest tool... I take it back, I think I do know why.  Theythink if they are nice to him they will keep getting Phat Lewts.  So it's a means to an end.<br />
<br />
Lots of people know of FoH, good or bad anything that is mentioned there reaches a lot of people.  You think if he didnt have such a popular web site they would have invited him?  It's all about numbers Sigil wants people to know about their new game w/o actually showing any SS or information.  They dont want his input, they want the free publicity.  And it seems to be working huh? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Well you find people that ignor your questions to be rude. I find people that ask silly questions to be both rude and annoying. And what do we do with rude annoying people? We IGNOR them (Was that the clue bell that just rung?) Lets recap you asked a stuipid question and you got ignored... All seems right with the world to me so far. Had you said he was rude becuse he told you to F--- Off I would have to agree with you whole heartly. But for ignoring a silly question not a chance.<br />
<br />
On a side note I find it interesting that you chose this thread for a first post when there are meny other much more deserving. I also find your spelling of my name curious. Reminds me of boss man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>garlaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I also thought I read on his first write up of WoW that the reason he was invited was because he happened to be friends with someone that worked there.  I could see that conversation where the WoW guy asks the PR folks for permission... &quot;yeah, this guy runs a big guild on everquest, has a site that gets a lot of traffice AND he hates SONY&quot;.  <br />
<br />
It's actually sad how much some folks let online games consume their lives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The point I was making is simply that his notoriety alone is such that his opinion is much more well known, and thus worth more from a PR standpoint than most.  Sorta like a Movie Star voicing their political views, right, wrong, or just completely out in left field... Their opinion is worth a lot more than mine or yours for the simple fact that people are curious what they have to say, while I highly doubt that most people give a **** what You or I think about the war in iraq or the ethical treatment of lab rats or whatever the topic of the day happens to be. ;)<br />
<br />
That's not to say Furor doesn't know what he's talking about though.  Generally, there is a valid point to his rants and in the end, whether it's in any way related to him or not, those issues usually get fixed fairly quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Furor did say that he (and I think his entire guild) would quit EQ in a week if SOE didn't fix one of the PoP encounters.  One of the other guilds (TR maybe?) even ran a countdown.  SoE did not do anything, someone else beat the encounter, Furor didn't quit but started being a WoW-fanboi instead.  <br />
<br />
Like Dennis Rodman, I wouldn't really want to be around the guy, but he does make things more interesting, and he seems to be pretty good at what he does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">you know, i just realized, if  I spent the time he spent playing EQ in college classes. I would have another degree. Maybe even a 6 year one. Man, kinda makes you think. Massive online college? Anyone want to develop it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">It's amazing.  I know of Furor, but I never so much as said boo to him.  For all I know, he's a coworker and I don't care.  What's amazing is that so many people here make all sorts of judgements on his character and his real life and so few of them know him in any other context than his name and guild.  Could we just keep the speculation to ourselves and if you must comment, base it off of what you do know.<br />
<br />
I know that his post makes him look like a tool and that he's wrong.  Everyone has a right to earn a living and Sunmoon has shown a lot of class and restraint here.  That said, even Furor has the right to shoot his pie hole off, it only makes him look bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Dont mistake attention and a big mouth with intelligance.<br />

Point of order, I think we all need to get some.  Not in an insulting way mind you, like you losers need to go out there and get some loving and stop playing EQ.  Just in general cause its a good time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I think we all need to get some<br />
I think we could all agree on this point.  Sony would significantly increase their subscription rate if they found a way to address this issue.</div></div><hr />
