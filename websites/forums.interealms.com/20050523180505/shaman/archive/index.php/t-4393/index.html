<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Met the nicest Shaman tonight. Had some interesting gear on. (looks wise). So I asked if I could inspect.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I was more amazed at the Platinum armband or the Velium Jasper Rings.<br />
<br />
So I ask his Wis?<br />
<br />
188.<br />
<br />
Cool.<br />
<br />
What's your AC?<br />
<br />
/\ (See thread title)<br />
<br />
Hey no worries the Enchanter was slowing - all he had to do was heal.<br />
<br />
Somehow he got aggro. (2 Frogs in Jail) Went down faster than the Enchanter could AOE Mez. Here's the kicker - after I asked him his AC he replied:<br />
<br />
 &quot;AC is worthless to a Shaman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes - I should &quot; TACTFULLY &quot; refer him to this site.<br />
<br />
I'm not bragging - I KNOW I'm ghetto with an 896 AC (Self-Buffed). But daaaamn. I mean my ENCHANTER has a self-buffed AC of 690.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nah, let him play how he likes.  If he's that clueless at that level he deserves to suck and wash out with the rest of them.  Actually if he wasn't also that opinionated about an issue he obviously knew nothing about, I'd say refer him.  But as it is we get enuf people wanting to do the old AC/wis debate and frankly we've passed that stage on this board.  Tell him like it is, then let him make his mistakes.  If he continues to suck he'll quit and make a cleric or something and will probably love it.  Heck, we need more clueless clerics out there.  Someone has to do that job.</div></div><hr />

We discussed a couple of points on the final fight (taken from here), and he got a kick out of this one:<br />
<br />
5) After you hand in the tear and Rak aggros, wait until the mage pets are engaged and Rak is on them, before you slowly step out of range. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I died with Rak too!  <br />
<br />
Oh wait that was because the mages delayed sending in the pets until I died for some stupid reason, I think they were hesitant because they had aggroed Neh when I hadn't turned in the piece before and they  were afraid of screwing it up again.  <br />
<br />
Hell hath no fury like a shammie that has to go get that damn tear again because of others stupidity!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">shrug, if he was a wis shaman and had 188 wis, he was probably poor AND not maxxed on defense.<br />
<br />
Something to consider, its really hard for shaman to truely understand why they need hp/ac until they start slowing and getting agro all the time.  I know i didnt slow much until 49, and if you havent maxed your defense at that point, you might just shy away from agro totally (a downward spiral, because it sure aint getting easier).<br />
Someone with AC that low probably needs the advice to get his defense up, more than coming to any site or getting ac/hp gear.<br />
<br />
edit, oh yeah, and someone please look at my magelo and tell me that my book makes me a druid.  HAR, i would love for some fool shaman to start thinking that when they want to boast about thier ac or hps =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey I died on Rak turn-in too:) However I would have lived trough it, but somehow I thought I was supposed to die, so I just stood there and took a beating. <br />
<br />
 I had an interesting discussion with a fellow Ab shaman too. Was soloing Mushrooms in FG when I saw an auction &quot;WTS JBB 37k&quot;<br />
 I thought ok, this guy is some other class and only heard that Jbb is very wanted among the shamans but hasnt got a slightest clue about it's price, or this guy has confused Jbb to a Jb BP. So I sent him a tell asking if he had confused these 2 items. The reply was &quot;no they nefred the drop rate of Jbb, the prices have gone way up now, it's the bracer and it's damn rare now, 37K is a good price&quot;.  At this point I finally did a /who and realized he's a 56 shaman. I almost fell from my chair... So I asked him if his fungi was no drop now, and if he had noticed how Sow seemed much slower too.<br />
 I already knew I shouldnt go on with this, but still told him that Jbb drops just like it used to, and that these were just rumours that have been circulating for every since kunark was released. You never know, this guy sounded ok at first, so he just  might be clueless. I told him the correct price is not more than 16K now that the bazaar has taken the prices up. <br />
 Well then this smuck replies me that ok, sell me your Jbb for 16k then, and I'll sell it out for 37K too. At this point I was already about to give it up, and didnt reply.... Until he sent me another tell saying &quot;LOL seems like I got your mind changed haha&quot;  Yea right... I still need my Jbb, it's a nice toy, even at lvl 60 when soloing. However it's a toy and a toy is not worth 37k. I wouldnt pay 37K for a JB Bp, even less for a single bracer. I wouldnt sell it to prove my point in a worthless conversation with a greedy dork who had probably Ngb'd the Jbb in hopes of Phat lewtz.<br />
<br />
  So I camped out for the night... I didnt feel like arguing with a guy who's point will probably be proven wrong for many, many times in near future...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What the hell was this guy wearing?  BRONZE armor?  With such low AC AND WIS, can't see where he was concentrating his armor to.  At the level that yer in the Jail, you should already have your armor coming togather in a coherent fashion and it sounds like this guy was clueless about all armor balancing.<br />
<br />
Oh, but he IS right.... AC is useless (unless you get hit) and HP's are useless (unless you ain't got any...... LOADING....  Please Wait)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's easy to have low AC if you never work on defense.   Running around in circles spamming &quot;get it off the healer&quot; doesn't work as well for raising skill as standing there beating it back.  I know... I was a mid 30s convert to AC/HP life.  Also was very easy to end up with wis gear before the bazaar, it seemed to be less expensive than a good set of HP/AC.<br />
<br />
Heck, in some cases, it still is much less expensive to get high wis than it is high AC etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I had a really really amusing moment with a ranger guildmate a few weeks ago. (Moment of background - I've been duoing with my wifes ranger a lot since 51st or so, I know what a good ranger can do and she has her gear set up for maxxed AC/HP - shes only 54th and hits 1050 ac with just her/my buffs)<br />
<br />
So I'm duoing in Burning woods with this 50th ranger from the guild, I only know her from chat and have never grouped with her before. So she starts pulling, first mob comes in - I slow it and yet it is still ripping her to shreds, I'm healing like mad - heck I even slowed it again in case I was asleep and missed a resist the first time or something. <br />
<br />
So we're chatting as the downtime mounts - every pull/fight was like that with me burning tons of mana healing her. I finally start chatting about gear and look at what she is wearing, I nearly fainted - she was wearing massive amounts of stat/resist gear and basically nothing for AC/HP. I offered some polite advice on upgrades (things I could make/give away cheap etc) only to be told that this was the set she WANTED. <br />
<br />
I laughed a lot to myself and from then on told her not to taunt at all and I tanked the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/em wonders if more rangers dress like this, and that that's why they have such a bad reputation for just falling down when the mob looks at them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Its so easy nowadays to up your AC as a shaman. The Bazaar works wonders for your stats.<br />
<br />
I have a friend who started playing shaman a few months back, and hes been playing like mad. Totally loves it. He is mostly in it for the pvp, and is ecstatic about his sowboots and ability to tank and melee down other players. Anyway, his ac at lvl48ish is probably better than mine was at lvl55 preVelious.<br />
<br />
So yeah, running around at 702ac not only means his defense isnt maxed, but he is also totally clueless about the importance of some good plate inbetween yourself and the monsters. Arguing that he lacks money to upgrade isnt true. With Bazaar you can pick up some serious ac/hp gear for very little cash.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just remembered, we had a powerlevelled wizard who ran at 203ac up in Hate. Boy did he like to nuke. Well, until he became too low level to use icecomet.</div></div><hr />

As I do with most of my characters I carry around 2 bags of extra gear with me to mix &amp; match<br />
<br />
AC wise if I'm going to be taking something nasty and JBBing / dotting I can get around 915ac buffed at 49, standard gear I run at 807ac with 180wis. I figure when I get along to a PoF raid I'll hit 200wis and can start upgrading to more AC.  <br />
<br />
Just needing some crystal spider eyes to replace my only piece of druid like equipment ;) and needing sickle to finish solstice earring for some nice hp / ft1 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you just look at the basic Shaman armor sets out there and follow them you notice what.. they're pretty good in the AC department arent' they?    I've mostly followed my Armor progression;<br />

Hate/Jaundice Bone<br />
Thurga/Pog (that got so slow I leveled up instead)<br />

I had a cleric friend offer to sell me their Green dragon scale tunic cheap before I got my Vindi BP and they were surprised I didn't want it.  My husband's Enchanters AC is almost 800 for goodness sake.<br />
<br />
Half the damn people out there are still clueless.  They don't understand how powerful Slow is, or the benefit of AC/Hps.  What good is mana if you aren't alive to use it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for AC, although I would never give it up, I still wish I had more AC on my fungi =P   Can't have it all, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My shaman is my alt, my primary is a ranger... well should I say my primary WAS my ranger.  I now consider both mains (yeah yeah yeah).  Seanus appears to be catching up to that ole woodelf daily.<br />
<br />
Anywho, coming up as a ranger in the &quot;old&quot; days (defense caps, mana penalty, experience penalty), I hoarded AC like a fiend.  I still do in fact, and his AC is 1030 self buffed (not bad for a paper tank).  My first realization of the shaman class when helping a guildy shaman get some equipment in FM.  I was comparing notes, and found his AC was higher than my rangers!!!   A little more investigation, and Seanus was borne.<br />
<br />
With the shaman I understand the points of discussion surrounding AC, and with Seanus too I have a good supply of AC.  But I also carry around a good supply of Wisdom gear too (all thanks to the Tribunal for clicky Jaundiced Bone Arms).  Depending on the situation, I switch gear out between High AC (travel, Soloing, camp breakin) and High Wisdom (Controlled group combat).<br />
<br />
There is no ONE set of ultimate shaman gear, nor should folks look to become a POWA shammy just by stocking up on one type of gear.  Like a tank, there are situations where one type of gear is required, and other types for others.  Seanus can get his Wisdom up to 220, but runs about 190-200 usually in group situations.  When traveling Wisdom is still in the 180s.<br />
<br />
I'm sure if I solo'd more, I'd have more AC/HP gear, but I'm a group shammy (although I can and have soloed).  Defense skill is in the 180s, and the Shammys AC is close to 800.<br />
<br />
The point is -- as the Shaman class is jack of all trades (and masters of some), there is no one set of ultimate gear.  Be flexible, and carry the resources to adapt to a change in situation, and your fellow citizens of Norrath will thank you for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On AB the pricing is really weird some items are really expensive, and others are soooo cheap. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yea.. Last night, it was... He was /auctioning it in the bazaar channel first, but I guess too many people told him off about his prices...37K for a kunark bracer is ust plain nuts... The sad thing is that there's enough of those disgustingly rich &quot;one week shaman twinks&quot; on Ab that someone will eventually buy it just because they have seen someone using it and been told it's great item... Who gives a crap about 37k if you have 3millions in bank...  Sadly I think AB is the only server where one can really see people like I just described above (both situations!).<br />
 <br />
 After I started playing again I havent been able to look at the bazaar chat for more than few moments at time. Ab /thebazaar is just too much for me... Maybe if we'd get some sort of age limit but...<br />
  People ask outrageous prices from crap items or argue about who scammed who's account/fungi/screaming mace/etc, or then they mock each other's gear, guild, looks, anything...  And oh lord  with that spammage... Of course someone will trade your Orc fang earring, one diamond and Langseaux to WW dragon legs or wilsapper in no time if you just keep sending that WTT PST PST every 15 seconds...<br />
<br />
One more pet peeve about trade channels now that I'm warming up....<br />
  I was hoping that when bazaar came out I'd never again have to answer &quot;Offer me!&quot; question or hear &quot;Taking offers on &lt;serpentine bracer&gt; &quot; but god no... I'll sell that serpentine bracer and I'll get maximum amount of plat possible out of it... 50pp? no way, I need at least 55! <br />
I'm so glad that I found all the purchasable equipment upgrades from the bazaar last week, OOIV, Barbed Rubi Bracer and Slime covered Rubi Coif, all together for 40k'ish. I'm not going to step on bazaar nor on the market chat in ages now... Not that I'd have any money anymore either;)</div></div><hr />

Lodi shields that went for 25k a month ago are for sale for 16k. Maybe it is because any droppable stuff you buy can and will be taken if you suck in pvp. I guess that is what keeps prices down.<br />
<br />
But more to the point of this thread, I love being a lizard shaman. I have 890 ac and 220 wis and have fire cold and magic 90 and above (for those pesky wizards mages and druids). I can take a licking and keep on ticking. I am working on the HP department (1800 self buffed), but since I have to go for all no drop, you can understand it is harder for me to get the good ac and hps. But i definitely understand the need for em both.<br />
<br />
I am starting the Chardok quests (already have the undead dragon sinew) and those 3 items alone will give me another 250 hps in no drop gear. <br />

Not to hijack the thread... I took my lumps on my Rak turn-in.  I'm not a wis shaman, I probably could have lived, but I figured it was better to die and get rezzed back than risk training Rak on the rest of the guild.  I've seen it happen, even with 3 pets engaged.  It ain't pretty and the Tear will probably end up lost because the raid party will likely wipe.  If I had to do it over again, I'd *still* stand my ground, die, and take the 96% rez.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion, wis shaman, ghetto shaman are normally a direct reflection of their skill as a shaman.  I've yet to meet a shaman that proved me wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not? I've found myself in situations where it said I had insufficient mana for Root. Not exactly where you want to be, but it happens. I'd rather dump all my mana into slows, even if it leaves me oom, with the hope that maybe I'll be the only one to die since the party will then be left with a bunch of slowed MOBs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I agree w/ that An, but for a slightly different reason.<br />
<br />
Its not really the gear that makes em bad, its just that people w/ wis gear ALWAYS follow the Kunark cycle.  <br />
<br />
No good shammy comes out of DL, and the only reason that i consider myself a good shaman, is that i went to Solb for several levels, and learned to play chanter, controll add's while soloing in dungeons, and how to keep people alive.<br />
<br />
I was a wis shammy until 24, when i discovered these boards...strangely enough, i have almost the same wis now, but i can self buff myself to about 860 AC(more then double what i used to have) and around 16-17 hundred HP's.  <br />
<br />
I met a shaman yesterday in KC...he was 51, im 49.  He told me that i should have 6 wis rings, cause then ill have more mana, and didnt listen when i said that mana pool size is irrelevant if you die before your oom(i cant remember the last time i died before i was oom...Well, actually yes i can, but thats only cause the whole freaking basement in KC aggrod on our group, and i basicly had no chance to get out alive(Monks FD failed after a nuke)).<br />
<br />
Anyway, he lost half his health in 2 rounds from a skele, and ran around until tanks got aggro, but he still didnt listen.<br />
-<br />
The gear a shaman wears deffinately reflects their skill(in 99% of shaman i have seen, i did see one guy who was pretty good, but had wis simply cause he was untwinked, and wis is a far cheaper way to go + people on my server know crap about shaman).<br />
<br />
The gear itself doesnt make em bad, but rather its what they were told, and the route they took(kunark outdoor) that &quot;proved&quot; it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but he died with a HUGE mana pool. :)<br />
Hmm, lvl 38, wearing Totemic, AC 742 unbuffed, without a shield, gaah, I bet when he gets a mob on him he runs around in circles screaming, &quot;getitoff,getitoff,getitoff.......&quot;<br />
I mean, comeon, even the Chanters are starting to realize the advantage to HP/AC gear. <br />
<br />
Hah! That sounds like me at lvl 38 =p I had junk for gear. It was basically whatever i found off my kills that I was wearing. I only bought my weapon (A Spine Chill Spear hehe).  I think I was even wearing some stuff off the Gnolls in Split Paw lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Last night our guild did Doomshade.  The initial pulls involve several Dark Assassins and Gankta? Moktors, which clears a hole to get to the Masters.<br />
<br />
For some reason, our tanks (all outstanding, usually on the ball all the time) weren't picking up the adds that well last night.  Several mobs up there can't be mezzed, so having tanks that are awake prevents casters from getting baked.<br />
<br />
Not sure what has changed in the last month, but I had zero problems last night gaining and holding agro on the little stuff, and I had no troubles surviving as well.  I have upgraded my gear recently, but I didn't think it was earth shattering.  Last time I tried this I got clobbered.  1167 AC, 3600 hp, and the offtanks could continue sleeping and I got to have some fun in UP.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the hot topic in our guild is not the importance AC / HP, but the importance of Resists vs. HP or AC / HP.  I will let you folks chime in on that because my lunch break just ended...<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No doubt there.  The big problem is though, there is no real HP/AC gear out there for chanters, less they're sacrificing int/cha.  My enc's magelo is below.  I've worked my ass off to try and get some hp/ac on him, after I balanced out int/cha.  Still working on him, but I know it'll never be close to shaman kinda AC.  Hell, when i'm doing upgrading my druid, he'll have hp/ac/wis that my shaman does.  Actually, he'll have about 20 more wis, but that's besides the point.  The point is, the hp/ac fad has caught on, and I like it =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Anomalos, I'm completely ignorant of Enchanter issues and discussions, so please /bonk me if this is a stupid question: do any Enchanters go entirely the AC/HP/Resist/Cha route, leaving their Intelligence somewhere around 150? You would think with the Clarity line they might have a similiar situation to that of Shamans, where fast mana regen makes up for the small pool. Or is it just too necessary to have a large pool for mezzes and stuns?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Wanted to chime in on the Enchanter subject.  I * THINK * it is quite possible to get decent AC AND INT for a Chanter. (The &quot;Charisma &quot; debate rages much on the Chanter boards)<br />
<br />
My unguilded 55 Chanter has 690 AC (Self-buffed) 212 int and 213 Cha. (unbuffed) I can and WILL drop CHA the first chance I get (Epic and or OoIV).  Enchanters like Shaman are starting to look for HP gear - be it those snappy earrings from CT, the items from Chardok or heck, even the rings from the Coldain. (That last one just came to me - not sure if they're All / All)<br />
<br />
When my ROBE toon has a better AC than your CHAIN toon - there is a problem. (Imnshfo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I agree with you all that ac is great (even if I rate regen higher), but I really struggle to get the gear. My AC is well below 800 at level 49. Defence isn't maxed, but I've been soloing some dk blues and trying to get it up - its just so damn slow.<br />
<br />
As for new gear - I can't find the money, and I'm more interested in gaining levels than farming rallic packs. I've got some nice jaundiced stuff, an SBS and an iksar regen bp, but some items really suck - bloodstained mantle, soiled breachclout legs, mammoth hide cloak (drood I know!)<br />
<br />
But for people in small guilds, non-twinked, AC in the 700s is all some folks can manage. I'm working on the kromriff leggings - something I can actually quest and not buy - but need to get a good number of my guild to help make a full group around their 50s, as we don't have many high levels.<br />
<br />
If anyone has suggestions for a budget of 1kpp total, or for a single group in their high 40s and low 50s without camping for hours on end, or for me to solo at 49, then I'd welcome suggestions. It ain't easy, IMHO.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">A shaman going with WIS gear isn't necessarly a bad shaman.  With good health and mana regen and some disciplined aggro control (toss in good party/raid members) and you'll be ok.  Granted, no one will be talking about you soloing Yeld or Lodi, but you'll be able to torpor and malo pretty and in some situations, cripple, without much fear.   Granted, exp group will be a little tough and pick up groups will get you killed more often than not, but you'll be a bad assed buffing machine (not entirely sarcastic here believe it or not) and you'll be able to heal.  With the changes to dot kiting WIS shamans have even more opportunities to exp solo.<br />
<br />
As for Kunark shaman, any shaman, or even a druid, who levels up entirely in outdoor zones is not fully educated and is likely to be a little soft with lower skills and no experience or in some cases staying power.  Usually they panic until they get their dungeon legs.  For all those who bash KC, granted the average skill level is low there, but thats because of people who have high level chars and then go out and play their twinks.  I was in a KC group that was great, handled big pulls (paladin pulling could not single pull for the life of him) and made considerable exp.  It had 4 melees, a cleric, and me.  The cleric was so bored he went afk more often than not without telling the group.  The melees all had the same chronic problem, they assisted very well and any chanter would be proud of that group ... if we had one.  Without a chanter they never split incoming pulls, which tells me they all played high level raid chars, likely casters and that night was twink night ;).  So to make this group work well I took CC, I slowed adds first pulling them off of the melees easily (as the melees were all on the initial target).  I'd pull the adds outside the party's melee range, root with immobilise once I was in melee with it, and move onto the next target.  By the time I've slowed and parked the adds the initial mob is almost dead and the cleric can go back to sleep.  A wis shaman would need a more attentive cleric.  Its not all Kunark, its just the outdoor based shaman.</div></div><hr />

    &lt;td width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;Two buddies were out drinking late one night and finally had to bag it after shutting down the bar.  They meandered down the center of the street trading jokes and mutual putdowns until they finally came to a bridge.  One of them stumbled to the edge of the bridge and leaned over to take a piss.  His buddy joined him, since they'd drank alot and the idea wasn't all that bad.&lt;br&gt;<br />
      &lt;br&gt;<br />
      After a while one of them mumbles, &quot;Damn bro, the water sure is cold tonight.&quot; and manages a grin.&lt;br&gt;<br />
      &lt;br&gt;<br />
      To which his buddy, chuckling, says, &quot;You ain't kidding man, and deep, too!&quot;&lt;/td&gt;<br />

I spend way too long away from town and always get overweight by the end of my adventuring.  I drop 200 AC and you know what?  In the end it doesn't matter all that much.  Sures it's 1200 down to a 1000 or close but still.  I have found HP way more important in the end game as well as the &quot;injured&quot; effect.  Meaning I have died with 4K hp on me just because the mob thought I was the easiest kill.  So sure get your AC up, it's easy enough to do but don't slag the poor guy who hasn't seen the light yet.  He's gonna live just about as long as you in Fear, xToV and most planes sure enough he got the resists.  Because if you got aggro 200 AC more isn't going to matter dick to a mob who hits inthe 200's and quads in his sleep.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I find that with a higher AC I can better Channel.  This makes a huge difference when I need to root something I've accidentally aggroed off the tank, or being able to root or slow an add, and so on.<br />
<br />
Granted, HPs are VERY important, but I slow things...  And always have a regen up, and can heal myself, and so forth.<br />
<br />
It is my thought that the only healer class who should not be so interested in the applications of a high AC value is the druid class, as being able to both snare and root gives them a greater ability to avoid having to check for hits/damage against their AC anyway.<br />
<br />
But I am still a young shaman, and most probably ignorant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Have to add my little story. I play on a relatively new server so gear isn't easy to get but it is there if you look. A friend was doin the sharood thing so we started talking about his def skill. He said it was 70 or whatever really low so I asked why he didnt just max it, takes a couple lvls soloing(we were late 40s) and isn't too tough. He said he always groups so doesn't need the ac. Anyway I told him about my experiences as a shammy on old server and the benefits of ac/hp although he said he wasn't gonna max his def anyway :( I grouped with him a few lvls later and noticed that his gear had changed quite a bit towards the ac/hp road and he said his def was 170ish. He also said he was having more fun and was more effective. Don't give up on these people, they can be reasoned with.</div></div><hr />

With ac and agi buffs my ac is just over 800 at level 47. I have solo'd giants in RM for about 4 levels and had two increases in defense. I pull with slow, stack two poison dots and tank for pet. I tend to refesh one dot. <br />

Should I increase my ac and try higher level mobs or what? Currently my defense is at 183.</div></div><hr />
