<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a lowbie troll inney worshipper. I am loved in my home town and dubious in Neriak and indifferent to dubious in Oggok. I want to have decent faction at all the evil sights and several key points like HP and FP. <br />
<br />
What factions are important to me and what are some good options for raising them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Easiest faction for you to increase in Neriak is the Cleric guild, giving you an 'ally' merchant. Just do the note quest (talk to the Dark Elf in the Grobb Shaman guild) multiple times, or collect a bunch of Halfling Necklaces and Raider Caps. In the Dark Elf Cleric guild, the merchant in the back left, standing behind the bar, is on the guild faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The most fun way to raise faction in North Freeport (where the bank is) is to BARSH the guards in the other freeport zones!<br />
<br />
Trouble is you can't really do this at your level, but it's worth remembering :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do not kill Ogres in Timorous Deep, you will mess up your Venril Sather (VS- The Overthere) faction before it's even worthwhile to do so if it is ever worthwhile. There are a few Ogres there not on VS faction but until you know which ones smile at them all.</div></div><hr />
