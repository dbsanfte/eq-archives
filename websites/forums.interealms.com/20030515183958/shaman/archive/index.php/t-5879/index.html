<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't tell you much about solo'ing there as a shaman, but there are two roaming mobs as you enter. They can be skele's (90% of the time - usually an sk with harm touch) or sperms. There are 2 static golems at each of the wing doors (8 total golems). You'll need to keep killing the roamers until a sperm spawns to get a key to the north door. You can also drop to the 'basement' where you'll find 4+ wandering mobs and 2 areas to pull from. In the basement on a raised dais, you'll find a teleport to the entrance area which will clear agro from the basement (I believe it clears agro at least, in thinking about it, I'm not sure I've ever tested it). Entrance mobs 'flee' to the east where a false floor will also drop you to the basement. A lvl 60 can single pull any of the golems so no need to worry about adds while you wait for a key to drop.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a little. Hopefully a shaman with knowledge can tell you about good spots to hunt, etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ubiqu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have done a fair bit of hunting in HS while trying to get out of 59.  I have not done much of the wings, but I do have info on the basement/entrance.<br />
<br />
Entrance:<br />
<br />
When you zone in you will be greated by 2 random mobs.<br />
<br />
Mobs<br />
Sepulcher Skeleton(SK)<br />
Undertaker Skeleton(SK)<br />
Bile Golem<br />
Bottomless Gnawer/Feaster<br />
Greater Plaguebone<br />
<br />
I have seen each of those seperate mobs spawn as a wanderer with the Undertaker Skel being the worst...he HTs for 730ish and can follow it with a round of melee for 300+ dmg...not fun.  The Sepulcher Skels HT for around 550, so they arent &quot;too&quot; bad I guess.  The respawn is 20 minutes, so keep a timer or be consious of what you are doing...having a SK spawn on you when you are in the middle of another fight can get messy.<br />
<br />
When doing the entrance, I kill the wanderers, then depending on whether I am using a pet or not, I can get through about 4-6 of the Pyre Golems before repop.  Be carefull when pulling from the East Wing(I think), most of the time I pull that wing I can get a single golem, but there is an add from behind the door.  I am only level 59 though, so it may be single at 60.<br />
<br />
I drop down to do the basement occasionally for a change of pace.  The same mobs spawn down there as upstairs, except you end up getting less Pyre Golems and more of everything else.  Just remember to keep an eye on the clock, there are a couple wanderers that make their rounds around the platform area that can be annoying.  Once the first drop down area is clear you can pull from 2 seperate hallways.  They have 2 spawns of skel/pyre right away, so I usually don't have time to do anything but those before I start getting repops.<br />
<br />
I intend to try and camp a wing at some point in the future, but that would require me feeling adventourous, and it is already hard to get a res when I die in the basement/entrance...much less retrieving a corpse from deep in HS...that would be a pain.</div></div><hr />
