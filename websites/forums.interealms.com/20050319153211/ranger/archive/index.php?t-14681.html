That is about the best bow in game imo..  I know you can take 18 max people in and you fight some guys on horses and must kill them all before they reach the &quot;center&quot; so the untargetable Mujaki will spawn or something along those lines.. Anyone got any more info?</div></div><hr />

-The quest is started by an erudite npc by the name of Eremor(or something like that begins with E).  He's located on the other back corner of PoN behind the large crypt'ish area filled with wraiths and gargoyles.<br />
<br />
-Theres a maximum of 24 people who can attend this event.<br />
<br />
-Mujaki is untargetable during the first part of the event.<br />
<br />
-There are 3 gravestones that spawns a pair of &quot;Servants of Mujaki&quot; every 30 seconds or so from what I remember.<br />
<br />
-The Servants of Mujaki hit for around 600-700'ish from what I remember.   They have an average amount of hp for their level.<br />
<br />
-You need to stop the servants from reaching the center platform, otherwise the result is they become untargetable and become mounted and will later be able to attack you when the waves are finished.<br />
<br />
-There are about 3-4 waves, i dont remember the exact number.<br />
<br />
-They major key to this whole event is organization.   Each group needs to be independant and be able to handle killing 1 servant and tanking/mezzing the other.   I dont remember if they were mezzable.   Since there are 3 gravestones that spawn a pair of servants, and you have 4 groups, use the extra group to help out any group that is in trouble.    My group was actually the first to wipe out on the event since our gravestone had some evil horses that attacked us when moved there.   While we were fighting them, the servants spawned on us and it got pretty messy.   The rescue group came and ressed us while we picked up and it just went pretty smooth after we got back on our feet.<br />
<br />
-Mujaki the Devourer himself isn't too hard.   He's your typical boss, hits up to 900 i think, has AE fear.  I never fought Mujaki with his servants since we managed to kill every single servant before they reached the platform.<br />
<br />
Thats about it =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
but it was much fun and good loot considering how fast its over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casanova</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you all kill all the servants &lt;shiver&gt; he doesnt AE fear.. its a single target fear.. he's got some kinda lifetap... bout a 5 min long fight... we usually get 3 of them in a row... you can hop the graveyards... easy mob great loot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eliak Quickblade</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some corrections to an above post.  I have done this event tons.  Skellie waves spawn in the following order 1-1-1-2-2-2-2-1 (i.e. number of mobs that spawn is 1 or 2).  There are about 8 waves total.  The skells cannot be snared but once slowed are weak, they hit for 470ish.  Mobs didnt seem to be mezzable either. Each wave also spawns about 2 minutes apart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arbok of Xegony</div><div class="date">11-30-2002, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the corrections =)    I've done this event around the first week of PoP and have only done it once.  So my memory is a little hazey but that information alone should give everyone a good idea of what to expect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit ran over and try'd to talk to Etumer today, unfortunally agro'd a few things running to him so only got a hail off =p, anyways he made reference to me being a sending from my brother, is there any one that i need to talk to before him to start this script? Just curious i will try to run out again tonight and try to figure out how to start it.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea what the respawn timer on the quest is, but it definately doesn't respawn right away.  Other wise it would be farm fest.<br />
<br />
I dont believe that you need to speak to anyone prior to starting the quest.   It's a stand alone thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharidann</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tried it last night and was bugged. :(<br />
<br />
Had 4 groups.<br />
<br />
3 ported in GY 1. 1 ported in GY 2 and Mujaki was in GY 3.<br />
<br />
We all moved to GY 3, but somehow didnt trigger the event. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eliak Quickblade</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a 4 group event and it can be bugged.  FYI there are actually 3 Mujaki encounter areas and there can be up to 3 Mujakis up simulatanously.  I think what happens is someone (or a group) goes and hails Etumer in the GY and ends up getting ported to the Mujaki event area.  They trigger the event and die/port out or whatever.  The next 4 group raid comes along to try the event and ports in.  The first 3 groups get ported to the first area (3 groups + 1 earlier =4) and the 4th group, which the game thinks is the 5th, gets ported to the next encounter area.  The problem is that this never gets reset, so once screwed up it lasts till the zone/server is reset.<br />
<br />
If this happens (one group ported to wrong area) you can lev and run over the wall to the next area and join the main force.  Only thing is that this will also begin the encounter in the 2nd area as well and that mujaki will go to waste.  <br />
<br />
Another bug that happens here is that there may be 2 mujaki's up (3 encounter areas) and you get ported to the one area with no mujaki up.  They need to fix these bugs.<br />
<br />
As far as the encounter goes, there are 3 gravestones that the mobs pop out of (so on double spawn waves there can be 6 up at once).  I employ a high DPS group at each tombstone (slower and off-tank mandatory).  Once slowed, the mobs are easy to tank, any decently geared ranger can do it.   I use the 4th group as the &quot;roving group of death&quot; to assist groups that fall behind or get low on mana.  Once you get it down, it is an easy (and fun) encounter with some decent gear.</div></div><hr />
