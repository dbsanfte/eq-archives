I am just now starting to be more serious about AA and I havent a clue what to get first and what to get when before others etc.  Please help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">runs speed 3, regen 3, is nice, then Mentl clarity 3 (needed for canni5) then canni 5.  thats basically how most shaman go, its a solid path for the basics, after than work on what you want, some aa are more useful than others, some depend on play style.  ext duration buffs is nice, and so is quickened buffs.  pets are very nice. and so is VP for CC/soloing.  <br />
<br />
thers really no set in stone way to go about it, just read the descriptions and figure out whats best</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>skitz1466</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Scowls! That will keep me busy for a bit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After Can5, I'd say Spell Casting Mastery 3 would be the next best AA.<br />
<br />
If you're in a raiding guild or plan on joining, I'd get MGB right after that - otherwise get SCRM and Quick Buff 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">run3<br />
regen3/metab3/both*    metab is a must for Vah Shir.<br />
MC3<br />
Cann5<br />
Mnemonic Retention      (spell slot AA)<br />
MGB*                         only if you raid.<br />
SCR3<br />
SCRM<br />
QB3<br />
HA3<br />
<br />
getting ND3 somewhere in there won't hurt a thing...<br />
those are just the basics that will help you in pretty much all aspects of general play, don't worry too much about the critical AAs until you can max them with a steady AA pace, they really only make an occasional spectacular flash, but nothing to rely on.<br />
<br />
if you solo a bit more than group, VP3 is a solid choice, and is more reliable than your spell root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">An actual updated Tree can be found at Samanna's Loverly site ^_^ http://samanna.net/general/aas.shtml</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've bolded my own personal picks; at 350 AAs, I'm still 39 short of maxxing all the bold ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">run/regen3<br />
MC3<br />
Canni (those three for sure)<br />
<br />
After that though. I say booo to buff duration aas, after all yuo can just refresh, however, you can never replace the combat aas, and while Combat agility is SLIGHTLY better, due to less spell interrupts, Combat Stability is an awesome ability to have, ND never hurts too.<br />
<br />
so after that, i'd go:<br />
CA3<br />
MR.<br />
SCM3<br />
VP1<br />
CS3<br />
ND3<br />
<br />
-i didn't get my ext buff aas until at least 180. but hell, if you're in a raiding guild you might like 'em sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">QB2 is about all that you need right away.  9 AAs for QB3 is a lot to save up for something that you won't see any added benefit from unless you are soloing and do not have any of the cleric Blessing of Devotion/Reverence buffs on.  <br />
<br />
As for the rest, it's really up to you.  Look them over carefully and plan a direct route from where you want to go.  If you raid or plan on it, then you might want to work on a different path than if you were just soloing.<br />
<br />
A good general idea though is to maybe get one rank in a few different things.  Say, if you are soloing, then working on getting maybe a rank of crit dots, as well as some of your defensive AAs would benefit you a lot .  If you are raiding, then working on SCR and MGB would help more so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">buff duration AA's are moot in raiding, you'll be refreshing them before they run out anyway. no, buff duration AAs come in handy while soloing and grouping. it will save you alot of headache and a large bit of mana over long EXP sessions.<br />
<br />
they also increase the amount of healing potential with our HoTs. QB3 for the same reason, getting your HoT off quickly and having it last as long as possible is very important if you want to be able to MH tougher content, again, this saves you alot of mana in the course of longer fights.<br />
<br />
I agree that defensive AAs are important for when you regularly group/raid with tanks that cannot keep aggro from you. but if I draw aggro in a group, its for one of two reasons, 1. I wanted it. 2. I wasn't paying attention. otherwise, defensives are good for soloing to keep things from getting out of hand.<br />
<br />
I also note that you must solo alot Grum, due to your first AA after cann5 is CA3, which is good bit of AA to invest right off. but one direction is never any less valid than another.<br />
<br />
choices at this point really depend on your playstyle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I tend to slow rather quickly :(<br />
<br />
Back when i did end up getting CA3, which was first, i was used to grouping with aggroless warriors, generally ones who didn't know how taunt worked as well. <br />
<br />
As a late bloomer i was getting my first aas at 65 in BoT, but the defensive line is definitely my most useful aa set past canni, and i'll stick by that, too :) <br />
<br />
Means that i can draw aggro off clerics and keep the mob busy until an offtank becomes free, or slow the second and third mobs on inc as a preventative measure against heal aggro, or in a grouping situation, where an unwanted add comes in, aggro, and tank long enough to root and gtfo.<br />
<br />
Definitely defensives for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>notch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ok.. I edidted my post because I am lame and couldnt remember my own path.<br />
I humbley request your forgiveness.<br />
Sorry.. but it was like over a year ago.. <br />
I Am lame.. not much else to say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grumblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No you didn't ^_~. Shammies go for MC3 solely because it's a requirement for canniV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, MC3 is required for any shaman to get canni5, which is the one and only reason that it's suggested that you take that route to get Canni5.<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you follow what 99% of the shaman out there should or do follow, then you should get Canni5 at your 23th AA:<br />
<br />
some people obviously disagree, but I personally hate buffing people all the time, and I will gladly take the extra minutes I gain from the SCR.  FA, Champion and Panther/Leopard are three buffs that you gain a lot from having that extra time gained from SCR(M).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would certainly choose ND3 over MC3 as a progression to Cann5 if it were possible, no doubt about that. however, MC3 is the prerequisite to having cann5 (and cann5 is prereq. for spiritual channelling)<br />
<br />
Cann5 should be your first real AA goal, its just one of those abilities that change how you play. (though, do be careful if you're naked! nothing like nuking yourself for 2k when you're at 1k HPs)<br />
<br />
after cann5 however, it simply is up to how you play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Get canni V and mnemonic retention, then like everyone else said the rest is up to you.  ND3, the healing AAs, RC1-3, etc are all good choices.<br />
<br />
I want to say again tho, I think getting VP3 was a total waste; I wish I had the AA's back.  Unless you run around with a disease debuff spell memmed, or you still live in LDON, 6/10 vp's get resisted, and even if it lands, it breaks within a few seconds.  Worthless imo....Also imo QB3 is too expensive.  Get QB2 and some beneficial haste from a focus or tribute.  The cap on haste for buffs is 50%, so no buff haste will stack on QB3...<br />
<br />
Then there's the question of spell casting mastery, which to my knowledge no one understands, not even the developers.  I got it just for kicks, but can't really tell any difference.../shrug<br />
<br />
Ancestral aid, spiritual channeling, and call of the wild are all very usefull OOW AA's.  No regrets buying any of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>skitz1466</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thank you all very very much, that should keep me busy for awhile.  You have all been very helpful!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hmm.  Been meaning to do this for a while, but I think I might make a branching AA tree flowchart type thing.<br />
<br />
The order of the AA's you choose really depends on what type of content/roles you expect yourself to be in.<br />
<br />
There are obvious basics:  run/regen, canniV, mgb (only if raiding).<br />
<br />
But then you might ask yourself, ok, self:), should I get lighting reflexes or advanced healing...<br />
<br />
Its not so straight forward.  If you solo mainly, you might want lighting reflexes over healing, as you'll be using a heal over time on yourself for the most part, and advance healing won't help you that much.<br />
<br />
If you expect to do lots of ldon's as the main healer, or are part of a raiding guild, then yeah, healing AA's &gt; defensive AA's.<br />
<br />
Other things: If you are mainly grouping and solo'ing, you probably won't want to bother with max radiant cure (or the next level).  I rarely feel the need to cast that just in groups (you have rgc, poison and disease cures, as well as pure spirit no counter cures already).<br />
<br />
But if you are in a raiding guild, then you'll want max radiant cure, as well as max ancestral aid asap.  <br />
<br />
I also disagree with a poster above who said not to get buff duration AA's.<br />
<br />
You have to remember, that Torpor/Quiessence/Spirtual Serenity are considered buffs.  Maxing buff duration AA's extends the healing power of these hots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">First 23 AA's are all about Cani 5 no doubt.<br />
<br />
The rest I would do a breath first ie buy level 1 on all of the, then level 2 then level 3 to get the max out of your AAs.<br />
<br />
SCS (aggro reduction)<br />
SCM (mana save)<br />
SCR/M (mana save / carpol tunnel save)<br />
mnemonic retention (sp) convenience<br />
ND (Hitpoints are good)<br />
CA/CS (see nd)<br />
<br />
Personally, I think dishing out 5k for a haste of mithaniel item is much better than spending 9AAs on QB3, gd useless AA.<br />
<br />
And getting the cheaper ones first has the obvious benefit, what's better<br />
SCS3 which is 18AA or SCS1,SCM1,SCR1, MR, ND1,CA1,CS1, and 4 spare AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Scowls1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">before you trash the idea of buff extention aa, like alot trash it, consider that it makes torpor/Q line last ALOT longer, as well as pather/leapord.  thats the real reason it is well worth the aa, since only a few selected (Time and beyond) drops have effects that stick on buffs with less than 3 minute durations<br />
<br />
QB3 is also nice, since your heals casting time is cut in half....food for thought.<br />
<br />
I have also always been a firm believer in starting a AA chain, and finishing it before starting any others, VP1 is nice, but if you try to get vp, rc1, and 15 others you'll never get them finished, and VP3 is much more powerful than vp1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Not true; Extended Enhancement * (and Zephyr of Brell) were changed to work on 4-tic base spells, down from 8-tic like they used to be.<br />
<br />
Of course, those effects stack with SCRM, for the win.</div></div><hr />
