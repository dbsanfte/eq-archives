<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Alot of the screenies that Ive been seeing for OOW have been pretty small detail oriented.  Im hoping that there is a way to turn that stuff down or off.  I think it looks nice, but I prefer to have smoother gameplay than flashy textures.  Im running a 128MB GF4 and 1 gig ram and I still have textures and models set to the bare essentials, as I like to be able to spin in a circle and not have my pc lag.<br />
<br />
Still, impressive shots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got myself a Radeon 9700 XT 128mb yesterday. Went from two mods and low quality textures to all mods and medium quality and now have virtually no lag. Can't wait to test it out in OoW tomorrow. :)<br />
<br />
Wish I hadn't forgotten to backup my screenshots when I re-formated my comp last night. I had some real nice shots though looking at the ones above, with low quality textures, they wouldn't do justice. Hulcror just didn't look that amazing on my screen when I saw him.</div></div><hr />

But I don't know how my graphics card is gonna run this... I have just been getting by with my Ol' PoS GeForce 2 32mb, I guess I will have to finally get a job and work for a new one :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yeah, I have a pretty souped up machine right now.  have a radeon pro 9800 with duel channeled 1024 ram and all my graphics turned on.  I wasn't getting any lag in beta near the end (if you didn't know.. the performance of each god zone improved daily.. so at first I had a lot of lag too but by the end of beta i wasn't seeing much if at all)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks a lot like the inside of my stomach after a bad day of booze  :D .<br />
<br />
Those pics look very nice, but is it me or are the second and third one a bit too close to real life fantasy drawings (V. Segrelles i think, but don't quote me on that one)? Just a random observation, i like those nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

Why is it that the guys making mobs seems to have their **** together but as soon as something needs to be done about anything player-related its handed over to cracksmoking monkeys??</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
thats cos making things look nice in new content is alot easier that fixing players complaints, making the gameplay good or redoing old models, though they have said they are thinking about it but i think they`ll probably give up.<br />
that and having that in the global file might slow things down alot:)<br />
<br />
but there willl be a lot of ohhing and awwhing, it does look nice in some zones and the mobs are quite well done, but once that facter has worn off  we will see what happens then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The graphics look really good and I like hte whole fire and ice theme in that one pic. Lets just hope that the functionality of each zone is good enough for people to enjoy and not get knocked through a wall or fall in the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But graphics looking good doesn't always mean the content is great. Additionally, those with sub-par hardware will be lagged to you-know-where and back and have no choice but to look at the ground or a wall.<br />
<br />
... and if the graphics are too laggy to look at, what's the point of making them appealing to the eye if you lag terribly just looking at them?</div></div><hr />

Oh, I can answer that! Thats because the way the mobs look has absolutely no influence on the game (except how big they are and their &quot;hitbox&quot;). The other things actually needs knowledge about the game. Thats why they can port over a model from Star Wars without any problems but they cant give Force Hold or Force Push to shamans hehe.<br />
<br />
And I think the people in charge of spells and other similar stuff in EQ are quite lacking in the know-your-own-game area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you think they did import the graphics from Star wars? cetianly alot of it wouldnt be out of place there. and it wouldnt suprise me:)<br />
<br />
and your dead right about the spell poeple, the spells are mainly copy/paste, dont need much skill to do them. The &quot;new&quot; ones though or rather the only real new type is vindictive spirit, which did nothing what so ever when i tried it, which suggest that there isnt the skill to make new types off spell, least that work, though that could be as intended:)</div></div><hr />

Poor Chubber!<br />
<br />
There are a lot of options now for graphics, so you can turn things down to meet your needs. But, well, I think you'd be missing a lot if you don't at least run over to a friends house and see the graphics at full force.  Some awesome stuff was done for this expansion (and, no, there isn't an artist standing behind me with a very sharp pencil forcing me to say that).<br />
<br />
We are taking advantage of the new cards, but we're also making sure it looks good on older cards.  It's been a lot of work, but I think our art and code teams have done a fantastic job.<br />
<br />
I'll probably be upgrading my own PC for this.  :)<br />
<br />
Nice screenshots, by the way!<br />
