copied from patch message - confusing this troll - translate please.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, I wondered about that one too. That never worked for me anyway. <br />
<br />
Maybe I only tried turning into a bear after I was on my horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It has been mine experience that if u are in bear form and u try to summon a mount u get the message<br />
<br />
You are unable to summon a mount in this form<br />
<br />
maybe there was a bug making it where u couldn't cast if u did this<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">- Spirit Call - These pets were running away from enemies when at low health. Pets should be far more loyal and willing to risk themselves for their Shaman friends, so we’ve fixed it so that Shaman pets will no longer run away.<br />
<br />
Cant say I ever noticed this happen to my pets, either.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Trixxy SoE !   :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kuukymunster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with litgruv. I have lost many a pet cuz they wouldnt back off when low health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They're not talking about normal pets, they are talking about the Spirit Call AA pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eleon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Never lost a spirit call pet to running either, they all enrage and die like a good puppy, but not until they give as good as they get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Patch messages are notoriously wrong.  And yet, Sony expects us to pay SUCH close attention to them as to be able to quote every line of every message, otherwise we might make gear selections that will have their Focus Effects nerfed 9 months down the road.  Affliction focus anyone?</div></div><hr />
