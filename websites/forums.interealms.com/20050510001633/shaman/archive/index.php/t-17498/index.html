right click on your map and turn off &quot;texture&quot; then select a color using the color selector for the background. Pick something easy on the eyes.</div></div><hr />

Usually you want to disable the height filter so you can see everything.<br />
<br />
You can use buttons or your mouse wheel to zoom in and out (while your cursor is over the map).<br />
<br />
You can click and drag on the map to 'scroll' it around if you're looking for something in particular.<br />
<br />
At the bottom right hand corner is a button that'll open up tools for the maps...like if you wanted to add a label for a wayfarer camp in SRo that's hard to find or something.<br />
<br />
Those are the basics that I use...mostly the zoom and scroll stuff.<br />
<br />
Dink around with the other buttons and stuff to find out if there's anything else that might be helpful to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can also edit the map .txt files directly.  Generally the last 3 numbers on a line are the RGB values for the line.  Most of the light colored lines are 155, 155, 155.  Just Find/Replace these with a color of your choice like 0, 0, 0 (black).</div></div><hr />

Thanks!  That helps, but I do like the textures.  I was hoping more for a way to change the colors of the lines, but this will work too.</div></div><hr />

Open the map in a text editor.<br />
<br />
Do find replace for 153, 153, 153<br />
<br />
Change to 0, 0, 0<br />
<br />
Save the map.<br />
<br />
Should have solid black lines for walls etc.</div></div><hr />

Set the fade level to zero.  That way you see the map and still see where you are going through the window.  Kind of like the Diablo map that way.</div></div><hr />

I am at work right now, and some how I missed your reply.  But that sounds exactly like what I wanted!  I'll give it a try tonight.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I can see how some people would like that, and understand why the maps on that site are set with the 153, 153, 153.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the map blocking the upper right part of my screen since I only use the map to get to a certain point, then turn the map off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Also, if you have scrolled the map around and are not centered over where your character is, you can click on the little square in the middle of the 4 directional arrows to center on your character.  The arrows are in the upper righthand corner.</div></div><hr />

Personally, what I do is set the faded opacity of the maps to 0 (right click &gt; backgroud &gt; alpha &gt; faded level), which is almost what it seems like you're supposed to do for those maps from eq-toolbox. They usually have light colors for the lines like grey.<br />
<br />
With the opacity of the window at 0, it doesn't affect the lines or words on the map, so they're totally clear and you can still see what you're doing.<br />
<br />
(I also have my fade delay set to 0 in the options menu so I can really quickly mouse-over the map if I'm having a hard time seeing something for whatever reason)</div></div><hr />
