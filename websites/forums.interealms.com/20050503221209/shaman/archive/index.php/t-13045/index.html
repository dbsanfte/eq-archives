<br />
PoG is still perfectly dooable, tbh a ranger/shaman duo should have zero problems there as long as your smart.</div></div><hr />

PoG's now have zonewide aggro again.<br />

ummm...How so?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of PoG farmers were hunting there to buy Malo.<br />
Protectors have High MR, right ?...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I soloed a black reaver at like lvl 62, pet tanked it, I just kept healing it with torpor at that time. Grp had all just zoned out so gave my opportunty to try. But although its possible to solo them, you got no means of getting to them since you would need a rogue to open the door. Would be 2 cool spots I would farm, crypt and Black reavers if it wasn't the case of a locked door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">POG's are not that bad at all. 61+ should have no problem slowing them. The real problem is that they would be a waste of time and they drop no loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Leoice got it on the head, yes they were actually quite nasty.....  To a late 50's guild who was fresh out of PoHate....  Now they are just pathetic, no you don't need malos, just spam greater immob and get them parked fast, once they are immobile, they are nothing more than a Sylvian protector thats guaranteed not to drop anything.<br />
<br />
If some of the people on these boards would stop crying about them and actually go try PoG out, they mind find this out themselves like a few have (/cheer Shandy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I havent tried solo PoG after patch myself but isnt it doable to just sit at their spawnspot to prevent them from spawning like it was before? I wont have time to try it out anyway but goodluck to all of you who got the time to try the things.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valentinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">CT ZI is a good spot.  The blood that drops there is used in smithing to make some pretty nice chain pieces, and new research items drop there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>WalkNot SoSoftly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With a ranger/shaman combo, they should be easy to do. Snare them, slow them, root them.  I think they summon but thats nothing when they are slowed.  Ranger can tank one while you heal ranger and root park the other.<br />
<br />
The only drag is timing the respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think the problem is that we can't handle the PoGs, its that it makes PoG a lot less feasible for farming for cash. Every 25 minutes you have 2 mobs to deal with at the same time that are a pain and drop no loot. So it slows you down a lot in the farming process which means you won't be making as much as you use to. PoG mobs have a lot of hitpoints so you don't get many regular kills between the PoG spawns.<br />
<br />
I use to solo PoG at times but it was hard to find it when there was actually anything up. I think I managed to farm there a total of 3 times when mobs were up to kill and there wasn't 5+ other farmers in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I wouldnt bother with Sebazy Mamutoi... he is one of those stone wall trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">High elf guards drop about 20 - 30p a kill in weapons...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I recommend pharming Crushbone for lewts!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually while killing in Droga for chardok faction i have repeatedly left after 1 hour with 500pp+... mobs drop FS weps and up to 5pp a time, considering im killing 6-7 a minute in an empty zone, its not too bad.<br />
<br />
P.S. Mineral Salts and Skins sell well in Bazaar for lazy people who want chardok faction<br />
<br />
P.P.S. If you're on karana, please ignore this :P I want it to myself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Old Sebelis is a new popular spot on my server... no one in there now that PoP is available... I've farmed about 4k an hour there (give or take a k)...</div></div><hr />

Felwithe guards were nerfed in a recent patch - I've tried them a few times in the last week, and the respawn times are much longer.<br />
<br />
Too bad, it was fun just to see the newbie High Elves run by and stare at the Troll. *grin*</div></div><hr />

It might be a nice spot to camp if you didn't have c3...<br />
<br />
What can I expect from the high elf guards? I'm a Vah Shir, but I've become unloved because of spending too much time the in the PoG before the nerfage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Gotta say, tho they're workable, they are highly annoying.  At 61 they succumbed to spells nicely.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind them nearly as much if they dropped something.  Research components, couple pp, rusty weapon... anything.</div></div><hr />
