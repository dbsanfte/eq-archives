Kaladim<br />
<br />
&quot;Mail!&quot; The voice echoed through the torch lit caverns of the Dwarven City of Kaladim. &quot;Come get your mail!&quot; a young Wood Elf shouted as he emptied three large sacks of mail onto the street in front of Tumpy’s Tavern, the local drinking establishment and unofficial town hall. <br />
<br />
Several Dwarves had gathered awaiting the faithful mail carrier. As usual, he was right on time. Kilrain began rummaging through hundreds of letters, not really looking for anything in particular, in fact he wasn’t expecting to find anything addressed to him at all. But there it was, a small envelope marked ‘Kilrain Bloodletter – Kaladim’<br />
<br />
The Dwarf tore open the envelope and removed the letter that was inside. He stared curiously at the wax seal that held the letter together before he snapped it between his thick and short fingers. After reading the letter through carefully he slid it back into the envelope and hurried off down the street.<br />
<br />
Kaladim was not a large city in comparison with most. Yet it was widely believed to be the oldest in the known lands. Most scholars agree that the Dwarven city was cut out of the mountains of Butcherblock over seven thousand years ago. However, the Dwarves insist that it is much older. In fact they claim that it was carved out of the mountain rock by their god Brell Serilis, shortly after Veeshan sunk her claws into the land giving birth to the dragons of old. <br />
<br />
The Dwarves are a modest people, and Kaladim reflects that. Long even stone corridors stretch deep into the mountains and open up into large plazas housing a variety of small shops, homes and other buildings that one would expect to find in any city. Stormguard Castle, the home of the Dwarven King was named after Stormhammer, the long line of Dwarven monarchy. It was secluded from the city’s core, nestled deep in the northern most part, at the end of a long tunnel that was thought of as Kaladim’s main thoroughfare. <br />
<br />
Kilrain’s home was a stone’s throw from the castle, but he wasn’t ready to head there just yet. First he thought he’d make a quick stop at The Bridlewood, a small store that he and his two brothers purchased a few years ago. <br />
<br />
The solid oak door swung easily on its hinges as Kilrain entered the shop and made his way past several display cases that held the rare and collectable items that he and his brothers traded in. A small fire cackled gleefully in the stone hearth casting a warm orange glow upon the room. Kilrain dropped himself into an antique leatherback chair and motioned to the Dwarf that sat behind the desk across from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you make of this?&quot; Kilrain said as he handed his brother the small brown envelope.<br />
<br />
Atokal took the envelope and slid out the letter that was neatly folded inside. He immediately recognized the broken wax seal that had previously kept the letter from being read by an all too curious mail carrier.<br />
<br />
June 14th<br />
<br />
Dearest Kilrain,<br />
<br />
I trust that this letter finds you in good health. It has been far too long since we have seen each other my old friend. I wanted to inform you that I will be in Kaladim three nights from now. I wish it was just a social visit, but alas I carry news of a more serious nature. There are some urgent matters that we must discuss. I am sorry but it is not safe for me to write the details or the reasons why I make this trip to see you in this letter. There are some that would rather see me hung then to allow me to bring you this news. I look forward to tasting some of that fine Dwarven ale of yours.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Aranuil<br />
<br />
<br />
A strange look of mild concern crossed Atokal’s face as he placed the letter back in the envelope and passed it back to Kilrain. &quot;Hmm. ‘Tis a mystery to me my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, that it is&quot;, said Kilrain as he shoved the envelope into the pocket of his cloth tunic. &quot;I suppose I will get my answer soon enough. According to the date on the letter, he should be arriving sometime tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kilrain rose from his chair and walked across the room to the door. &quot;I should be off before Grayeyes has my head. I am already late for supper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye. I will finish up here. It was a good day Kilrain. We’ll be in fine shape this month I believe,&quot; Atokal said as he gathered up several full bags of gold and platinum coins. &quot;I’ll be heading to the bank to make the usual deposits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It shouldn’t be long before we have enough to buy you that new farm near the Crossroads,&quot; Kilrain said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye,&quot; Atokal said with a grin. &quot;Not long indeed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Drop by after supper. With any luck Grayeyes will let me go to Tumpy’s tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Kil,&quot; Atokal said as he reached for his cloak that hung on a hook near the stone hearth. &quot;I’ll be by around eight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kilrain smiled, turned and left the shop, the door closing silently behind him. As he passed through the center plaza of Kaladim he glanced over at the immense arena near the warriors guild. ‘Ah the good times that I have had in there,’ Kilrain thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Dwarves are known for several traits. Among them is an unnatural ability to mine, whether it be to build an underground dwelling or to search for rare gems buried deep in the rock. However it was the arts of dueling and drinking that they were most known for. From a very young age dwarves are taught to fight. More for the sport than to actually train for a worthy cause, and when it came to drinking none could match their appetite for beer. Often these two skills were practiced at the same time. It was not uncommon to see several drunken dwarves dueling in the arena to settle an argument after a long night in Tumpy’s Tavern. <br />
<br />
In his youth Kilrain loved to duel with his childhood friends Rallistan, and the two brothers Sparck and Slashir. ‘I wonder how they fair?’ he said to himself.<br />
<br />
As he approached a small row of houses in front of Stormguard Castle he could hear the soft melodic and familiar voice that told him he was home. That voice always warmed his heart. He opened the front door to a waft of sweet smelling honey glazed ham that was roasting in the stone-cut oven. Grayeyes was knelling in front of the oven gently basting the meat as she softly sung an old tune. She had not seen Kilrain come in, and he stood and listened to her sing for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;A shadow falls on a door, a door we could not open, down the halls we never walked. The dreams of our youth fading like the memory of a morning mist in a time that seemed more peaceful, in a land that we called home. A land that is so distant, as distant as those dreams…&quot;<br />
<br />
As Grayeyes stood, Kilrain approached her and wrapped his arms around his loving wife. He kissed her cheek and she turned in his arms to face him. &quot;Hello darling,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;I didn’t hear you come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello my beautiful wife,&quot; the Dwarf responded in a tender tone. <br />
<br />
Grayeyes was stunning. More Elven then Human, Half Elves were often thought to be the most beautiful race in all the lands. She was tall and slender, and true to her name, her eyes were Gray. Not the typical dull gray that one might expect, but a deep gray that was both warm and inviting. She had the most beautiful voice of any bard that Kilrain had ever heard. She was well versed in the songs and music of her ancestors, and could often be found sitting at home singing, and playing one of her many instruments, as well as writing and recording songs of her own. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am making Honey basted ham for supper,&quot; she said proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that. It smells delicious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How was your day?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. We sold a fair amount, thanks to a strange Gnomish caravan that was passing through. Oh and I also received this,&quot; he said as he passed Grayeyes the letter.<br />
<br />
She read it and handed it back to him. &quot;I wonder what this urgent news is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a clue,&quot; Kilrain said as he shoved the letter back into his pocket once again.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t too long until the two were seated at a large wooden harvest table eating what Kilrain thought to be the sweetest ham that he had ever tasted. Fresh vegetables and warm blackened bread accompanied the meal. After supper the dishes were cleared away and the couple retired to the living room. It was not a large room, but it was very comfortable. Various books and song sheets littered the shelves above the fireplace. Two hickory chairs sat on each side of a small table against one wall of the room. A harp, drums and other musical instruments were neatly stacked in the corner of the room. A large intricately carved oak armoire stood against the back wall, sealed with a heavy lock that hung from two thick brass eyelets. From the appearance of the lock, it was quite obvious that they didn’t want anyone rummaging around through its contents. <br />
<br />
A soft leather hide sofa was positioned facing the fire. The two sat on the sofa and Kilrain put his arm around his wife as they warmed themselves in front of the fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I may head down to Tumpy’s with Atokal this evening,&quot; Kilrain said sheepishly.<br />
<br />
Grayeyes turned to face him and much to his surprise said &quot;Ok,&quot; as she lightly kissed his cheek. &quot;I have some things that I am working on anyhow. Just try not to be too late.&quot;<br />
<br />
No sooner had the words left her mouth that loud rap was heard on the front door.<br />
<br />
Kilrain rose from the sofa and opened the door. &quot;Hail Kilrain,&quot; Atokal said as Kilrain stepped aside to allow his brother to enter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Atokal,&quot; Grayeyes said with a smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello m’lady,&quot; Atokal responded as he bowed before the Bard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun at Tumpy’s,&quot; she said. &quot;But just don’t keep my husband out too late,&quot; she said in a tone that was only half joking. &quot;A woman does not like the idea of falling asleep alone while her man is out carousing the local taverns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ll have him home at a decent hour,&quot; Atokal chuckled. <br />
<br />
Kilrain put on his cloak and kissed Grayeyes on the lips. &quot;I will see you shortly my love.&quot; He then turned and placed a hand on his brother’s shoulder and ushered him out the door.<br />
<br />
Tumpy’s was already quite lively. Only two tables remained vacant, the rest were filled with loud half baked Dwarves who were knee deep into their ale. A few Wood Elves were also present as they quietly listened to the drunken Dwarves twist their tales of grandeur. <br />
<br />
Kilrain and Atokal took their seats at a table in the back, far away from the bar. A short and stocky Dwarf walked over to the table and took their order. A few minutes later a large jug of cold ale and two dirty glasses were set down in front of them. <br />
<br />
Kilrain began to pour, &quot;So Hammerstalker should be back in a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye,&quot; Atokal said. &quot;Hopefully this trip will prove to be more… profitable.&quot; <br />
<br />
In running the Bridlewood, it was generally left up to Hammerstalker to find the items and collectibles from various gypsy camps and treasure hunters scattered throughout the Faydarks and Antonica. He would buy the items at bargain prices then return to Kaladim where Kilrain and Atokal would clean them up for resale in the store. Hammerstalker’s last trip was far from impressive, and the shop was running low on high-end merchandise.<br />
<br />
&quot;…it was named after the tribal war of the Trolls! I am telling you!&quot; the slurred and agitated voice bellowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah the first argument of the evening,&quot; Kilrain whispered with a grin.<br />
<br />
The two Dwarves sitting at the table beside them were obviously drunk. &quot;That is a damn lie and you know it Rudger,&quot; the one Dwarf said to his companion angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no lie. The Trolls went stark mad and became cannibals. They slaughtered each other by the thousands… and ate the dead. They say the bones from those battles are piled as high as the peaks of Butchblock mountains,&quot; Rudger said as he made a grand gesture with his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be true, but the Field of Bone is not named for that event!&quot; the other Dwarf Kouven said as he rose from his chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea what you are talking about Kouven,&quot; Rudger said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You must be daft! The bones are from the civil war of the Iksars, not the tribal wars of the Trolls,&quot; he insisted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have either of you ever been to the Field of Bone?&quot; a calm and cool voice asked.<br />
<br />
The two Dwarves stopped to see who the stranger was that was addressing them. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is true that the Field of Bones is named after the immense amount of bone in the area, and in some places the bones are piled as high as a mountain. Although to claim that they are as piled high as the peaks of Butcherblock is a slight exaggeration. But I assure you the bones are not from Troll cannibals or the civil war of the Iksars. It is the bones from a dragon. A dragon named Lord Jaled’Dar.&quot; A slender and well-dressed Wood Elf smugly smiled at the two Dwarves as they searched for something to say to the pointy-eared intruder. <br />
<br />
Seeing their lack of response the Elf continued, &quot;The Iksar civil war happened centuries earlier. And the Trolls didn’t kill each other until well after the Field of Bone was aptly named following the deception of the Ring of Scale and Jarred’Dar by Lord Trakanon.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Elf glared menacingly at the two Dwarves as he pressed the subject further. &quot;You are Dwarves. Surely you should well know these facts, as the Trolls that escaped the cannibalism to Antonica were the very same Trolls that signed a treaty with the Ogres at Broken Skull Rock.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all it took, and in a fit of rage Rudger leapt from the table and ran to attack the Wood Elf. With lightning reflexes the Elf side stepped the Dwarf and pressed a finely crafted dagger into his back. &quot;I could gut you right where you stand dorf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wouldn’t be a very wise idea Elf,&quot; Kilrain said calmly as he downed the remainder of his glass. &quot;Unless of course you are hoping to meet your god this night.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Elf released the startled Dwarf and turned to face Kilrain. &quot;I don’t think Rizz would approve of you treating another Keeper with such… disdain, Kilrain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dahrc?&quot; Atokal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha!&quot; Kilrain laughed. &quot;I didn’t recognize you rogue! You look… different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dahrc smiled brightly at the two Dwarf brothers who quickly offered him a seat at their table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another jug of ale barkeep,&quot; Atokal shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are mad for mentioning Broken Skull Rock in Kaladim my old friend. In fact you are lucky that I don’t kill you myself for such lack of judgement,&quot; Kilrain said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha,&quot; Dahrc laughed. &quot;You know I cannot refrain from teasing my height challenged friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren’t going to sit and drink with this blasphemous treehugger are you Sir Kilrain?&quot; Rudger asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go home Rudger, you are drunk. And take Kouven with you,&quot; Atokal said as he waved his hand in dismissal towards the two drunken Dwarves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah,&quot; Rudger said disapprovingly. He then grabbed hold of Kouven and left Kilrain, Atokal and Dahrc to get reacquainted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tis good to see another Keeper, even if it is a backstabbing blasphemous rogue,&quot; Atokal chuckled as he unconsciously checked the small pouch that hung from his side that carried his gold and platinum coins. <br />
<br />
&quot;What brings you to Kaladim Dahrc?&quot; Kilrain asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why I have come to steal the spoils of Stormguard of course,&quot; Dahrc said with a grin. <br />
<br />
The barkeep had returned and set a fresh jug of ale on the table along with a glass for Dahrc.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, the truth be told I have come for the two of you and for Hammerstalker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hammerstalker is not here I am afraid,&quot; Kilrain said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not here? Oh, what a shame,&quot; Dahrc said. &quot;I was hoping to meet with the three of you.&quot; He paused as he took a drink of his ale. &quot;I have just left the company of Ransure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah Ransure, how is he?&quot; Atokal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is fairing well, although terribly bored with his newfound lifestyle. He doesn’t take well to politics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Politics? What the devil is Ransure doing meddling in politics?&quot; Kilrain asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as it turns out he and Arborealus have taken up positions in the Elven Council in Kelethin,&quot; Dahrc responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arborealus I can picture, but Ransure? Haha, that is something I would pay to see,&quot; Kilrain said. <br />
<br />
&quot;They are hoping to get Aaeamdar to join the council as well. But so far he has not warmed to the idea. There are some strange things going on in the Greater Faydarks these days my friends. Felwithe has chosen to withdraw from the Elven Alliance once again and there is some concern about the Orcs of Crushbone,&quot; Dahrc said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh the damn High Elves are at it again I take it,&quot; said Kilrain as he poured himself another glass of Tumpy’s finest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye,&quot; said Dahrc. &quot;The pompous bastards. It’s hard to believe that they are even Elves. They think of themselves as so much better then the rest of us. But without their commitment to the alliance, Kelethin is vulnerable. I have come under request of Ransure, Arborealus, and the Elven Council to ask for you to intervene on our behalf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have no pull with Felwithe,&quot; Atokal said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No not with Felwithe. We all know how close you are to King Kazon Stormhammer, especially you Kilrain. I have come to ask you to speak with Stormguard to gain the alliance of the Dwarves should the Orcs decide to… do something foolish,&quot; Dahrc said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hrmm,&quot; Kilrain said aloud as he rubbed his beard. &quot;I suppose we could speak with the King on your behalf. I don’t think he would mind renewing the old friendship between Kaladim and Kelethin. We will do so tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps we could speak with him this evening?&quot; Dahrc asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I sense that there is something here that you are not telling us my friend,&quot; Atokal said curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let me just say that it is important to the Elven Council to know as soon as possible that they have the support of the Dwarves if they need it,&quot; Dahrc said as the two brothers stared at him. &quot;If it wasn’t a matter of such grave importance I wouldn’t ask you to do this so hastily. Nor would I ask of you to accompany me back to Kelethin in the middle of the night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Accompany you back to Kelethin? Tonight? Dahrc what the devil is going on here?&quot; Kilrain said as he was growing more impatient with all this secrecy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kilrain, the Elves have reports of some recent border skirmishes with the Orcs. We are vulnerable and require the alliance of the Dwarves immediately. Some in the Council believe that the Orcs could be planning an attack on Kelethin. Ransure has requested the assistance of the Dwarves, and has specifically asked for you two and Hammerstalker to come to Kelethin immediately as representatives of your King, until we can find out what the Orcs plans are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Atokal said. &quot;Very well if we are to gain the ear of the King tonight we had best do it soon. It is already half past nine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three paid their tab at the bar and quickly made their way to Stormguard Castle.<br />
<br />
&quot;We wish attendance with the King,&quot; Kilrain said to the Royal Guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is rather late to disturb the King Sir Kilrain,&quot; the guard responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye Sir Kanuf, but it is of importance or I would not make such a request.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, wait here a moment while I put forth your request,&quot; the Guard said as he made his way into the inner courtroom of the castle.<br />
<br />
Kilrain and his brothers were always very close to the Royal family. In fact after their father was killed mysteriously, Kilrain, the youngest of the three, was taken in and raised by the King. Long has the King thought of Kilrain, Atokal and Hammerstalker as his own sons. Yet he always had a special place in his heart for Kilrain. Most likely because he raised him, and also because Kilrain chose to follow the King’s tutelage to become a Paladin and a Knight of Brell while Hammerstalker and Atokal both chose the path of their father to become Holy Clerics, Templars in service to the Dwarven god Brell Serilis.<br />
<br />
The guard returned a few minutes later, &quot;Follow me,&quot; he said, and the three entered the inner courtroom of Stormguard Castle. Kilrain and Atokal were very accustomed to the place, but for Dahrc this was the first time he had ever seen the interior of the castle, and he was amazed at both its size and splendor. The room was immense, and the stone walls were covered in rare gems of all types that were protruding from the rock that the room was carved out of. Jasper, peridot, sapphire, gold, platinum and several other types of jewels sparkled in the torchlight. Several large paintings of previous Dwarven Kings hung from the ceiling, along with flags of war from centuries of battle. A large circular marble table sat in the middle of the room and a long red carpet led from the entryway to the throne. Sitting upon the throne was King Kazon Stromhammer. He smiled brightly as the three approached. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hail my sons! And well met!&quot; the King said as he stepped down from the throne to greet them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kilrain and Atokal kneeled in humility and reverence. &quot;Hail M’Lord,&quot; Kilrain said. &quot;I am sorry to disturb you this evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nonsense,&quot; the King said as he embraced the two brothers. &quot;You don’t visit me nearly as much as I would like. But I know that this is not a social call, so what is it that I can do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two brothers introduced Dahrc to the Dwarven King and told them of the concern of the Wood Elves. The King listened intently. When they were finished he turned and slowly made his way back to the throne. After several long moments the King responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well. Go to Kelethin and tell them they have the support of Kaladim. We can’t allow the Elves to fall to the cursed Orcs now can we?&quot; the King laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish my Lord,&quot; Kilrain said with a bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you mighty King,&quot; Dahrc said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Atokal,&quot; the King said, &quot;you come back and visit me once this matter is tended to. I know I won’t be able to drag Kilrain away from his beautiful wife to come and chat with an old man, but surely you will come and talk awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye my King, I would be most honored,&quot; Atokal said as he bowed.<br />
<br />
The three left Stormguard and Dahrc went to the front gates of Kaladim to await Atokal and Kilrain. The two Dwarves had to go home to collect their things in preparation for the journey to Kelethin.<br />
<br />
Kilrain entered his home shortly past eleven. Grayeyes was already sleeping soundly. He began packing a burlap sack with food and drink from the kitchen. After the sack was filled, he took a large key that was tied around his neck and opened the oak armoire that stood in the living room. What lay inside was simply astounding. Various pieces of brilliant armor, weapons and bard instuments were neatly packed away. Kilrain began removing some of the items and he slowly strapped them on. First his greaves, then his deepwater boots, his breastplate, his bracers, each piece slowly transformed the Dwarf to reveal who he truly was. By the time he took hold of his trusted hardened velium war lance, the transformation was complete. Where once just a moment ago stood a common merchant, now stood a fierce looking Paladin. A Holy Knight of Brell. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kilrain?&quot; the soft voice came from behind him. The Dwarf turned gracefully, inspite of the heavy armor he was now wearing. Grayeyes was standing in the doorway to the bedroom. &quot;What’s going on?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Kilrain walked to her side and led her to the sofa where the two sat together once again. He told her of the events of the evening, and she insisted that she go with him to Kelethin.<br />
<br />
&quot;No my darling wife, there is no time for that. Plus it is merely a visit of diplomacy. I shall be back in a few days. You stay here and tend to your writings. I will be back before you know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what of Aranuil? He is coming here tomorrow to meet with you,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hrmm, Kilrain said. &quot;I forgot about that. Please give Aranuil my apologies and hopefully he will have the time to wait for my return.&quot; With that, Kilrain kissed his wife deeply, bid her farewell and stepped out of their home to make his way to the front gates of town.<br />
<br />
&quot;What took you so long Kilrain?&quot; Atokal said as Kilrain approached. Atokal had also donned his full battle armor that gleamed a deep rich purple signifying his priest class. He looked truly formidable. His eyes burned brightly, so much so, that you could almost see the powerful magic that pooled deep within him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not have a wife that you must explain things to my brother,&quot; Kilrain said with a grin.<br />
<br />
Dahrc stared at the two, and for a split second Kilrain could have sworn he saw a flash of envy in his eyes as he examined him and Atokal in their battle armor. &quot;Come, let’s be off,&quot; he said, and the three passed through the gates of Kaladim into the open air of Butcherblock Mountains.<br />
<br />
Butcherblock Mountains were immense. Their tall jagged peaks reached high into the night sky, blocking out the light of the moon. Only when the moon was at it’s highest point, at midnight, did it shed light upon the pathways that cut through the valleys. <br />
<br />
The three walked in silence. The odd comment or question was thrown out by the Dwarves to encourage conversation, but Dahrc was always fast to answer, if he even answered at all.<br />
<br />
‘Odd,’ Kilrain thought. After all this time apart you would think Dahrc would be more inclined to chat. ‘Oh well’ Kilrain said to himself. ‘I suppose his mind is focused on the matters at hand.’<br />
<br />
The Dwarves continued to make idle chat, and often inquired about what Dahrc had been up to over the past several years since they had last spoken. Yet each question was met with a growing silence.<br />
<br />
As they reached the Crossroads a Royal Guard exited the guardhouse and stood in the path. <br />
<br />
Finally Dahrc spoke. &quot;Deal with him quickly,&quot; he said. &quot;Time is of the essense.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kilrain looked at the Elf as anger grew within him. &quot;You have dragged us out in the middle of the night to get us to Kelethin before sunrise. We have not complained in the least since this unusual request was made. Now is not the time to be barking orders at us like we were some elven handmaid who has not brought you your morning tea on time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right Kilrain, and I am sorry. I am just very worried about the security of Kelethin,&quot; Dahrc said. &quot;Please forgive me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is alright Dahrc. We are all tired and our patience is running thin. This won’t take but a moment and we’ll be back on our way.&quot; Turning back to face the Guard Kilrain said, &quot;Hail and well met Sir Nyzil.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hail Sir Kilrain. Hail Holy Atokal. What brings you to the Crossroads in the middle of the night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We thought it a good time to come and look for a plot of land for my new farmhouse,&quot; Atokal chuckled jokingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the middle of the night? Are you daft? Or merely drunk? And who is this Elf that slinks back into the darkness as if the light from my torch would burn his fair skin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is our friend Dahrc Redblood. We are accompanying him to Kelethin to deliver an urgent message from Stormguard,&quot; Kilrain responded.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ah. The King’s Official business then. Very well Sir Kilrain, I shall not delay you any further. But be warned, bandits have been spotted on the road this night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will take heed Sir Nyzil. Be well,&quot; Kilrain said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the Glory of Kaladim Sir Kilrain,&quot; the guard saluted.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the Glory of Kaladim, Sir Nyzil.&quot; Kilrain said. <br />
<br />
The three walked on past the Crossroads taking the path to the east that led to the Greater Faydarks. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking around here Kilrain,&quot; Atokal said as he pointed off into the flat meadow to the left of the well-traveled path.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, t’would be a good spot for your farm brother,&quot; Kilrain said with a smile.<br />
<br />
The three once again fell silent as Dahrc continued to walk a little ahead of them setting the pace.<br />
<br />
It was half past three in the morning when Atokal once again broke the silence. &quot;We are making very good time. The mountain pass to the Greater Faydarks is just ahead. Let’s stop and rest a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; the Elf snapped. Turning, he noticed the stunned look upon his friend’s faces and again was quick to offer an apology. &quot;I am sorry for my outburst,&quot; he said coldly. &quot;But if we don’t press on quickly I fear we may be too late. We will rest shortly… I promise you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well Dahrc,&quot; Atokal said.<br />
<br />
Without further conversation the Elf began the uphill trek into the mountain pass that separated the lands of the Dwarves from the lands of the Elves. After a short while, Kilrain let Dahrc walk on ahead once again, as he reached out and grabbed hold of his brother’s arm to whisper into his ear. &quot;I don’t like this Atokal. Something’s not right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye Kilrain. Darhc is acting quite peculiar. Hopefully Ransure and Arborealus can explain all this when we get to Kelethin.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly Dahrc stopped dead in his tracks and turned to face the two brothers. &quot;You will not get to Kelethin fools! Your journey ends here! KILL THEM!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly several shadows rushed out of the darkness towards the startled Dwarves.<br />
<br />
&quot;DARK ELVES!!&quot; Atokal cried.<br />
<br />
More to come…<br />

At that moment Wulfran stumbled out of the woods a loud Bleeting was clear over the din of battle.<br />
