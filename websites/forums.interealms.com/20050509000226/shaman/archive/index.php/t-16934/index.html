<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Take One Ten slot bag and fill it with Mage Toys. Put the bag in the Shared Slot of your bank. Help yourself to the Supplies as you need them they wont Poof when you log. This Works on FV Server where we are alowed only One Chr per account, not sure about other Servers.<br />
<br />
Please Note you cant Put NO RENT Items in the shared Bank slot Unless they are in a Normal (Not No Rent bag)<br />
<br />
Please get a Friendly Enchanter to Mem Wipe you after you ahve read this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Laranu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've tried, mistakenly, to put no rent items into the shared bank slot. It doesn't work. This may be a FV thing only seeing as how you do only have one char.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The key Laranu is to put the No Rent items in a Bag and then put the bag in the slot, It may well be a bug but what do you loose if they fix it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Laranu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, that is what I've done. If it is working it is a bug and I wouldn't be surprised if you lost all that stuff when it was fixed.</div></div><hr />

Yer tried this a while ago logged the wifes mage on summoned some toys and tried to put them in shared bank in a backpack but no can do<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Logged on mage, summoned a jade bracelet &amp; an Elemental Defender, put them in deluxe toolbox in shared bank slot. I was logged out over 5 hours &amp; the're still there :D<br />
<br />
N.B. I'm on ARo, not FV. Wonder how long it's gonna take for them to pick up on this....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And heck here I have been having my friendly mage duel me and then having him pass me 8 bags full of pet supplies then dueling me a second time.  Then I have a handy little pet toy bank at what ever location I want.  Lasts me ussually about 6-7 days depending on my play time.  Deaths while dueling as you will recall causes no exp loss.  And replacing our lost mana is only couple clicks away any how.  I like to do this just before logging for the night as most of my buffs have faded by this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">this thread and all posts relevant should be edited to reflect &quot;working as intended&quot; and all text pertaining to any &quot;roleplaying with the shared bank slots&quot; should be deleted :)<br />
<br />
makes me wonder if this works for anything else....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wouldn't work with no drop items I believe, since placing a NO DROP into a bag will make the bag NO DROP as well.  But the same won't happen with NO RENT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OMG they are gonna try to fix this and they are gonna make bags NO RENT if there's a NO RENT item inside.  You mark my words.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I noticed right after the shared slots went live that you could put a lore item in the shared slots and then loot another. It helped on such camps as the soulstripper and dirulia sea worn ring. I believe that is still the case. It certainly helps to be able to have the ability to store a lore item until you can log your trader on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Worgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is working as intended to offset the miserable lack of availability of BAIV items except for rallican's bracelet!  /cough,  /splutter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the issue with lore items is working as intended or else you would defeat some of the purpose of the shared bank. I'm on the bandwagon that its working as intended for the norent and summoned stuff. However I would like to see this thread nuked off the board just in case ;)</div></div><hr />

Seems that if your in bear form shrunk down to the smallest size you can stick your head in the walls and scout out the next rooms.   Works like a charm in MM...prevents the surprise hidden mobs.</div></div><hr />

Has always been like that. Works in any zone (dungeon). Go to some of the bigger dungeons and check it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Works with pretty much any illusion and being fully shrunk.  Also works with just horse and shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Expect the no rent item thing to be fixed in the patch on the 8th. It doesn't work on test, containers get tagged NO RENT, as Caanus &amp; Weissblau expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I never expected containers to get tagged as NO RENT if you put such an item inside it.  oing something like that is just BEGGING for a /petition queue a couple miles long.  People aren't going to be patient enough to remember that they have a mod rod in the bag along with their epic, ornate armor molds and other such valuables.<br />
<br />
  If placing a NO RENT item in a bag also makes that bag NO RENT, expect to see a couple million posts on the mage boards hollering about it very quickly.   Would be the dumbest thing EQ has ever done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Tagging a bag no rent because items in it are no rent would be insanely stupid. The first time I have to petition cuz some dumb mod rod i didn't want but got given on a raid cause me to lose a 5kpp bag or who knows what in it would be the last time I ever want to see a mod rod in my life. And you just know that verants gonna mess it all up, like they do everything else. You'd hear alot of rangers bitching the next time they log off with a fleeting quiver full of summoned arrows and it wasn't there when they came back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">says NO RENT when I rclick for description of box, don't think it means it will poof. will check it out.<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
edit: Box didn't poof, but has NO RENT in rclick description when it has no rent items in it, same as you get NO DROP there with no drop items.</div></div><hr />

I just use bind sight. I have found it to be incredibly useful in LDoN, as I am usually the puller for my groups. I even pulled on a HARD adventure. It's been a long time since I had that much fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">About the bear form thing, thats not technically a bug it's a design problem.   And fyi you can also look through walls when shrunk in any form, just sit/stand/sit/stand etc and you can see through pretty much any wall. <br />
<br />
Monk friend of mine does this all the time when he pulls.<br />
<br />
edit:  guess I should have looked at the middle part of the thread where like 5 people responded to this :P</div></div><hr />

Yes, I've been doing this ever since I got my horse actually :) Which I got before I got my first bear form. Heck, the other day, guild was in WW, just at ToV entrance, and about to tackle Sontalak, and I hid in one of the alcoves in other to try and hide from his AE *which doesn't work btw since it's an outdoor zone..oh well*. Anyhow, I could see &quot;through&quot; the wall and watch the puller sneaking up on that nasty dragon and watch it waddling up to us and all. So it's not just dungeons, although from my experience, the ability to look through the walls is more common there. (And before you ask....horse inside = not possible. Not true. PoJ :P I could look through the walls and see all the critter cells and see if they'd pop. very handy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Not anymore, they just fixed it in this patch.<br />
They must read these boards. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Aye it was Fun while it lasted. I wonder whats happeneed to the few bits i had in there....</div></div><hr />
