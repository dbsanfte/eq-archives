<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cidvicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have always built my own systems. So I am use to haveing the &quot;best&quot; that is avail at the time of my upgrades.<br />
<br />
Now I am looking for a notebook. I am teaching, holding Power point presentations etc. I start looking at whats avail and now I have created a 3000. dollar machine!!!!!<br />
<br />
This is maddness, so I need your help on a decent laptop. I dont want to spend alot of money, I already have 4 machines at home, I just need a mobile unit now.<br />
<br />
I keep chanting to myself.....Dont need 64mb video for laptop, Dont need 64mb video for laptop, Dont need 64mb video for laptop, Dont need 64mb video for laptop,............:) :) :) :)</div></div><hr />

   Not exactly sure how much fire power you need...but this configured system here would suit you fine for the purposes you listed in your post.<br />
<br />
Goto the Dell site: www.dell.com (duh)<br />
Click on the Home and Home Office link<br />
Then enter the following<br />
E-Value Code: 6V944 - 41NVCD<br />
<br />
Scroll to bottom of page, click Yellow link &quot;Continue&quot;<br />
Scroll to bottom of this page, click Yellow link &quot;Add to Cart&quot;<br />
On the &quot;Your Cart&quot; screen, click the &quot;System Details&quot; link to see all the stuff in this PC.<br />
<br />
This is basicly the one my work buys for its employees (not me, I havent been there long enough) and it suits their purposes just fine.  You can also drop another couple hundred if you already own a copy of Office...not that I am suggesting you to install it on more than one PC, Oh My!<br />
<br />
Also, I am just like you, where I used to build my own system.  I stopped last year and gave into the dark side...the dark side being Dell...and I couldnt be happier.  They ARE the supreme laptop company in my mind, and I think if you ask around, you will find more of the same.<br />
<br />
Peace out<br />

I'm also running a Dell Lattitude laptop, and am verra pleased with it.  950 mz processor, 256mb RAM and a 32mb ATI video chip.<br />
