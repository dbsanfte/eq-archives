<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My admission of guilt:<br />
<br />
Ok, I have been playing a shaman for about 2 months now (currently lvl 50) and I really feel I am missing some things.<br />
<br />
I just read the thread on two-boxing in LDoN and it suddenly dawned on me that I am really not making use of my hotkeys.  Some people target, slow and send in dogdog all with the click of a single button.  I have been doing this entire process manually (except assisting of course.)<br />
<br />
I am really lousy at tartgeting multiple mobs (I always forget the various targeting quick-keys), and I feel I could be alot better all around.<br />
<br />
Now, I rarely have complaints, and I do pay TONS of attention when playing so I frequently recieve compliments (I never let a buff fall fully, my chanters get healed as soon as they get hit, and I usually can root one or two of an overpull before it even gets to camp), but I feel with a little good advice, I could be much much better.<br />
<br />
My questions are these:  What hotkeys set ups do you think are crucial/helpful for a shaman to make life easier.<br />
<br />
What targeting keys/tricks do you use on frequent occasion.<br />
<br />
What other little tricks do you do on regular occasion that you feel separates you from the mediocre?<br />
<br />
I know alot of this can be found on search, and I am looking it up as we speak, but I think there are possibly many people who share my same problem, and I would like to get a post to consolidate some of this info.  Thanks guys.<br />
<br />
Edit: basically, I think I know my class really well, and know what I am supposed to be doing, I was just hoping for some ideas on how to do it with more effeciency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best way to seperate yourself from mediocre shaman?<br />
<br />
NEVER PANIC.<br />
<br />
Staying cool and collected during rough pulls or emergencies is how you will do the impossible and make people sit back in their chairs and say, &quot;Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keeping your head when other people are panicking is my number one tip to being a good shaman.. or good in any class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My questions are these: What hotkeys set ups do you think are crucial/helpful for a shaman to make life easier<br />
<br />
Well heres a couple i use.  <br />
<br />
Canni dance key.  I even use this at 65 still.  Im close to canni V, and i bet i'll use it after that too :)<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 8( my canni spell slot)<br />
/pause 25(adjust this depending on your machine/connection)<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
An MT key.<br />
/target  tank01( name of your tank atm )<br />
<br />
A plain assist key.<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
This is my pet key.<br />
/sit off<br />
/assist tank01( current tank again )<br />
/pause 2<br />
/pet attack<br />
<br />
Then of cource my generic message keys for when a mob is slowed/maloed ect..<br />
<br />
I do pretty much everything manually other than that.  i dont like to have alot of things in hotkeys, because theres not much room for change if something goes wrong.  I also always target mobs manually if im not assisting someone, i never did trust f8 lol :)<br />
<br />
NEVER PANIC<br />
^<br />
this is good advice too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i have 4 spells that never leave my line up, the other 4 change from time to time depending (altho tigirs also never gets dememed on ldon)<br />
<br />
5) turgurs<br />
6) tnargs<br />
7) Q<br />
8) cani4<br />
<br />
my hot box, <br />
1)Q<br />
2)tnargs<br />
3) cani4<br />
4) turgurs<br />
5) /assist <br />
6) sit<br />
7) AA cani<br />
8) Virulent paralysis<br />
9) radiant cure<br />
10) spirit call<br />
<br />
couple things, the spells in my hotbox are the clicked and dragged gems, not /cast #, my assist key is just /assist so i can bounce from player to mob, to assiting the mob to see who its beating on etc.  the sit button is pulled from the main menu, and auto changes to stand.  all of my aa buttons are pulled from the aa menu.  i usually don't have a pet up and running. my main exping is ele/ldon and he can prove to be more of a bother in dungeons than a boon.  i like this set up b/c i can do everythign left handed, alt 1-4 casts the first 1/2of myspells, while 1-4 on my hotbox casts the other 1/2,  leaving my rhandfree to mouse around<br />
<br />
edit: oh yeah, i also never call  when mobs are slowed, etc, just a personal pet peeve of mine, trying to keep spam down, i may say if i get a streaky resist guy or something but thats usually it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree 100% with Haagen.  <br />
<br />
Being calm and keeping your head and trusting that the other people will do their job is the biggest thing to keeping the group alive.<br />
<br />
*edit* I wanna be like everyone else :)<br />
Spell Line up:**= Never take down<br />

2) Sit/Stand Hot Key dragged over<br />
3) /cast 5 /guild Q coming to %t /cast 5 /cast 5  (multiples so if i fiz it's no problem)<br />

8) /pet attack<br />
9) /cast 2 /guild Avatar coming to %t SO DONT FRIGGIN MOVE! /cast 2 /cast 2  (DAMN do i hate it when i get &quot;FA dropping&quot; so i start to cast and they run out of range.... out of range means the spell is burned and you have to wait another minute and listen to them bitch about not having Avatar)<br />
10) VP<br />
<br />
Want a good tip to be a good shaman? Sham SUCK at casting and Fizz all the friggin time.... to protect yourself do like I do.  <br />
/cast # <br />
/group &quot;I'm casting # on %t&quot;<br />
/cast #<br />
/cast #<br />

This way if you dont fiz it will just come out<br />
You begin to cast #<br />

curious as to why you use a hotkey bank on sit... you can remap it to any key on the keyboard yes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Verileah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would hesitate to put pet attack on the same hotkey as slow except maybe in specific situations...I'm usually next to the tank when I'm slowing (sometimes I stand back and yank the bad guy to where he needs to be if he's in a funky position) but when I sic doggie I usually want to be behind the mob or opposite the other pet or wherever doggie will keep the position stable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Verileah,<br />
I dont do it (as you can see from my other post) but I could kind of understand someone doing it.  If the mob is 30' out and you sick the dog, he will dart out and attack, then you slow the mob and the mob will turn from doggy and come after you... there ya go pet is now on the other side of the mob than you :) if you are standing next to the MA positioning is right where you want it.<br />
<br />
This is assuming you are sicking the pet and hitting the hot key before the mob is already in position at the MA of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Puppy assist is NEVER on the same hotkey as slow. Never, never ... bad shaman!! I used to do this. Many seasons ago, I had one incident in LDON where the tank assisted the puller too early and popped his &quot;Assist Me Now&quot; hotkey ... Monkey see, monkey do. Shaman sees assist message, shaman hits assist key ... puppy sics. Well ... being that the tank had targeted the puller while the cleric was pacifying a room ... puppy brought back many of the mob's good friends, most of whom died along with most of my group. Getting the &quot;your pet is the target of something's attention&quot; message is NO fun. From that point on, I cast Turgur's, and while the spell is casting, use the Attack button on puppy's window to send him into the fray since you can't use hotbuttons during spell cast.<br />
<br />
The phrase &quot;Don't Panic&quot; is the most intelligent thing I've seen written on these boards in a long, long time.  You are a shaman, you have multiple roles in a group. You can't fulfill these roles if you're freaking out over your keyboard. Do your job(s) ice-cool ... and when it's all said and done and you're 60m while the rest of your casters are OOM and breathless ... you sit back, pull an ale from your bag for you and a treat for puppy ... and say, &quot;Hell, that was cool. Let's do it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have several hotkeys ... none of which I can remember off the top of my head exactly as they appear in my bank. I know I've got one for healing, one for assist, one for slow, one for slow resist, and one for Canni 5 (Light help me, but it's fun to scare clerics). The others ... well, let me unchain myself from my desk and go load EQ at home. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks guys.  I certainly know how to keep my cool in a fight, and I have been in 2 situations where half my LDoN group started running, and me and a lone Melee class stood tight and took the pull all by our lonesome.  Nothing in my EQ career was  more rewarding than mid-way through one of those two fights, the cleric poping his head in the room and going &quot;damn... the shaman kept the ranger alive in that rediculous overpull?  And how are all these mobs parked neatly out-of-the-way-like?  Ooo, look, they all slowed too.  Ok guys...  come back and /assist the ranger.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think, in general, I am pretty good at knowing what our class can do, and what to do in what situations.  I just don't think I am necissarily the best at executing.  I certainly need some tips on targeting.  I don't have my AE slow yet, so pulling off that add or two to root park is a pain in the !#@$ with my manual targeting.<br />
<br />
I see the downside with /pet attack being on the slow key, so I think I'll just stick with clicking the /pet attack button on his window while slow is mid-cast.<br />
<br />
Any other cool hotkey setups?  I definately am going to add a couple /cast 3 to my healing hotkey, as I certainly hate to spam the group when I get a fizzle or two.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just want to make sure I'm constantly improving.  I feel like I kinda reached a point where I am working really well with my shaman, so I wanted to start learning those advanced tricks that separate the decent shaman from the stellar ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok Well call me a lazy shaman :) or jsut resource full. <br />
<br />
Assist Hot key<br />
/assist {Tank Name}   ** Assists the puller or MT<br />
/pause 1-30 ** Is set on its own line so timing can be tweeked<br />
/pet attack<br />
<br />
Quen Hot key ** my Tnag's heal hot button is pretty much the same as well.<br />
/Cast 1   ** casts my Quenissance spell<br />
/say Casting 300HP Heal over time on %t.<br />
/pause 4, /cast 1<br />
/cast 1<br />
<br />
Now what I do here is for those times the puller is making longer pulls or are in LDoN adventures I set the pause high like in the 16-20 range what ever seems right at the time. (I try to shoot for pet to attack 2-4 sec after MT engages mob)  This allows me to assist fast but have plenty of time to cast my slow.  If for any reason I do not want puppy to attack at this time I tap my pet back off key.  Pet back off key is located in Hotbutton 5.  My slow spell is in the fifth slot so I have my finger over the back off key pretty much the while time when I need to be monitoring pets behavior.<br />
<br />
Hot button bank<br />
1. Quen/Torpor Msg + cast **Have this one here as its RIGHT next to F1.  And I cast this on myself the most when it was still Torpor.<br />
2. Spell Gem 2 **Just pulled spell gem for casting nukes/dots.<br />
3. Spell Gem 3 **Just pulled spell gem for casting nukes/dots/AoE slow.<br />
4. VP root **I have my root spell always in spell gem 4 so either 4 or Alt 4 works to root.<br />
5. Pet back off button. **slow alway memed in gem 5 so two most used keys are stacked.  Just have to apply alt to swap between them.<br />
6. Snare clicky **Malo is in spell gem 6 most days for those annoying resisters.<br />
7. back up assist key or other needed hot key<br />
8. (Canni) Spell Gem 8 ** always here<br />
9. Quick heal Msg + Tnag **Just quick simple heal msg<br />
10. MT Assist **This is the Hotbotton detailed above I've come to really like this one.  Tends to be very configurable for most any fighting area.<br />
<br />
Another thing I was shown/told about is the action menu hot button bank.  What is so really nice about this is that those buttons can be clicked on at any time even if you have a long running macro.  Typically I have my idiot keys here.  (aka mob slowed msg, Mob Maloed, Mob Resisting, Mob Rooted, and Mob snared for those people not use to me or not farmilar with the different spell effects.)  Also I have my dismount hot key so I can dismout with out having type it or interupt casting.  Have pet back off key as well as the one in the pet box is just too dam near the pet go away key as I have discovered several times while trying to get him to back off.  My canni 5 button is here as well as I would end up eatting myself to death alot more if it was any where else.  Using the actions menu allows me to have 12+ more hot buttons avalible at all times.  Though they have to be clicked they are so very helpful for those times you need them.<br />
<br />
Ok as for targeting well I ussually have techneque that I use it works ok some times some times it dont work worth a fart.  Stupid EQ client.  After getting the primary mob slowed (aka MT's target) I hit my F8 Key.  If my target changes (aka Watch health for simular named mobs) I slow it and if not mezzed sit to drag mob off to a corner to be rooted.  I repeat this till all mobs are slowed.  Now if my target does not change after tapping F8 twice I change positions some times move to other side room sometimes I only take a step or two silly pathing can mean alot here in what mob is targeted.  I continue to tap F8 till I get new target and then slow and drag to corner.  If it takes more then 4-6 sec to get a different mob targeted (some times F8 is just plain dorked up) I will start to click select my targets.  I find the best places to click on your target some where near thier heads or middle of thier name tag just above there body graphics (for those headless ones).  Though most times I find I can get most mobs targeted quick just by doing small side steps.  As meele push seperats them quite nice pretty quick.  I have also lately been using AoE Slow (Tigir's Insects) alot on mult-pulls (3-4).  Most times I do not get any mobs on me from it.  On the good ones I will peal off the ones not being beat on and I can root them to the side.  If they tend to hit REALLY hard or really fast I might go ahead and start applying our super slow but most times now days I just space them out and let the group kill em.  Tigir's takes just enough edge off of them to make them manageble and not worth the extra mana to furthur slow them.  This is best done though on mobs that are blue to you and dont resist often.  If your bouncing Turger's alot I wouldnt suggest Tigirs just do your normal slow setup.  I have been getting more and more use out of Tigirs then I ever did prior to LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The best way to seperate yourself from mediocre shaman?<br />
<br />
NEVER PANIC.<br />

<br />

Heh, in real life I am a ER Nurse and we have a saying stolen from an old book, the first thing that you check in an Code Blue is your own pulse. The same applies to playng any game when things get dirty.<br />
<br />
<br />
curious as to why you use a hotkey bank on sit... you can remap it to any key on the keyboard yes?<br />
<br />
Yeah you can do that, but I dont like doing things like that for something like sit; you can interrupt spells that way, or cause un-needed aggro by hitting a key during a bad typing accident :D<br />
<br />
Best advice that I can offer is to use your pet as a way to time your spells; things like FA, Haste etc, its one of the better ways that you can avoid the annoying tells from random group member for a given buff.<br />
Another is, and I know that its annoyingly simple, be friendly.<br />
Its a friendly shaman that gets invited to pickup raids; gets random tells from BoT tower raids asking if you want to come loot a drop, dont have to donate for KEI or rezzes or Virtues, etc. Make friends, this is, regardless of what some people want to play it as, a social game. People are part of your game experience, good or bad. Make it a good thing by at least being friendly; dont dote on people, but dont treat them like dirt bags either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Of note, you can have a /pet attack hotkey however you can also click the attack button in your pet window WHILE YOU ARE CASTING. This is handy while you are debuffing/slowing you can get your dog launched. You can't do this from a hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah if I want to send in my pet while I'm casting, I'm a pretty fast typer and just type in /pet attack.  But you are right you could pull over the hot key too.<br />
<br />
Just hard to teach me new tricks I guess... if it aint broke dont fix it ;)<br />
<br />
I hear of others that have a canna hot key and such with /sit off /canna /sit on.  No way do I want those linked... too many times I need to stand up and stay standing while I canna.<br />
<br />
I also put C5 and RC on my 10th page so I dont accidntly hit them... I use Shift+# and Alt+# all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm not really sure why you think having a bunch of hotkeys makes you a better shaman (and I'm not trying to be facetious here either).  It sounds like you are doing a pretty good job to me (then again, I'm a fan of doing most stuff manually myself):).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mmm, how to be a good shaman?  Don't laugh at the other casters when they run OOM, it's bad form.  :)<br />
<br />
Seriously, most important thing to being a good shaman is paying attention.  Know what's going on.  Know what needs to be done.  Figure out what isn't being done.  Then do it.  Shaman excell at adapting to the needs of the group.  A good shaman is one who doesn't get caught in the trap of thinking &quot;I'm a slower&quot; or &quot;I'm a nuker&quot; or &quot;I'm a healer&quot;.  A good shaman lets the situation determine what role he plays.<br />
<br />
Other tips, arranged in no discernable fashion:<br />
<br />
You can keep your best slow and your second best slow both memmed at the same time.  This is nice when there's the possibility of overpulls (or just large normal pulls) to avoid that annoying recast delay.  <br />
<br />
When you're out of hp, you're out of options.  Get as much as you can, however you can, it's the most important stat.<br />
<br />
Wis is crap.  At all levels of the game.  Most decent shaman gear nowadays has both wis and hp, so you probably wont have to choose much, but if you do, leave the +wis stuff for the classes for whom the size of their mana pool matters.  Keeping your ass from getting dead is a lot more important than having an extra 20 mana.<br />
<br />
Use your pet.<br />
<br />
Don't die.  A dead shaman casts no slow.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid of dying.  Yeah, I said don't die, but it happens.  You can't piss off mobs for a living and not have it go bad sometimes.  :) Maybe Malox the mob first next time so you dont have to spam-slow it.<br />
<br />
If you target a mob, you can switch back and forth between the mob and you by hitting the Tab key.  If you go into Options/Keyboard and select Target from the drop down menu you can assign a key to toggle between your last two targets, whatever they are.<br />
<br />
If you have several mobs clumped together, watch their feet.  It's easier to tell them apart, and with the new targeting ring thing figuring out which mob you have targetted is a breeze, nice when you're trying to make sure everything is slowed.<br />
<br />
Make a hotkey that says <br />
/pause 'however many 10ths of a second it takes for the canni you're using to cycle',/cast 'whatever slot your canni spell is in'<br />
every line for the first 3 or 4, and<br />
/cast 'whatever slot your canni spell is in'<br />
for the last line.  Mine goes<br />
/pause 50,/cast 7<br />
/pause 50,/cast 7<br />
/pause 50,/cast 7<br />
/cast 7<br />
/burp (so I know I'm done)<br />
so you can stand there and chew yourself down while you have a drink, scratch your butt, stare vacantly out the window, whatever.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with making a canni-dance hotkey, but maybe keep a hotkey that just casts canni once, so you don't wind up sitting when you shouldn't.  Macros rock, but they tend to be very situational and can screw you up bad if they go off at the wrong time. I have 5 hotkeys that are always up, /assist, and 4 canni-related ones.  All the other stuff, the /assist-/cast malo-/cast slow-/cast nuke-/pet attack-type things, get swapped in when the situation demands.<br />
<br />
You can make macros that mem certain spellsets.  The macro is /mem 'name of your spellset'.  This can be handy if you tend to find yourself doing lots of different jobs in a short period of time, or are just lazy like me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope some of this is useful,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm, a lot of good advice here... And I'm not going to repeat it, so the only thing I would like to add is this:<br />
<br />
Why would you sit? Ever...<br />
<br />
If you need mana, just canni/stoi/torpor/Q - it's much much faster.<br />
<br />
If you need aggro, there are easier ways to get it than sitting down.<br />
<br />
My motto?<br />
<br />
&quot;Real Shaman never sit!&quot;<br />
<br />
I should put that in my sig :)</div></div><hr />

i didn't remap it after a small accident with remapping my sense heading key and forgetting about it.  i forget what i did by accident, but i remember it was not good.  <br />
also i used to 2box (before my 2nd box broke, sorta, long story) and having remapped keys would mess me up, same reason on my war my taunt key is in the same spot as my cani key, i might absent mindly hit it and such, i even toyed with the idea of leaving it blank, for those cases like i'm sure we all remember typing whAt to a quest mob only to see<br />
hail XXXXX<br />
XXX hits you for ###<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If you need aggro, there are easier ways to get it than sitting down.<br />

...but not quicker ways. ;)<br />
<br />
I have a sit hotkey aswell, but it's mainly a force-of-habit thing from years gone by.<br />
<br />
Using the pet window is a good tip for controlling your dog whilst casting. You can also target other group members during casting by using the health bar on the group window (F2-6 keys don't work, although F7 does still target the player in front of you and F8 does still target the mob in front of you).<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'd echo the sentiment that &quot;Don't Panic!&quot; was a valuable quote for our class aswell as for Douglas Adams' literary career. Way more often than not, an impossible situation just looks that way, and if you take a deep breath and start doing what you do it'll work through in the end.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and picking up on what Flufy said, spellsets are your friend. We have enough spells to make changing more than one or two a complex matter. I tend to name mine in order, for example, I have a set for buffing pre-dungeons, a set for having just zoned in (bringing the pet up and maybe bearform if I fancy the regen/melee annoyance factor :p) and a set for action. Typing &quot;/mem dunga&quot;, &quot;/mem dungb&quot; or &quot;/mem dungc&quot; makes it simple and lets you get on with other stuff like working out who's on FA cycle and/or taking tells for buffs. That sort of thing gets your job done quickly and is one less thing for people to kick around waiting for, thereby making your life easier and their impression of you better.<br />
<br />
And one last thought, the way to be more efficient is to do what you just did and ask your peers. That shouldn't be a guilty admission by any stretch, I wish I had the presence of mind to do it more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">well I know I found myself changing two spell sets almost every time I whent to hunt so I got smart one day and named the two I use most &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i have a good example as how to be a better shaman. Last night I was on an adv. Assasination(I hate them), and as usual in most pickup groups, there is an idiot (Xfacter). He's got no idea what he's doing...  So, we got 20 minutes left and 2 guys die. Soooo, while waiting for them to come back, we continued. I'm completely OOM because im MH, slower, haster, buffer, MT (I'm not joking, I could out dmg all of them with Delightful Orb...), and every 15 seconds from Xfacter, &quot;haste plz&quot; &quot;haste plz&quot;. On top of that, our ranger had no clue how to track something in a dungeon, he kept saying, &quot;It's behind us and to the left, let's go the way that was just a dead end, maybe we missed a door.&quot;  Druid is OOM cause he constantly has to heal, neither of the 2 ppl that died want to run back, the demand a rez when nobody was a cleric. 5 minutes left and Xfacter  get the brilliant idea to run up the wall past the mobs in the way, which suprisingly worked, then he ran straight at the boss, who was surrounded by 5 other mobs. I just gated and disbanded. Moral&quot;s&quot; to the story.<br />

Pickup groups are usually bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have hotkeys for<br />
<br />
generic assist (/assist)<br />
<br />
assist MT (/assist mtname, edit key as appropriate)<br />
<br />
casting Quiescence (torpor/stoicism/whatever)<br />
<br />
casting Tnarg's (blast heal)<br />
<br />
casting Kragg's (mini-CH) - although usually Kragg's is not memmed, when it is memmed I have it in slot 8 and use the hotkey<br />
<br />
casting epic - not used much any more, but sometimes.<br />
<br />
CanniV - I have a CanniV hotkey set up solely to let me know when CanniV is ready to recast.  When it's ready, I switch to my AA bank and cast it using a hotkey that announces what I'm doing and then does it.  Problem is the announcement/doit hotkey doesn't reset when canniV is available.<br />
<br />
the rest of my hotkeys on my main bank are just ANNOUNCEMENTS.  Announcing Malos, announcing Slow, announcing that I have aggro, etc.<br />
<br />
I have a seperate hotkey bank for raids that announces malosinia, cripple, etc.<br />
<br />
I have a seperate AA hotkey bank that consists of announcement keys on the left column that also invoke the AA, and the raw AA buttons in the right column so I can see when they are refreshed.  CanniV, VP, RC, and Spirit Call are in there right now.<br />
<br />
That's about it for me - I no longer use Cannidance (although I do use Canni 4).  I do all detrimentals manually, I canni manually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Beolvaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Banks of hotkeys are nice to play with. I used to do the /gu old casting a spell /cast x routine until I realise that it does not matter what spell you are casting. All that matters is what spells land or get resisted in some cases.<br />
<br />
I can use shortcuts to cast spells so I don't waste the hotbuttons on that.<br />
<br />
Messages are duplicated in both /gr and /rs. It created a bit of spam for me, but I can use the same set of Hot keys in raids as well as Grouping. I think it makes me a little faster.<br />
<br />
1. Slow bounce message<br />
2. Slow message<br />
3. Cast Epic DoT<br />
4. /assist MA<br />
5. Cannidance<br />
6. Dismount<br />
7. Malo message<br />
8. ***, it's resisting everything message<br />
9. /assist<br />
0. pet attack<br />
<br />
A small note on dismount, I own a bargain basement drogmor. I can easily outrun it, out accellerate it, and it really sucks when i have to strafe. When things go pear shaped, the mount does and I use the extra mobility to handle targeting.<br />
<br />
I then use another bank of Hotkeys to trigger clickie Items. I suspect I will have another bank of hotkeys to trigger AAs when I get them.<br />
<br />
Remember:<br />
You can use F1-F6 to target your group members<br />
You can use Alt+1-Alt+8 to cast your spells<br />
<br />
Example of use, on incoming where the MT is in position 4 in the group<br />
<br />
F4<br />
9 (It helps to pause for a moment here and verify the target)<br />
Alt+7 (Happens to be where Malo ended up)<br />
7 (Malo Message, skip if it get's resisted first time)<br />
0 (Pet attack, if you are quick you can get this in before the spell gems recycle)<br />
Alt+2 (Slow)<br />
1/2 Depending on results</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">just wanted to point out one thing about using a /target (insert name here) hotkey. You have to be pretty darn close to the person, or you'll get the &quot;I don't see anyone with this name around here&quot; message. If they are in your group, much easier to use the F keys to target the tank, then make a generic /assist hotkey. If you're on a raid and not in the MT group, then I guess you have to do it that way, but in regular grouping, I would NEVER make a /tar hotkey. Honestly, I find its much easier to click on the person to target them, as the /tar command is rediculously short in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Some other tips others haven't mentioned:<br />
<br />
Use the UI to your full advantage. I use the Vert mod (it's at eqinterface.com under featured sets), it's a well maintained, functional, compact mod. The nicest thing about it is the hotbutton feature has 2 sets of 10 inventory slots you can customise yourself with an included program (ccake). It makes using right click items, or swapping items in and out, easier.<br />
<br />
Use a timer mod. I use Arista's timer mod, it was linked here recently, it's also in the forums at eqinterface. I keep slow, malosinia, grummus, and avatar timed easily enough with it. Avatar timer is useful in groups, the others are useful in raids.<br />
<br />
I think the UI changes SOE made were the best changes since the game was released.<br />
<br />
Use the spellset menu to mem groups of spells. I have spellsets for general grouping, general raiding, buffing, and for specific raid targets. I moved the utility spells and other spells I swapped to the front of the spellbook and swap them in like that, I don't like the mem individual spells menus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I find that a lot of what makes my life easier isn't hotkeys, it's remapping what's already assigned on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
Important keys are under my left hand on the keyboard.  Target nearest mob is G, target nearest person is S.  (anything to avoid F keys)<br />
<br />
90% of the time, I cast spells by hitting ALT-1 thru ALT-8.  The mouse takes too long, and all my hotbuttons are used for other things.  (save for canni, my fingers would fall off)<br />
<br />
Assist the mob to heal someone.  Once this becomes a habit, it's SO much easier to save someone in an emergency.<br />
<br />
Assist your dog to target corpses that fell into the wall, or those ANNOYING FREAKING whirlwinds in miragul's.  As long as kujo hasn't engaged anything else, he'll point you to the last thing he was fighting.<br />
<br />
BE FLEXIBLE.  This is the #2 rule after don't panic.  Sometimes I spend most of my time healing, sometimes I do whatever I can to add to dps.  Hell, last weekend I did a couple of dungeons where I never slowed unless we had 3 or more mobs at once, and then, of course, it was tigir's.  Important point is, I try to remember to always be looking for a way to maximize my usefulness to my group by adjusting what I'm doing to complement our strengths and make up for our weaknesses.  I find that this makes up a lot for the crappiness of my gear compared to that of my raiding guild friends.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Mmm, how to be a good shaman?  Don't laugh at the other casters when they run OOM, it's bad form.  :)<br />
...<br />
Don't die.  A dead shaman casts no slow.<br />
<br />
Don't laugh at em, but do call them slowpokes when the group is waiting on them and you are FM. :)<br />
<br />
Don't die is important.  The method is also important.  <br />
<br />
My A#1 priority on any pull is getting the mob(s) slown.  Once they are slow, I can do anything the group needs in most exp groups - off tank, heal, offtank and heal, buff, dot, etc.  In a multi-pull situation, this may mean sacrificing a tank or a healer while you spam a slow.  Getting that slow on is often the difference between a full wipeout and just losing one group member.  <br />
<br />
If a slow bounces and you become the target, you have a choice - reslow, root/VP, or torpor/quiessence yourself.  I've had limited success with each option.  What do the rest of you do in that situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Don't panic.<br />
<br />
I've found that it's sometimes a good thing to wait a minute for a pull to get sorted out to send in dog dog.  Although with an enchanter on crowd control dog dog will automatically back off.<br />
<br />
Another &quot;trick&quot; I use is to have the MT invite everyone to the group.  That was she's ALWAYS f2.  Part of it is a carryover from when I 2 box and f2 is always &quot;target the tank&quot;, but if it's going crazy, I don't want to have to remember what &quot;f&quot; key the tank is.  She's f2.  One less thing to think about.<br />
<br />
But yeah, keep your head is good.  Q the tank, slow the one on the MA, slow the add that's been pulled off and parked by the ranger, figure out what's not slow and slow it, refresh Q on the tank (only reason to have spell effects on), throw a tnarg if the tank gets below 50.  <br />
<br />
Something I've just started playing with is in LDoNs, if you think you will get adds, just root one (and if it's not a caster, even better).  That way the adds come and one stays rooted (make sure it can be rooted, the granite stones in tak and the brown mummies in MM can't be).  I have a root off hotkey so the ranger knows he's going to be root parking one.  I've found that it just sucks too much mana to have to blast heal the tank because it takes forever to get 2 slowed, especially if, God forbid, you get a resist.<br />
<br />
For hotkeys I have:<br />
1 - Q<br />
2 - turgur<br />
3 - /g &gt;&gt;&gt; %T &lt;&lt;&lt; is SLOW<br />
4 - tnarg<br />
5 - /g ROOT IS OFF (normally click cudgel)<br />
6 - /g CANNI 5 - DO NOT PANIC /alt activate 47<br />
7 - pet attack<br />
8 - /assist<br />
9 - canni 4 (normally sit/stand)<br />
0 - pet back off<br />
<br />
Yes, I know I can use alt keys for spells and make my game more efficient, but I've also found that smooth functioning is better.  You just get back from the bathroom, you discover that the bard wasn't paying attention and the tank is at 40 percent with 2 unmezzables because the bard had some bad luck, you don't want to have to chord a bunch of alt keys (I find I tend to fat finger at least one, especially if I'm coming back to the PC and my hands aren't in position, and I don't like healing mobs by mistake).  f2, 4, 8, 7, 2, 3, 8, 1 (yes, I can pretty much do that in my sleep).  Manually target the second one and slow it too.</div></div><hr />

Messages are usually cool once or twice, but when they are announced on EVERY mob, it gets old quick.  So I pull out my sarcastic/weird/stupid hotkey and hit it every time a nuke lands.  Invariably I get a few WTH?? tells from people in the grp. :)</div></div><hr />

Right now I have 4 different spell sets saved - got my Buff set, my raid set, solo set, and since emperor in ssra is only disease slowed I have my emp spell set.  Having a hot key for dog dog is not such a big deal because you can send dog in while casting malos or slow.  That's one of the rare things we can do at the same time.  My number one way of letting everyone I know how good a shaman I am is announcing everything - %t is slowed, %t is debuffed, %t is healed.  I feel that if you dont let em know what you're doing they forget how many vital rolls you are filling LOL.<br />

Hit escape to clear to your target box.  Slow and root the next name to appear in the target box and back up.  <br />

<br />
1 targeting issues. I always have 2 assist keys set up in my hot keys. 1 is always the tank &amp; the other is either the OT or the puller. If i have a chanter or bard in the group they are my second assist<br />
2.When in an LDoN I always have 2 slows memmed. Turgurs &amp; Torgors. Rarely do I ever have 2 Slows resisted so I cast 1 then cast the other if resisted<br />
3. Unless I have good croud control in the group i aways have some sort of root memmed. Shammys are great at LDoN CC. 2 mobs come into camp, slow the mob that is not on the tank. This draws argo. Now run into a corner of the room &amp; root the mob. Then you can go back &amp; slow the other mob...Works very well.<br />
 LDoN spell lineup<br />
<br />
1 Torpor or Q if you have it<br />
2 Canni<br />
3 Chloroblast (saves lives) or some type of heal<br />
4 dot / nuke (depends on how fast mobs die<br />
5 haste/ regen/ shrew/ or any buff that is needed <br />
6 root<br />
7 Slow Turgur<br />
8 slow torgor (malo goes here with named mobs)<br />
<br />
this is my 2¢ hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">things I've found useful:<br />
<br />
-using the hotkey bank thing to house all my non frequent macros (torpor/q, messages for differnet slows etc).<br />
<br />
-always binding as close to where grouping as possible. In places like bot binding just outside can sometimes make the difference between a wipe and just a single death.<br />
<br />
-if there isn't a mezzer in a group, then its helpful to designate someone as the root parker, and if its you, use a macro when you do it.<br />
<br />
-using a buff timer so noone has to ever ask you for buffs is nice.<br />
<br />
-the only way to sort through mobs on a big pull is assist the MT and ST and then using the target circles select the mobs that arent getting whacked and pull them off with non damage spells. Chaining turgurs and torgors normally does the trick to get aggro, then pray for GI to stick long enough for malosinia (or decay if you using VP).<br />

F8 or something like that will target the nearest NPC to you,  what I did is I remapped this key to be 'T' so that I can quickly target nearby creatures without fumbling around with the F* keys.   I have also remapped the 'nearest PC' key to be 'Y'.  This way I can just run around and target things very quickly and with little effort for fast slowing.   The nearest PC target key is great for when you're raiding and cant take the time to click on a name in the raid window, just run over to whoever is getting beat on (most likely chanter or cleric), quick target and patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Wow guy/girls, Thank you VERY VERY much for all the great advice.  I have already begun employing about half of it into my routine, and it is certainly helping my game quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I just dinged 51 yesterday, so I can finally mem turgurs and tirgirs, but I noticed that the cast time on tirgirs is painful compared to the new slow.  I guess if it's between waiting for refresh, and waiting while slow is actually being cast, I'll go for double the slow.<br />
<br />
Quick question though...  I find I am MHing more and more, and I usually always run CC (I like mad DPS in my LDoN's so it's usually me one or two tanks and alot of dps classes (usually rangers and rogues), that way I finish most my missions in about 30 minutes and can get one or two more in the time a &quot;well ballanced group&quot; would take to finish one.  Every once in a great while, I have no pacifyer either (late nights usually) so I am doing a whole heck of alot of CC, and need to do it quickly.  I am wondering what you guys think of my spell setup, and what should be changed/fixed:<br />
<br />
1. Heal (right now superior healing)<br />
2. root<br />
3. Malosi<br />
4. switchable (Nuke, cure, buff-refresh)<br />
5. haste (ok I know I am being lazy here... just hate re-meming this damn spell cause it fades so often) that, and if I sit to mem haste it will fall fully on one or two melees (use self for timer), and the words 'haste please' get realy close to triggering that suicide button =)<br />
6. slow (now turgurs)<br />
7. stoicism<br />
8. canni II<br />
<br />
What I am thinking is drop Malosi for another slow, as I don't have enough resists to really warrant a malosi (don't often group with other casters either, though I suppose the SK's, Pally's and Rangers still benefit from it.)<br />
<br />
Or should I get off my lazy butt and drop haste for slow and keep malosi?  or drop them both and have another alternating buff slot (would really cut down on my time spent unmemming and meming that could better be used for canni).<br />
<br />
Any other spells I am completely forgetting for LDoN that would be deserving of a spell slot?</div></div><hr />

4+ years in EQ and that idea never even occured to me. Gonna try it out tomorrow, seems like it could be really useful. I normally have 2 chat windows open, one is for main chat, the other is for melee damage and my guilds raid chat channel, then I open a third for the Shaman channel when doing guild raids. After the raids are over I usually close it, I'll try sending messages to a personal channel in that window and see how much it helps.<br />
As for being lazy and keeping haste memed at all times, I don't blame you for doing it. Before I got my ornate BP, I did most of the time too. In places where you can't use a mount, sitting to mem a new spell can be deadly. Especially in LDoN, where there is virtually no down time, and mobs are packed all around you. I never bothered having 2 slows up unless one is Tigirs. My guild is raiding Time now, and has gotten one Times Antithesis (clickable Turgurs!) to drop. When my time comes to get that piece of loot, I'll have 2 slows to cast, until then, its debuff and slow and wait for recast if its resisted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  stand next to the MA when slowing if you tend to pull agro.  That way it doesn't screw up the melees and pets that are trying to get at the mobs back (if you are somewhere else when you get agro the mob runs to you and screws up the melee dps.)<br />
<br />
2.  in LDON, use a lower level slow to save mana.  Mobs die fast anyway, so I use my lvl 39 slow most of the time in ldon.  (I'm 57 now btw)<br />
<br />
3.  when there is more than 1 mob incoming, don't send the pet in until the situation is under control.  Dogdog is great for taking a couple hits while you get a mob parked.  If you send it in after the main mob and you get interrupted when the adds start beating on you when you slow em, the whole group suffers because now you can't do your job of slowing/debuffing the main mob.<br />
<br />
4.  if the MA can't take multiple mobs at once (easily), immediately pulladds away on incoming via slow.  (the root park em)<br />
<br />
5.  last, but by far the most important...COMMUNICATE.  Talk to your group constantly and tell them what you are doing (at least until you get a feel for how you all play) and ask if they have any concerns.  Also, don't be bashful about giving advice to others.  (although understand that they may reject your advice...sometimes for good reason, and sometimes... :rolleyes: )</div></div><hr />

Oooo, Oooo, I just had a thought...  I can't see why it wouldn't work, but I am at work so I can't try it yet.  Would it be possible to use this technique to time your buffs?  Like make yourself a hotkey that looks like this:<br />
<br />
/cast 5 (haste)<br />
/pause X (x being the duration of haste minus 15 seconds)<br />
/1 Brunook, haste needs refreshing, 15 seconds left.<br />
/pause x (x being say 10 seconds)<br />
/1 Brunook, 5 seconds till you hear &quot;haste please&quot;, &quot;me too&quot; &quot;me three WMP&quot;...  avoid that and cast already...<br />
<br />
Obviously you would only use it to cast the first haste, then cast the rest manually...  But seems like it could be a great way to time your spells without wasting the mana casting it on yourself (and could catch you eye a little more than dogdog's buffs do when they fade into the wind).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Just had another random thought...<br />
<br />
I use to solo alot when I was younger, and I remeber an odd tactic I used.  If a mob was running, and was starting to get a little to close to his buddies, I would hit sit, and the mob would turn around and head back towards me.  get hit/stand, back up a step, sit.  Kept doing that until dots finished it off, or till It was at a safe distance.<br />
<br />
My question is this, does this work when multiple targets are on the mobs hatelist (i.e. when your in a group)?  And if so, will it only work for the person on the top of the hatelist?<br />
<br />
If so, and your group has no snarer and root hasn't stuck yet, or snare bounced for that matter, could the MT use this same tactic to keep the mob in camp till others finish it off?  I know this would have saved me from one or two group wipes in ruj.</div></div><hr />

Lots of great advice in this thread. Some I already knew, some of it new twists or tricks for me. That one, however, I would NEVER have thought of on my own. Damn good idea...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If my thinking is right, you could indeed do that but you wouldn't be able to use any other hotkeys while it was paused as the macro would still be running. Thus, not very effeicient use of your hotkeys. Very nice idea though, the theory was a good one. <br />
<br />
I think that's right, I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong. :) Anyone who's tried building pauses into things like CanniDance hotkeys etc will probably have found this already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">well, did it last night.  was able to use hotkeys while pausing for a tell to myself...  that's the upside.<br />
<br />
The downside is, you cannot set a pause longer than 600 (one minute).  If you do, it just reverts the time to one minute and performs the action then.  therefore my attemp to send myself a tell when haste was falling (/pause 6400) failed miserably and I got a tell  a minute after I casted it.<br />
<br />
This might still be a workable idea for Q on the tank if you need to keep it up constantly for a while for some reason.  That's about it.</div></div><hr />
