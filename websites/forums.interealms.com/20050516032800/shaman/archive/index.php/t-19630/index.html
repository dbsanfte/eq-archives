<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Killian22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright I never really post on boards and what not but I've been reading these boards for some time and I am just wondering why all the shamans think they are sooooo underpowered. Now I'm not 65 yet but I've been around the game for quite some time and I havent noticed any real drastic change to the power of a shaman I have just noticed a drastic change to the power of the MoBs. I'm gonna go down the line here on why I think we arent that bad cause theres no use in makin a bitch if you dont have anything to say about it.<br />
<br />
Healing: Yes our healing sucks but then again shamans have never been good healers not from day one. We get decent heals that are more geared towards downtime and spot healing than towards being in a CH rotation. If ya want the big big heals go roll up a cleric and have fun makin sure you arent the one who is behind on the heals when the MT is goin down.<br />
<br />
Buffing: This is one of our best and no one can take it away from us, sure other toons can rival it some can even come close in some stats but across the board no one can take us in buffs. (yes I know thats not the main bitch from shamans its been on the heals and damage output but I will get to that...read on)<br />
<br />
Debuffs: ok this is our bread and butter in my opinion, yeh I know bards can slow, enchanters can slow, hell beasties can slow (guess its that half shaman thing I dont know) crap even necros can slow the undead, but none have the big one, even though we are rivaled true by enchanters but they are deffers as well and bards have to keep the song goin for theirs to work, we got melee debuffs, unresistable resist bebuffs that help alot try em sometime. <br />
<br />
Damage: Ok I dont know were people get that shamans cant do damage just because we cant kill the big MoBs like back in the day when bein able to solo lodi and the lesser dragons like back in the day were what set us apart for damage. I did a run down on necro/shaman damage didnt add any focus effects and heres what I got.<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
curse line added with poison line both fast acting and effiecient gave me a combined damage of 7712, now just say you have Pox and throw in BoU and that brings you to 11,066 damage to a MoB in 2 minutes I dont think thats to bad. (not countin resist but hey they happen to everyone) now throw in epic and that takes you to prolly in teh ballpark range of 13k damage thats not to bad in my book for two minutes.<br />
<br />
Necros:<br />
Poison line plus snare/magic line gave em 5485 now I have never played a necro and I am sure they do more damage than that with DoTs but their main str is their snare/fear get bone boy on em that makes them so efficient.<br />
<br />
Offense: Face it you a caster you melee isnt gonna be great even with a 200 skill cap in weapons. If ya wanna do melee damage I'll give ya a hint roll up a melee.<br />
<br />
Defense: I know me personally I can stand toe to toe with most MoBs for some time if it comes to that so our tankin isnt that bad but it isnt that great nor is it meant to be guess what once again we are casters. If ya wanna take a beatin roll up a tank and have at it trust me I have played one all the way to 60 it gets boring.<br />
<br />
Only thing I can see that shamans need is a good snare (not that crappy inny one that trolls get it just sucks) for damage and maybe a better heal but nothin big cause hell I personally hate healin all the time takes away from other things I can do.<br />
<br />
I know your gonna flame and so your not 65 yet you dont know how bad the MoBs resist yah yah yah but hey bud MoBs resist if they didnt the game wouldnt be challenging. I bet you other casters get resisted as well just the way it goes. MoBs mitigate now just somthin SoE thought would be funy I guess.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is and it states it on castersrealm at the creation guide for shamans.....drum roll.....SHAMANS ARE MASTERS OF NOTHING BUT GOOD AT EVERYTHING!!!!...we are still highly sought for in groups for that reason alone and we will always be highly sought for. Chances are if your havin trouble findin a group its because your not needed, its filled, or they would just rather play with people they know better than you it is a social game you know and they pay their 12.95 a month just like you so they can do what they want. If ya cant find a group go solo its not to bad to go tear up mobs you used to be worried were gonna smear your ass to the wall when you was lvl 35 and runnin through ME hopin your invis didnt drop (just an example there are other zones)<br />
<br />
Another bottom line is all teh bitchin in the world isnt gonna make SoE change anything no matter how good your arguments are because just like someone posted before you are paying them they dont have to listen to you because they know that you are gonna bitch but your still gonna play nuff said next customer. Yes I know most of you think that we havent had an upgrade since kunark and maybe so but alot of toons havent had an upgrade till PoP and they were suckin till then so get over it and stop bitchin cause your preachin to the choir.<br />
<br />
But by all means if you want to be hassled for heals,rezzes,haste,mind candies,and anything under the sun aside from the normal then bitch away and have fun doin that all the time.<br />
<br />
In conclusion Shamans are not a bad class sure we could use a tuning up here and there but overall we are still a very self sufficient class that can slide into the group thing with no problem at all. There I said my piece.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/sigh.  Okay, I know that not everyone is playing the game the same way, but let's see where we should start here.<br />
<br />
Buffing: This is one of our best and no one can take it away from us, sure other toons can rival it some can even come close in some stats but across the board no one can take us in buffs. (yes I know thats not the main bitch from shamans its been on the heals and damage output but I will get to that...read on)<br />
<br />
Um, stat buffs are useless - all high end characters are max physical stats.  Druids have better buffs (more hp + mana regen).  Cleric buffs are insanely superior to ours.  Regen is senselessly outdated, it doesn't even make up for modern AEs.  We have Focus, which 1 person can MGB and then you're done.  In a group, you could even get it before the group starts if you were so inclined.<br />
<br />
Debuffs: ok this is our bread and butter in my opinion, yeh I know bards can slow, enchanters can slow, hell beasties can slow (guess its that half shaman thing I dont know) crap even necros can slow the undead, but none have the big one, even though we are rivaled true by enchanters but they are deffers as well and bards have to keep the song goin for theirs to work, we got melee debuffs, unresistable resist bebuffs that help alot try em sometime.<br />
<br />
The size of our slow, and its superiority over the other classes is almost entirely removed by mitigation.  On normal mobs, we have 5% better slows than enchanters, and 10% better slows than bsts.  But on a mob that mitigates to slightly, our now 18.75% slow is essentially indistinguishable from even a beastlord's 16.25% slow.  The 10% difference is now a meaningless 2.5% difference.  Our &quot;melee debuff&quot;, cripple, is the same as enchanters get.  And while Malos IS good, if that's all we are going to get as a unique power, its a sad sad day.<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
curse line added with poison line both fast acting and effiecient gave me a combined damage of 7712, now just say you have Pox and throw in BoU and that brings you to 11,066 damage to a MoB in 2 minutes I dont think thats to bad. (not countin resist but hey they happen to everyone) now throw in epic and that takes you to prolly in teh ballpark range of 13k damage thats not to bad in my book for two minutes.<br />
<br />
Modern combats do not last 2 minutes, ever.  These numbers are as close to reality as Enron's accounting figures.<br />
<br />
Necros:<br />
Poison line plus snare/magic line gave em 5485 now I have never played a necro and I am sure they do more damage than that with DoTs but their main str is their snare/fear get bone boy on em that makes them so efficient.<br />
<br />
This is a painful mis-calculation of necro power, that ignores most of their powerful spells, and fails to even consider the value of resist modifiers.  Fear kiting, while useful to solo with, as not been what makes necros &quot;so efficient&quot; since Kunark.<br />
<br />
In conclusion Shamans are not a bad class sure we could use a tuning up here and there but overall we are still a very self sufficient class that can slide into the group thing with no problem at all. There I said my piece.<br />
<br />
You did indeed.  And while everyone is entitled to an opinion, not all opinions are right ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a dead horse, just let it go.  I've tried convincing people here that shamans are not underpowered, and it just doesn't work.  Likewise, nothing anyone here can say is going to make me start thinking my class is weak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">some people would think superman was underpowered.. wether something is over or underpowered is more about opinion than fact.. you can throw charts and graphs and impressively written documentations at people but it wont do any good.. because some people just want more power, so will say what they have to to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For the love of God please **** and go away already....<br />
<br />
 The high end shaman think one thing the rest think another and unless your in POTime then you will have no clue what we are talking about.... so stop posting already please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't really think the shaman class is underpowered per se, and so I stay out of most of these discussions.  Its more a case that we're marginalized - that we lack uniqueness - and that many of the things we are good at, aren't things that *matter* most times.<br />
<br />
Our buff is useful.  But it doesn't stand out like Virtue or 9.<br />
Our dots aren't absolutely terrible on paper.  But they take too long to work for modern combats, and they are too high aggro for the ones that they would work for.<br />
Our heals are good for non-mitigating mobs, but fall way behind when our slow fails us.<br />
<br />
We do a lot.  But that doesn't mean we don't need some attention, and some changes.  Just because we're not &quot;weak&quot; (like, say, Kunark-era paladins), doesn't mean we are balanced, and doesn't mean we shouldn't get more than we do.  I don't ever want to become a Kunark-era paladin.  No one should be, whatever their class.<br />
<br />
All that aside, the original poster was just missing the point on a lot of topics.  Even if I agreed with you, Jin, that doesn't mean those dot figures are realistic or accurate, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What I don't get is when 400 people see a situation one way and there are 2 or 3 who think they have some divine take on the same situation that renders this overwhelming number of people's viewpoint in error.<br />
<br />
I think Jin is wrong but he definately has the bona fieds to be wrong.  (may be part of the problem; he is too uber to see the problem)<br />
<br />
But a less than 65 Level telling me that my concerns about my class are unfounded makes me laugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is simple really.<br />
<br />
Go to any class board... All of them have posts that their class is unbalenced hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malkaven Maddness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">not underpowered, forgoten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vannilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I havent noticed any real drastic change to the power of a shaman I have just noticed a drastic change to the power of the MoBs<br />
<br />
This is exactly the problem. Other classes have gotten upgrades, from small to massive, to keep up with changes in mobs. We've been able to stay competetive because slow is a very powerful tool, even after nerfs to it's effectiveness.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm gonna go down the line here on why I think we arent that bad cause theres no use in makin a bitch if you dont have anything to say about it. <br />
<br />
I'll do the same then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing:<br />
<br />
I'd prefer to save healing till near the end, the shaman's situation is best understood when you see everything else we give up as well, in addition to healing power.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffing: This is one of our best and no one can take it away from us, sure other toons can rival it some can even come close in some stats but across the board no one can take us in buffs.<br />
<br />
We can max out the pretty green numbers better than any other class in the game, I agree. Even though only two of those buffs actually do something at raid level (due to everyone easily maxing stats with equipment, and low returns for high stats), we can waste precious buff slots like no other. Due to the +Atk in FA, and the +HPs in Focus, they are the only two buffs we have that amount to anything. You are not your agi, you are not your str/dex buff. Unfortunately, now that you've got all those crap shaman buffs, and your agi and dex are no longer 17 points from maxing, the real buffs (hps, resists, mana regen and atk) don't have room to stick. Regardless of the amount of stats that we can buff, none of them amount to a hill of beans if your guild can kill things in Ssra.<br />
<br />
<br />
Debuffs: ok this is our bread and butter in my opinion, yeh I know bards can slow, enchanters can slow, hell beasties can slow (guess its that half shaman thing I dont know) crap even necros can slow the undead, but none have the big one, even though we are rivaled true by enchanters but they are deffers as well and bards have to keep the song goin for theirs to work, we got melee debuffs, unresistable resist bebuffs that help alot try em sometime.<br />
<br />
It's not so much the fact that they HAVE these slows, it's how close they come to ours, and how more and more people are coming to realize that the small % sacraficed from the slow is more than made up by the other abilities these classes have. The most common thing I see in guildchat is &quot;Need slower for water/earth, bst prefered&quot;. You know why? Because beasts add two vital things to a group, one passive and one active, Slow and DPS. Their slow is so close to ours (10% difference), and their DPS is so much greater without having to expend so much of two valuable resources (time and mana) to keep it up.<br />
<br />
Damage: Ok I dont know were people get that shamans cant do damage just because we cant kill the big MoBs like back in the day when bein able to solo lodi and the lesser dragons like back in the day were what set us apart for damage.<br />
<br />
Shamans weren't made to be a main damage dealing class. We're able to keep up a fair DPS, but we can't maintain it due to spell costs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 I did a run down on necro/shaman damage didnt add any focus effects and heres what I got.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
curse line added with poison line both fast acting and effiecient gave me a combined damage of 7712, now just say you have Pox and throw in BoU and that brings you to 11,066 damage to a MoB in 2 minutes I dont think thats to bad.<br />
<br />
Aside from wishful thinking that we could do this to any non-aten blob/ other hellish HP mob without getting agro (I can pull agro off of the best SKs, paladins and warriors with BoWs and incite if I don't pace myself and try to stack too many dots for DPS, and sometimes even when I do), the necro: <br />
<br />
<br />
Poison line plus snare/magic line gave em 5485 now I have never played a necro and I am sure they do more damage than that with DoTs but their main str is their snare/fear get bone boy on em that makes them so efficient.<br />
<br />
can match that DPS with their dots (and their main strength isn't fear or snare, it's their ability to lay all of their dots and then FD to clear the agro), and beat it with their far superior nukes, and have a passive mana regen that beats our active. Combine that with their pets and we're totally left in the dust. This is only to be expected, as you're comparing a damage class with a support class, but it's the truth nonetheless.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line is and it states it on castersrealm at the creation guide for shamans.....drum roll.....SHAMANS ARE MASTERS OF NOTHING BUT GOOD AT EVERYTHING!!!!...we are still highly sought for in groups for that reason alone and we will always be highly sought for.<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, being the masters of nothing is our bane, not boon. In this stage of the game, specialization is EVERYTHING. A group filled with classes who specialize in one department (Healing, buffing/support, tanking, slowing and DPS are the four major things in my mind) is going to perform far better than one filled with a few specialists and a few classes that are marginally good at several things. Formerly, this was not a problem for shamans, but with class amalgamation, other classes can perform our main duty (slowing, which is only needed once, and does not stack in any way, shape or form) AND do another STACKING role better than us. Once slow is out of the way, our main job is done, and we HAVE to do something else. Heals stack up to the amount of damage the mob can do, and the amount of hps the tank has. Buffing is useful up to any hard/softcap set. Slowing is a fire and forget ability. DPS is the most stackable of them all, as you can never have enough DPS. Our biggest strength is slowing, and we suffer in everything else for it, while other classes are right up there with us in the ability, but are designed to do other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The fires are dying down, dont stoke the coals please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Healing: Yes our healing sucks but then again shamans have never been good healers not from day one.

Try to make a worthwhile point, NO ONE thinks we should have CHEAL!!!  Where this worthless argument comes from I dont know.  What do I want?  When I heal with my best heal I want to see more than 20% healed on your average tanks!  I think this has always been a shaman argument.<br />
<br />
Buffing: This is one of our best and no one can take it away from us<br />
Do you play with any other classes?  Or just play in all shaman groups?  We haven't been the &quot;king of buffs&quot; for a long time now...<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
Yeah..we have slow (which is mitigated to some extent in many areas).  We have malos! Thats about it really.  I've never noticed a difference with cripple, and I dont have a spell gem to devote to this spell either.<br />
<br />
Damage<br />
You should get together with thott.  Not only are your numbers unrealistic for 2 minutes of time (you try casting all the spells you added on and tell me how realistic it is), but you don't even account for the aggro assuming you are doing this outside of solo.  You don't include the best necro DoT's either it seems.  Necro's can feign death to avoid the aggro situation.<br />
<br />
Defense: I know me personally I can stand toe to toe with most MoBs for some time  <br />
Thats great!  I dont think this was an argument about shamans that anyone has had (i've never seen anyone complain).  We don't expect to tank for groups, but almost anyone can tank once most mobs have been slowed....<br />
<br />
Only thing I can see that shamans need is a good snare  <br />
This is sarcasm right?  You argue how we are great for the most part, but you want snare?  I hope you don't determine what our next spells are for the next worthless expansion.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is and it states it on castersrealm  <br />
It also states (on caster's realm) that the AA cannibalize gives us 1200 something mana, and it probably says somewhere there that shaman are hybrids.  This is among all the other great (sarcasm) information to be obtained there.<br />
<br />
Another bottom line is all teh bitchin in the world isnt gonna make SoE change anything no matter how good your arguments are  <br />
Maybe you don't remember the single target Str/Dex spells in PoP?  I do. Endless feedback finally got them to remove the spells from our lineup and gave us tiny terror (yeah its sort of pointless) and talisman of alacrity (i love this spell!). <br />
<br />
Yes I know most of you think that we havent had an upgrade since kunark and maybe so but alot of toons havent had an upgrade till PoP<br />
Why should ANYONE have to suffer because someone else had to in the past?  This is one of the weakest arguments i've ever heard.  Just because my great-great-grandparents had to walk into town 20 miles in the snow uphill both ways, doesnt mean I'm going to refrain from driving there in a car so I, too, can suffer!<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
Anyway, shaman aren't really broken, but it's getting to the point where everything we can do is of marginal value compared to other classes.  What would be wrong with a shaman having a respectable DD that casts in a feasible amount of time?  (1k in 6 seconds, doesnt seem too much to ask).  Why cant shaman have a decent heal?  1800 healed for ~550 mana doesn't seem unreasonable to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not to be rude you made a rather long post but its obvious you have not read any of the other posts on the subject.<br />
<br />
I will try to give a brief (well brief for me) summary of what you asked.<br />
<br />
Healing: Simply and complete not true what you posted.<br />
Until level 54 Shaman are the same if not better healers than Druids.<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1290&amp;source=Test<br />
At level 58 we get our not so complete heal (which was recent with PoP):<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2435&amp;source=Test<br />
Druid get thier no so complete cheal also at 58:<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2179&amp;source=Test<br />
PoP brought about a subtantial increase in Druid heal power.<br />
Good for them not going to begrudge them a boost.<br />
Before PoP both classes were fairly even though level 60.<br />
60-65 Druid healing got substanially better and our healing did not.<br />
We got Tnarg and Quiescience<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3233&amp;source=Test<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3398&amp;source=Test<br />
They got<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3232&amp;source=Test<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3443&amp;source=Test<br />
The reason for the change? Slow.<br />
Except slow with PoP got hit with the nerf bat via mitagation.<br />
We slow for less and heal for less now.<br />
Where before we healed the same as Druid though level 60 with the same exact slow we got at level 51.<br />
Ok Druids needed the boost.<br />
Problem is Shaman healing is really really inadequate at level 65 to funtion as a Priest class.<br />
That is just Druid/Shaman.<br />
Now enter Paladins.<br />
Paladins pre-pop heal a bit less than Shaman still having group heals we lacked but we were still more powerful healers.<br />
Post PoP Paladins are equal to us or even better really because of their abilility to group heal which we lack.<br />
You also have the cure aspect of healing here as well.<br />
PoP made Paladins better single target curers than us.<br />
We maintained better mana regen and better group cures over Paladins that is about it.<br />
<br />
Now enter GoD heals:<br />
Shaman<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4899&amp;source=Test<br />
Druid<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4883&amp;source=Test<br />
Paladin<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4893&amp;source=Test<br />
Add to that Paladins get Radiant Cure aa with PoP<br />
<br />
We lose MORE ground in GoD on heals.<br />
Druids and Paladin heals are again substanially stronger.<br />
Paladins gain ground on group cures.<br />
<br />
The end result is Shaman have become sub par healers even to Paladins.<br />
<br />
Buffing again you are not correct<br />
BL out buffs us with more usefull buffs post PoP<br />
Pre-pop we outbuffed our hybrid class.<br />
Combine Ferocity, Spiritual Vigor, Talisman of Kragg, Infusion of Spirt, Celerity and Spiritual Dominion<br />
9 mana per tick<br />
50% Haste<br />
190 Attack<br />
620 hp<br />
85 Sta<br />
50 Str<br />
55 Dex<br />
65 FR<br />
65 CR<br />
65 DR<br />
65 PR<br />
65 MR<br />
<br />
vs<br />
Focus of Soul, Ferine Avatar, Boar, Swift like the Wind, Wrulan, and Diaku<br />
<br />
60% haste<br />
140 Attack<br />
544 hp<br />
260 Str<br />
245 Dex<br />
200 Agi<br />
200 Sta<br />
<br />
Edit: to make the corrections noted below<br />
<br />
So whose buffs are better??????<br />
Not Shaman thats for dang sure.<br />
The only advantage Shaman have is group versions of more spells.<br />
<br />
Now again enter GoD!<br />
Shaman buffs?<br />
None<br />
BL?<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4875&amp;source=Test<br />
Baiscally it doesnt stack with IoS its group IoS.<br />
There goes part of that group version edge huh?<br />
<br />
Debuffs?<br />
Uhm not even going to go into it... BL slow less resisted.<br />
Mitigation, New GoD slow less % than a BL slow!<br />
Please so we can debuff so can other classes.<br />
We get Malos and Malosinia Mages get Mala and Malosinia.<br />
End result even.<br />
We get Cripple so do Chanters.<br />
Ok so we have a VERY minor edge in debuffing.<br />
MD, Tigir, and Grummus.<br />
How many times you cast each on a daily basis?<br />
<br />
Offense?<br />
Melee<br />
Uhm check the parses that a Cleric with a summoned hammer will outdamage a Shaman with a high end weapon and RB on.<br />
Then gee GoD again.<br />

http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3186&amp;source=Test<br />
At least they made it self only.<br />
<br />
Shaman?<br />
Again no improvements they will not even fix RB to not suck.<br />
<br />

Not even going in to the rest... SKs Chanters Rangers BL<br />
pretty much everybody that nukes getting better nukes.<br />
Shaman?<br />
Another worthless disease DoT<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4901&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Please take the time to research before you post.<br />
GoD will be bringing even more large power boosts to other classes when we got left in the dust at PoP....<br />
I wont say anything about those classes not needing or deserving it.<br />
Good for them they get better.<br />
<br />
Problem has been and continues to be we get left behind more and more every expansion.<br />
Will I shut up and deal with it? No way.<br />
SoE dont like the complaining they can fix it or deal with us complaining.<br />
Our proposal was fair and fairly well agreed upon by the Shaman community who often does not agree on such things.<br />
<br />
I will not sit and quietly abide by it.<br />
Thanks but no thanks.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not 65 yet <br />
Thanks when you get here and can actually comment on that level of play feel free to engage conversation at that point.<br />
Until then you have not experienced that part of the game yet to comment on what we need or do not need at that level.<br />
<br />
Me? Personally I am there and I love my Shaman enough to fight for him and the all too real problems we are facing at that level.</div></div><hr />

Please note that at level 1, shaman, druids, and clerics all have the same healing spell.<br />
Also note, that at levels 29-33, shaman are better healers than clerics.  Clerics and shaman both use greater healing at that level, but shaman also have a regeneration buff which clerics don't have access to.<br />
Also note, that at levels 51-57 shaman and druids use the same superior heal spell.<br />
<br />
Buffing: This is one of our best and no one can take it away from us<br />
I'm only able to buff my guildmembers hit points by 544 because that's all Focus of the Seventh gives.  Everyone else has max stamina, strength, dexterity, and doesn't have room for ****ty buffs like agility.  My ferine avatar only gives 140 attack.  The stats are wasted on everyone I cast it on.<br />
<br />
and bards have to keep the song goin for theirs to work, <br />
Bards have a 1 minute duration slow. (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3066&amp;source=Live) Most mobs I hunt die in about 1 minute whether it's a full group in PoV, Sol Ro Tower, or Ele Planes.<br />
<br />
I did a run down on necro/shaman damage didnt add any focus effects and heres what I got.<br />
What you got is that the shaman gets aggro after his 2nd dot, and no longer can cast any more offense spells because he'll take aggro even more, and has to heal himself because he's tanking, or use inefficient DDs as damage instead of efficient dots.<br />
<br />
2 minutes I dont think thats to bad. <br />
Xp mobs in a full group die in about 45 seconds - 1 minute.<br />
Disease dots are worthless except for soloing or kiting in small groups or very long luclin type boss mob fights.<br />
<br />
that makes (necros) so efficient.<br />
What makes necros so efficient is they load up 5 dots on a mob, then feign and get no aggro while their dots go full duration.<br />
That and they are in skele form full time so they don't have to spend time casting a spell like cannibalize all the time to mana regen.<br />
<br />
Only thing I can see that shamans need is a good snare <br />
ROFL.  Good one.<br />
Shaman need tweaking to what we already do.<br />
-Slightly less aggro on our dots so we can USE our dots without pulling immediate and permanent aggro.<br />
-if less aggro on dots isn't the way to go, we need better DDs.  It's sad how far behind we are.<br />
-Slightly better healing to contribute better when mobs can't be slowed<br />
-more useful buffs than just the boring stat buffs that don't do anything to a 305 str dex agl sta tank.<br />
that's about all we really need</div></div><hr />

I rarely make posts on threads about these topics, but for some reason your posts irked the hell out of me.<br />
<br />
How long have you even been playing a Shaman? I'd take a wild guess and say you aren't even qualified to sit in an ivory tower and be judgemental of a large majority of the people I see posting on this/these topics.<br />

Try reading and truly understanding the posts from people such as Murtak and Chutoi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a couple people, including yourself, pointed out - you arent level 65. Shamans are quite powerful up to level 60 which is where we were in Kunark. Everything we've gotten since then has been minor upgrades to what we already had, with a couple exceptions (Bane, Blood of Nadox, for example). Even at level 65 you will still be happy with your shaman - in the old world or normal Lost Dungeons - mostly.<br />
<br />
You dont play in the world where almost every mob mitigates slow or is immune to slow and hits for 500-1000 a pop or more. Maybe once you experience that world, you would understand how pathetic our other utilities are if you nullify our one 'game-breaking' ability. <br />
<br />
To expand on that point, there is no 'slower' archetype. There are pure melee, priests, casters, and hybrids. Each of these fulfills a role of either a tank (a damage taker), a dps (damage dealer), or a healer (a damage mitigater). Because that's the entire basis of the game - hit points. Making your hit points last longer than your enemies.<br />
<br />
What baffles a lot of people it seems, and SoE too, is that shamans are priests. That is, our job is damage mitigation - healing and slow are our tools to do this. Our slow was apparently too powerful (even though they whored it out to our stepchild class), so they have adjusted the world to adapt and overcome. But they also in the meantime adjusted druids and clerics and paladins(!) to heal better and better, while we got 1 single heal spell upgrade since Kunark. Sorry, I dont count Kragg's - I never use it and I know no other shaman who does. Quiescence wasnt an upgrade in healing terms, it heals the same amount as Torpor (a Kunark spell). We are not equipped to fulfill our role in that world I spoke of above.<br />
<br />
You obviously didnt start your shaman back in the beginning, Killian, as I and many others here did - because you seem unknowledgable (not sure that's a word, but it sounded nicer than the alternative) of the actual ranking of shamans as healers in the original game. Clerics were #1. Shamans and druids were #2 - unless you count regeneration, which shamans received before druids. Paladins and rangers didnt really even register. In fact, until Kunark, shamans and druids had exactly the same healing spells - at exactly the same level, again except for regen which shamans got first. <br />
<br />
Now, look at today's Everquest and look where we rank among healers. Clerics are still #1. They can complete heal, heal over time, group heal, reverse damage shields, heal you alphabetically, whatever. Druids have surpassed us in the number of heals they have, the amount they can heal for, and mysteriously have better regens than we do, including an AA regen/heal. Paladins have a 900 group heal that casts just as fast as our 1300 single heal, and they're about to get an upgrade to it that will heal 990 in the same cast time. We dont even have a group heal. They have a heal over time that heals 900 for 300 mana. Torpor/Q heals 1200 for 200 mana...yes, ours is better, but not by a whole lot. Paladins have a single target heal for 850 which casts in 1 second and costs less mana than our 1300 heal. Remember, this is a hybrid we are talking about. Are you getting the picture yet? I know a lot of shamans dont want to be healers, but sorry - that is what we are. And if SoE is going to eliminate our damage mitigation from slow, they need to get us back on track with our healing or we will go the way of the manastone...only useful in old world zones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Alright I never really post on boards and what not but I've been reading these boards for some time and I am just wondering why all the shamans think they are sooooo underpowered. Now I'm not 65 yet but I've been around the game for quite some time and I havent noticed any real drastic change to the power of a shaman I have just noticed a drastic change to the power of the MoBs.<br />
I consider myself underpowered compared to other post-time characters when fighting mitigating MOBs that last at best 30 seconds, which is what most of the complaints are about.<br />
<br />
Healing: Yes our healing sucks but then again shamans have never been good healers not from day one.<br />
From day one we were tied for second place with druids.<br />
<br />
We get decent heals that are more geared towards downtime and spot healing than towards being in a CH rotation. If ya want the big big heals go roll up a cleric and have fun makin sure you arent the one who is behind on the heals when the MT is goin down.<br />
Noone, not a single shaman I have seen complain so far wants a CH, semi CH or CH clone.<br />
<br />
Buffing: This is one of our best and no one can take it away from us, sure other toons can rival it some can even come close in some stats but across the board no one can take us in buffs.<br />
Stat buffs are completely useless for post-time players. If you take them into account or not a beastlord buffs more HPs, more ATK, more stamina, more resists and has mana regen buffs we don't have. We do beat them in haste I guess.<br />
<br />
Damage: Ok I dont know were people get that shamans cant do damage just because we cant kill the big MoBs like back in the day when bein able to solo lodi and the lesser dragons like back in the day were what set us apart for damage. I did a run down on necro/shaman damage didnt add any focus effects and heres what I got.<br />
Shaman can still kill summoning melee only MOBs with tons of HPs better then anyone - thats beside the point though - noone is complaining about our soloing ability.<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
curse line added with poison line both fast acting and effiecient gave me a combined damage of 7712, now just say you have Pox and throw in BoU and that brings you to 11,066 damage to a MoB in 2 minutes I dont think thats to bad. (not countin resist but hey they happen to everyone) now throw in epic and that takes you to prolly in teh ballpark range of 13k damage thats not to bad in my book for two minutes.<br />
So you are getting full damage with a 2.6 minute DoT on a MOB that lasts 2 minutes? I have trouble getting Bane to run fully, nevermind a disease DoT. Surely you have seen that as a major point in all the complaint posts?<br />
As to resists, no, they do not happen to everyone. Check the resist modifiers on other classes' DoTs some time.<br />
<br />
Necros:<br />
Poison line plus snare/magic line gave em 5485 now I have never played a necro and I am sure they do more damage than that with DoTs but their main str is their snare/fear get bone boy on em that makes them so efficient.<br />
So, comparing 5 damage only DoTs to a lifetap, a snare plus Necro's least used DoT gave you these numbers? If you are going to post comparisons please research them first.<br />
That aside, only MOBs below lvl 55 can be feared. And if a MOB can be a feared a Necromancer (or Shadowknight) will prevent more damage then our slow, probably for less mana too.<br />
<br />
Offense: Face it you a caster you melee isnt gonna be great even with a 200 skill cap in weapons. If ya wanna do melee damage I'll give ya a hint roll up a melee.<br />
Shaman originally were the battle priest class. I do not think anyone seriously wants to spend time whacking MOBs anymore, but it would be nice if at least Rabid Bear allowed us to outmelee our dog.<br />
<br />
Defense: I know me personally I can stand toe to toe with most MoBs for some time if it comes to that so our tankin isnt that bad but it isnt that great nor is it meant to be guess what once again we are casters. If ya wanna take a beatin roll up a tank and have at it trust me I have played one all the way to 60 it gets boring.<br />
I cannot remember anyone asking for upgraded tanking ability.<br />
<br />
Only thing I can see that shamans need is a good snare (not that crappy inny one that trolls get it just sucks) for damage and maybe a better heal but nothin big cause hell I personally hate healin all the time takes away from other things I can do.<br />
Shaman should never get snare. The classes are getting too blurred as is.<br />
<br />
I know your gonna flame and so your not 65 yet you dont know how bad the MoBs resist yah yah yah but hey bud MoBs resist if they didnt the game wouldnt be challenging. I bet you other casters get resisted as well just the way it goes. MoBs mitigate now just somthin SoE thought would be funy I guess.<br />
Would you mind actually reading the complaint posts before commenting on them?<br />
<br />
Bottom line is and it states it on castersrealm at the creation guide for shamans.....drum roll.....SHAMANS ARE MASTERS OF NOTHING BUT GOOD AT EVERYTHING!!!!<br />
Oh, that settles it then I guess. Surely castersrealm can do no wrong.<br />
<br />
Another bottom line is all teh bitchin in the world isnt gonna make SoE change anything no matter how good your arguments are because just like someone posted before you are paying them they dont have to listen to you because they know that you are gonna bitch but your still gonna play nuff said next customer.<br />
Historical evidence suggests otherwise.<br />
<br />
Yes I know most of you think that we havent had an upgrade since kunark and maybe so but alot of toons havent had an upgrade till PoP and they were suckin till then so get over it and stop bitchin cause your preachin to the choir.<br />
So, if we are preaching to the choir, do you too think shaman are in need of major upgrades?<br />
<br />
But by all means if you want to be hassled for heals,rezzes,haste,mind candies,and anything under the sun aside from the normal then bitch away and have fun doin that all the time.<br />
That surely is a good reason to not want new spells - nevermind that noone is asking for any of the above except heals.<br />
<br />
It's a dead horse, just let it go.  I've tried convincing people here that shamans are not underpowered, and it just doesn't work.  Likewise, nothing anyone here can say is going to make me start thinking my class is weak.<br />
Unlike some other people I can respect what you say though, even if I do not agree. Not only because you are at a similar level of the game as me, but because you can actually form coherent thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think Shaman are a good solid class, BUT we just cant keep up with the modern game, Most of the upgrades we got in the last two years are because other classes got them (like Pets alwasy being max level).

<br />
It's worth mentioning that there was a change in the healing vision during the caster balancing that occurred late in the Luclin era. The concerns specifically was the dependence on clerics and CH, and the lack of a significant role for druids in raids. The level 58 75% CHs (Kragg and the druid equivalent) were introduced in the Luclin era to increase the healing power accordingly. At the time most toons had much lower hp than what they do now, and the druid version was for practical purposes equivalent clerics CH (allthough not at the very high end high hp characters). The shaman version was not nearly as good though, and was really only a &quot;CH&quot; for casters. The spell was widely regarded as useless by shaman at the time who had torpor and was primarily used as a poor mans torpor. The PoP spells continued this paradigm shift with the fast heals and an upgraded version of the 75% CH. The shaman version of the level 64 75% CH was initially on test, but was dropped shortly after before going live.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure why the shaman versions of all these spells healed for less than druid equivalents, but I doubt slow had much to do with it. Most groups at that time would have a slower of some sort. It more likely had something to do with the mana efficiency of using cannibilize to recover mana. Since canni converts hp to mana, the faster you can replace that hp, the faster you can replace lost mana. At the time of the caster balancing PoP was in late stages of development, and devs would certainly have been aware of the impact of slow mitigation. If there really is a case for the argument that shaman heals have fallen behind, it needs to be made in that context of mana generation, not slows.<br />
<br />
One other thing, comparing BL buffs with shaman buffs isnt really valid since many of the BL ones are overwritten by shaman or paladin buffs. Those that arn't overwritten stack happily with shaman buffs, so there isnt a conflict between the two classes in that regard (where there is, BLs clearly have inferior alternatives). Also, IoS is also a shaman spell, not just a BL one. The only people who use that one are clerics anyway. Both classes can haste, but shaman get better hastes, both in magnitude (if worn haste doesn't bring it to the cap) and duration (tali).<br />
<br />
On the curing front, disinfecting aura is as effective as crusaders touch for poison/diseases counters, and both classes get access to RC/RGC. Only shaman classes (shaman and BLs) get abolish poison, so the statement that pallies are better single target curers than us is incorrect. We also get blood of nadox, which is a very usefull spell when dealing with poison/disease based traps and AEs. In at least one mob it is the difference between a tough encounter and a trivial one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Tulega ,for canni  heals torpor was still much better to heal our canni. and now Q , it alwasy has, extra healing power, if the form of a quicker less effecient heal wouldnt really affect that.<br />
<br />
just because they decide not to give us that spell doesnt mean it was the right decission SoE have made lots of wrong ones as seen by all the balancing needed to other classes in the first place. Also , it doesnt mean that we dont need a balancing now.</div></div><hr />

- Can you understand one simple sentence: NO SHAMAN WITH A HALF BRAIN WANTS TO HEAL LIKE A CLERIC OR DRUID? Is that so goddamn hard to understand?

Heh.. what you fail to understand is that our problem now, will be your problem down the road. And, seeing as we have triple of most your hp, resists and mana pool, yet we all say there is a problem, wouldn't that let you to believe that there is a serious issue here?<br />

Go ahead, grind out your easy ldon adventures, farm loot in BoT, and be content. Well, news flash for you, some of us aren't content with that. We worked hard to push to a level of game that is challenging, only to find out that shamans bring hardly anything to the table anymore.<br />

Jinheim, try playing with only half your equipment and a quarter of your AAs and then let me know how powerful you are. Any problems you might or might not feel with your equipment+AAs will be much more visible for other (more normal?) people.

I'm still unsure what our problem that you people bitch aboot.  People say we lack in healing, but I sure don't see it.  As a shm I've been able to keep the group alive while doing a ldon hard when the cleric went ld after 5 min the adv started.  As long as I've had two cc'ers or two tanks with an AoE agro enducer I heal fine in hard without a backup healer (with max aa in healing your mana efficient heal does 2.4k, Q does around 2.6k with it being 70% extended, and with a healing 4 item you can crit heal for 3.1 to 3.4k).  We can heal just as good as druids in tactics and even better while in HoH.  Their only HoT is an AA.  All we have to do is pop a q on the tank before they engage the mob and spot heal here and there.  In HoH I prefer me being the only healer and picking up one tank and four dps classes.  With that makeup you'll be getting an aa ding every 45min and can get an 18 mob rotation for the cycle.<br />
<br />
Our DPS is fine as it is and it's only getting better with dot crits, a third lvl of dd crits, and casting subtlety in the new exp.  Right now the two things that are holding me back for dps is the agro I generate and the lack of HP's the mobs have.  Most fights only last for 30~40sec.  That is enough time to cast bane (420 per tick) and chain cast your quick poison DD (with an ID4 item you're nuking from 700-810 every 3.5 sec or crit for 1.3k to 1.45k (or more if you have a bard in your group).  On your fights that take longer that 60sec you can cast bane, wait two or three ticks and cast Saryrn (320 per tick), and follow it up with by chaincasting your quick poison dd after waiting a few ticks.  That's almost 1.5k dmg per tick without even getting a crit on your dd.  Our DPS output is fine seeing we were never truly classed as a dps class.  Sadly I welcome having a bst in the group, more hp/mana regen and he can slow which allows me to contribute more dps without having to worry aboot agro till the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
Our one goal in raid encounters is to debuff the mob and keep the ma or sa up with spot heals in case a cle/dru lags during their CH cycle.  As long as they're up the nukers can burn down the mob which ensures victory.</div></div><hr />

The only advantage DA has is the seperation of counters.<br />
You can cure more small DoTs<br />
But since we are talking level 65 here how man 65 mobs cast stuff below 10 counters and multiple DoTs?<br />
Most DoTs your talking about especially at raid level are more than 10 counters.<br />
<br />
Now on the other hand Pally have to mem 1 spell to cure poi/dis/curse<br />
We would have to mem remove curse or remove greater curse<br />
Both of which Paladins also get.<br />
2 spell gems vs 1.<br />
Don't know where I am supposed to get all these spells gems....<br />
<br />
The Paladin spell Crusader's Touch is a bit better than DA for single target cures. Not a huge difference mind you but it still does make a Paladin better at single target cures.<br />
A good example of this might be LDoN chest traps and traps.<br />
You never quite know what resist it is going to be beforehand and often<br />
times Radiant Cure will not cure it.<br />
<br />
As far as group cures we have Nadox (had to fight like heck for that though huh?)<br />
And we had Radiant Cure with Paladins getting RC we do lose ground even if we get hastened curing. <br />
The improvements to Paladin healing aa in GoD far exceed the benefit we will gain from a slightly faster RC.<br />
<br />
As for the healing it was Sony that stated back when those heals went in that our heal was less due to slow, and that they were trying to make us balnced healing so we could heal the same as a Druid if the Druid was healing an UNSLOWED mob when we healed on a SLOWED mob.<br />
Their concept was to have Shaman have the same heal power as Druids based on the fact our mobs would be slowed and the Druid's mob would not be. A very flawed premise to balance on.<br />
Now enter slow mitagtion to the already unslowable or slow immune mobs.<br />
Our healing never got better to compensate but Druids did.<br />
<br />
You have to consider too that quite a few other classes have group heals. The Shaman has none to use ever.<br />
Enter GoD where other classes healing improves again and we get another HoT that cant keep up with the damage that is being taken by a tank. We lose more ground. Did our slow get better to compensate the healing differnces in ANY case thus far? No and in fact our slow got worse in terms of duration and percent with GoD.<br />
We get this minor resist adjust that will have very limited uses between the gaps of Turgur and Grummus.<br />
<br />
Sony has said:<br />
We do not use expansions to balance classes.<br />
My answer is still:<br />
Sony uses expansions to UNbalance classes.<br />
<br />
Like I said I dont feel the Druid's didnt deserve it or need it.<br />
I think its great they can function well as a healer in groups now.<br />
But Shaman healing got left in the dust in terms of heal power with the release of PoP because that balanced was based on a false premise that a) the Druids mob will never be slowed and b) Our mobs always will be.<br />
Our class is PRIEST yet we can not function well as main healer in most upper tier zones.<br />
<br />
I do not want to heal as well as a Druid.<br />
I would like to heal a bit better than I do now though.<br />
<br />
Back to BL and buffs.<br />
The comapariison is made as one class to another.<br />
IoS does not stack with Focus it does however stack with BL buffs<br />
When your comparing buffs from one class to the other the first thing you do is rule out that the BL nor the group will have Shaman buffs.<br />
Even if you happened to include Shaman buffs by BL they still come out on top as having better buffs.<br />
<br />
Ferocicty is better than FA (besides they stack)<br />
SV stacks with Focus and adding in Brell makes a difference how? Shaman cant cast Brell either.<br />
SV is still adding more than a Shaman can add over Focus.<br />
SD adds mana regen to the group Shaman cant do that.<br />
There is a 10% haste difference between the single target hastes ano no difference in hast % between the Shaman group haste and BL hatse... Any sane Shaman is going to prefer the group haste so you will get the same % and your back the the group spell advantage I mentioned earlier which is eroding.<br />
Sta Agi Str and Dex are largely useless buffs at this level.<br />
Most people are capped. And in all seriousness check the actual parses of any stat over 255. Anything over 255 added is very negligable.<br />
So basically even when you DO add the buffs together the BL add much more to ours then we add to theirs.<br />
However that was not the basis of that comparison but stacking BL vs Shaman buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will fix those PE numbers later on that error of the stacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Since you didn't bother reading the zillions post about what's wrong with shaman and poasted yet another super-intteligent thread where &quot;shaman&quot; and &quot;underpowered&quot; are used in the same sentence, i will repeat again what i already said.<br />
<br />
maybe, someday, someone will bother read the **** on those board before posting his own.<br />
<br />
Anyway!<br />
<br />
I'll sum it up for you:<br />
<br />
Groups:<br />
Paladins are better healer<br />
Beastlords have slow AND dps<br />
<br />
Raids:We don't stack at all and once we did Fo7 we are close to useless because we heal like crap and cannot do any valuable damage to a mob.<br />
<br />
Some raids are nicely made (Xegony, Time Trials) to make us feel useful, but this is a large minority - do you know more than one raid (hint: seru) where a melee adds very little to a fight?<br />
<br />
Bingo, there is not, we alays need more melee and more clerics, but we need a limited number of shaman. We are the ONLY class that: cannot do good damage, cannot heal well on a raid. And what's the problem? dealing damage and healing are what is important!<br />
<br />
Now i would advice you go further than raiding splitpaw before talking ever again about shaman being &quot;overpowered&quot; or &quot;just fine&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Edit:  <br />
As long as I've had two cc'ers or two tanks with an AoE agro enducer I heal fine in hard without a backup healer (with max aa in healing your mana efficient heal does 2.4k, Q does around 2.6k with it being 70% extended, and with a healing 4 item you can crit heal for 3.1 to 3.4k). <br />
<br />
Q is 300 a tick, how do you get 9 ticks (2.6k) out of a 4 tick spell, regardless of how extended it is?<br />
<br />
'mana-efficient heal' - are you talking about our 10-second complete heal?   Grats to you if you can keep a tank alive with that thing.</div></div><hr />

I'll acknowledge that my gear might make up for any of our shortcomings, but you also need to remember that when I made Jinheim he did not come with 5200hp, 430aa, and time flags.  I worked my way up from having a *club and a *tunic, just like most of you did.  When PoP came out, I had about 2300hp and 30aa, what would be considered gimp by today's standards.  I exped and raided in pop, all the way from pod to potime, and my gear got gradually better as time went on.  In that year, I never felt underpowered.  When we first got access to PoV, I was able to function as a main healer in the desert using torpor and kragg's mending.  Remember, this was with tanks with luclin and velious era gear, not the 11khp monsters we have today.<br />
<br />
I'll admit that I have never done LDoNs with less than EP gear.  However, if you can heal in PoV, I'm sure you can heal in LDoN.  As for our damage output in LDoN, I think it is actually pretty good if you have a group that can handle multiple mobs.  I typically root a mob in the corner so that it gets killed last, and stack dots on it while my group kills the others.  I do very respectable damage this way.  What else is wrong with the shaman class?  We don't debuff good enough?  I've never had a problem getting groups, and I've been the slower in every group I have ever been in unless I'm grouped with a shaman or enchanter that has their time weapon.  I'm not sure what else you could ask for.<br />

Finally, I am curious what was so offensive about my first post that it warranted several negative rep bumps?  Is it now standard practice to give negative bumps to anyone you don't agree with?</div></div><hr />

The fact that you have good friends with good gear that will group and raid with you even if they might have been able to do it without you could also cloud the issue.<br />
<br />
I dont think the rep bump comment was directed towards me but just to be sure: I dont use that system since its just as messed up as what GoD has in store for shamans :)<br />
<br />
I guess a lot of these threads will die out soon because GoD is just about to get released and we all know that it is much less likely anything changes after release. Next big release for EQ could very well be WoW ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having friends definately helps when you're looking for a group.  However, having friends certainly isn't limited to people in PoTime :)  I just have more people in my guild than an average person does.<br />
<br />
As for a group being able to function without me, that's ok.  There is no class that is required for every single group, and that is how it should be.  I think with a competent group (not necessarily uber, just know how to play the game), any competent shaman can function as a healer in normal LDoN or pov/bot/tactics.  I've done it many times in random pickup groups, and it isn't even difficult.  If it was difficult for me I could see how it would be too hard for someone without EP and time gear, but it isn't a stretch at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I realize many people truly play a different game - the following is from the post-plane-of-time point of view.<br />
<br />
As long as I've had two cc'ers or two tanks with an AoE agro enducer I heal fine in hard without a backup healer<br />
So as long as you never have to heal more then one MOBs damage you do fine? Do you realize that even without a slower a cleric or druid will do at least as well as you, and a paladin can at least handle a double pull, even though me might run out of mana eventually?<br />
<br />
We can heal just as good as druids in tactics and even better while in HoH.<br />
Until said druid gets max FT and maybe a few outside buffs and fights still only last for a half a minute. Then he will outheal you while still finding time to add some damage.<br />
<br />
Their only HoT is an AA.<br />
Their only group heal is an AA too! Of course that is a lot better then the number of shaman group heals.<br />
<br />
All we have to do is pop a q on the tank before they engage the mob and spot heal here and there.<br />
I can keep Q running for an entire adventure but it still is no more then a band aid when you encounter some hasted 900-hitters.<br />
<br />
In HoH I prefer me being the only healer and picking up one tank and four dps classes.<br />
Anyone can heal on trivial content. Just because a Necromancer heals the odd riposte damage fine while he is fearkiting does not mean he is a good healer.<br />
I realize HoH might not be trivial content for you, but slowable, not overly resistant single pulls with room to be kited if need be is not exactly a difficult enviroment.<br />
<br />
Our DPS is fine as it is and it's only getting better with dot crits, a third lvl of dd crits, and casting subtlety in the new exp.  Right now the two things that are holding me back for dps is the agro I generate and the lack of HP's the mobs have.  Most fights only last for 30~40sec.  That is enough time to cast bane (420 per tick) and chain cast your quick poison DD (with an ID4 item you're nuking from 700-810 every 3.5 sec or crit for 1.3k to 1.45k (or more if you have a bard in your group).  On your fights that take longer that 60sec you can cast bane, wait two or three ticks and cast Saryrn (320 per tick), and follow it up with by chaincasting your quick poison dd after waiting a few ticks.<br />
Our damage spells aren't anything to write home about. Both Necromancers and Druids have better DoTs. Every single caster outnukes us, and Rangers, Shadowknights and Beastlords can do so conditionally. If you factor in that every single one of these classes has to try hard to run low on mana given sufficient gear . . . <br />
I am not sure any class does less damage then a shaman (post time).<br />
<br />
Our one goal in raid encounters is to debuff the mob and keep the ma or sa up with spot heals in case a cle/dru lags during their CH cycle.<br />
You need a single shaman for tha&lt;t extra debuffing edge. After that a druid, cleric or paladin will do better.<br />
<br />
I'll admit that I have never done LDoNs with less than EP gear.  However, if you can heal in PoV, I'm sure you can heal in LDoN.  As for our damage output in LDoN, I think it is actually pretty good if you have a group that can handle multiple mobs.  I typically root a mob in the corner so that it gets killed last, and stack dots on it while my group kills the others.  I do very respectable damage this way.  What else is wrong with the shaman class?  We don't debuff good enough?  I've never had a problem getting groups, and I've been the slower in every group I have ever been in unless I'm grouped with a shaman or enchanter that has their time weapon.  I'm not sure what else you could ask for.<br />
Jinheim, every dotting class can do that corner dotting trick. Of course a druid will often play primary healer, something we have a much harder time attempting and a Necromancer will probably root one, tap-tank one and have his pet on the third.<br />
<br />
I do not feel too bad in LDoN groups solely because I have my slow stick and thus I can still add some damage and healing. If I had to actually cast my slows I would be hard pressed to do more then slow and occassionaly patch heal. A Beastlord would slow at least 80% as well as me, while adding twice the damage I could do if the only thing I did was doing damage. An enchanter could slow 90% as well as I do, while bringing mez and charm to the table, not to mention better buffs. A second cleric or druid would heal more damage then I can mitigate with slow and still have mana left over for doing damage. A paladin could bring at least the same amount of healing to a gorup that spreads damage out and still tank and do damage.<br />
<br />
I do not like to rely on a unique item to not feel like I am not pulling my weight.</div></div><hr />

Heh...with the new drop down menus on gems it take seconds to exchange one for the other. I dont normally have any of those cures memmed. They just go into the two floating gem spots I have when needed. As you pointed out, we can do everything pallies can do cure wise plus TA is potentially more versatile. Pallies dont get AP, which has its uses. Your argument that pallies are better single target curers doesnt hold water ;). <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, it would be useful to dig up the link where Sony actually said that. I'm not convinced that it isn't a case of Sony having &quot;said it&quot; because everyone repeats that they &quot;said it&quot;. If they did make heals to match slow reduction from turgurs, they would have given druids heals 4 times the size of ours (in terms of mana efficiency, since thats the magnitude in damage reduction), and they didnt, so, if someone from Sony really did say that, they were incredibly stupid ;). You need to remember that these heals were implemented at around the same time that slow mitigation was developed, so they could hardly have been unaware of the issues involved if that was truly their rationale. I think its more likely that the real reason was our far superior mana regeneration abilities, consequently our heals were made correspondingly more &quot;expensive&quot;. Druid's 4 mana/tick self buff is puny compared to canni in its various forms ;). Put it this way, would you sacrifice canni in order to get better heals? I suspect most shaman would not :p <br />
<br />
You have to consider too that quite a few other classes have group heals. The Shaman has none to use ever.<br />
<br />
Technically we do. Forget about group replenishment? :D  It is a usefull spell in its own little way btw, allthough seldom used ;)<br />

Your arguments about BL buffs are weak. Most caster classes have buffs of some sort or another. The fact is that both classes buffs stack, and where they dont, ours will overwrite theirs, as far as I know. Our primary buffs dont have major problems stacking with other class buffs, whereas BLs do. I don't know too many people who would take SV over BSS, so if there is a pally in the group or raid, shaman are decidely stronger buff wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go ahead, grind out your easy ldon adventures, farm loot in BoT, and be content. Well, news flash for you, some of us aren't content with that. We worked hard to push to a level of game that is challenging, only to find out that shamans bring hardly anything to the table anymore.<br />
<br />
I am not going to add to anything that hasn't been alrady said numerous times. I will however say people like you really need to READ what the problem is and in what situations before coming here and opening your mouth spouting this inane drivel over and over. Fine, you don't have a problem with a shaman in your game play.. well we god damn do. So who are you to say anything about a situation you have self admitingly denied you are part of.<br />
<br />
So, you can either support your fellow shamans or you can just hold your tongue, because when you have no clue about a situation and try to comment on, and in your case even tell us to shut up, you make yourself just sound like a moron.<br />

Group Regen is not much of a heal and Druids have the same exact spell.<br />
Your point again?<br />
BL have Paragon<br />

Druids have Wood<br />

Both or substantially supperior to a group regen.<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3441&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Regen is called regen for a reason because it is too small to be considered a heal.<br />
<br />
In the scope of the comparison BL vs Shaman buffs it is valid.<br />
We lose hands down.<br />
The guy said we had the best buffs. Fact is we do not.<br />
BL in a group with no Shaman will buff better than a Shaman and no BL.<br />
There is no doubt about that. Hard evidence staring you in the face waiting for you to actually read it and comprehend it.<br />

<br />
By your magelo you are yet another monday morning quarterback Shaman that is not at that level of play.<br />
Your Shaman is quite obviously a bot/alt considering the major difference in gear between your Warrior which obviously your main and your Shaman which is obvious either a bot or a twink.<br />
When was the last time you played your Shaman as main healer/slower in PoE?<br />
When was the last time you were the only healer/slower for LDoN hard?<br />
Simple fact is your Shaman could not do that without people dying all the time.<br />
<br />
You come here try to disprove me with your opinions without any basis in fact on a char that is quite obviously not your main char and doesnt play at the same level as where the issues lie....<br />
<br />
Until you have some sort of proof to back up anything you say your just a troll and begone with you.<br />
Frankly I have given you much more time than you deserve already because you have not offered any kind of proof as an argument.<br />
You have stated OPINION not proof.<br />

This is such a false statement that it is not even funny to tear it apart.<br />

<br />
There are a few trolls that come and say shaman are still Demigods... I understand the idiocy in that...<br />

Jesus, if u think we need some tweaking where you are then stop posting negative **** about us that are in game content above you KNOWING we need tweaking.... <br />

Your basically cutting your own throats on this one... If you do BoT and Sol Ro and u think we need some twinking.. Or even if you exp at zone in of PoFire or Water....and you think we need tweaking... just wait till you get to PoFire tables in a group.... Or down by Corndog in Powater for exp.... Your gonna feel like one of the most useless people in the group.....<br />
<br />
Lets not even talk about Potime trials... and how shaman arent even bothered with in them....Much better to have Bst for his dps/slow or a chanter for slow since alot of the mobs there arent mezzable.. chanters just slow....<br />
<br />
I never understood how a class could basically try and derail its self the way you guys do....Lower content shaman trying to say they know it all and we are fine, when 95% of end game shaman are saying that we are obsolete just boggles my mind....<br />
<br />
Keep posting how good we are.... in 6 months to a year when POP is trivial and you make it to PoTime and your sitting at trials for a hour wondering why your not in a kill group... come back here and tell us how GREAT and AWESOME we are... so we can laugh our asses off at you....<br />

I don't know how many times durning the past 4 years that I have heard Shaman higher level than me spout some advice or truism that could only come from being higher level and at the time I would think priggish know-it-all! <br />
<br />
As I have advanced I have found that more often than not these &quot;Older&quot; Shaman where indeed correct even if they did have a problem with communicating in a civil manner.  So after about the 3rd or 4th time my own experience has proven these older guys right I started to believe what they are saying.  Now I am only at 80 AAs with no Luclin or Pop equipment, but I can look at the game mechanics and see how what these guys are saying will probably be true for me eventually.<br />
<br />
My big problems now are that Shaman don't stack well on raids and that Beastlords offer more to a normal LDoN group than I do.  Don't tell me otherwise, because I have had too many other players tell me this to my face (pixelated face).<br />
<br />
I can solo pretty well and when I started playing 4 years ago soloing was my prefered method.  Eventually I took the &quot;EQ is a social game you idiot and you should be grouping&quot; argument to heart and started to play mostly in small groups.  Now I am being told not to worry about the fact that my class is weak in raids and groups because I can solo well!  It is kind of irritating to change your whole attitude only to be told you were right in the first place. (I know this is not true since grouping is more fun)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">KurthMcdonough (and others in other places have pointed out)<br />
<br />
Bottom line is and it states it on castersrealm at the creation guide for shamans.....drum roll.....SHAMANS ARE MASTERS OF NOTHING BUT GOOD AT EVERYTHING!!!!...we are still highly sought for in groups for that reason alone and we will always be highly sought for.<br />
<br />
I have to argue this.  There may have once been a time when shaman were THE jack of all trades class, and this could have been a reason why we did not need to be a master of nothing, but this jack of all trade status is certainly not a unique shaman trait any longer.  There are many classes that can do almost everything now.  Exactly how many more uses do shamans have over druids for example.  I certainly do not see that Im any more a swiss army knife than a druid is.  Druids cant slow, but they can snare, port/evac, heal significantly better than a shaman, do better dps and burst dps, debuff in many areas, and have buffs just as highly sought after as mine. . .<br />
<br />
Crimity, I did a normal Ldon in a pet zerg group last week, where I was the main healer/slower, but barely ever healed because the two necros in the group had it covered (Ive never played a necro not sure what spell they were using, it seemed to be some kind o very fast regen, that once mobs were slowed kept pace with damage).  The truth is except for pure meleers and some of the int casters, every class is near jack of all trades status.<br />
<br />
But maybe Im just grumpy.  I got bumped from a hard Ldon group last night in favor of a beastlord because Im still lvl 64 while he was lvl 65.  I dont know.  Im not uber, my guild is not close to being elemental flagged, but just trying to do hard Ldons, I can see what the uber shamans are complaining about.  I cant fault the group that bumped me, they were better off with the 65 beastlord over me.  Due to the mitigation in hard Ldons, the bsts slows are about as good as mine (maybe better considering the speed issue), and he had significantly better dps than me.</div></div><hr />

You can be tired of the tone, and I am sure many of us are. Problem is that unless you gripe endlessly, Sony will not make changes. Always has been like this, always will be. In fact, I would wager that is the biggest reason for our lack of improvements over the last 4 expansions or so, we never said much. The few changes that they did, removing some single stat buffs in PoP, changes in alchemy, drop rates, all came after months of griping about a problem.<br />
<br />
So, if you are tired of it, skip the posts. But why try and throw a wrench in our efforts? You aren't affected so it doesn't matter that much to you? Fine, but again why make negative posts?<br />
<br />
Also, I'd be careful making assumptions on how long people have played the game and use it as a basis for your validity. There are perhaps a thousand people that have played as long or longer than I, but who cares, right?<br />

We can heal just as good as druids in tactics and even better while in HoH.  <br />
<br />
And no one is denying this. We heal well on easy stuff, but who wants to live their life on easy stuff? Damn near everytghing in elementals mitigates, or is immune to slow, thus requiring more heals to deal with their insane melee dps thats slowed less% than earlier content. If the healing aa/item enhancers ALWAYS kicked in, it would be one thing. We can keep a tank alive, we cant keep the exp FLOWING as a healer. I ask you... can a paladin, sk, or warrior all server to keep an exp group moving as a tank? Why can only 2 of the 3 healers do it at end game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh..I was running through Netherbian with my newbie necro one day and saw a small group hunting there with a couple mobs in their camp. I paused to see if they were okay, and saw their tank (a shadowknight) was real low on health and cleric looked like he was medding. So I cast empathy on the shadowknight and started lifetapping the other mob so I could give my life to the tank. They invited me to hunt with them, and after a while the shadowknight sent me a tell saying how glad she was I joined because I was the best necro she'd met. I guess people dont know that necros can heal a little bit. I deleted my necro at level 20, so dont know what they can do at high level, but their heals are sacrifice type spells (typically) - they give their life to the target, then use lifetaps or leech dots to heal themself.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Looked at the higher level necro spells, check out Theft of Vitae. It's a leech dot that gives life to the whole group, instead of just themself.</div></div><hr />

We're outdamaged and outbuffed (not to mention outtanked, have you SEEN a beastlord avoid damage?) by our hybrid, and outhealed by someone else's hybrid.

<br />
Let's stop and think about the things (slow, canni, dots, healing) that made such a great impact back in &quot;the day&quot; and what they've become for today's high end shaman.  Maybe this will help people understand why we &quot;whine&quot;.<br />
<br />
Slow - Mitigation.  While a very good thing for the game, it greatly diminishes the most valuable aspect of a shaman's existence in both raid and group settings.  Also, when you give this same ability (offset by 5-10%) to 3-4 other classes, the &quot;shaman impact&quot; only further decreases.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize - Mana regen from Canni is pretty sweet.  But hello, &quot;Active&quot; regen!  We are the only mana class that has to cast a spell every tick to activate this ability.  Also, the end game is all about quickness and responsiveness.  Cannibalize doesn't fit into that scenario at all because you can't do anything (can't even move) when you're cannibalizing.  Effectively you take yourself out of the game for six seconds every time you cannibalize.  It's even worse than meditating -- you can at least socialize or AFK while you med.  And of course, you can't meditate and cannibalize at the same time (without canni-dancing, which will make you want to poke your eye out).<br />
<br />
DoTs - A great source of damage, the potential for DPS is pretty good with DoTs.  Unfortunately, mobs die too quick at this level for DoTs to be effective, due to the amazing DPS of the many other classes.  Not to mention, if we're maximizing DPS with DoTs, we're not doing much else, AND we're tanking (ask Dregen about my aggro).  On raids, more than 2 DoTs and we risk compromising the MT, especially if we have debuff aggro too.  And finally, on raids with 4 necros and 5 shaman, the mob bounces our dots pretty quick.<br />
<br />
Healing - With the introduction of mitigation, our healing now has only slightly more impact than that of ranger heals prior to PoP (I'll let you do your own math).  Yes, we can heal, and yes our healing does help.  But in my opinion, it doesn't qualify us as a priest class anymore.  Quies is fantastic for it's efficiency, but useless on mobs that triple for 700.  And it's single target, making it ineffective on raids.<br />
<br />
Buffs - Maccuul made better comments about this already.  To point out the gross misperception of shaman buffing, a cleric in my guild seemed to think people would prefer shaman buffs to cleric and druid buffs.<br />
<br />
In summation, every class-defining ability we have has been rendered mediocre at best due to increases in game content.  I am not upset about other classes improving; I am merely frustrated that we have been ditched as an impact class.<br />
<br />
The people who really want shaman in their group are either 1) unaware of our actual impact (we still live off our Kunark reputation), or 2) doing content like BoT, CoD, and normal LDoN.  Otherwise beastlord, chanter and bard are all preferable.  Look at it this way: these classes are preferable because overall, their value is greater to a group than our &quot;class-defining&quot; roles would provide.  It isn't that we suck.<br />
<br />
This stuff has been repeated over and over and over.  While part of me wants to say &quot;get over it&quot; to both sides, like others in this thread, I would rather keep doing whatever it takes to get Sony's attention.</div></div><hr />

True, I've not been main healer in PoE (I have in PoF though). Not a lot of experience healing in hard LDoN either, allthough I have briefly when our cleric went belly up. Whatever, I do know though that my shaman is capable of healing my warrior on yellow cons just fine when duoing for quest bits, so I suspect that I could handle most situations. And thats without all the hp/ac/focus effects/aa that you guys have. I'm not saying that we can heal anywhere as well as a cleric. Obviously we cant. Shaman are saying that they don't want heal as well as clerics, yet, when they provide examples of where their healing is inadequate, they give examples of the most difficult situations. That means they DO want to heal as well as clerics. You know, I understand that, I play in the same places as you and I am well aware of the challenges there. Shaman do have limitations, every class does, and it is part of those classes.</div></div><hr />

wow. you healed in the weakest elemental plane. Good on you. Was it zone in mephits? Those are some leet exp. And you healed briefly when the cleric died! wow! So can a paladin. But I bet you were near oom from 1 mob eh? Let me pose a question to you. If you had 2 tanks in the gruop, a warrior and a paladin, and the paladin died (obviously he was the main tank), and the warrior had to tank for a battle... would it seriosuly cripple the group? Any of the 3 tanks can function as a tank over the course of a session in a challenging setting. Not so with the healers.<br />

You are showing your profound cluelessness and ignorance again shaman BOT. Exp groups arent &quot;the most difficult&quot; situations. We dont  want raid level healing, massive group instant heals, etc. Clerics own us on buffs/healing/paccing/melee, druids can heal adequately AND nuke/snare/charm/ not to mention BUFF BETTER at the end game. Since with a shaman you need a healer anyways, why the hell not take a beastlord and a healer instead, to get essentially the same slow and MUCH MUCH better dps/buffing/mana regen etc?<br />
<br />
But hey, you are clearly having fun being mediocre. A class cant get by on being simply average (or below average in our case) at several things, when in a group of 6, theres likely going to be a specialist at everything they do. I cant do 5 things poorly at once... since I can only SLOWLY cast one weak spell at a time. We barely edge out the other slowing classes, but all the other classes which can slow do another thing EXCEPTIONALLY well (cc/charm dps, pull/cc/dozens of other functions, or mana regen/dps).

Apparently you didnt even play your Shaman in PoP when it came out.<br />
Slow mitagation has been completely changed from what it was in PoP beta. The way it works was COMPLETELY changed.<br />
Remember hasted mobs? You can slow on your friendly neighborhood giant and he proceeded to wipe you group in short order be uhm mitagation was not thoroughly tested and was BROKEN.<br />
Heals were balanced on a 100% false premise.<br />
<br />
GoD did not exist then.<br />
Mitigation was supposed to be limited use on some mobs.<br />
GoD 95% on all mobs in a hard adventure mitigate.<br />
<br />
I dont have to prove anything to you simply because you still have stated nothing but opinion. Your arguments are opinion.<br />
Your debate is on content you have not expienced on char that is admittly botted and not played to its fullest potential.<br />
PoF your talking about a zone most people solo in and you think your healing is great... I regualrly see:<br />
Druids, Wizards, Necros, Enchanters, Paladins, Shaman, and Rangers soloing in PoF. It is saying I heal fine in Kunark!<br />
<br />
Come up with some reasonably sustainably counter argument with a basis backed up in fact why our healing did not improve much with PoP.<br />
Will not improve with GoD.<br />
The proof even without any other evidence lies in the fact we no longer heal as well as a Druid. We did for 60 levels and 4 years what changed?<br />
We had slow, Torpor, Can5, can4 all before PoP AND we healed the SAME as a Druid.<br />
<br />
Here is ONE of the developer chats state how mitigation was SUPPOSED to work but never did.<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4899<br />
and here is one on out own boards from Scott Hartsman admitting mitigation is broken and not functioning as intended.<br />

That should be enough at least to say that our healing power was not properly balanced to a poorly implemented and buggy slow mitigation system.<br />

there is a big big difference between playing a shaman soloing, grinding and raiding.<br />
<br />
I feel that due to the way we regen mana we will never have problems with both soloing and grinding.<br />
it even gets to a point where its boring when you dont heal, pull, slow and dot and thats just because we can and have the mana for it.<br />
<br />
BUT when raiding, and this is the part where the shamans roll is VERY thin.<br />
sure we can heal, but how fun is it to heal people when the AE hits them for 2K ?<br />
sure we can slow but not before we have had the mage to sinia and the chanter to tash.<br />
melee... just not worth the time <br />
yahoo we can DOT yep , but on raid the mobs resists are so high you need to chain cast dots on them, and only if you are lucky it will stick. <br />
and DDing them come on dont try telling me its worth it on raids ?<br />
<br />
to sum it up a shaman is good at anything up to raids, but after there is a complete stop on what a shaman can do.</div></div><hr />

Actually my experience is a lot different from yours. The few times I solo I do pretty well, mainly because the fight lasts long. However when grinding the only reason I can keep pace is because of my slow stick. If I had to actually cast Turgur's instead I would not be able to do more then slow MOBs and if I am lucky drop a heal every third kill. When MOBs last 20 seconds slowing them 8 seconds into the fight and then having your slow mitigated simply does not cut it when our healing is built around a 75% slow. Our mana regen likewise does not cut it when we noone runs out of mana in the first place - except us, who get to make up for our inefficient spells by cannibalizing, if we can find the time to do that.<br />
On raids where MOBs actually last long enough to use DoTs (well, some raids anyways) I instead find myself limited by the ridiculous aggro on our DoTs, forcing me to only partially DoT and nuke instead.<br />
<br />
sure we can slow but not before we have had the mage to sinia and the chanter to tash.<br />
That is fine - I do not expect to make even a 10% dent in a boss MOBs melee output all by myself. Resists on some specific MOBs might be too high (LDoN raids can be pretty bad in some places) but overall I think that is not one of our problems.<br />
<br />
yahoo we can DOT yep , but on raid the mobs resists are so high you need to chain cast dots on them, and only if you are lucky it will stick.<br />
Again, my experience is totally different from your's. On most raids you can easily find a DoT or three you can stick with minimal resists. Aggro on the other hand is just sick.<br />
<br />
and DDing them come on dont try telling me its worth it on raids ?<br />
Certainly worth more then getting summoned and beaten down due to DoT aggro  :p .<br />
<br />
to sum it up a shaman is good at anything up to raids, but after there is a complete stop on what a shaman can do.<br />
In my experience (insert standard post-time disclaimer here) we actually have a big problem in groups, stacking and aggro issues on raids and do pretty fine soloing.</div></div><hr />

I don't think any non-whining shamans would try to claim that we are.  We are in danger of becoming so, if druid/cleric damage/heals scale up while ours remains constant.  I still see the proposal as a reaction to the GoD spells/aa (if there had been a new decent direct heal there and a new nuke, I don't think the proposal would ever have happened).<br />
<br />
The problem is that our dps is a collection of lots of small numbers.  This leads to the misconception that it is small.  It's not.  I churn out 150+ dps in xp groups while keeping mobs slowed.  <br />
<br />
The only problem we have dps-wise is in burst dps situations, i.e. low hp mobs that die in &lt; 30 seconds.  It is here I feel inferior, because I sit on my full mana bar and have trouble even nuking enough to put a dent in it.  I can imagine the druid doing the same thing, only their nukes are much bigger.<br />
<br />
You just can't dismiss dogdog when comparing a shaman to a druid, though.  A base 38dps is like having a constant 200/tick DoT going on your side.  That is simply huge.  Even assuming a mob only lasts 3 ticks, you begin each fight with a 600 dd advantage over the druid.  Nuke the mob twice for 675, and you have done 1950.  Meanwhile, druids do 430/1705 with their nuke... we've done 1950 for 550 mana.    Now consider that we get an extra ~50/tick mana regen over a druid (assuming some canni4 uses) and who has the advantage?  That's right... we do!  <br />
<br />
Now, sometimes the druid will nuke twice and deal more damage, but other times we'll nuke 3 times... there is probably a region in there (mobs lasting ~4 ticks) with lapses due to pulls/running etc. in which druids do a little more damage than shamans.  But as soon as the mob is lasting 6 ticks, the druid is not touching shaman dps.  Bane just owns druid dots.  The mana regen + pet just puts us over the edge.<br />
<br />
As for beastlord, the dps gap is not as big as you would think.  The bst does not deal all that much dmg himself; a lot of it is packed into the pet.  I'd love to do some parses, but I'm pretty sure a Time shaman is at least close to an elemental beastlord dps-wise.<br />
<br />
Finally, when soloing, I can maintain, with 0 mana loss, a sustainable dps of 167 just from dots (1.155*(420+320+131)).  Shaman actually solo doomfires at Fire tables as well as a necro (verified with a necro in my guild... they gain pet dps, but they run around without a mount while a shm sits on horse, thus having much worse mana regen); when GoD goes live, I may actually be able to clear all 9 pops there before respawn.  Virulent paralysis, when it works, is just super powerful.<br />
<br />
I came up through bazaar gear, too, so the &quot;but you're time geared&quot; argument just doesn't hold water.  If anything, the shaman at 65/~25-30aa (where many many players are) is vastly more powerful than his competitors, because who among them has an aa that remotely competes with Canni5?<br />
<br />
When I was testing GoD, I betabuffed tons of classes.  And, yeah, I know some of those betabuffs are just crap, but I really gained an appreciation for just how damn good a shaman without FT is compared to another class without FT.  The shaman just totally owned the other classes, many of whom couldn't even do their jobs without &quot;wait I need to med&quot; moments.  At FT15, it is just a much smaller gap (the greater mana regen for everyone effectively hurts the shaman).<br />
<br />
My biggest complaint, and where I think shamans truly are underpowered, is in RAID situations where mana regen is just not an issue.  Druids just dominate us in this setting (better heals, higher burst dmg).  The only thing that makes me feel valuable in a raid situation is blood of nadox (go go LoY!!).  This is why a lot of Time shamans complain, I think.  Because they feel like all we do on raids is cast focus and get our small heal made fun of by big tanks.  In addition, we simply lack cool abilities like paragon or spirit of the wood that we can use in a raid setting.  So, here, I will concede the point at last, that shamans need work.<br />
<br />
Try playing an SK and turning on LFG, too.  Good God.  I never wait more than 10-15 minutes to get a group with the shaman.  I can literally sit for 2 hours with no tells with LFG on with the SK.  And, like it or not, being able to get a group on demand IS power.<br />

And of course shorter fights not only affect our DoTs, they also cripple our mitigation abilities.<br />

Mana is becoming more and more irrelevant - more mana regen does us no good if noone runs out of mana in the first place. That is, if we even have any time left over for cannibalizing after we tried to match the other classes heals or damage.<br />
<br />
Now, sometimes the druid will nuke twice and deal more damage, but other times we'll nuke 3 times... there is probably a region in there (mobs lasting ~4 ticks) with lapses due to pulls/running etc. in which druids do a little more damage than shamans.

Check out the resist rates on druid DoTs. Check out their damage shields. Parse the DPS of a charmed pet. Oh, and don't forget the druid adding some mana regeneration to the group.<br />
By the way, that fight duration of about 4 ticks is exactly what a lot of the complaints are about - and no, it is not 'a little more'.<br />
<br />
As for beastlord, the dps gap is not as big as you would think.  The bst does not deal all that much dmg himself; a lot of it is packed into the pet.  I'd love to do some parses, but I'm pretty sure a Time shaman is at least close to an elemental beastlord dps-wise.<br />
Sure, if you assume long fights and if you do not mind insisting on a tank who can taunt of the insane aggro our DoTs have - of course that is not what the complaints are about.<br />

Just because you can keep up decent damage in a situation where the MOB lasts ages and for some odd reason does not summon does not mean we are fine in other situations.<br />
I have not seen a single complaint about shaman being unable to solo, yet every other whine-about-the-whiners post states shaman are good soloers. Necromancers are great soloers too, as are Druids, Wizards, Shadowknights, Magicians, Enchanters, Paladins and Beastlords. How exactly is shaman soloing special?<br />
<br />
I came up through bazaar gear, too, so the &quot;but you're time geared&quot; argument just doesn't hold water.

Noone disputes that shaman do well just after hitting 65. Not as well comparatively as at 60, but well enough. At that point people still run out of mana. Few MOBs mitigate slow. Fights still last a minute, or even longer.<br />
As you say yourself we are hurt by everyone getting horses and FT and superior mana regeneration buffs. We are also hurt by slow mitigation and shorter fights. Do you honestly think that fights are going to be getting longer, slow mitigation is going to be less common and mana regeneration is going to stagnate in GoD and the expansions after it?<br />
<br />

At least on raids I get to pretend I am outdamaging everyone else by getting summoned. At least on raids my tiny slow advantage matters. At least on raids some MOBs last long enough for me to dot them. And yes, I do get to cast Blood of Nadox on the couple of MOBs where it the extra couple counters cured matter.<br />

People refusing to group with shadowknights need to have their head examined. The amount of damage a well-geared Shadowknight can bring to a group is sickening for a tank class.</div></div><hr />

The thing that really makes me whimper is the fact that ANY other class out there gets a slow that's almost if not just as good as ours.  :( <br />
<br />
When I first started playing I understood EQ to be a collection of classes that, when brought together, could make one helluva team.  Each person brought something unique to the table that made the gears turn.  But when you start giving certain class-specific abilities to other classes, those other classes who were once indispensible for their slow/cheal/tank, etc. - are now passed over in favor of classes who &quot;have it all.&quot;  What would happen if warriors got FD?  Or rangers got CHeal?  We'd end up with an EQ that has 4 or 5 classes.  That's no fun.  That's certainly not what this game was intended for IMO.<br />

<br />
<br />
Also post-time, and disagree.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you are still fighting MOBs that last 2 minutes or more - many of us are not, and the game is only progressing towards ever shorter fights.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am fighting mobs that last long enough to put bane on.  This is with a full group of &quot;post-Time&quot; people.  Earth mobs last ~40 seconds.  That is long enough.  Only in LDoN do mobs get annihilated so quickly that you can't use bane.<br />
<br />
The mob lasts about 6-7 ticks, during which time my pet attacks (38dps), I bane (80dps), and I velium strike once (27dps) or possibly twice (54dps).  This is somewhere in the neighborhood of 150dps, which considering I malos'ed and slowed the mob is not too shabby.<br />
Yes, when I velium strike with bane on, I often get summoned, but it isn't a big deal.<br />
<br />
In an LDoN normal, I melee with greatstaff to get the mana regen (super high proc rate) for about 20dps, toss 2 spears of torment per mob (75ish dps), and the pet does his 38.  I am still keeping up ~135-140ish dps, which isn't amazing, but, again, I don't think it's godawful... and I'm pretty sure it is better than a druid who is healer for the group (assuming no charmed pet).  <br />
 <br />
<br />
Unless of course said druid finds something to charm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very true.  I didn't mention charm because it isn't always available to the class.  It's pretty hard to quantify, as it's nice dps vs. 0 (nothing available to charm).  Overall, I don't think shamans feel threatened by the charm ability of druids.  But, yes, a druid with a charmed pet will definitely be much better dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana is becoming more and more irrelevant - more mana regen does us no good if noone runs out of mana in the first place. That is, if we even have any time left over for cannibalizing after we tried to match the other classes heals or damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is true, and I've been observing this for awhile now.  How mana pool effectively functions as mana regen (if you assume you can finish the adventure/fight/whatever at 0 mana).  6000 mana over the course of an hour (600 ticks) represents a mana regen of 10/tick based just on the mana pool size.  This is where nuking has gotten so effective.  For a 10 minute fight, it is even crazier (60/tick from a 6k mana pool).  This has certainly raised the effectiveness of nukes by a lot and reduced the impact of 'sustained dps'.<br />
<br />
<br />
Check out the resist rates on druid DoTs. Check out their damage shields. Parse the DPS of a charmed pet. Oh, and don't forget the druid adding some mana regeneration to the group.<br />
By the way, that fight duration of about 4 ticks is exactly what a lot of the complaints are about - and no, it is not 'a little more'.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not think a druid damage shield in an xp group exceeds the damage granted by FA.  But it would require parses to verify.<br />
<br />
The druid does get nice buffs, and this is a potential area of disparity (Fa+glades is &gt; focus+fa probably, at least in terms of dps granted the group).  But shaman do have the very powerful self-mana-regen, which is still pretty awesome (it more than makes up for the disparity in spell cost, anyway, by far.. especially canni4).<br />
<br />
Shamans kill druids in terms of DoTs.  The resist rate on Bane can be a problem on some mobs; that's my only minor complaint about it.  Where bane can land, there is absolutely no contest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, if you assume long fights and if you do not mind insisting on a tank who can taunt of the insane aggro our DoTs have - of course that is not what the complaints are about.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, what do you consider to be 'close to an elemental beastlord' ?<br />
<br />
<br />
I compared with a bst app to my guild at the time.  I had Time gear and they had elemental.  They parsed their own dps as high 100s, like 180-190.  I consider 150 dps to be pretty close to that, for a slow/support class vs. a dps class.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Just because you can keep up decent damage in a situation where the MOB lasts ages and for some odd reason does not summon does not mean we are fine in other situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not ages.. it just has to last 1 bane duration, or most of 1 bane duration.  Bane isn't very high aggro.  If you nuke on top of it, you might get summoned (I don't often with a paladin tank).<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you honestly think that fights are going to be getting longer, slow mitigation is going to be less common and mana regeneration is going to stagnate in GoD and the expansions after it?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I think fights in GoD will be much longer than those in LDoN.  They will be comparable to PoP when it first opened.  Bane will run full duration, which is all that is needed for shamans not to suck.<br />
<br />
<br />
People refusing to group with shadowknights need to have their head examined. The amount of damage a well-geared Shadowknight can bring to a group is sickening for a tank class.<br />
<br />
<br />
I absolutely agree... but dps and tanks both have the problem of just a lot of them around and hard to get groups sometimes.  Slowers and healers just get invites right off.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I may be talking out my ass.  I haven't parsed the damage that my fellow Time-geared druids etc. are doing, just my own.  But I've been talking to a druid friend of mine this morning, asking them what they typically cast in LDoN normals (1 nuke per mob was the answer), in PoP, etc. and I think my numbers are pretty correct.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Hell, at this point I don't even care about getting a new heal.  The ones I have function just fine when there's a cleric and/or druid about.  The thing that really makes me whimper is the fact that ANY other class out there gets a slow that's almost if not just as good as ours.  :( <br />
<br />
You complacent fool. Shamans are MORE than a slow. Enchanters are slow AND cc/charm dps/buffs. Beasts are slow AND superior DPS/better buffs.  Bards are slow AND superior pulling/cc. Shamans are slows AND...pathetic heals? Useless stat buffs? Umm.... Be content to be just a slow, and you will be made obsolete by classes whic h are slow ++. Oh wait, we already are.<br />
<br />
For some stupid reason, you are content to spot heal. I ask you... are shadowknights content to &quot;spot tank&quot; in exp groups, ie only for short periods of time? No, they are main tanks. They perform the role well enough that no grup is significantly slowed down by having a SK tank. Even if we add another slowing class to do the slowing, shaman healing in the end game is weak enough that there is a SIGNIFICANT decrease in group productivity. Furthermore, because we have to chain blast our weak heal... we cant effectively do much else besides heal. If a druid or cleric has another slower, they have the ability to do other things besides just barely keep the tank up. Why are we so far behind the other HEALERS in healing? Because of people like you who just want to slow, despite the fact that its weaker and weaker with every expansion. <br />
<br />
Our complaints are about the end game. Where we all have max ft. Where our former advantages are whittled away by capped (largely useless) stats, slow mitigation, huge mob dps, and very short exp mob fights. If you arent in this level of play, do me a favor... shut up. If you have to go off on something you are unqualified to speak of the berserker boards are open. How about you go make some &quot;educated&quot; posts on how they fare in elementals/time?

Oh, and whatever necro said shamans solo the tables as well as they do... lol. Thats cute... because we can snare and stuff. WTS Oceanfront Property in S RO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">I'm still unsure what our problem that you people bitch aboot.  People say we lack in healing, but I sure don't see it.  As a shm I've been able to keep the group alive while doing a ldon hard when the cleric went ld after 5 min the adv started.  As long as I've had two cc'ers or two tanks with an AoE agro enducer I heal fine in hard without a backup healer (with max aa in healing your mana efficient heal does 2.4k, Q does around 2.6k with it being 70% extended, and with a healing 4 item you can crit heal for 3.1 to 3.4k).  We can heal just as good as druids in tactics and even better while in HoH.  Their only HoT is an AA.  All we have to do is pop a q on the tank before they engage the mob and spot heal here and there.  In HoH I prefer me being the only healer and picking up one tank and four dps classes.  With that makeup you'll be getting an aa ding every 45min and can get an 18 mob rotation for the cycle.<br />
<br />
Our one goal in raid encounters is to debuff the mob and keep the ma or sa up with spot heals in case a cle/dru lags during their CH cycle.  As long as they're up the nukers can burn down the mob which ensures victory.<br />
<br />
That is fine until you hit things with time limits. Remember getting into POV? Remember all those shaman crying about how they are level 62+ and still can't get a pov trial group. (Don't buff people until they help you through the trial was common thought).. but why I can heal dps slow blah blah once you get to poTime+ or have to do poj trials at 60 you see how weak we are. <br />
<br />
Can't do crap for dps my crit is 1850 ish compared to a druids 1500 base.<br />
Can't heal for crap my heal is 1300 compared to 1750 or 4500 in 10s. Ya you can blast 1300 x 3 in 9seconds assuming 1 crit that's 5200 hps healed for 1800 mana and a 1.5k quadding guy ass raping you. Bane doesn't stick on **** in time. <br />
<br />
While the mob is not resisting and you can take an hour to kill it ya shaman are pretty nice. But when you have 25 min to kill a LOT of monsters no one really wants to see a shaman there. can't CC, slow really is not that important but helps a little if any, heals will get you oom fast cause they hit HARD or will get you dead soon. Bane (70dps) won't stick, our best nuke when it crits is then comparable to a druid.<br />
<br />
Those are things you need to consider. In hard ldon I don't malos, come on now how easy are these mobs. My guild just got in time so now I see the light I used to fight for how overpowered shaman are. We just beat TT, guess what I did? sit in a corner and hit tnargs until I was oom using canni and rod when I could woop di do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">NT servers were too busy so it messed up my post can't type all that agian.. basically when the mobs are really tough and there is a timer involved shaman weaknesses show up.<br />
<br />
I'm a time level shaman (no time gear yet) and people still ask for buffs when they do poj trials but they don't say &quot;hey you want to help out?&quot;<br />
<br />
If any of you remember back when you had to earn your way to pov/pos then you'd know how underpowered we really were when it comes to tough situations. <br />
<br />
Bane I guess was really great for us, but in time at least it bounces off of everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">I don't know really. Maybe we could use a little tweaking here and there, but I know I feel useful in most situations.<br />
<br />
I can be group healer in normal LDoN's just fine. And before people say it's because of my gear, I regularly group my ranger with another shaman who has bazaar gear and he heals just fine too, with a completely non-uber group.<br />
<br />
I can solo okay, it takes a while, and I'm not a big fan of soloing, but I can do it. Picnic tables in PoFire are my usual spot of choice. I don't know if I do it as effectively as a necro, but I do it a lot more effectively than a mage. :) I also join guild kite groups there, where I do significant DPS, and can save lives with patch heals.<br />
<br />
I regularly do hard LDoNs. I'm main slower, naturally, but with pet and bane, and FA, I do reasonable damage. My roots and heals have saved the day in more than one otherwise bad situation. If the cleric goes LD, I can cover heals quite adequately.<br />
<br />
I raid also - I have a variety of roles on raids. Slowing is the obvious one, but I can do some DPS and I can patch heal, cure, and can do rooting in some situations.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't struggle to get groups, and I can go solo while I'm waiting anyway. I have had enchanters tell me that they keep getting overlooked for groups in favour of shamans. I think it's largely a matter of perspective - your own class is always the one that's the worst off.<br />
<br />
Again, as others have said, a few tweaks would be appreciated, for example, nukes of the order of cleric/necro nukes, a couple of better heals, that sort of thing, but shamans aren't broken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nuke the mob twice for 675, and you have done 1950. Meanwhile, druids do 430/1705 with their nuke... we've done 1950 for 550 mana. Now consider that we get an extra ~50/tick mana regen over a druid (assuming some canni4 uses) and who has the advantage? That's right... we do!<br />
<br />
This is where my experience seems to contradict yours.  When Im in a ldon or exp group, by the time I maloed, slowed, then cast 2 nukes, the mob would be dead and the puller would have another in camp.  Am I missing something?  Is there a canni that has absolutely no down time?  I have literally no time at all to canni up if I take the time to nuke, unless the group holds pulls for me.  In theory we have much better manna regen than other casters because of canni.  When Im soloing I think this is true, as I have all the time in the world.  But in practice this supposed manna regen does not exist.  Shoot I have a hard time getting pullers to give me the 30 seconds it takes me to summon dog dog and give him two daggers before they start pulling and demanding you gonna slow this? haste plz.  <br />
<br />
As Kianor explained <br />
<br />
I don't know really. Maybe we could use a little tweaking here and there, but I know I feel useful in most situations.<br />
<br />
To a large extent I think that is all that the dissatisfied shaman are asking for too, some tweaking.  People are talking past each other here.  Ive seen many replies implying that the unsatisfied shamans are whiners, expecting to be able to put up dd nuke numbers rivaling wizards, and cast big heals with numbers rivaling clerics, but Ive not seen a thread where the unsatisfied shamans have actually asked for this (not that you are suggesting this Kianore, your post seems free of any inflammatory exaggerations).  The Proposal made it clear, I thought, that the shamans who are looking for more do not want the moon, but just some tweaking in one area.  I dont think that shaman are broken the way that warriors were, but I can certainly see how we are slowly sliding that way.  Maybe if I was in even more demanding areas (elemental/time) I'd see even more of a problem.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what I'm advocating.  I don't think we're broken, we need a couple minor adjustments.  I would like the DoT changed to a new DD (a 1k DR based DD would kick ass), the new canni made accessable and the slow recast on the new slow dropped significantly.  I think that would be sufficient for balancing us.  I personally don't care if the BL overwrites my slow and if a mob lasts more than 90 seconds in my camp then I've got bigger problems than a short duration slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Shamans aren't underpowered at the moment.  I don't think any non-whining shamans would try to claim that we are.  We are in danger of becoming so, if druid/cleric damage/heals scale up while ours remains constant.  I still see the proposal as a reaction to the GoD spells/aa (if there had been a new decent direct heal there and a new nuke, I don't think the proposal would ever have happened).<br />
<br />
The problem is that our dps is a collection of lots of small numbers.  This leads to the misconception that it is small.  It's not.  I churn out 150+ dps in xp groups while keeping mobs slowed.  <br />
<br />
The only problem we have dps-wise is in burst dps situations, i.e. low hp mobs that die in &lt; 30 seconds.  It is here I feel inferior, because I sit on my full mana bar and have trouble even nuking enough to put a dent in it.  I can imagine the druid doing the same thing, only their nukes are much bigger.<br />
<br />
You just can't dismiss dogdog when comparing a shaman to a druid, though.  A base 38dps is like having a constant 200/tick DoT going on your side.  That is simply huge.  Even assuming a mob only lasts 3 ticks, you begin each fight with a 600 dd advantage over the druid.  Nuke the mob twice for 675, and you have done 1950.  Meanwhile, druids do 430/1705 with their nuke... we've done 1950 for 550 mana.    Now consider that we get an extra ~50/tick mana regen over a druid (assuming some canni4 uses) and who has the advantage?  That's right... we do!  <br />
<br />
Now, sometimes the druid will nuke twice and deal more damage, but other times we'll nuke 3 times... there is probably a region in there (mobs lasting ~4 ticks) with lapses due to pulls/running etc. in which druids do a little more damage than shamans.  But as soon as the mob is lasting 6 ticks, the druid is not touching shaman dps.  Bane just owns druid dots.  The mana regen + pet just puts us over the edge.<br />
<br />
As for beastlord, the dps gap is not as big as you would think.  The bst does not deal all that much dmg himself; a lot of it is packed into the pet.  I'd love to do some parses, but I'm pretty sure a Time shaman is at least close to an elemental beastlord dps-wise.<br />
<br />
Finally, when soloing, I can maintain, with 0 mana loss, a sustainable dps of 167 just from dots (1.155*(420+320+131)).  Shaman actually solo doomfires at Fire tables as well as a necro (verified with a necro in my guild... they gain pet dps, but they run around without a mount while a shm sits on horse, thus having much worse mana regen); when GoD goes live, I may actually be able to clear all 9 pops there before respawn.  Virulent paralysis, when it works, is just super powerful.<br />
<br />
I came up through bazaar gear, too, so the &quot;but you're time geared&quot; argument just doesn't hold water.  If anything, the shaman at 65/~25-30aa (where many many players are) is vastly more powerful than his competitors, because who among them has an aa that remotely competes with Canni5?<br />
<br />
When I was testing GoD, I betabuffed tons of classes.  And, yeah, I know some of those betabuffs are just crap, but I really gained an appreciation for just how damn good a shaman without FT is compared to another class without FT.  The shaman just totally owned the other classes, many of whom couldn't even do their jobs without &quot;wait I need to med&quot; moments.  At FT15, it is just a much smaller gap (the greater mana regen for everyone effectively hurts the shaman).<br />
<br />
My biggest complaint, and where I think shamans truly are underpowered, is in RAID situations where mana regen is just not an issue.  Druids just dominate us in this setting (better heals, higher burst dmg).  The only thing that makes me feel valuable in a raid situation is blood of nadox (go go LoY!!).  This is why a lot of Time shamans complain, I think.  Because they feel like all we do on raids is cast focus and get our small heal made fun of by big tanks.  In addition, we simply lack cool abilities like paragon or spirit of the wood that we can use in a raid setting.  So, here, I will concede the point at last, that shamans need work.<br />
<br />
Try playing an SK and turning on LFG, too.  Good God.  I never wait more than 10-15 minutes to get a group with the shaman.  I can literally sit for 2 hours with no tells with LFG on with the SK.  And, like it or not, being able to get a group on demand IS power.<br />

I don't malos in LDoN.  I don't even have it memed in LDoN.  This is the reason I use Spear of Torment; poison just lands better.  I cast 1 slow right off.  If it lands, great.  If it doesn't, I don't bother recasting.  I melee with greatstaff of power constantly (frequent hits for 210, regens so much mana) and toss the fast poison nukes (23% hasted) in between hits.<br />

Only 120 with 1 vel strike, or 145 with 2  :/  And if dogdog isn't doing 38, adjust the number by whatever he actually does.<br />

In more practical terms, I am often stopping to FA someone... or to canni/Q... or re-slow after a resist... so that number represents an ideal, not an average.<br />

Since when can non-hybrids cast between swings? That to the best of my knowledge is a hybrid only advantage. For every other class casting a spell means you wait your entire weapon delay again before swinging.<br />

And you FA dogdog? For an added 4 DPS? Whoa, that wouldn't be worth the hassle to me, even if it might be slightly more mana efficient then nuking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Chifari explained (in response to an earlier post of mine about druids vs shamans)<br />
<br />
I don't malos in LDoN. I don't even have it memed in LDoN. This is the reason I use Spear of Torment; poison just lands better. I cast 1 slow right off. If it lands, great. If it doesn't, I don't bother recasting. I melee with greatstaff of power constantly (frequent hits for 210, regens so much mana) and toss the fast poison nukes (23% hasted) in between hits.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to ask Chifari, why even bother to cast slow at all then.  I do have a cut off point in the mobs health were I say bah forget-a-bout-it and give up trying to slow, and switch to damage, patch healing, or just canni.  When I do this, it seems it seems to me Ive failed to do my job.  If there is a situation where it is not matter if a mob gets slowed or not, seriously why did the group invite a shaman over a class with better damage?<br />
<br />
Your tactics are similar to mine indoors, except that I do not have a strong weapon (I have a soulstripper mace).  I will either melee while canning, or use a damage spell.  At this point the group would be much better off with the druids dd than my dd to finish off the mob (or a BLs dps, bah even a second clerics damage is better than mine).  I expect you do much more damage with your staff than I do with my mace, but still look at the dps youre contributing.  If it is not important that the mob gets slowed, and your utility to the group is based on your damage output, why would the group not choose a class that has a much larger damage output than yours?  Ill admit I just hit 65, and my gear not very good compared to most.  Maybe once I acquire better items Ill be able to melee and nuke and be happy as a dps class.  Still when I put up the LFG flag, and the party is being assembled, Im the slower.  No one has ever invited me to a group for my dps.  Ive never had anyone gripe at me for not nuking or meleeing hard enough.  I have been griped at because I cant slow mobs as fast a beast lord though, or I'm lom and have the audacity to ask for 30 seconds to canni and heal before the next pull.<br />
<br />
If the group expects me to slow mobs, I do my best to make sure I consistently slow the mob.  For me Id say on most db mobs, if I do not malo the mob first turgurs bounces about 40% of the time, and bounces a second time about 40% of the time.  After maloing a db mob turgurs bounces about 10% of the time.  I dont have long parses to back up my numbers, but Im not comfortable with the bounce rate of turgurs without maloing, and over all I spend a lot more time and manna slowing mobs by chaining turgurs than maloing then turguring.  I realize that in some areas its not that big of a deal whether the mob is slowed or not.  Normal Ldons is one of them.  This goes back directly to my point, the group would be better off with a druid nuking and patch healing and passing out Pot9, than with a shamans dps.  Over all a druid or a BL adds much more dps AND manna regen for the group than a shaman does, and the shamans slow is not really needed in many situations.  The more Im exping in harder zones and trying hard Ldons, the more Im finding that BL are better slowers than I am because theirs goes off quicker, and they can recast it quicker if we have adds to deal with.  My role is more and more becoming weak dps, or over-slowing a beastlords slow.  I hope some of you ubers tell me things get better as I get nicer gear and more aas, but from what I can see, its all down hill from here.  Oh well, maybe Ill dust off my jbb again and try soloing guardian wurms instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ouch!<br />
<br />
In regular adventures I only malos Named.  I get very few resistes to Turgurs and when I do, a second attempt gets it.<br />
<br />
In hard adventures I malos everything.  A resisted Turgurs here is painful.<br />
<br />
Your resists seem very high to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">I should clarify, the specific bouce rate of 40% was not for normal Ldon's in particular, but just exp groups in general.  I will say I don't normaly see that high a bound on normal Ldons, but exping in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok my turn to whine...<br />
<br />
When I left to daoc 2 years ago shamans were pretty solid. I find the game has changed alot. Shamans were pretty solid all the way up to 65. Granted Im in crappy gear but I imagine if I was in better gear with good augs it would only be a bandaid on the problem rather than a fix. Like duck tape fixes to a problem.<br />
<br />
Please be nice I am a nooblet compared to alot of you having only been back to eq for a few months. I only know the problems on the surface.<br />
<br />
but<br />
<br />
Here are my gripes...<br />
<br />
Our dds just suck they are so crappy im thinking we shouldnt even have a dd in the first place. I have 0 spell haste so casting velium strike I can litteraly use it as a timer to boil an egg irl. <br />
<br />
Heals ok so if we dont have alot of offensive power its ok because we can heal! But the problem is I have alot of trouble keeping a grp alive on my own. Even in a normal ldon I guess maybe im just gimped or unskilled. I have came close but one bad pull and its over. Especially with no improved healing items. <br />
<br />
Dots I think our dots are ok but disease dots minus their long duration blow goats.<br />
<br />
Pet I never thought of shamans as a pet class ever.I always loved dog dog but knew his limitations. Yet all our new aas are pet crap? *** those should go to bst lords imo. A few are cool but come on. I like the idea of the pet that regens end for the grp but imo it should also give a stackable haste and regen maybe even mana regen. that would be sweet and very usefull. Even if just small.<br />
<br />
Buffs, ok one thing that bugs me about the high end gear is people are maxing all their stats. Not good imo. Buffs dont go over the caps. If they made a seperate cap for buffs shamans would at least be an uber buff bot hehe. We would again be the kings of buffing.<br />
<br />
From playing lots of mmorpgs I have learned if a class doesnt do alot of damage but has alot of utility its ok. Im finding in that shamans are lacking alot of high end utility minus slow. We should be the best slowers period. Right now we ride a fine line. It always bugged me that our haste doesnt even come close to ench haste yet their slow is very close to ours. And back in the old days that didnt matter too much cause an ench slowing could get aggro get hit a few times and go down fast. Now days there are enchs out there with hp that make baby jesus cry.<br />
<br />
I dont know maybe i should just keep my mouth shut being such an eq noob and all but these are my opinions. If I am corrected than thats fine cause Im really to new to be talking hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">For all of you non-65 shamans (of which I am one) you should really listen to the 65's here and get behind them in trying to get some improvements done.  Let me tell you why.<br />
<br />
As has been said a hundred times already, you don't know the 65+ game.  You don't.  They do.<br />
<br />
Now, how much will it suck for you to finally reach level 65 and be ready for those elemental planes and Time . . . only to find out that all those 65's who were complaining six months ago were right?<br />
<br />
You wind up with a 65 character that no one wants to group.  THAT my friends is the definition of suck.<br />
<br />
I do not want to see the day where I finally am involved in this conversation:<br />
<br />
<br />
Somebody:  &quot;Hey, what's your highest character&quot;<br />
Me:  &quot;I've got a 65 Shammy&quot;<br />
Somebody:  &quot;I'm so sorry&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">It doesnt take a lot of intelligence to get there. However, it gets really old having people in lower tier planes say we are fine. I was fine in lower tier planes and groups as well. I am quite the suck now. You will be too. The major complaints we have are at the end game, and those who arent there, and saying they heal fine, are hampering the ability to get us tweaked.<br />
<br />
I think ya missed my point. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying Shaman are fine and dandy. hell no. I've been playing since Kunark launched, and, granted i'm not jacking off to screenshots of my time gear, but i know my class (well, ex-class) and i know how it works. I can quite definately agree that we're stuck in Velious at the launch of GoD.<br />
<br />
It was just the attitude of &quot;Unless you're level 65 and in the 'end game', you're an idiot who has no right to speak&quot; attitude that really steamed my cauliflower<br />
<br />
If you're wondering about that &quot;ex class&quot; thing... I quit in favor of a beastlord. It's easier to get a group, less clicking hassle, and I can actually contribute to the damage. It should be noted that in my beastlord's 51 levels, groups i've been in have only invited a Shaman twice. TWICE.<br />
<br />
Yes, a low-level shaman is &quot;all that&quot; solo, but put them in a group and watch them flop around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Since when can non-hybrids cast between swings? That to the best of my knowledge is a hybrid only advantage. For every other class casting a spell means you wait your entire weapon delay again before swinging.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't bother timing or anything.  I just stand close and melee and get whatever swings in that happen when I'm not nuking.  Proc rate on greatstaff is insane, and it enables me to nuke a little more.  Isn't huge damage, but it's a 210 here and there.<br />
<br />
<br />
And you FA dogdog? For an added 4 DPS? Whoa, that wouldn't be worth the hassle to me, even if it might be slightly more mana efficient then nuking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only because I religiously keep anyone that swings FA'd and I use pet as a timer.  Not because I am actually that concerned about 4dps.  When I see it wear, I know to start cycle again.  I guess I could FA myself (I do sometimes, but not often).  When I'm doubling my sk, I use him as the timer.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I see you did not factor in resists. And if you have multiple 30% focus items, how are your melees equipped? I would assume that even the tanking warrior outdamages you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could be, haven't parsed it.  The thing I see from Time gear that really bothers me is crazy 750dd procs etc... especially when I see it going off a bunch (combat effects or what not).  It makes me wonder what the point of having a nuke for 925 is that actually costs mana.<br />
<br />
As far as resists, that is a definite problem.  A huge problem, actually.  Bane should have a resist rate more like our poison or disease dots, and forget the ridiculous recast time.  I don't understand why they felt the need to gimp this spell so much.  Yes, you are absolutely right that dps in some areas (bane-related) is almost crippled by stupid resist rates.  I wouldn't even mind using bane as a hugely overcosted nuke (I've done this before, using it even when it only runs 3 ticks, just to give my mana regen some purpose).... <br />
<br />
If any devs reading this, omg please make Bane easier to land and take away the recast time!!  <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, but fights are only getting shorter each expansion. What I have seen from GoD so far only reinforces that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup.  All we'd need is a 3-4 tick dot that clocked in at 100dps and I'd be happy (600/tick).  Although is something that only runs 3 ticks even a DoT anymore?  It's more like Tears of Saryrn then, heh.<br />

Haha.  Apparently I got negative reputation from Zorlac because &quot;no shaman wants heal&quot;.  That's funny.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Hmmm, something is fishy here. In these threads, it's very clear that Zorlac also supports improvement to shaman healing. In fact, in the poll thread he states:<br />
<br />
IMO we need:<br />
(1) Cannibalize upgrade. Big chunk HP, big chunk mana.<br />
(2) Direct heal upgrades. Paladins in GoD will blow us out of the water in the healing department. A hybrid healing better than a priest, sad, pathetic game balance.<br />
<br />
My theory:<br />
<br />
Someone is angry at Zorlac for his um, pithy rejoinders to threads and has decided to sign his name to negative rep bumps targeted at popular posters with rep. According do the imposters devious schemes, the high rep posters will retaliate with their massive rep bumping power and neg rep bump Zorlac!<br />
<br />
Clue 1: Zorlac actually is in favor of improved heals for shaman<br />
Clue 2: Another poster who received a signed Zorlac rep bump (with a clue phone reference, nice touch, really), received a GREY rep bump. Since Zorlac has been a member since 99, has plenty of reputation and has over 1K posts, he should be able to substantially alter reps with red/green bumps<br />
<br />
Just a note, Sunmoon can check who is actually rep bumping. I'm going to ask him who rep bumped Juujuu on Feb 8 :)<br />
