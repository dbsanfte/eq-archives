<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last Friday while I was kicking around Freeport watching the local &amp; global markets, I get a /tell from a high level player. He wanted to know if I was a Shaman and if I needed a few quest items that he wants to get rid of. I asked if I can see the items and we agreed to meet behind Jade. I'm not fully read up on the Epic quest, but he was offering me Marr's Promise, Woe and Envy for a few pp. Nobody in his guild needed the items and they were useless to him. He thought he just find a Shaman and basically give it to them. <br />
<br />
So now these three items are sitting in the bank and I went to check an Epic walkthrough. Are they useful to me or do I have to start from scratch? Did I get bilked for 300pp or was the guy being extremely nice and giving me a gift? Are they the same items that I would get if I started the quest from scratch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You basically won't have to kill the guys that drop the items now, the paladin guy (the guy who drops the shield) can be kinda a stinker but other than that. You saved yourself a bit o'time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The two guys who drop those pieces are on a 2 hour spawn, which is probably the biggest headache about getting those items (the actual fights aren't too rough.)  If someone kills one of them while you're fighting the other, you've got another 2 hour wait on your hands.<br />
<br />
Basically, if the 300pp seems worth avoiding the hassle, then you got a good deal.  Entirely depends on your own perspective :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My big concern is getting a head start on the epic. Am I missing faction improvement and some important jewel which will allow me to start the epic? I'm camped at the Nexus, where is a good place to start the epic since I have these items? What is the suggested levels for each leg of the quest?<br />
<br />
I know, I should have posted this under the Quest board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, if its faction you're worried about, then whenever you go see the wolf in ej before you hit CoM for the final raid, check your TrueSpirit faction. It should be ally.  If its not, then go back to the beginning of the quest and do the first part a few times to get your faction up.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this should work.  I have a tear as does another guild mate of mine for two of our up and coming shaman when they decide to do their epics that we will MQ with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no you wont lose any faction.you still have to talk to the spirits to turn the items in.i started the quest with the guy in rathe mtns cause thats where woe and envy are. i started around 35 and i think i was 43ish when i got to the boots. which is also where im stalled now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did the quest up to receiving the Shield of Falsehood in 3 hours one night.  It's very easy.  I was 47 at the time tho.  Only tricky part was the test of patience, and I figured that one out without too much hassle.  <br />
GL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got my Shield of Falsehood at 35.  I spent a couple hours on 2 different nights to do this.  I died once to the paladin that drops Marr's Promise, but that was due to poor strategy on my part.  I was prepared for a couple more deaths during the test of patience, but I got lucky.  45 minutes on the bottom of the ocean was a little nerve-racking though.  Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So without starting at the beggining, I can probably hand in all three items to the wandering spirit in WK and start the epic there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goku999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i think you have to trigger the spirit first the the gem u get after test of patience, and i also think you need the faction (all of it combined gets u enuf) from the parts before it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You'll still need to start at the beginning.  There's just no faction adjustments for killing the mobs in Rathe Mountains that drop the 3 items you bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can get the boots and shield very young, but it can take a while to track down the mobs on the turn-in; they wander a bit over a wide area, and you have to do some traveling.<br />
<br />
Best thing is to get a druid friend to help you out for the evening, as he can help track and do some porting for you.  I had a wizzy friend help me port and find the mobs, and eventually paid some tracker like 50 plat to find the turn-in mob, too.  Well worth it to get the searching over with.</div></div><hr />
