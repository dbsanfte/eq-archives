<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for parses that show how much bane and blood of saryrn get extended by:<br />
<br />
Extended Torment IV - 10%<br />
Focus of Mediocrity - 15%<br />
Timeburn - 20%<br />
Chronoburn - 25%<br />
<br />
Also looking for parses of how much quiescence is extended by:<br />
<br />
Focus of Mediocrity - 15%<br />
Eterninostrum - 20%<br />
Chrononostrum - 25%<br />
<br />
<br />
I ask for these because I was looking back on Henora's parse of EB4 (&quot;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=17104&amp;&quot;) (10% bene) with quiescence, and she got amazingly good results out of it.  I would like to see what the higher level focii do for Q, and if I can expect 2 extra ticks of bane with just ET4 as well.<br />
<br />
If I can get all the information together I will try to compile it in to one manageable thread and hopefully get it stickied in the medicine cabinet - full credit to all who contribute, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What Focus are you getting 2 extra ticks from, Jinheim(on Bane)?<br />
<br />
Or am I reading your post wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on how you count Giac, since Bane is never 4 ticks as it's listed. I have always received an extra tick on bane without any focus affecting the duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Chronoburn - 25% i was always getting random +percentage.  From like to months ago i remeber getting something like anywhere from 28-33 ticks of Ultor.  Bane i seem to always get 7 ticks.  Lucy lists bane as 5 ticks but even naked i always get 6 ticks from it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eterninostrum - 20% always added the full 20% to buffs, mainly only tested avatar but was always the same duration down to the very last second.<br />
<br />
From every thing I have tested the negative effect ones seem to be random percentage and the benifical ones are constant full duration.  The heal over time spells being the exception since the server can count ticks funny some times.  However i never got over 8 ticks with Eterninostrum - 20% or  Chrononostrum - 25%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All DoTs get an extra server side tick, which was put in ,I believe, when they did the mob running at you DoT damage reduction nerf forever and hell back (which they unnerfed eventually), so if you see a DoT is 5 ticks in lucy, it's 6 in game, and 8 is 9, blah blah blah.</div></div><hr />
