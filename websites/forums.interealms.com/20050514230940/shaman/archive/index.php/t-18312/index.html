<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaolian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a disturbing phenomenon occurring on the Everquest servers. It began with Legacy of Yheska. Pop up ads, appearing during log in. The citizens of Norrath found this to be an annoyance, but we collectively shrugged, assuming that Sony would realize those ads interfere with our gameplay and remove them. Eventually they did, and we gave it no more thought.<br />
<br />
Our complacence was a mistake.<br />
<br />
Today we see a new breed of pop up. It appears during log in. when switching characters. Even in game, where we pay for recreation, it assails us with systemwide messages. The Lords of Everquest spam is everywhere, and there seems to be no end in sight.<br />
<br />
No more. <br />
<br />
We have this chance, this one chance to stop this evil from spreading. Citizens of Norrath! Join me in taking a stand against these marketing tactics, and together, we can show Sony that we WILL NOT STAND FOR IT!!!! This is not a balancing issue that most classes of the world can choose to ignore! Like it or not, this is your game. Will you chose to act? Or stand idly by, forever wondering if you could have made a difference as pop up after pop up interrupts your gaming experience?<br />
<br />
You can make a difference!<br />
<br />
On Wednesday, December 10th 2003 at 8pm eastern, 6pm central, and 4pm pacific time, join your fellow players in a serverwide revolt against the pop-ups and in game spam. There are three ways you can help.<br />
<br />
1.	I will be hosting a mass protest on the Bertoxxulous server in the Plane of Knowledge next to the Nexus stone on December 10th 2003 at 8pm eastern, 6pm central, and 4pm pacific time. You are invited and encouraged to create a new character (or bring an existing one!) and join in. The more people we have there, the stronger our position will be. Once we are gathered there, we will proceed to phase 2.<br />
<br />
2.	Even if you can’t make the protest on Bertoxxulous, you can help with this phase. At precisely 8:15 eastern, 6:15 Central and 4:15 pacific time, all protest participants will be asked to /petition the following text:<br />
<br />
“I hereby submit this petition in protest of the Lords of Everquest pop up advertisements and in-game spam. Consider this petition notification that I will not even consider buying Lords of Everquest until the ads are completely removed from Everquest. Thank you”<br />
<br />
If you like, please feel free to add: “p.s. Kaolian sends his regards” <br />
3.	The third and final phase of this protest will be the e-mail campaign. Please send a short message to eqmail@soe.sony.com asking them to remove the pop ups. Please, do not spam them with multiple messages, the goal here is to show them that we will not be ignored, not to knock them off line with a denial of service attack. <br />
<br />
We will be coordinating the protest from this thread at Allakhazams:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=1&amp;mid=1070887539773572461<br />
 Please check back for updated information as it becomes available<br />
<br />
Together, we can reclaim the magic that was Everquest from the hands of corporate greed. Viva la Resistance!!!!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can stop this popup by altering a line in the eqclient.ini file. The line is &quot;LoEPopUpLastView=&lt;number&gt;&quot;. Change the number to something huge - it's a timestamp of when the pop up was last shown, so set it far into the future to fool the program into not showing it.<br />
<br />
Of course this is just a work around and I agree that these popups in general are annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just send the emails. Getting a lot of people into PoK on a single server could cause the zone to crash, which would be an annoyance.  Having those people all petition at the same time will flood the petition queues and only bog downthe legitimate petitions.<br />
<br />
Is it REALLY that bad?  It takes about 1 second to click a button on the screen if the add pops up.  Across many message boards I have seen fixes that will stop the adds from popping up.  Why dont you employ one of those methods and fix your problem instead of pounding your fist against a desk and composing a great spittle covered rant like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steeloak_Grouchiebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, I did what Grippa said a while back...changed the first two numbers to 99...never looked back. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't see what the big deal is either. Yeah it's annoying but it could be worse. They could have little windows pop up while in game with adds for all of Sony's products.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just /bug /feedback and /petition every time they do &lt;SYSTEMWIDESPAM&gt;.  Kinda funny to have a petition hotkey.<br />
<br />
<br />
they spam me, i spam them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hell i think there is a conspiracy to randomly make people go LD while zoning to force LoEQ pop-up adds on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">also to note, if you just click &quot;buy&quot; it will close EQ and open a web browser, close that and eq wont ask you anymore (or at least it hasnt for me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thats what i did jede, someone said they bought then canceled, so i planned on doing that but when it closed eq i just said forget it, altho i've only logged in twice i havn't noticed it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/feedback it, but don't petition.  The guides that pull all the petitions are overworked as it is, to have to sift through 20 new bogus petitions everytime they serverwide the annoucement isn't fair to them.  They have no control over it, but are stuck with the cleanup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For you guys that haven't figured it out yet, this was another barb aimed at the warriors who were getting together and /petitioning at the same time last month to fix their class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Changing the first two digits to 99 in the ini file worked fine for me too.  IMO we should save the protest for something more important that we cant fix ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kaolian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">UPDATE: <br />
<br />
Victory. <br />
<br />
As of at least this morning, the Pop up ad and ingame spam has ceased on all servers. Coincidence? Maybe. Regardless, Sony has acceded to the wishes of the bulk of the players, making our protest somewhat redundant. Therefore, I am calling off the controversial /petition and e-mail campaign. I will still be present in the PoK if anyone wishes to stop by for a victory celebration. Thank you all for your support, and another thanks to those that critiqued the idea for furthering the dialogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The game was released, hence no more reason to pre-order and no more reason to spam the ads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The game was released, hence no more reason to pre-order and no more reason to spam the ads.<br />
<br />
Dont inject any of your logic here!</div></div><hr />

<br />
3/4 of the time i get booted from game I find myself looking at some poll or popup.</div></div><hr />
