<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">FYI about this spell. I have it and think Falino does too. VI in their infinate wisdom chose to make this summoned item use an expensive component. The component is called Quintessence of Knowledge. It is made through alchemy and costs a little over 100pp. It is used up when the talisman is used. Who knows when or if you will be in a position to have to use one of these but just wanted to post the info. The Thurgadin gate potion is cheap and easy to make. Also easy to get to the PoP portal in GD now. If for some crazy reason you are out of the gate potion, and have no Wizard for TL or Druid for a port, then I'd be happy to summon one for you.<br />
<br />
There is also a quest to get this: Small Clockwork Talisman (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16558) . It has 5 charges of a gate spell that also uses the component. It seems to be the first part of a multi step quest.</div></div><hr />
