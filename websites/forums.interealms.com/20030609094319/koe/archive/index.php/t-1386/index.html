<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Truant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Jagged Ice Shard would own if anyone has one laying around. But any decent piercing weapon good for a primary slot rogue.<br />
<br />
Considering that what i'm using currently sucks for primary slot, I need to upgrade pretty fierce.<br />
<br />
I'd be willing to work out payment or a loan policy if anyone is interested in helping out.<br />
<br />
Muchas Gracias<br />
<br />
and remember, <br />
<br />
bok bok often, and bok bok safe!<br />
<br />
<br />
(no idea what that means)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is only one weapon upgrade for your primary that you need bud.. <br />
<br />
It is a nasty 4 letter word, but I think we need to have a party in Kith sometime and if you are not ready for the party, you need to get there and I will help if I can.. :)<br />
<br />
Save your cash.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Truant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone say party? I'm there! ;)<br />
<br />
I am actually at that point. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I do still need to get a Kedge Robe, which is no drop. It can be multied if both people are of non kos to beta nuetral. But I may have one lined up through a RL friend.<br />
<br />
Of course, the robe subquest is assuming that the general doesn't drop the Cazic Quill. Which as i understand there is a 10% chance of him dropping it. Otherwise you do the robe subquest.<br />
<br />
So in closing,<br />
<br />
Piercing weapon to borrow maybe?<br />
Kedge Robe<br />
<br />
If anyone has either and would like to help:<br />
<br />
1. post here<br />
2. PM me<br />
3. Hit me with a tell in game.<br />
4. If you prefer email, hit me with a PM and i'll get you a good email addy.<br />
<br />
Just think. In another 2 bubbles, i get to graduate from Rakedom to BokbokGuard!<br />
<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER<br />
My purpose in writing this is to in NO WAY try and make ANY insinuations to the officers or epic commitee. I know the guild is doing alot with expanding to new zones, recruiting, and raiding, and I support that 100% and attend everything I am able. I simply wanted to upgrade my primary weapon until the time comes that the officers and epic commitee wish to attempt that horrid, vile, ugly General Viagra. I appreciate everything the officers and the commitee have done, and want you all to know that. *hug* :)</div></div><hr />
