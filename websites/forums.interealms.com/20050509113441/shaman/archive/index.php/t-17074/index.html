Kind of like if they had a 1.1 zem before and now it is 0.85...</div></div><hr />

I got the same exp as always.<br />
<br />
Did you experience this in one adventure or in several?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If SoE did do that on purpose, I'm sure it's to try and get SOME people out of the dungeons and back to 'regular' hunting grounds, so they can take a little bit of the load off the ldon servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nah I don't there is a nerf, its just speculation. Also suggestions that there is less cash loot doesn't seem valid either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to get about 75% of a level in one adventure  Of course that was about 7 or 8 levels ago :P.  It's been slowing down drastically over the course of my 30's levels (now level 35, half way done).<br />
<br />
Anyway, last night I was 34, and 63% of the way through the level according to my UI.  Left that adventure clearing it completley with 95% complete.  32% gained eating a chest death btw, no matter how many times you tell people they still don't listen.  But anyway Today went in Level 35 12% in and left with 48%.  So 36% xp recieved, with no deaths this time.  A bit of a loss if I hadn't died the previous night, but not one that seems different to me after leveling as I have been.  Gaining a level puts at least a 5-10% damper on the xp in my 30's it seems, but then again the avg level of groups I'm with changes daily so these numbers are hardly anything but my observation of adventures completed in mistmoore.<br />
<br />
But as you said nothings changed for you. The only question I have then is were you doing Hard adventures before previously?  And grabbed normals today?  Perhaps the lead (if it wasn't you) was taking normals to see how much faster you could chew through them, or to possibly see whats in the chests now that the damage has been reduced (supposedly...really need to play my rogue again and see what kinda damage they do at 57).<br />
<br />
Things are always different higher up though so my numbers may not really mean anything.  But I can't say anything more than my group today was satisifed with xp gained as was I.  And it nobody brought up this fact.<br />
<br />
Haven't seen anybody talking about it at all today actually, and something like this I'd expect to hear complaints about in OOC for sure :P.</div></div><hr />

I can't confirm that this is the case, but last night was the FIRST time I have received less than 2 blues in XP for the dungeon.  I know, because I went in needed exactly 2 blues do ding, and didnt get it.  :P  (Granted I died in the final 10 minutes of the overtime period, but i hadnt received it prior).  On the flip side, our group made over 1800 plat to split (plus 2 aug drops and chain leggings), which was the best money I had ever gotten in MMC.  (And for the record, I'm 20 &amp; 1 in MMC so its not like my first run through).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As for me this was based on 4 adventures done at 63 before the change (got 2.8 2.75 2.8 and 2.7) and 2 adventures done after the change(2.15 2.15)<br />
<br />
Yes I am nearing 64th right now. (Well I am at least over 3 orange into it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did two adventures last night and noticed no difference... Both were collection though so there were more mobs killed than in a slaughter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have the same group as always and I got the same exp as always (9% straight exp on one dungeon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">its hard to do this with anything but AA exp. If you want to claim there is a nerf you would have to do ~100+ trials and then find the average.  Maybe your last two runs through someone was one level under what the other adventures were, maybe you didnt kill as many mobs..lots of variables.<br />
<br />
Also...you mention a certain amount of a blue.  If you want people to believe you, you have to use the UI that displays % gain; otherwise its easy for me to say you just read it wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hate to think they nerfed ldon xp, its already about the worst xp I have available to me.  A mission usually delivers 1/2 bub of aa xp or 1 single tick of orange in main xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Laranu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It seems very strange to me that people complain about the xp gotten in dungeons. On an average I get 50% of an aaxp point per dungeon. At 65 I haven't looked at the regular xp but this seems to me to be very good xp for what effort we're putting into getting the group together and going. Most of the time it's a very simple process and its fun to boot.<br />
<br />
Mindless giant pulling in BoT while good xp is so BORING. I have lots more fun with friends pulling wild trains in LDoN Dungeons, making loads of cash and good xp.</div></div><hr />
