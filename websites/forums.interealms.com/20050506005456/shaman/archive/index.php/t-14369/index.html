<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont know if others have been having a problem with this but I'll put my story here.   <br />
<br />
Yesterday....got a tell for a group, yay!   PoV rc, I hesitated because that camp is almost certain death.  Its only a matter of time before 3,4 maybe 6 mobs come FROM absolutely nowhere come and cream your group.  The problem was not that though.  The problem was we had a 58 clr.   I would think he would be fine,  Ive seen lower in there before.  <br />
<br />
I WAS WRONG!  This guy was a sponge, he always got aggro and could not keep up with heals at all.   There was honestly 5 to 10 mins between each pull. It ended up being one of those groups you leave to go work on tradeskills or something. Complete waiste of time and mana.  I think its great that lower lvls can just walk into pov/pos and not go through the agony some of us did for the trials, but if they want to  hunt there they need to get their act together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't group with them again.  Weed out the trash by not inviting them to groups.  Pretty soon they'll get the hint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is one of the reasons why I'll never go to PoV, without my guild and will think twice before going to BoT or HoH.  If you zone into BoT now, you'll see the &quot;Welcome to KC&quot; sign is crossed out, and under it is written, &quot;Welcome to Unrest.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lol Final. <br />
<br />
As for anyone who thought that removing the flagging process was a good idea: I told you so, I told you so! Bet Torment and Tactics are bursting with refugees of the flood....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know what you mean Final, The other day on the 7th we fended off everyone elses mobs instead of our own.   You dont even need a camp there.  You can get decent exp just picking out a few from the newbs trains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont understand why people dont get the point. I came back because they removed flags. It makes the game fun for me again because I dont have time to plan in EQ. I just log in, find group, and play a while, and maybe raid once a month. But I went to PoV (I'm 59) once. After about 15 minutes of doing good, I got a mob I just couldn't slow. We lost our tank in like 5 seconds. I was like, Ok, it happens. Same thing happened 5 - 10 times. I realized either the tank wasn't high enough level to be there, or I wasn't. But to play it safe, I left and went back to PoN, PoD to finish off 60, then I'll be back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ah, give it time.  Flags sucked in many ways, and were good in some.  It didn't just weed out the &quot;lowbies&quot;, it weeded out the people with too little time to play, or who work odd hours.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it also opened these places up to all the people who can't handle the zone, due to levels, gear, or attitude.  Just like Nightmare when PoP was first out - how many idiot quadders ran right over the zone in?  People who were underpowered for the zone mostly got the hint - and once people get over the newness of the new zones, they should buy a clue as well.</div></div><hr />
