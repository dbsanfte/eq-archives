<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been away from the game for quite awhile and recently started playing again on a casual basis. I decided to buy PoP, as from what I have read the exp is much better. Anyway I was soloing in PoN, but was looking for a partner to ease the boredom of exp grinding. Along comes this 59 ranger who is LFG.  So I ask her to join me.  She laughs and says &quot; I cant tank these mobs&quot;.  I was like what? What do you mean you cant tank them?. She kept saying if she would have to shoot arrows and eventually would get aggro and have to tank the mobs at which point she would die. Either she never grouped with a shammy that had a clue, or she herself was pretty clueless. Guess she never heard of Torpor, or kraggs' or tnargs, or the abilities of our 61 pet.<br />
<br />
So just to show her that her fears were groundless, I pulled one of the spiders and tanked it the whole time and still ended up the fight at 55% mana and full health.  I didnt even canni, I just epic dotted, threw on a BoN or two and melee'd with my pet. I figured if she saw that I could tank them, it might open her eyes a bit to what she might be able to do.......didnt work lol. She just ran off in a hurry.<br />
<br />
Now I have never played a ranger and I rarely ever duo'd with one, but geez they cant be any worse of a tank than our pet. I dont know if she just bought all the talk of rangers being &quot;paper tanks&quot;, or if she really felt the mobs would tear her up. I cannot believe that rangers are that poor at taking dmg that they would be afraid of GY trash which I can solo and end with 80-90% mana.  I know they dont have the defense or AC of plate tanks but c'mon, are rangers that underpowered? Especially when grouped with  a shammy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rangers got their defense cap raised awhile back. That would have helped a bit.<br />
<br />
They should be able to tank PoI/PoN/PoD mobs slowed but PoV Golems/etc in the desert would decimate them (unless they were super-uber and full buffed).<br />
<br />
I doubt any ranger could tank BoT or other 3rd Tier planes (no cheating and sticking them in a group with 5 clerics/druids!).<br />
(Well ok.... there is always some exception, no doubt some Ranjah in full VT gear/Elemental armor /ROFL).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Reality until they get the defensive AA's (combat agility and combat stability).  Those go a long way in making them decent tanks in Tier 2 zones.  Guildmate ranger with over 70 aa's is a better tank than some warriors I've grouped with.  But don't forget, level &gt; all in EQ.  This can not be stressed enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Our 61 pet is level 58 corect?  I dont know what its HP are, but they cant be more than a halfway decently equipped ranger.  Plus our pet hits for what? 60 max without weapons?.  If I have zero problems keeping him alive, why in the world would a ranger be afraid to duo with me? I mean we are talking about mobs that dont summon, hit for 250ish max. that is a cake mob in my book.  I realize Rangers can't tank the hard mobs, but I am talking regular exp group mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are correct on our 61 pet.  I don't it's hps either but comparing said ranger to our pet, you have to take into account the ranger's AC.  If the ranger's AC is rather low, they won't be able tank anything in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 61 and just a couple Defensive AAs, I was holding my own in PoI, PoD, and PoN but that slow is essential! Now, with a few gear upgrades and a few AAs spent, tanking Tier 1 tanking is a piece of cake.If the ranger in question had Archery Mastery 2, you are better off tanking/letting dogdog tank(lvl61pet) and letting her shoot. If she had a decent bow and AM2, she will have better DPS than if she were to melee. But at lvl 59 I doubt she had AM2+, its possible, but most rangers go to 60 before working in Class AAs.  <br />
<br />
The few times I ended up tanking in BoT(MA went down) I took alot of damage fast and the heals had to keep pouring in. I haven't been back sice I picked up Combat agility 3 and Lightning reflexes 1, but Im looking forward to seeing how well I fair with them now.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Re-read the 1st post.<br />
Unless she is WELL equiped at 59, the yard trash would tear her up. After seeing you tank... there is no reason why she should have ran off like that. She could have at least tried it once, you could have allways stepped in and tanked if things were going bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shammylammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As a 57 Ranger who just started a Shammy (lvl 22 now, a young-un), I must defend my class!<br />
<br />
We can, and I have, tanked very efficiently in Tier 1 planes.  I tanked the other day in PoI for hours, and I have had no problems tanking in both PoN and PoD, although both were brief.  I have decent gear, by no means uber.  Although, I must note, everytime I tanked it was with a full group.  But in PoI, I could tank extremely well, sometimes going as long as two fights without a CH.<br />
<br />
The main component to a Ranger tanking, however, is a slower.  And my favorite slowers are Shammys  ;)   (although I did tank an archaic, but it was a bit scary)  But when you land a snare/arrow/flame lick before the mob gets back to camp, the Shammy can slow immediately, with no chance of aggro.  The whole reason I'm leveling my shammy is so I can duo in the planes.  A Ranger/Shammy duo makes me drool...<br />
<br />
So yes, Rangers can tank.  And yes, that other Ranger was clueless.  And no, we're not the best tanks, but when played correctly, we do quite a nice job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rangers nowadays can tank old world (ie original EQ, kunark, and velious) non-boss mobs pretty well. They can tank half decently in Tier 1 zones, but tier 2+ zones they can't do much at all. As someone mentioned above, defensive AA's go a long way towards helping a ranger tank, but nowadays it's pretty rare that you find a ranger with maxxed defensive AA's since their offensive AA's are so much more potent. You need to group with a ranger with, I'm guessing here, about 75+ AA's to start getting some with defensive AA's. Just as a shamans AA path is pretty much run3 / regen3 / MC3 / canni5, a ranger is run3 / regen3 / AM3 / EQ, which eats up a lot of AA's. Then most rangers tend to go for things like melee crits, SC fury, natural durability and healing gift, rather than defensive AA's because they know that they're in dire straits indeed if they need to tank a mob.<br />
<br />
edit: I suppose natural durability might be considered a defensive AA, but I don't look at it that way. ND 3 on a ranger would give about 400? hp (correct me if I'm wrong), which isn't even 1 hit from tier 2 + mobs. Most rangers with ND3 that I know bought it because it allows them to withstand AE's during ubermob encounters rather than helping them tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rangers can tank just fine all the way to tier 3 as long as their defensive AA skills have been used.  Many rangers listen to the 'attack is everything!' philosophy a bit too much and put everything into offensive skills while letting their defensive skills lack.  That coupled with equipment choices will make a poor tank.<br />
<br />
I've always tailored my ranger to be a defensive ranger first, offensive second.  As long as a mob doesn't hit for over 1000 a pop, a decently equipped and AA'd level 65 ranger should be able to tank it.  Granted it won't be as easy as a warrior tanking the mob but it sure won't bounce around to casters either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had more HP than one of the rangers in my old guild for a while that was the same level. But boy, was her atk really high!<br />
<br />
Attitude and gear has a lot to do with it, just like a necro that pulls. 97% of necros won't try it, but there's 3% that make monks look bad. A ranger with the right gear can do a lot of damage and still take a few hits. AAs help, of course. But no ranger should ever be a worse tank than you at the same level-- their defense and dodge skills are signifcantly higher than ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I 2box with my 55 ranger tanking in tier 1 planes all the time, never had any probs, he needs 1 or 2 Cheals per round. I normally end a fight at fm/fh and top off the rangers hp with a quick stoicism.<br />
Ranger pulls with snare, i slow asap and send in dog, wait till ranger has enough aggro and dot the mob with Pox/Bane.  Works ok for me.<br />
I doubt my ranger can tank in PoD Cy atm his gear is bad, but Yard trash is no problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I myself have no trouble tanking in PoN slowed, even done it unslowed on a couple of instances though decent healer as pre-requisite.

Not sure about teir 2 etc first hand but I've read a lot of folks who say they have no prob tanking in a lot of teir 2 situations too from the Ranger Glade /shrug.<br />
Sounds just to me like a poor example of a ranger personally.<br />
<br />
In response to the post topic, &quot;Rangers=Paper Tanks...Attitude or reality?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's attitude my friend, rangers are not that bad of tanks anymore.  Our defense used to be 200 ages ago (mega sux) but it is in fact 240 currently for those still unknowing of the truth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Attitude and knowlege of the game.  There is one ranger in my guild who knows the game inside and out and has equipped his character well (3500 hp unbuffed for a non uber ranger), he tanks just fine and can hold agro much better than any warrior.  I would imagine most have a lot less hp than that (still talking non uber which most players are), in the middle 2k range.<br />
<br />
However I have run into many other rangers that cannot tank and will not tank and many that when I ask them 'can you be main tank?' they reply with 'never tried'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I kind of figured it was more about the &quot;attitude&quot; than a reality of the game.  I think sometimes folks listen to what others tell them they can and cannot do too much, instead of just going out and doing. Seems to me it would be pretty boring to be pigeonholed into doing the exact same thing in every group you are in.  There are always idiots disparaging the abilities of other classes, but that doesnt mean we have to heed what they have to say.  <br />
<br />
I have always felt that any plate or chain class could in theory act as a main tank in an exp group given the right make-up of the rest of the group, but have never done so because its not what their class is &quot;supposed&quot; to do. <br />
<br />
I wasn't aware of the increase in the defense cap, but I am glad Rangers got an increase in that area. I never understood why their defense skill would be the same as priests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">disagree ,ac parse have show that ac have quasi no effect.They should prefer HP.<br />
<br />
The man has it right, I've noticed ac means very little in PoP, most stuff just hits near max most of the time.  <br />
<br />
And to answer your question, no rangers cannot tank PoN effectively, especially duo with a shaman, because many of the yard trash spiders and treants will resist slow 40% of the time, and you will be hard pressed to keep a 3000 hp ranger alive when a 330 hitting trash mob is mauling him.<br />
<br />
If the ranger has Virtue he can tank by means of shear hit points, but otherwise rangers can't mitigate well, they are not a plate class.<br />
<br />
The Ranger class is still the bastard of EQ, especially in PoP.  Unless they have 45 AA, they have no role, therefore they are not desired.  Same can be said for druids, wizards, mages.  Only difference is that druids and wizards can solo well, rangers and mages cannot.  By the way I play a 62 ranger, 61 shaman, and unless it's a guild group my ranger hardly plays anymore.  Lately I've been camping him in Skyfire to see if guardian wurms are up, otherwise it's not worth the time trying to get him a group.  I've been thinking of deleveling him back to 60 to work on AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think rangers are still suffering from the &quot;ranger down!&quot; mentality that came around after Kunark. Rangers now are not the fragile, easily killed beasts they were then, if the ranger has half a clue, he/she can be a semi-decent tank.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the rangers are their own worse enemies. I think half of them still believe their class is weak. However, a reasonably equipped non-uber ranger can do a passable job as tank, and can take or shed agro as they require, which makes them a great secondary tank - enchanter gets agro, ranger takes it back until the warrior can taunt it off the ranger.<br />
<br />
I play 61 ranger and 58 shaman. I'm playing the shaman much more than the ranger these days, but that's mostly because of a shortage of shamans in my guild.<br />
<br />
As a ranger, my feelings about being main group tank (tier 1 only) are very similar to my feelings as a shaman about being main healer - I *can* do it at a pinch, but I'd rather not have to. As a ranger, I'd rather have a plate class tank, as a shaman, I'd rather have a cleric or druid heal. Both are more efficient. But if I have to, or if we can't find one of those - I can do it, and will do it to the best of my abilities.<br />
<br />
I find it better to be getting slow experience while waiting for a cleric/tank to be LFG than getting none because &quot;rangers can't tank&quot; or &quot;shamans can't heal&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do get fed up with people being down on rangers for being so easily killed - it's not true any more, but you still hear the jokes, and it still affects a rangers chances to get into groups.<br />
<br />
My favourite duo with either class is still shaman/ranger though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gooshemz I'd strongly disagree with your pesimistic view and your assesment of the class.  I'd think it funny as hell if at 57 I tank better than your 62 ranger /shrug.  As I've stated I've never found it very difficult MA'ing in teir one zones myself expecially with a slower....and 40% of the time resists and you have a 58 shaman that doesn't sound right to me.<br />
<br />
At 57 just self buffed I have 2700+hp add on shaman and or druid buffs and i&quot;m over or around 3500, and if group is lucky enough to have a cleric 4k-4500hp easy /shrug I think your 3k estimate is more a worst case senario /shrug.</div></div><hr />

Oh that's nothing, wait till you get flagged for Tier2 and try to find a group in PoV.  You won't need my pessimism because you'll be knee-deep in your own.</div></div><hr />

Thats right, not 1.  In fact the only spell I have had resisted at all is root, very occasionally.  Pox, BoN, slow, cripple, JBB have all stuck with no problem.  The GY trash ( all solid blue) are some of the least resistant mobs I have ever seen. You could write that off to luck, but 40% resists on slows is a fallacy, at least at my level. <br />
PoV/PoS may be another matter, but PoN is very easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Keep in mind that Gooshemz is giving the viewpoint of a ranger that appears to be in the 'poor gear, poor player, no one wants to group with me *cry*' category.  A well played and well equipped ranger doesn't perform as bad as he appears to be saying he performs.<br />
<br />
The 'ranger down!' stuff that came about with Kunark is due to two things:<br />
<br />
1) The 'uber guilders' and their fanboys advocating AC as the #1 stat back then.<br />
<br />
2) Clerics and healers that had the attitude 'If they're not a warrior, I ain't healing them!'<br />
<br />
3) The extremely poor itemization for chain classes.  There really weren't very many nice HP items.<br />
<br />
Nowadays most people are smart enough to know that AC is pretty much meaningless and HP/Stamina are really the number one stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I grouped my shaman in PoN from 53-60, I'd say trash spiders resist 1/3 on slow, maybe a tad more.  Hence my 40% number.</div></div><hr />

The more the better and sometimes I am lucky enough to three or four in a group.  Tier 2 and 3 they can tank just fine, with only a shammie as a healer and get an AA an hour in a full group. Spells, equipment, AA all help but what makes the biggest different is a two handed weapon.  Duel wielding tanks have got to go when they are in front of a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Gooshemz,<br />
<br />
just a remark, no pun intended.<br />
<br />
Maybe at 53 you get resist troubles there (don't know, i started there with 57 i think). At 57-58 the 40 (or 30) percent is simply not true. I would suggest, you state your level, when you talk about resists - as this has the highest influence on your data.<br />
<br />
At 57 i think (as far as i can remember  :) ), resists were like 15-20 percent without any try of maloxxxx, and as others have said already, i would do maloxxxx on most of PoP-mobs (depends on level of course). After maloxxxx resists dropped to near Zero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">While i was lvl60 and 61 I tanked PoD, PoI Factory, PoN, etc w/o a problem.  In PoV I've tanked the Inner Cave camp and never needed a CHeal.  Havn't had to tank HoH or BoT yet though.  There is 1 key that makes it easier for a ranger to tank and that is using a 2hs rather then dual weld.  When i siwtched from duel weld to a 2hs (weighty polearm then windblade, now keep a widebladed greatsword bagged for tanking now that i have AM3) I took 50% less damage due to the decrease in reposte damage.<br />
<br />
And I'd like to know where in tier2/3 you can do a AA in a hour.  Best i've done is 1:45 at Inner camp and even then we were ahead of the spawns.  Seems most places the spawns dry up rather then having low DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">In Plane of Valor last night I was enchanter slowed mobs with no problem. I have no defensive AA's yet and was at 5K HP.<br />

Pit in tactics if you are the only group there.<br />
Wastelands in PoV, if there only one or two other groups there.<br />
Lots of places in HoH, just not the basements.<br />
Lots of places in BoT, south and west are good.<br />
<br />
You need a few things to do this, five damage dealers and a shaman, (sk, necro, 3x rangers for example) a high density of mobs, and a very good puller (ranger).  Basically as soon as one mob falls there is another right there.  Kill times are consistently under 45 seconds.</div></div><hr />

I have been adding the defensive AA's along with a mix of combat Aa's to my ranger though and it does seem to help.  I refuse however to tank most stuff in zones like PON and POD due to the fact that it hits way hard and the resulting downtime while duoing is not worth it.

<br />
That's a pretty ignorant thing to say Chromite.  My ac is around 1150 self-buffed and I was leading raids for my guild 2 years ago, so you're &quot;poor gear, poor player&quot; comment is incorrect.  And...just because you're awarded great gear by your guild does not make you a great player.  <br />
<br />
Rangers don't get groups because they have no role pre-45 AA, period.  As long as rangers continue to have this delusion about how wonderful they are and how they can tank (tanking slowed mobs with maximum point buffs on doesn't count, a mage could do this) and how they are such great damage dealers (they are 3rd rate, sometimes 4th) then the class will be stuck in LFG hell for as long as Everquest is around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Gear, level, and skill of player are the three determining factors.<br />
<br />
Rangers are and never were meant to be MTs.  They are meant to be supplemental damage dealers (as far as DPS goes, they are right up there with monks and rogues).  Can they step up and MT in a pinch?  Under the right conditions, yes (most notably, a shaman and cleric being present).<br />
Can they do it as efficiently as a warrior or plate tank of similar quality?  No, nor were they ever meant to.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Rangers don't get groups because they have no role pre-45 AA, period.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes they do, as DPS.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as rangers continue to have this delusion about how wonderful they are and how they can tank (tanking slowed mobs with maximum point buffs on doesn't count, a mage could do this)&quot;<br />
<br />
It's hardly a delusion.  And I'd love to see a mage try to out-tank a ranger.<br />
<br />
&quot;and how they are such great damage dealers (they are 3rd rate, sometimes 4th) then the class will be stuck in LFG hell for as long as Everquest is around.&quot;<br />
<br />
They are second only to monks and rogues in terms of DPS, and I believe rangers can even surpass rogues in that respect with the proper archery AA.<br />
And personally I feel rangers are great to round out groups.  Just so many people can't let go of the pre-Hybrid fix days, and are still stuck in the &quot;warrior, cleric, chanter or nothing at all&quot; mentality. <br />

You need a few things to do this, five damage dealers and a shaman, (sk, necro, 3x rangers for example) a high density of mobs, and a very good puller (ranger).  Basically as soon as one mob falls there is another right there.  Kill times are consistently under 45 seconds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">And...just because you're awarded great gear by your guild does not make you a great player.  <br />
<br />
<br />
My guild isn't a raiding guild.  It's a family guild.<br />
<br />
Every single piece of armor I am wearing on my ranger I scraped and fought for by leading 1 group encounters with my friends, questing for them or leading small raids.  Some pieces were obtained by a large amount of people due to me and my friends having to scrape, claw and fight with the political powers that I used to raid with to get some sort of recognitition for the effort I and my friends put out for them.  Those that know me on my server know that I put out 200% if I'm ever in a raid or a group.  Unfortunately that isn't awarded by some folks and is just one of the many reasons why I do not 'raid' anymore.<br />
<br />
Joining an uber or large AE tag type guild is not a choice for me because I don't like to be associated with the folks that end up in those guilds.<br />
<br />
Many times I can recognize a good player by the care and nurturing they give their character.  That is, seeing the quested items they have, seeing how they are with their gear choices.  Granted thats not the only way you can recognize skills but it's just one of the ways.<br />
<br />
Rangers don't get groups because they have no role pre-45 AA, period. As long as rangers continue to have this delusion about how wonderful they are and how they can tank (tanking slowed mobs with maximum point buffs on doesn't count, a mage could do this) and how they are such great damage dealers (they are 3rd rate, sometimes 4th) then the class will be stuck in LFG hell for as long as Everquest is around.<br />
<br />
This just shows your skills and knowledge about rangers and why you have problems getting groups.  While the rangers like you sit on the sidelines whining about how much they suck, others excel and play just fine with or without archery AAs.<br />

Yup.  The shaman is doing all the direct healing along with malos\slow.  Regen, speed, avatar on everyone, along with driving the doggy.  MT pretty much has Q on them constantly.

The tank can easily last one resisted slow and two is not much of a problem.

The fact that you would equate LFG with the caliber of player speaks volumes about your ignorance.  I can log my 61 shaman on and have a group in tier2 in 10 minutes, you know what?  I'm not even a good shaman LOL, I have zero AA and no Malo, it does'nt matter, groups need me.  I can log my 62 ranger on and go LFG in tier2 for 6 hours straight.  Why?  Because nobody needs a ranger.  That pretty much blows your theory out of the water doesn't it?<br />
<br />
It's not your skill man, it's your class, get over it.  Then the 95% of rangers without 45 AA can get a group.  Get off your pedestal for a minute, admit that rangers are good for nothing and maybe SOE will throw you a bone and give rangers a reason to get invited to a group.</div></div><hr />

Rangers rock. But they are a square peg. Dont slam them into a round hole.<br />
<br />
If you want to tank a 1000+ hitter properly get a warrior. If you want to hold aggro like no class in the game Get a shadowknight. If you want a defensive tank with HEals and such get a paladin. If you want your casters to all be flush with mana while still having good dmage output get a BEastlord. If you want A higher attack the ability to snare safely, Either meele damage ranged damge and the ability to gain or shed aggro for positioning on a dime Get a ranger. All while Maintaining good damage. If you want a Bard Get your head examined. (Kidding bards are amazing Jack of all trades)..<br />
<br />
And So on. All classes have strengths and weaknesses. And at different points and locations through the game they all can shine or grow dull and listless.<br />

What you do is up to you. But classifying rangers as crappy just cause. Well that is foolish. It is not an easy class to play to its full potential. And when you are Cybering with 32 people watching TV and Listening to music all at once. Sure you are gonna suck.<br />

Unei is very right that a ranger with a good 2H weapon may be a bit more effective to avoid all the riposte damage/enrage damage PoP mobs deal, but that does require a ranger with a good alternate haste item, which most at that level don't have.<br />
<br />
A ranger is not a warrior in tanking terms, which ought to be obvious to most.  Ergo, you simply start the heals a bit sooner, and be careful not to engage until the mob is slowed.  But ranger dps is very good, so it balances out.  Pull, root, debuff and engage.  If you pull and engage an unslowed mob, you are asking for trouble.  <br />
<br />
And the ranger needs to be smart about when to root/snare and back off to give the shaman some time, and also to pay attention for enrage.  <br />
<br />
Rangers are hardly broken.  A shaman/ranger combo in PoN is great.</div></div><hr />

Pardon me while I laugh my ass off here. A ranger with proper aa skills and a good bow will deal more damage than any class in the game right now. Even with out the aa's they will outdamage warriors in regular melee with comparable weapons.<br />
<br />
As far as tanking goes with slowed mobs almost any one can tank. Yes gear and aa choices can have a big influence on how well they do it. We may joke about it with the rangers in the guild but they can take a beating, they dish out great damage and have some useful spells to boot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nigguh puhhhhhhhhhhhleeez.<br />
<br />
Lets put it this way, I can tank regular tactics mobs just fine, in my usual group setup I am CC and frequently my means of CC = Tanking them simply because there isnt room to root park without causing further adds.<br />
<br />
Now lets have a quick look at the defensive differences between myself and a wizard.<br />
<br />
Oooh nope, no parry, no block, no riposte either!  And /le gaspe, we both have the same dodge cap.<br />
<br />
The only *INATE* difference is around 10% hps and our AC, and lets face it, my defensive AA's are doing far more than my AC is against stuff in tactics, everything else = equipment.<br />
<br />
So its simple, a wizard with sufficient hps could tank just fine providing they could keep agro without running themselves oom after a few mobs (Probably using snare for taunt).  Still think its idiotic?  You need to learn the mechanics of EQ better, I'll see if I can talk one of our wizards into a little testing if the need arrises =)<br />
<br />
If you still don't think its workable, try putting some thoughts down as to why rather than just being a condesending idiot =P</div></div><hr />

My shaman at 59 was in Cazic Thule duoing with a 65 wizard.  He would pull a lizard and I slowed, and he used his epic, then would recast it when when it wore out (900 pt damage absorb I believe).  He hardly took any damage and the stuff was dropping fast with him casting big nukes.  I barely had to heal him at all with regen on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sorry to inform you that you are wrong. As a moderatly well equiped lvl 62 ranger (I have eq/am3 but I dont advertise it when lfg) I hardly ever wait longer than 30 minutes for a group. A good (good = skillful, doesnt have to have uber equip) ranger can pull in teir 2 better than many monks, and can tank/offtank nearly everything as well. Also, if you are getting outdamaged by a warrior you are retarded (and you should be having about monk dps w/ spell damage). The reason I hardly ever have to go lfg for long is because people remember a good ranger. This may sound silly, but its true. If you have an exceptional cleric in your group, you dont notice it that much because you expect the cleric to do well. If you have an exceptional ranger in your group (not the ones that just sit behind the mob and hit /assist), you are like &quot;Wow, never expected them to be that versatile&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Reality here is that most groups will have a dedicated healer in them because it is difficult for the shaman to do both roles in tier3 grps.

<br />
Shaman can do both roles, it is just slower.  I have seen all the 65 spells for sell before, but that does not mean they are easy to get or everyone has them now.  Far from it.  I payed 85k for Q, and more then worth it.  Shaman power goes up greatly with just this spell.  Avatar and Q make a group go fast.  Without them things just slow down, but are still very doable.  My groups are the same before and after Q\Avatar.  Kill rate is the only change, not the fun or risk.  Maybe it is difficult but difficult does not mean it cannot be done.  Difficult for example is keeping avatar on five melee for three hours straight.  Shaman can be the only healer in a PoEarth group for example, but it is not going to chain kill stuff like when a cleric is there.<br />
<br />
But I do agree 1 hour per aa is something most people will not see.  It requires good equipment for DPS, some 65 spells, and the most important thing, lots and lots of practice.  People do not talk on the phone, do five minute RR afks, or watch TV.  Everyone has to be attentive, flexible, and aware of the situations all the time.  If not efficiency does down and people get killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">And to answer your question, no rangers cannot tank PoN effectively, especially duo with a shaman, because many of the yard trash spiders and treants will resist slow 40% of the time, and you will be hard pressed to keep a 3000 hp ranger alive when a 330 hitting trash mob is mauling him. <br />
<br />
You, sir, are just plain incorrect.  I started slowing in PoN early 47th level  (yes, you read that right, 47th), and I have very few problems on spiders, ravens, treants, banshees, and wraiths.  I draw stares of amazement as the ranger (yes, our MT and puller was a ranger - high 50s) pulled with snare.  I simply cast Malaisement (because I'm low level, remember?) when it's on the way in, and then I cast Togor's Insects.  It then runs straight over to me hits me twice, and stands there looking at me while the ranger taunts.  After a couple rounds, the ranger gets aggro, and I am at 80% health.  I cast VoS on it, toss a cripple on it just to see if I can steal aggro again (never have yet -- rangers taunt well), then I sit and med (yes, I sit - no horse yet).  So, if you'd like to dispel your pessimism, come on over to the Rathe and do a lookup on Eriadoc, Eriadocc, or the shaman, Lizeriadoc, and I will be more than happy to demonstrate for you.  Granted, I am with a full group of mid-to-high 50's, but your claim about 40% slow resists is just plain wrong.  In fact, I'd say it's between 5% and 10% at my level (now 48), and the groups I've been in haven't had a close call yet, with constant pulls.  At any rate, my experience definitely demonstrates how rangers can and do tank regular XP mobs in PoN.  I can't speak for anything else, and I'd say Tier2 will definitely present more of a problem, but clearly PoN is not a problem for a ranger with a slowed mob.</div></div><hr />

When I tank stuff, unless its PoTactics or higher, I generally don't need much additional healing at all (thx torpor/ca/lr/scrm + the occasional self TM), does that mean I'm not 'really' tanking even when I'm occasionally tanking full time for groups when we haven't had a proper plate tank floating about?<br />
<br />

<br />
The whole point of having a tank is to stay alive until slow lands, this is where ac, mitigation, defense, parry, riposte, hit points and especially AA abilitites come into play.  Once slowed, most mobs become trivial, even ones that hit for 1400.<br />

<br />
And your comment is completely irrelevant because I didn't just roll up a ranger with all those skills.  I earned them over time.  When PoP first came out I had something like maybe 70ish AAs I think.  I hadn't maxed all my defensive skill AAs but I had maybe trained them 1 level or more.  And you're right, most rangers don't invest in those skills because they choose to go the ATK/etc. route which makes them less effective at tanking.  What I've been saying all along is that a ranger who chooses their gear wisely and rounds their character out skillwise has no problem tanking in the zones being discussed.<br />
<br />
My tanking ability IS relevant because one of the things being discussed was that rangers couldn't tank in Tier 3.  And I am living proof they can.<br />
<br />
Level 60ish Rangers in tier 1 POP are NOT going to be able to tank EFFICIENTLY.  Sure, they can tank a slowed mob, they can tank in a pinch in a duo of small group, but its not EFFICIENT.<br />

It's not efficient for a mob to pong all over the place off a warrior either making the cleric waste mana healing chanters, wizards, etc..  Big deal.  In each case for each of the classes you give something up.  It's why people should have an open mind as to what classes they let into a group.  Doesn't really matter because you can make it work with all of them with pentalties in different areas depending on the class and skill of the players.<br />

Once a Ranger has hit level 65 and invested time into 150+ AA points??  Sure....tehn they can tank in tier 1 POP...but they won't get much EXP doing it.<br />
;)<br />
<br />
Any ranger that levels to 65 first is really taking a route I don't recommend.  I recommend to most rangers to hover at 60 for a while gaining AAs and learning zones.  Those that do the East Commons -&gt; North Ro -&gt; Oasis -&gt; High Keep -&gt; Overthere -&gt; Dreadlands -&gt; Velketor's -&gt; Plane of Nightmares/Plane of Justice -&gt; Plane of Valor route miss out on a lot of content, learning opportunities and skills.  Most rangers taking this route are the ones in large guilds where it doesn't much matter what their skills are.  They just show up, listen to the raid leader and get free loot.<br />
<br />
And once again, I and others in the thread still are putting the point across that in Tier 1 rangers can tank just fine as long as they know their class and wear decent gear.<br />
