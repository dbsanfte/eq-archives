<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How usefull is FT? Both in general and for a shaman in particular.<br />
<br />
I can understand that max FT is a lot better than no FT at all. But how do I weigh it in on a per points basis? This isn't in regard to auguments but rather choices on normal equipment. It is also for equipment that don't tend to have all stats on them like high end raid stuff. When I see FT it is always a trade off.<br />
<br />
I.e. How many HP can a lose to gain FT 1. How much AC etc.<br />
Can I afford to lose 20 AC to add FT1? 100 AC for FT4?<br />
<br />
I have a hard time convincing myself that FT is all that usefull. Compared to KEI and Canni it seems it wouldn't add much. Is this true or is FT really good?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Flowing thought is OK, it's always there and always on. I value focus items more and wouldn't consider losing a lot of hp for flowing thought. AC on the other hand seems to be unimportant after 1100 or so.<br />
<br />
I think with Canni 5, SCM and a mana pres 4 item any shaman should be able to do well enough without sacrificing gear for flowing thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i agree, i wouldn't sacrifice much for FT... on the other hand, after getting Ext Blessing IV and Spell Haste IV from LDON, I will be working on maxing FT through Augments - which will require some type3 slotted armor too, so its a long term goal of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got basically all my FT on &quot;accident&quot; i guess you'd call it.  Just happened to be on items I mainly wanted for focus/stats.  Having been over the 15+MC3 cap for quite some time.  It's really benefical.  Especially if you are on a horse.  I never have to cann4 anymore...by time i need mana cann5 is most of the time up and ready (even on boss fights chain healing).<br />
<br />
Sacrificing isn't really needed.  Eventually, hopefully, you can get it on gear as you get newer items that have kick ass stats. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You'll sacrifice focuses more than hp/etc.  The hardest thing for me with FT is finding a strong balance of FT and still allowing me to get other focuses I want - improved healing, mana pres, EE, spellhaste, cold DD focus etc.<br />
<br />
If you ever have the chance, I highly highly highly recommend Aten's neck.  Sure there are better necks out there now (more hps anyways) but having FT8 on one slot is fantastic for me.<br />
<br />
Just plan out which focuses you want and try to fill in the rest of your slots with FT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">FT is never a stat i looked for in an item, its always been the STA/HPts, FT is an added bonus, and it is nice, i do notice a big difference in mana regen now with my FT maxxed.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you ever have the chance, I highly highly highly recommend Aten's neck. Sure there are better necks out there now (more hps anyways) but having FT8 on one slot is fantastic for me. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yup, that +aten bp = capped ft  and only 2 slots taken up :)  Not to mention the wicked resists (if they matter to you).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would put focus effects, hp, mana, and even resists to a certain extent above FT when looking to fill a slot.  FT is much more impactful for those poor classes that can't just push a button to get mana back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Doing some very simplified approach here:<br />
FT15 equals 2 casts of Can4 per minute, or 300 HP that you won't have when you need them.  That makes  one FT equal to about 20 HP.<br />
On the other hand it also means a savings of 2 less casts of can4, about 10 sec per minute, that you save.  And that can be important when you are chain  casting heals and can squeeze just one more cast out before you have to hit that canni button.<br />
Since most FT items have decent HP to boot I usually pick FT over HP.  Once you get VT/elemental/time gear, where there is actually a massive trade-off, you will cap FT fast with a few peices anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wouldn't be concerned about FT very much.  Stay focused on Focus items that are relavent to you.  There are plenty of FT items that we can use out there that you'll eventually run across if you contine to progress through the game.<br />
<br />
If you are basically stopping your progression in LDon though, you may want to take a closer look at your equip.  FT is nice at times but our class doesn't absolutely need like wizards and clerics do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Instead of determining how much mana FT 15 gives you or how many fewer canibilize 4 casts you have to do, just remember that KEI = FT 14... <br />
<br />
so if you have FT15, its like you have a constant KEI ... to me that rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the question is sort of rhetorical..there are very few FT pieces that you will stop and think, &quot;Hmm..this is FT2 and i could give up 80hp and...&quot;  There are a few pieces (like the FT1 mask thats droppable and i think the other is a belt of some sort) where they have FT and basically nothing else, and i'd recommend against these items as you sacrifice a LOT to get a little.<br />
<br />
If you want to know what i think...FT1 to me is about 50 hp so when comparing gear thats the estimate i use.  Its completely arbitrary and irrelevant though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shaman = Priest = main focus on casting spells not meleeing.  Anything that improves casting is good.  FT is great.  I have FT15 and MC3 and I love it.  My personal balance when I was evaluating kit was FT1 = 50hp - although I have pretty good kit all in all these days and don't need to think about FT any more (Talisman of Vah Kerrath and Torch of Aten Ha Ra).  <br />
<br />
I don't have to canni4 anything like as much to stay at/near FM - nice to rest the Canni finger after all this time.  When healing for elemental minis as an example I can chain cast Tnargs on the MA (or Rampage Tank) throughout the whole fight because of my superior mana regen (obviously using CanniV when it pops and I am on 80% or less mana).  <br />
<br />
When we are casting spells (other than Canni4) we have exactly the same mana regen as other casters, and when you are a principal patch healer on elemental minis/gods you don't have time to Canni4.  The MA (or rampage tank) needs healing constantly.  <br />
<br />
Do the math assuming that you have max spell haste and a healing4 item, (ignoring healing AA, heaing focus' as they affect both equally and thus the results scale to each other) and stuff like that and compare alternating Tnargs/Canni4 with chain casting Kraggs.  <br />
<br />
Tnargs = 2.85 + 2.25 (recast) = 5.1 seconds = 1300 + 10% from IH4<br />
Canni4 = 2.25 + 2.25 (recast) = 4.5 seconds<br />
=148dps of healing<br />
<br />
Kraggs = 10 + 2.25 (recast) = 12.25 = 1950<br />
=159dps of healing<br />
<br />
Kraggs is a better heal. and kraggs only costs 400 as opposed to 450 for tnargs.<br />
<br />
Now drop out the canni4 and just chain tnargs = 280dps of healing.  That's a shag load more than Kraggs, almost double.  <br />
<br />
Mana Regen and Mana Pool = king for this kind of thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For other casting classes, FT affects how effective they can be.  For shaman, FT affects how lazy we can be.  I like to slack as much as the next guy, but I don't think I'd trade off anything that matters, like hp, for any amount of FT, especially given that the cap is still 15.  I have much bigger problems getting the mana out fast enough than I do generating it in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the responses. No, I will never get the type of items where FT is just an added bonues to otherwise great stats (with some exceptions). EQ is not about raiding for me (personal choice). Just wish SOE didn't mandate it :(<br />
<br />
People seems to be a bit split on the hp versus FT thing. How about AC? Is it worth to go from say 910 AC to 900 AC to gain FT4? (AC allready beeing one of my worst stats) Seems to me it might as I would be hard pressed to get my AC over 1000 even if I went that route.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I like FT, I like being lazy, so I don't cast canni4 much unless after heavy mana usage; I will take FT item it as long as it have top HP on it. yes, every good FT item have good hp anyway<br />
<br />
I also like Focus effect, especial some top effect; example: I take VT crown over element helm for effect<br />
<br />
HP, I use to care it most when I don't have good hp gear, I don't really care about hp now, it is not really much difference between 6.3k or 7k buffed; every  item from raid come with good HP anyway, I will look at if that item have good effect/ac/stat as bonus<br />
<br />
AC , I almost forget it since PoP release; I will take what it have from a good hp item<br />
<br />
overall, I won't take FT over HP, a good example are I take Bloodmetal earing(70hp) vs Solstice Earing(55hp,Ft1); but I will take a good focus effect over HP; FT &amp; hp is easy to get but a good focus is rare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I feel FT is very important for a shaman, but it is not as important for us as it is for other classes with inferior mana regen abilities.  Between my FT and mana pres focus, I can pretty much chain cast tnargs for a 5 minute raid boss fight (with raid buffs and bard song, of course).  Without my FT, I'd have to stop sooner.<br />
<br />
Here's how I rate things when I'm thinking about a new piece of gear:<br />
<br />
1) Focus Effect &amp; Clicky Effects - I'd wear my elemental boots for their preservation of xegony effect even if they weren't awesome stats.  Ditto for my det and bene haste items.  Marr's Gift on my arms is also an awesome effect, but I could live without it so I rank it slightly lower than other focus effects.  I'd like an improved damage item but it isn't high on my list of priorities.  I'm a GM pottery and I have made a few of the ID4 pofire items, but I don't swap them in for my mace of confusion, even though it would mean only a small loss of stats.  There are also some other effects I would like to have, mainly just Faerune or just some form of truesight.  I have had a 85hp/85mana helm in my bank for a while, but I didn't start wearing it over ornate until I finished my seru quest earring last week.  I hate casting acumen, but seru earring is instant clicky acumen so that makes it pretty painless, and I finally upgraded the ornate.  Other clicky effects are also good.  Best example would be ornate legs.  I don't know if I will ever be able to live without right-click root.  I'd also like a right-click dispell item for dueling, but I wouldn't spend a lot of DKP on it unless it had really great stats as well.<br />
<br />
2) Flowing Thought - I absolutely love flowing thought, but of course there are limits to how much hp and mana I will sacrifice for FT.  I wore FT3 boots over vindi boots, and I probably would have considered wearing them over ornate boots if I wasn't already at the FT cap when I got ornate.  Another example is when I was wearing a 65hp 65mana ft3 range, and the opportunity arose to claim my present ranged it (130hp, 145mana, 18% detrimental haste).  That was a no brainer and I destroyed the ft3 range, dropping me down to FT12.  I miss the FT and I do notice the loss, but the improved stats and detrimental haste made it an easy choice.  Also, one of my weakest items is my neck (ft2, 60hp, 20wis).  I am ready to upgrade it for an EP quality neck (125/125 or better), but I wouldn't upgrade it for something like the talisman gate quest neck.  I'd get significantly better stats with the quest neck, but it wouldn't be worth dropping the ft2.  I would, however, upgrade it for a VZ or TZ neck (whichever one has the 18 to all resists).<br />
<br />
3) Hit Points - No further explanation needed.<br />
<br />
4) Mana - Very important for when you need to chaincast tnargs on a raid, but on long sustained fights (exp groups) our mana regen makes our mana pool kind of irrelevant.<br />
<br />
5) Resists - For most people resists would be at the bottom of their list.  Resists seem to do practically nothing in PvE.  Bard song + seasons + guard of druzzil + tribunal should handle all of your resist needs on raids, unless you have absolutely horrible base resists.  The only resist that should really be important for most shamans is MR.  Dots you can cure, nukes you can heal, but if you get rooted or snared it can mean serious trouble.  I, however, like resists a lot.  I duel a lot, and I also have a bit of a fetish for seeing really great resists.<br />
<br />
6) AC - Good to have but I'm pretty convinced it doesn't do much for us after 1200.  If an item has AC, great, but my decision on whether or not to claim an item is not swayed at all by its AC.  My AC is significantly lower than most shamans with gear on the same level of mine, mainly because my secondary (agnarr orb) has no AC at all, whereas most other shamans have a VT shield or something like that with massive AC.<br />
<br />
7) Everything else - My wisdom is capped, and my stamina is almost capped (easily caps with self buffs), so I don't need these any more.  Everything else is pretty worthless for a shaman.</div></div><hr />

How the heck are you capping stamina?  I put 20 points into it when I created my frog (yes, everyone can laugh at my magelo below now) and still don't have it maxed...<br />

If you look at his magelo, he's got over 4000 hp and some elemental gear - some of which has +20sta on one item. At that sort of level, it's not that hard to cap stamina, especially with our buff.<br />
<br />
I can't see your gear, your magelo shows you as naked, but I'm assuming you're not in a high end raiding guild, so it's a lot harder.</div></div><hr />

Well, I am mainly in tier3 or tier4 PoP gear, and you're mainly wearing bazaar stuff.  Almost every piece of gear I'm wearing gives at least 10 stamina, and several of them give me 20 or more.  I realize most people aren't in EPs yet, but even before I started getting EP gear I was hitting 305 stamina with buffs.  Remeber, sta buff gives you 60 stamina, so you really only need 245 base to cap it.  I was hitting 245 well before I was in EPs, mainly wearing just tier2 and ssra loot with the occasional bazaar piece thrown in.  Another thing to remember is that after 255 stamina, you only get half as many HPs per point of sta.  So, once you hit 195 base, stamina becomes a lot less important.  At 245, it doesn't really matter at all.  More base stamina would make my magelo look better and free up a buff slot, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />

A few nice items from the Elemental Planes and Aten Ha Ra really helps you cap your stamina.  Really nice not to have to buff that on myself any more, and it saves a spell slot all the time as well :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Aten neck effect counts towards worn FT?<br />
<br />
Every kind of effect that gives you mana regen counts towards the effect cap, UNLESS it gives you a buff icon.  Example:  necklace off of the acrylia burrower gives you 2 mana regen, boon of recovery off of shei orb gives you 3 mana regen, emp ssra robe gives you 5 mana regen - all these are buffs and dont count towards FT cap.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The thing with AC is that it is only good at certain levels...<br />
<br />
Buffed to 1000 is a level<br />

Buffed to 1250 is a level<br />
Buffed to 1400 is a level<br />
Buffed to 1700 is a level<br />
Buffed to ~2000 is a level.<br />
<br />
This is why people do not often see much of a difference when they add on the AC gear...  Once you get to a buffed AC of 1250+ then AC shouldnt be a factor till you can hit 1400 buffed -- the second there is a decent path available to make the jump -- make it -- just dont sit with 1340 buffed ac because that is not much better than 1250...  The jump comes at 1400...<br />
<br />
The reason for this is because monster ATKs tend to be clustered...  What is funny is 1350 MIGHT be a valid AC number *IF* you crippled every mob.<br />
<br />

<br />
Presently my shaman is at the 1250+ ac tier...  Now I am working on HPs etc.  When I get to the point where I *CAN* jump to 1400 then it will be yellow fang earring time and I will jump.  Until then exp between what I have and 100 more is mostly worthless...<br />

Now a more interesting question on this general theme is whether the REGEN 5 chest augment is better or worse than the FT 2 one for a shaman... That choice will be in front of me soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO trying to equate hp regen to mana regen becomes irrelivant once you get torpor or probably even stoicism. Once you get to the point that you can heal yourself that effectively the limiting factor becomes not how fast you can regen hps back but how fast you can cann them down. Pre those efficient heal spells regen does allow you to cann more and indirectly increases your mana regen rate but once you have those heals it really falls apart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd personally say the regen 5 aug.  It's not very hard to get to 15 ft, at least if you're in an elemental guild.  Even without that since the ft 2 aug can fit into every slot it won't be that hard to max ft.  Regen on the other hand has a cap of 35 worn regen, which is much much harder to reach. And if I'm correct the regen 5 aug is chest slot only.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh yeah, FT is very very useful.  I've recently gone from 4 ft to 11 ft and have noticed a huge difference.  In small amounts it doesn't seem to do much but it adds up really quickly.  It's less canning you have to do, more spells that you can cast on the same mana bar, and most importantly it's more chain heals (or nukes if that's what you like better) that you can do when the **** hits the fan and you don't have a chance to canni.  As for evaluating ft on a how many hps will I give up for a pt of ft.  Personally, I'd look at it more on a &quot;how much am I dying with lots of mana left?&quot;  If the answer is a lot, then you need more hps so that you can stay alive to spend your mana, if the answer is sometimes but only when you had no chance to live then not much would've helped, if the answer is that you or people in your group die fairly often because you run outta mana to slow/heal then the ft would be much more valuble than the hps for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">FT2 &gt; HP regen 5 unless you're at the FT cap.  There is no question FT is better in this situation.  You could think of it this way...the hp regen is mana but it still needs to be converted.  Even though technically 5 hp regen generates more mana per tick than FT2; we must factor in that it wont always be possible to actively convert regen per tick into mana nor will it always be practical.<br />

<br />
and sslyva where did your numbers come from?  Data or point to the source.  Numbers from feelings or anecdotal evidence arent relevent...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Those numbers were culled from many many different boards...  The warriors and hybrids seem to be more in tune with what high ac does than other people... <br />
<br />
As I said before -- the REASON why it is that way is because monsters tend to fall into groups -- Now if the planes werent set up in tiers and the monsters didnt have similar atk values (and bosses similar to the next tier) then it would be more a linear function -- but it isnt...  <br />
<br />
There are tons of monsters where 1400 or 1700 are major points for whether your armor works or not...  There are almost none or none at all where 1550 is the point where it makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">if hybrids and tanks are &quot;more in tune with ac&quot; its only fitting..they get beat on so they have a reason to know what ac does.  Throwing numbers of what warriors and hybrids observe tanking high end raid encounters in PoP is hardly relevent to what a shaman will be tanking, and i dont care if you get aggro on a resisted slow etc. Raising AC to points you could theoretically tank a god in PoP just in case you get a resist/summon is illogical, and if you arent in PoTime gear you arent going to get that level of AC without sacrificing important stats.<br />
<br />
I would also like to point out that classes and AC are independant..so what you read on the the warriors board about 1700 and 2000 AC is hardly relevent to a shaman, and it also isnt going to apply to a mage.<br />

Getting back on topic... I think quite a few people underestimate the value of FT.  If you get enough passive mana regen you can do more than if you have to constantly canni mana back.  Its like i told my friends..I just dont have time to canni (it was my main argument for wanting to get canni5 before i leveled past 60).  You only have so much time to cast and canni4 eats into that time..so the less need there is to canni, the more time you have to do other tasks.</div></div><hr />
