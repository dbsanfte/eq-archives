<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snowielder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want my own server where no one can steal my camps, KS me, train me, or in any other way inhibit my playing time.  <br />
<br />
I always thought that I would bore of Everquest cause I would get bored of the game itself.  Lately, however, I have been loving the game, but hating the people that play it.<br />
<br />
About two weeks ago when I was in Scarlet Desert, was camping some bloodtribe and a named one pops.  I run out of the cave to med quick.  Two druids come along, waltz right past me and start killing the named.  I inform them that I am camping the cave and that I can take the named.  They say, &quot;sorry,&quot; kill the named mob, loot it, and gate out.<br />
<br />
Tonight, trying to find a new hunting spot for myself and my brother who is a 54 ranger.  We try the umbrous toilers in Maiden's.  We are killing for maybe a half hour, things going well.  Along comes a 60 enchanter.  Dire charms a toiler and procedes to kill every toiler within about a half mile radius.  I say we were here first, she says &quot;oh, didn't see you,&quot;  I asked if she can let some toilers through so we can kill, she says, &quot;you guys can't clear the whole hill anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
My guild also had Phinny camped and then stolen from us recently while we were gathering to kill it.<br />
<br />
And the thing about all of these incidents is there is nothing I can do about either.  I petitioned the druid and got the PnP explanation.  I do believe these are all PnP, so realistically, all you can do is complain to the player, who is probably laughing hysterically.<br />
<br />
I have never had a major problem like this happen up until the past few weeks, and I'm more frustrated than I have ever been on any corpse run with these people.<br />
<br />
Is this just something I am going to have to get used to?  Cause I don' t know if I can get used to it.  It's just so rude, and then they could redeem their actions by doing something nice, but instead continue to be rude, proving their prior actions weren't &quot;a mistake&quot; and that they weren't &quot;sorry.&quot;  (I love when they apologize and then continue doing exactly what you complained to them about).<br />
<br />
I guess issues like this have been covered before in the forum (been a lurker for over a year), but needed to let off some anger or else I would be in a bad mood all night.<br />
<br />
Also, any zones that exist where these people tend not to hang out or have they found most zones already and the rest of us are just screwed?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go to Firiona Vie if u can handle the RP part, which is not that bad if u dont act like an idiot.  i went to seb the other day and we where the 3rd group in the zone, and we where surprised.  back in the days of Lguk it was common for my group to have the zone to itself.  FG ussualyhas one group max killing shrooms.  The server is nice and empty for the most part.  But then again there are some things that people dotn liek about the server.   Like if i want the stormfeather map piece for eyepatch of plunder i may end up havign to shell out 20k, damn TLC i cant getit myself =/<br />
<br />
but if u tired of a full server FV is without a doubt not crowded though it has its disadvatages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been playing the Neverwinter Nights single player campaign  in multiplayer mode with my oldest eq buddies this past week on a passworded server Its been utter bliss, no goobers, no spamming, roleplayed characters, no camping, quests you can actually solve, a feeling of exploration and wonder (no spoilers, yay!) and so on.<br />
<br />
I wish VI would put out a server software package, I know plenty of people that would chip in to run a custom server.<br />
<br />
As for people in general in MMORPGS, IMHO  they are just getting dumber, more aggrresive, more vocal and damn well intolerable, EQ is nothing at all like it used to be and dare I say it , intended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You were too slow to get to the named mob before someone else did.  Someone else engaged it first.  Grats to them.  Lesson to you to be faster next time.<br />
<br />
There's lots and lots and lots of mobs in ME.  Pull anything that moves.  It's all xp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Camping&quot; Phinny has no meaning.  If you were gathering forces for Phinny, when another group already had their forces together and was ready, congrats to them.  They were ready first, and engaged first, and got the prize.  Lesson to you to you to be faster next time.<br />
<br />
EQ has competition.  It's often a race to get something before another player does.  You have no more right to any mob than anyone else does.  If you are too slow, you don't win the race.  You can either give up, keep losing, or adapt.  Take your pick.  I'm sorry, but none of your stories make me think you were in the right.  Sure, it's ****ty to lose out on named mobs, but that's EQ.  There's more people wanting to kill the nameds than there are named to go around.  Be faster next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm sorry you're getting frustrated with EQ.  While I agree that the others SHOULD have shown a little patience and let you have your shot, they were in their right to jump you.  You need to move fast to get what you're after, its even more painfull with mobs that are in high demand.  Zlandicar, woushi, rumblecrush, and a handfull of other mobs have a life expectancy of minutes (if that) and if you're not ready to take them right off the bat, someone else will.<br />
<br />
I feel bad for you, but there's nothing you can do, you're in VI's world now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I felt that way when I first started playing EQ.  Now I consider the few problem players - mostly, but not always, druids - to be part of the challenge.<br />
<br />
I recently bought Morrowind and found the absence of other people to interact with greatly detracted from the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And people wonder why some people play on PvP servers....<br />
When that happens,just beat down said moron into a pulp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It would be nice if there were a way to set up private EQ servers, but it's not bloody likely to happen. Verant wouldnt be raking in all our money each month if they did that...unless they wanted to host the servers and charge for bandwidth. But they'd probably go bankrupt from demand for servers. But at least they wouldnt have to worry about customer service anymore...oh wait..nevermind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">People with attitudes like Juujuu are usually in uber-guilds , they've been leapfrogging ,camp stealing,kill stealing and being jerks in general since day 1 .<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
because they can. There's no rule against being a jerk in EQ .<br />
<br />
And having a bad rep doesnt matter when you're guild endorses such behvior.You can usually get everything you need from said guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
They may have had no &quot;right&quot; to said mobs but they were there first.And there are still many people who still respect camps,and act in a respectful manner. You just had the misfortune of meeting a few jerks in a short period of time .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gytmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree with everything Tweadle said.<br />
<br />
It is called common courtesy (although it is unfortunately becoming uncommon in EQ), something many people from uber guilds lack.  Rumble, fine - Vindi, fine - etc etc etc on uber mobs.  But when someone has been hunting a certain area, like a patch of shrooms in FG for example, or a certain cave, for another - leave them frickin be.  They are there, and have been camping it.  If they are holding all the spawns in their area in question, leave them be.  If they have to stop for 2 min to med, that doesn't mean they aren't camping those mobs.  Long as they are holding the spawns and getting the first one when it repops w/i a reasonable amount of time (few minutes), leave them alone.  Respect others and move on if the area is camped, and don't be a jerk.  And leapfroggin on mobs like Phinny is horses**t - happened to our guild once.  We were down in his &quot;cave&quot; and waiting on a couple to med up, and CoHing one other in, when a group of ubers zoned in, came down and leapfrogged us, AFTER we had killed all the other mobs in Phinny's area.  That is just crap, pure and simple - and RUDE as hell.  Have some respect.  Others are there, leave them alone and move on and drop the uber guild attitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In the &quot;real world&quot; I still hold doors open for people behind me at stores and such.  It's called, courtesy.  Just because there's competition in RL, I sure would hope common courtesy still exists.<br />
It's losing grip in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I also agree with TweadleDimm. While what Juujuu said is pretty much what the PnP says, I think people with this attitude is the only thing I hate about EQ.<br />
<br />
Before my guild even bothers to mobilize for any named or epic mob, we first check to see that noone is there and preparing to kill it. If another guild or group is there, we find something else to do.<br />
<br />
For me it all comes down to, just because the rules allow you to be a rude, uncourteous jack***, doesn't mean you have to be or should be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Amen. I have recently had some serious issues with a few &quot;Ubers&quot; (I call em GUBERS). I won't name names (that isn't honorable). But just because there is a PnP that says no such things as camps but that doesn't mean that respect and courtesy shouldn't be there. <br />
<br />
I mean it's like I pull in front of you at the stop light and stick out in traffic just because you are giving pedestrians room so I assume you don't want to go forward. <br />
<br />
People never suprize me with their lack of common courtesy. I often quote an unknown author with, &quot;...Never underestimate the power of stupidity in large numbers...&quot; <br />
<br />
And as much as I try to believe in my fellow man I just always seem to try to believe in the uncouth and the mean and the rude and the mooch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Agreed with TweadleDimm and the others with similar opinions.. the world of Everquest is becoming too much of a playground for jerks who have absolutely no fear of repecussions unlike in real life situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would like say that people are concentrating too much on &quot;uber folks.&quot;  It's really an attitude problem in the general public.  When my server went FFA, it was ugly at first, then things started to pan out, with only a minor scuffle here and there.  Racing to ubermob_01 was fun.  When it comes to guilds lashing out vulgarities, training, and leapfrogging each other, is when it isn't fun.  That's immature and a waste of time.   Point is, I see/hear level 20's doing stupid stuff, just as much as a level 60.  It's just at a different scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ramhorn has a good point.  UBER does not mean idiot and not every druid is a butthead.  Some of the uber folks I have met have been top drawer, but sadly its the buttheads that tend to stick out.<br />
<br />
BTW, I hope people don't jump all over juujuu.  Sadly his main point is correct even if I completely disagree with his opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Curiously enough, it seems to coincide with the holidays, spring break, and summer vacation.<br />
<br />
Then the twerkies (part twerp, part turkey) go back to school and things get a little less crowded.<br />
<br />
Not to say that all folks who lack common courtesy are youngsters, or that all youngsters (teens/lower) are jerks, but there's a sadly high correspondance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The eq world is a strange one. Hard to tell whats going on on the other side when you can't see the person. Ive offered to share spawns of a static camp when a necro was asking me if I would let them know when i was leaving. (ig's front 2 spawns). figured i was only going to be around another hr i could let one spawn go. Than i had to afk a couple times and come back to the necro killing my spawn. Said he just couldnt help himself. Than another time  i get trained by a runaway druid quad and few minutes after i died get a tell from said druid who made sure i got a rez (was 4 people in zone and 2 were me and still somehow got me lol in the grey, was in a corner away from zoneline). Another time i died a bad death and couldnt get my body. Just about all my guild who was on at the time scambled to help me get it back even though i was in a pretty out of the way place. My point of all my rambling? Never know what your going to get in eq but i still think the good things happen more often than the bad. Bad irritates me but the good keeps me coming back.</div></div><hr />

But man. I just created a Char on Rallos Zek 'cuz my bro is usin hsi necro on my account. I'd probably have to say 'Flowers of Happiness' are Twerkies, god yes. 3 of them come at me, a mere level 10 DE wizard with newbie quest gear on.. they all got Lamentations, SBS's, Iksar Regen Bps. Hehe, well... i vow to keep playing till i kill every single one that attacked me. Ahhh.. I can't wait till lures! Anyway, all you PvP folks if you can give me tips on how to play, flood me with information till my brain explodes!</div></div><hr />
