<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry I was such a dick in Fear last night.  I had a crappy work week and was impatient with things and I let it affect my conduct around you guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jice, if it wasn't for your &quot;motivation&quot;  ;) together we would not have taken out Draco on the 3rd attemp.  After the 2nd attemp, moral was low and doubt was very high that I thought we were gonna wrap things up for the night.  <br />
<br />
I am happy that with your help we were able to turn things around and succeed. So don't worry about it even if things did not turned out I would still have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just be careful, Jice -- while I personally almost fell out of my chair laughing - some at VI might think that kind of stuff is bannable.  I like playing with ya too much to see you get booted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only thing I see wrong here is you forgot to bring the Pizzas....:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was in tells with Erolz.  We were discussing how long the CR on our third attempt was gonna take.<br />
<br />
Wasn't the smae dragon the third time, though.  He only conned blue, and the presence of more classes to debuff him meant that nukes were going all the way in.  He went down easily.<br />
<br />
What inspired me to stick around for a third attempt was a line from Jice:<br />
<br />
&quot;My people are going to revolt if we don't make at least one good try at this.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't have folks travel all that way and not give it a shot.<br />
<br />
<br />
And it was the spelunking bit that just about rolled me outta my chair!</div></div><hr />
