<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which class would make a better partner to a 24 Shaman....looking to take duo from 24 to 50+ mainly...this is NOT a 2 box, 2 people will actually be playing...<br />
<br />
1. Warrior<br />
2. SK<br />
3. Necro<br />
4. Beastlord<br />
<br />
I did a search on this, but did not really find what I was looking for, so thought I'd ask the question...yet again...<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think no matter if one is botting a second character or another person is playing it, I think the answer is the same.<br />
<br />
Warrior no. The other three, yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, if this is an opinion-type question, then I would rate partner classes as follows:<br />
<br />
1 - Necromancer<br />
2 - Magician<br />
3 - Beastlord<br />
4 - Shadowknight<br />
5 - Paladin<br />
6 - Monk<br />
7 - Ranger<br />
8 - Rogue<br />
9 - Bard<br />
10 - Enchanter<br />
11 - Druid<br />
12 - Warrior<br />
13 - Wizard<br />
14 - Cleric<br />
<br />
Note*  The warrior falls low on the list simply because duo'ing a warrior-shaman gets really, really boring after a while.  It's very efficient if you're 2-boxing a bot character, but really redundant if you're just in a duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gummey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gahhh!<br />
<br />
No more, Stop my brain hurts...<br />
<br />
We should have a seporate category for 2 boxing and Partners since we get this topic like 3 times a week!!!<br />
<br />
 :eek:</div></div><hr />

monotonous, aint it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cirys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">monotonous, aint it?<br />
<br />
Almost as monotonous as you whining about it.  Leave already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cirys, after all we have been through..I am shocked. You washed m hair man, that meant alot to me :(<br />
<br />
(edited content about Slapnuts up there performing 2 obscene acts upon himself, the second proceeding directly form the first)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why not another shammy?  I cant speak for all you fine persons, but I group with another shammy in my guild, and we have quite a bit of fun. We trade jobs on and off, both have pets (obviously) both have cann, so the downtime is minimal...  I realize that Shammy/ Shammy isn't as good as: Shammy/necro or my personal favorite Shammy/ pally, but Shammy/Shammy is definetly worthwild in my book.  Sorry I know that this is a bit off topic, because the actual question asked about 1 comp, 2 toons... Also, the best reason for Shammy/Shammy.......(drum roll please) is..... my stinking Charm of the Brotherhood would actually do something!!!! hehehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shandrillar, once long ago I dreamed of stacking dots and bounce-kiting mobs for xp when the DoT-stacking was allowed. Only one shaman I ever knew agreed to try it, name was Boogiemonster. We effectively stacked beans on spiders in DN for fun and profit, and after a week had gained a few levels and 3 PSC's (which we wore, replacing a totemic and frog scale BP). It DOES work, but a big issue is, 99% of all shaman don't even THINK about it! Damned shame too man..damned shame. <br />
<br />
Glad you brought that up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Glad to hear bud, we did have a good time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Great thing back then was, one would malosini, one would slow, and with dogs pounding (have them /pet guard near the back wall!) we would run about like madmen. Once one had aggro, the other would toss in a JBB or refresh a poison dot. Even the occasional nuke. Neither of us had our epics at the time, but we didnt need them. We rarely took hits, so had lots of hp to canni off of. If we did get hit and got shadowstepped, all the better! Gets out of melee range :) Once at 15% or so, we would park the slob and watch the dogs beat em down while dancing the canni manni. Can't remember alot of things that were more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bilanea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I know i've duoed with a monk from 47 to 62 so far, and have duoed with other classes, I personally think that monks are the best partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Classes that can snare and fear are my personal fav...SK's are my fav!~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Again i say what does the other person want to do? Just melee? Melee and cast? Just cast? alot of options to partner with a shaman and arent many classes that arent effective. So the best is a combo where no one is effing bored while playing. I havent like grouping with just a cleric. My 2 box warrior grew boring since he had no real untility and at the time didnt have cash for the cool proc weapons or clicky items. Other than that tons of options and play styles that work great.</div></div><hr />
