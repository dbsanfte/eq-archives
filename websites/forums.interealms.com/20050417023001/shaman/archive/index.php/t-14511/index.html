<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The soulstripper is a great weapon for a shaman and I am always seeing groups of 50+ wipe on it. I never understood why. I have camped it solo 5 times now and been unfortunate to only get the cloak every time, no weapon, but it can be solo'd and should be solo'd by a shaman. Here is how to do it.<br />
<br />
Invis to the spawn spot, usually the placeholder is up (Servant of hate). Head down the wall opposite him to just past the small outcrop of rock, this will put you out of agro range from the PH and the two mobs guarding the entrance to the pit room. Pull up dog dog, give weapons, hos, regrowth and haste. Take out the placeholder. Easy with slow, dog, jbb and eb. Stand on the spot the PH spawns on and set pet to guard here. Then move back to the spot you started from.<br />
<br />
You can solo pull the two mobs at the pit if you want, depends how confident you are. They are not hard to kill but you need full mana to beat the soulstealer (possibly) so dont be killing one when the next pop is due. Also, the two mobs at the entrance to the tunnel from the bridge are solo pulls at 52. The servant of hate is a pansy, but the archon of malevolance will complete heal twice. Anyone find it annoying that you dont get 3 x the xp. lol.<br />
<br />
After 10 minutes self buff with hos, regrowth, all resists, rage, guardian, stamina, and any other things you want. If the soulstealer pops he will cast on you immediately. Engage pet and malosi him. Then slow him. At this point he will most likely be beating down on you. He double attacks for around 200-250. Root him and run to his spawn spot. This will ensure you do not bring agro from adds. ebolt him and jbb until he comes at you again. root and switch positions. He will possibly run under 20 percent so root him and jbb to death.<br />
<br />
It can feel a little uncomfortable in the beginning but hang in there and get him malosi'd, and slowed, then stoicism and canni as required. I have usually finished the fight with 80 percent mana, and 80 percent health. I will post how close it is if he has the soulstripper on him because I assume the proc could make it more of a challenge but still doable.<br />
<br />
I have been lucky every time because Chester Steelblad has been up and he is a wandering spirit that cons indifferent and will not add. I have been told that if he is not up a wandering mob will come down the tunnel and attack so be wary. If Chester is up just let him pass.<br />
<br />
Good luck and please ask any questions, I think I have this covered, and it is always good to solo a level 51 mob comfortably so do it for the self kudos.... :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry to hear that you haven't gotten the soulstripper in 5 tries. <br />
<br />
Here is a story of my experience with this mob.<br />
<br />
I was camping this guy for the second day, first day 12 ph's not soulstealer. Second day 5 ph's, but the roamer was around, I killed him each time he he came near. When I was fighting the roamer, the soulstealer spawned, I was at half mana, and about 70% health. He aggro'd on me, I managed to kill the roamer, and doggie got killed rather quickly from the soulstealer. Of course my buffs had dropped, and I really was a sitting duck for him. I think I got him to about 90%. Right before I died I noticed that a druid was sitting there invis'd. I'm sitting at my computer thinking, I'm dead and a druid got the spawn and the drop. I invis and head back in to drag my corpse to the zoneline to wait for a rez. I see the druid root-rotting him, has him down to about 85%.<br />
<br />
At this point I am totally disgusted with this game, and ready to log for the night as soon as I get a rez. The guildie who was going to rez me, goes LD. I look in the zone and see a cleric afk. I send her a tell and ask if I could buy a rez from her. She comes to the zoneline and rezzes me, no charge. Tells me to send a tell to her alt if I need further help. I go back to the spawn spot and see that the druid is gone, and the soulstealer is up, however the roamer is also up at this time. I send her alt a tell, go back to the zone to get her, we invis and head in. While setting up, the roamer aggro's on her, causing the soulstealer to aggro as well. I haven't had the chance to cast my doggie, so I root the roamer, and atk the soulstealer. She heals me and nukes the soulstealer. We finally kill him, and then kill the roamer. I loot and we run back to the zoneline. <br />
<br />
I am now the owner of a Soulstripper...<br />
<br />
When I thanked her for all the help, she told me it was just good karma coming back. Seems that a while back, I sow'd her alt for a CR, which I do with no hesitation. This was her way of paying me back. I told her if she ever needed an slow leveling shaman for anything, just send me a tell.<br />
<br />
This was one of those days when I really HATED this game and then had it turn around into a good day..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I killed him at 53 with help. I think I could have done in myself but it would have to be perfect to pull off. When I camped him the roamer was always up. Anyway myself at the time was 53 and I had a ranger from the guild who was 46 at the time tank him. He went down easy when slowed while the ranger and my pet went to work on him I layed ebolt and plague on him. All in all it's a great weapon and well worth getting. I think we were there 3 hours or so but when he did spawn he had the soulstripper in hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SS will not aggro you if you sit closer to stairs.<br />
<br />
There is one thing I have noticed all the times I have camped the SS. The wanderer is a sneaky little Bastage... he wont come around UNTIL you try to pull the SS..<br />
<br />
as for chester......<br />
Because he takes up a spawn point... I just kill him too...<br />
<br />
-edit-<br />
that sounded bad.. I forgot to include WHY I kill chester... to make him the wandering spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Absurdum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Though Chester may spawn at just about any of the mob locations around the stairs, he most often spawns where the roaming mob does. I also play a Pally and when I finished my second LoY spell quest, Chester was actually spawned where the mob is on the left ledge as you go down the stairs. Anyway, if Chester is up and taking the roamer's place, it is best to leave him be since you will never have to worry about that roamer showing up at the worst possible time. Yes he takes up a mob spot, but, he can be the difference between a bad experence and a good one.<br />
<br />
Also, if you kill him, you may be depriving some poor pally of a shot at finishing their spell quest. Try to imagine how you would feel if someone kept killing the Impassive Sea Spirit and you couldn't get Stoicism because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Smellious, that is a great story, and I am glad you got the soulstripper. It is always nice when good things happen based on events from the past.<br />
<br />
KS'ing is very annoying. Point in hand, I was on Dirulia last night clearing the boat. I had been on it for about 2 hours and was basically just finishing one mob off when the next one popped. So, mob pops, I sick dog dog on it and cast slow. I then see another character standing next to me casting. I get ebolt off and start chain casting jbb. At the same time I put an ooc out that I was camping the boat and had been for a while. He responded that he was looking for a black medallion and wasn't ks'ing... ?<br />
<br />
So, obviously this was the captain I was fighting (I just hadn't noticed) and this guy wanted him. He continued to cast on the captain and I was very pleased that when he died I could loot. I thanked him for &quot;assisting&quot; and pointed out that I logged the fight, clearly had agro first and wasn't very happy with his behavior.<br />
<br />
His response? /camp.<br />
<br />
What is it with these people?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The key to the original guys post was his jbb .. with out that this camp would be very difficult at 52 with so many things that can make this go wrong.  I camped this with a 55 warrior which made thigs pretty easy (2 soulstealers) but without the mana saved from jbb I dont see how you could hold this camp while pilling all 5 plus wanderer and be FOM for soulstealer dude, even caning down.  I would like to go back with a jbb and try this.  <br />
<br />
Anyway good luck .. its worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good point Dasgood, the jbb really was important in the camping of this mob, as much as Chester being up was as well. I tried it with the random walker up and had to gate. Until you made this post I guess I hadn't really given much thought to exactly how useful the jbb is. It really does add a great deal to the fight.<br />
<br />
Edit: One point though, when I was camping this I was really preparing for the next pop between fights. It took most of the 18 minutes to recast all resists, buffs, etc. on me and buff pet while canni'ing to FM. I didn't touch the 2 mobs at the entrance to the tunnel, or those near the pit. Just wanted to point that out in case folks thought I was bragging about &quot;owning&quot; the tunnel. It wasn't fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been camping the Soulstealer myself of RN.  At lvl52 it was a no go, got owned like a rented mule.  The Soulstealer uses Envenomed Bolt - so if you're not ready for it, you're Hp will drop FAST!!!<br />
<br />
First attempt at lvl52, got Soulstealer to 50% before I died (tried to dot him to death - bad idea versus a mean caster).  At lvl53, he was tough, but not as bad (resist buff dogdog too as the Soulstealer will EB dogdog).  At lvl53, I used an entire bar or mana on - Malise, Slow, EBolt, Shock of Venom, Shock of Venom, Shock of Venom, Shock of Venom, ....(I think 8 Blasts got me down to about 20% mana and I that time I had to Stoicism and hope that dogdog would finish him off) Giving dogdog a set of mage weapons, girdle and mask help alot.<br />
<br />
At lvl54, it becomes MUCH easier as your new nukes will help alot (no JBB).<br />
<br />
I've been lucky enough to get 6 Soulstealers in a few days (I've been selling them for 4.5kpp in the Bazaar and they go in minutes - my closest competition normally is in the 7kpp range).  I did get one cloak.  I thought it would make some decent money seeing as it was his rare - started the price around 8kpp.  Five days later it was down to 2kpp and I was happy someone bought it for that.<br />
<br />
But for the lvl52 shaman wanting to solow this camp, I'd suggest the following:<br />
<br />
1) KeI<br />
2) JBB<br />
3) Virtue (this by far is a difference maker, as without Virtue it was always a REALLY close fight, but with it the Enraged Soulstealer would only get me to about 50%)<br />
if you don't have any of the above,<br />
4) A partner - with just a lvl43 Paladin partner the Enraged Soulstealer was CAKE.</div></div><hr />

Oh you mean kinda like all the people who mess up Hollowshade on a daily basis for the war or to farm for the smithing, and leave me and other Vah Shir unable to finish the only piece of racial armor we get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jazzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just wonderin if anyone could post the loc of PH for the soulstealer, i have only been to dulak for Stoicism spell and would like to get my hands on a soulstripper<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't know the /loc but here are the directions. When you zone into Dulak head up the passage to the main courtyard. Hug the left wall as it turns into the courtyard. Head straight out from the wall through the invisible door in the wooden wall ahead of you. This takes you into the tunnels. Follow the tunnel down and around until you come to a huge stone bridge. Take the right junction in the middle of the bridge and go past the two mobs at the entrance to it. Usually one is a servant of hate and the other is an archon of malevolance. Head down that tunnel and on your left half way down is a static spawn. This is the placeholder. It will either be a servant of hate, or the soulstealer. The spawn time is ~18 minutes. You will know if you are in the right place because the end of the tunnel you are in is an opening to a pit with two mobs guarding it (one either side) and usually one in the middle at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Use Invis, the tunnels are fulll of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So I buckled and bought a soulstripper.... hah... I just couldn't stand in that tunnel anymore knowing that when the stealer did pop he would probably have the damn cape. Anyway, the weapon is awesome, I just wish I had got it from the stealer in Dulak, and not the stealer in the bazaar... :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, was a good camp, now I need to get the charm from the Stormwave captain, 3 legs, 1 staff and counting... <br />
<br />
Some things I am just not destined to get. I will get the charm though, it cannot be bought...<br />
<br />
Sorry for the lamenting post, it isn't all bad. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jazzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">kk followed directions saw Servant on left side is there also a roaming emmissary too. Also where is there a safe spot to med <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Might have to check this out if I head back to dulak. I'm assuming a 54 shammy and 56 ranger will have absolutely no problems with this camp, we both have decent gear for our level so we should be fine. Nice guide, Hope the spots open if I do go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Jazzin, if there is a roaming emissary you will not find a safe spot to med.... Your hope will be that when you kill that roamer Chester spawns. He is indifferent and will not get involved, plus he is the spawn for the pally quest. I never stick around solo if the roamer is up. Too much effort to be ready in case the stealer spawns.<br />
<br />
If Chester is up you can med safely along the right hand wall just past the place holder. There is an outcropping of rock. Head just past that and you will not agro the 2 mobs at the pit entrance, or the PH/SS.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Stol, missed your post, you and your ranger friend should have no problem with this camp. Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got bored and camped this guy last night. I just have to add one thing. <br />
<br />
watch out for screeming terror. he did it to me once and after my pet died he healed back to full. so I went back and started killing him again and he kept mezzing me. I guess it cleared his aggro list or something because every time he mezzed me he healed back to full. I finally put on some gear and cast resist magic and that stopped his mezzing days =P<br />
<br />
just a word of warning. other then that he was cake at 58. im now a proud owner of a soulstripper =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Helil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Could a 54 shaman and 48 warrior clear the way to the soulstripper and kill him too?<br />
<br />
both are not well equiped [To me :)]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes, you could clear the way from the entrance to Dulak if you wanted to. It would take a little while but is doable. Just bear in mind that you can invis all the way to the tunnel so if your server is busy you might find yourself piggybacked, or leapt over to claim the camp.<br />
<br />
If you are fighting from the entrance, just fight up the corridor to the main courtyard, then take a left along the wall. When you get to the wooden wall you can agro pull the nearest mobs outside to kill them by just standing in the hidden entrance for a few seconds. Then it is just a case of crawling down the tunnel until you hit the bridge. There are some rooms along the right of the tunnel but if you hug the left wall you will head straight to the bridge. At the bridge you need to clear to the center, then turn to your right. That is the tunnel that the soulstealer spawns in.<br />
<br />
If you are not too well equipped I would recommend you have kei to keep downtime at a minimum. Spawn time on mobs is around 18 mins so you do not need to immediately vacate the position of the last mob you dropped and can usually sit there to med up before moving on.<br />
<br />
When you get into the tunnel you do not need to worry about the mobs at the entrance once or at the far end of the tunnel leading down into the pit. If you sit opposite the placeholder you can safely kill him (or the soulstealer) on re-pop. They run on low health so I would recommend root to stop adds.<br />
<br />
For the soulstealer I it is worth popping your resists onto yourself and the warrior (Easy to do by timing the pop and giving yourself time to re-buff and re-med prior to the pop). If chester is up and wandering the tunnel leave him be, he is indifferent and will not add. If he is not up you are prone to seeing a wandering mob that likes to wander as you engage the soulstealer.<br />
<br />
Horse/lizard is a good addition if you have one. Otherwise slow, malaisement (if you have resists on dots), listless power (if you have trouble keeping up with heals), dot, heal warrior, add pet in and you should have no real issues.<br />
<br />
Is a good idea to do the stoicism quest as well if you haven't already done so, will make this crawl a whole lot easier on the mana pool... :)<br />
Best of luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've been douing the Enraged Soulstealer for a few weeks with a lvl46 Paladin (he started at lvl43 - yes he's gained 3 levels down there).<br />
<br />
The Enraged Soulstealer is cake if you have someone to run interference so you can nuke his butt off.  The Paly stuns really help too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>leichter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">can a 51 shammy and a 48 pally duo this guy? pally has full haroldic shammy has JBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Superior Healing helps alot, as you don't have the time for Stoicism to work.<br />
<br />
But I think you could with full buffs, including resists.<br />
<br />
The JBB helps, but the longer the Soulstealer lives, the greater teh chance of one, or both, of you dieing.  That's why the lvl54 nukes make such a big difference in camping this guy.<br />
<br />
Make sure you get a Malosi in, and the paladin should have all his stuns mem'ed.</div></div><hr />

We tried pulling from deeper in and one of the mobs cast fear on the wife.... or course she was SOW'ed and ran off and all hell broke loose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>pr0fess0r</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hi Guys<br />
<br />
I'm now the proud owner of a Soulstripper! I'm a 52 Shammy Froglok on M-T (Karokk). I spent a lot of yesterday camped right in front of his spot, getting the PH time after time, but I had timed it so the wandering emissary of suffering spawned neatly between PH spawns.<br />
I dont have a JBB, so I had dogdog with a couple of Shivs, Alacrity (Spirit Quickening drops too quick - is it really worth it?), HoS, Regrowth and all the magic resists. I had Aego, KEI, Regrowth, Alacrity, HoS and a baby droggie as well as all my resists. <br />
Once the SS popped, he started nuking me, and I couldnt get Turgur's to stick in time, and wham, I was dead. A guildie also died taking him on, in the end 3 of us took him down and I got my wep. Going to camp this my 56 Pally buddy because at 6k each it's a real earner ! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I camped this guy 7 times and started at 52.<br />
<br />
This probably re-iterates some of the advice given but here's my story and tactics.<br />
<br />
Invis up and run to the SS spawn and position yourself against the wall just at the top of the stairs (well really a little further up where the stair slope flattems) on the opposite side to the SS. This spot is safe from aggro and you can even move to the wall on the same side as the SS.<br />
<br />
If you can't see chester steelblade then he is the roamer, YEAH! fi you can see him then a luggald is the roamer, BOO!<br />
<br />
Anyway bring up dogdog, HOS and haste it and give it some weapons. Without weapons the fights are much longer and mana intensive. Buff ya self and make sure you got a fresh KEI.  I have a droga and so pull that up and shrink myself twice. I never tank in here just use dogdog to do that.<br />
<br />
Anyway pull the roamer first and then the SS ph using malosi or whatever, then slow and ebolt when required or plague..up to you, and stick to this routine as it means you will never get jumped by the roamer when fighting the SS as it's on a 20min(ish) timer so you can even med/canni back up to full mana after killing the roamer before you tackle the SS. AND ROOT THE MOBS, i have had a few instances when the roamer has started up the slope and the SS popped and hell breaks loose resulting in a CR :D<br />
<br />
OK so you have killed the roamer and ph a billion times (believe me it can take that long) and you just dispatch the roamer and the SS pops. w000t!<br />
<br />
Now cast all the resists you can on both yourself and dogdog. The SS casts ebolt, fear, has dispelled a few times etc, then buffs and med/canni to full mana...you will need it.  Load up Stocism, Superior Heal, malosi, Eblot, Plague, Slow, root and a nuke....pull with malosi, send in dogdog, slow, then just ebolt (you will have aggro now, you may get it with slow sooo root and backup) plague. By this time you probably have ebolt on ya, i never bothered curing and just cast stocism on myself and live with it, dogdog may need a heal by now to. Ebolt probably just wore off so recast, maybe need to re root and NUKE NUKE NUKE! until dead...loot SS or whatever and invis up or gate out cause you won't be very healthy or have much mana left.<br />
<br />
This worked well nearly everytime, only time it didn't was when i got a add or the SS aggro'd to early. At 53/54 you can take this a little easier.<br />
<br />
This was all done self buffed with about 2.2k HP's<br />
<br />
WE ARE AN UBER CLASS, NO DOUBT :D<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
My magelo says 49 which i am now as i quit and had a mate acrifice me down to 46 for essence emeralds for my guild and sold my gear..but the gear i have is almost the same as i had when i took the SS as 52 the first time.....6 SS's and 1 Cape later however i had full tae ew gear a SS for myself and other nice equipment.....NEVER SELL YA GEAR AND SACRIFICE YOURSELF DOWN UNLESS YOU ARE GOING TO QUIT FOR GOOD!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

at lvl 45 with kei and virtue, i solo'd all the way to the ph.  took me a while, no doubt.  so for all those asking if they and a partner can do it, if i can do it at 45, you surely can.<br />
<br />
he spawns on the hill right before you get to the pit.  had a group of mid 40's earlier last night camping the spot.  he spawned once after killing 3 ph's, and after that, he spawned everytime, 6 times.  with a 48 sk tanking, a cleric, and me, was easy.  at 45, he usually resisted the first slow (4 out of 6 times), resisted the second slow (3 of 4), and resisted third (1 of 4).  each time in grp, we had another mob in camp at the time, and i somehow acquired agro on him first almost every time.  in the group, i had no kei or other higher lvl hp buffs, only mid 40 cleric buffs.<br />
<br />
anyways, he dropped the silly thing each time for a total of 6.  pretty impressive, and at lvl 45, he amounts to monster xp gain too.  the ES has quite the impressive range of spells too.  saw him fear our cleric twice, paralysing root me everytime, dot me with scourge and eb and a fire one i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Poeshun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">This is a easy camp for a lvl 52 Shammy with KEI when killing the Place holders (ph).  Did this yesterday, 7 Sep 03, on Drinal and the spawn rate is crazy.   :confused: Soulsteeler is a tough mob and may be fairly difficult for a Shammy under 52.  Not sure though, because a guildie showed up and got agroe from the Soulsteeler just as he spawned.  This kind of got me off-guard and I was behind in my spell sequence.  I got him down to 10 percent before he killed me, but here is what I did.  :rolleyes:   (Friend wasn't a factor, 51 Cleric, because Soulsteeler waxed him quickley) <br />
<br />
Anywho, Soulsteeler pops and agroes guildie so, I first Malosi and send in poopie.  I then Incapacitate and then slow.  I kind of paniced for a bit at the beginning but am sure the slow stuck.  After slow, then envenomed bolt,  and plague and then start to Tank away with poopie.  In between, I'm casting Winter's Roar, (don't have JBB, if it's not already obvious).  I'm holding my own and poopie is also kicking tail.  Then all of a sudden I'm down to 23% and he's at 20%, not good.    :(    Well luckly another person is camping other mobs and comes to help, only to watch me die and Soulsteeler quickly there after.   I did get the weapon though, as other person knew I had camped there all day.  :D   <br />
<br />
I was buffed to the hilt, to include magic and poison resists, hasted and ready to rock.  Poopie was buffed also.   I'm confident, a 52 shammy could take him, definitley with JBB, but even without, if your confident and cast the right spells in order, you should be victorious.  I will say, having Chester as the roaming spawn made all the difference.   Perhaps waiting to 55 will make victory a certanty.<br />
<br />
The spawn cycle is this, 20 Ph kills and then 1 Soulsteeler, then 3 ph, and Soulsteeler, 3 ph, and then Soulsteeler, then back to the 20 ph again.  The spawn time is every 20 minutes from kill.   So it can make for a long day.   You will have to figure out safe spot to sit and med. <br />
<br />
KEI is great and makes a huge difference.  You have plenty of time to rebuff and regain FM before next spawn. <br />
<br />
Good luck and I will retry camp for selling when I hit 55.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">From your post I can't tell if you soloed the soulstealer 3 or 4 times or just once when your guildie came by. Its becoming a pretty popular camp on my server (karana) and i've not gotten the camp 2 nights because other people had nabbed it. Still trying and will post how I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ouch just soloed it with my pvp shaman lvl 52 but it was  a real pain :rolleyes: but now I got the toy  :D <br />
<br />
Landed one last shock of venom just before he could aggro the static spawns before the bridge, because of course he mezzed me just before to run off  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
so it can be done at 52 with a bit of luck  ;) <br />
I gated last week when I was 51 without Drogmor and took him down to 40 percent left before to be almost oom.<br />
<br />
PvP resists on (not great but enough vs NPCs 150MR buffed)<br />
no jbb<br />
no epic<br />
3060hps buffed with virtue, 180 wis<br />
Kei<br />
stoicism<br />
and a fresh wonderfull drogmor<br />
<br />
pull with roots then/maloxxx/slow/incapacitate/plague/poison dot and nukeS<br />
pet buffed HoS/alacrity/rusty toys<br />
<br />
I think the key is to switch Superior Healing and Stoicism when you have an opportunity, plus of course Disinfecting aura.<br />
<br />
scarying to be mezzed and you see your mob running low hps in the way of others mob  :confused:<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna try soon again, hope it can help  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I've noticed that a couple of the posts here mention casting resist buffs on your pet.  That is unnecessary.  Your pet uses your resists.  Buff your resists, it automatically affects the resists of your pet.  Saves you a little mana :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">bleh- camped this 4x approx 3 hours each time a piece and never saw him. Ended up just buying it for 3.5K plus a small trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>KarlNapp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I tried it with lvl 53 (with a lvl 55 druid) and get 10 times the ****ty PH. At 54 i came back with a lvl 51 Warrior, but I made a great mistake: I had casted Malo, Tugurs, Cripple on him - i a row. - So I'd gotten the full aggro on me. We killed him, but at his last Dot (EB) on me I didn't have enough mana to cure it - and I died.<br />
<br />
I got a rezzer (lvl 48 cleric) in zone. Together with his girl friend (lvl 46 paladin) we start camping the Soulstealer again. He spawned 2 times in 2 hours (every time with weapon), and now the boy was cake: The palli stunned his spells (I waited until 90% with debuffing) - doggie and the warrior do the rest - it was boring for the cleric ;-)<br />
<br />
I think a paladin is the best partner for this mob. - Now, hehe, I'm the owner of a soulstripper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well, following the info here I just tried twice at level 55 with KEI, 1050ish ac and over 3k hp.  First attempt I died in about 30 seconds.  Second attempt my 49 pet (I have nowhere near the 3500pp for Spirit of the Howler) was at 20% health within 4-6 seconds and dead within 10... I barely made it to zone out.<br />
<br />
Not sure how people were soling this at 52.<br />
Pretty disheartening after the ammount of time it took for him to spawn. :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just bumped him off at 55 and here's my experience:<br />
Self-buffed only:  HoS, Regrowth, Rage, Riotous Health, SoW, all Resists, Drogmar<br />
Dogdog buffed:  Regrowth, Alacrity, 2 rusty daggers<br />
AC:  ~950<br />
HP:  2300<br />
All Resists:  ~100<br />
<br />
He spawned and I was out of aggro radius.  I sent dogdog and cast Malise.  It landed and by then dogdog was down to 20% hp.  I moved into melee range so he started beating on me instead of dogdog and channelled a slow, then Disinfecting Aura on dogdog, then E-bolt.  I hit myself and dogdog with Stoicism and started clicking my JBB.  Recast E-bolt once and Stoicism 2 more times on myself (to be safe) since he was nuking for 600 a pop.  He started to run at 20% so I rooted and finished him off.  He had the Soulstripper and it procced 3-4 times for him.  The drogmar wasn't really a factor since I had 40% mana left after the fight.<br />
<br />
Overall there weren't any close calls, except the initial blast that dropped dogdog's health like a rock.  Once I had aggro on me and slow on, it was just a matter of time.  I tried him at 53 as well and got dropped in 30 seconds.  Slow didn't stick and that was the end of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I have camped this on several occasions.  Here are the tales.  First time, myslef at lvl 52 with lvl 51 pally.  No deaths, no SS to show for our troubles either.  Second time, lvl 53 this time, with lvl 52 pally(same one), many spawns, no SS.  Third and final time, me at lvl 55, pally at lvl 53, SK at lvl 54 and another shammy at lvl 52.  We were rocking the place, but no SS again.  We stayed each time for 3-5 hours.  Got 1 claok, and of course much other junk loot.  Maybe once I get bored enough, I will go back again.  It's decent cash, but I may just stick to the grimling mask for profit.  Much more cash on our server (average 10K) and drops more often.  Now, if I could just find a way to get past that whole &quot;lore item&quot; thingy.....<br />
