<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Like some opinions on the best shammy sheild out there. <br />
<br />
Generally its always been the Sheild of Wurms....<br />
<br />
But last night Rumble dropped a <br />
Grand Sheild of faith: AC35 STR5 STA5 WIS20 MR10 FR10 CR10 DR10 75hp and 75 mana<br />
<br />
Seems like it smokes it to me. IS there a better sheild?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best?<br />
<br />
Yakatizima's Shield of Crafting? hehe<br />
<br />
Shield of Wurms is very nice, but I think I would wear my Orb of the Infinite Void over it for daily use, with the extra 45 hps.  Other nice ones are whitestone shield, buckler of insight, shield of holy vigor....<br />
<br />
That rumble shield is very very nice.  Considering that Rumble is what, Vindi difficult makes it even better.  I think it looks like a garage door though, so thats kind of a problem.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I love my shield of the wurms. I honestly don't thin kI will ask for an upgrade unless there is something that is a real knockout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mmm the druid that won it last nice equiped it and it looked just like the ORS/shield of wurms. <br />
<br />
Oh...heh and as far as that shield of crafting, hell I have never seen one nor know the stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kinda hard to argue with Yakatizma's Shield of Crafting (ac 75, str/sta/wis/saves 15, hp/mana 100).  I personally use Shield of the Wurms and like it a lot.  I won't be looking to upgrade this (i.e. blow merit) for a long while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hehe that would be good Krakster, man those gargage door shields are hella ugly.  I had just heard the rumble one looked that way too, glad to know its not the case.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just curious what you all think is the best shaman shield that is tradeable? OoIV?</div></div><hr />

Mebbe between that and Bone Braced Buckler?(obviously second.. but easier to get/cheaper)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When you're talking tradable, the quality drops off pretty fast.  OOIV, Bone Braced Buckler, Bladestopper, SBS, Clay Guardian Shield, Skull Marked Shield.  I guess Lodizal would be in there somewhere, but I can't imagine using that in the secondary slot.</div></div><hr />

Personally I wear a whitestone as primary gear, that's not a bad one either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Did Shield of Ssraeshza get updated, or is it still the one with FT6 and 0 HP?  I guess my other slots are too weak to consider giving up hps in my shield slot, even for FT6. I'm on the borderline of being able to C5 unbuffed right now, so I'm very conscious of hps.  Perhaps too much so, because I don't see this shield as being all that great for shamans.  Am I just wrong about the stats though?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">wish the shield of wurms had the same hp as the cleric version... every other stat is the same &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Shield of the Wurms is garbage. Wouldn't use one over my Sarnak, really. Though that comes down to saving DKPs for better upgrades. Considering the stats on the Shield of Dragonkind, the Shield of the Wurms is just a slap in the face.<br />
<br />
Grand Shield of Faith (Rumblecrush) and Shield of Holy Vigor (Archlich) are both shields that are accessable to many guilds capable of getting the Shield of the Wurms. I give the edge to the Grand Shield of Faith because the Grand Shield has more HP, more mana and more evenly distributed resists. The AC on the Shield of Holy Vigor is negligable to anyone who can buff over 1200 AC, really.<br />
<br />
As for the 'best' shield, I dismiss any suggestion of Yakatizma's Shield of Crafting simply because the very definition of a good shield indicates that it still drop. If it's a shield I can't get, then it's not a good shield. As Saint Anselm of Canterbury said, 'that which is is greater than that which isn't'. A selfish view, but a fair one nonetheless. Now, if someone can lead me to a website showing someone getting a Yakatizma any time within the last few months, I'll change my tune. Until then, the runaway best shaman shield is...<br />
<br />
...the Shield of Ssraeshza. Hands down.<br />
<br />
Actually, since the 75 AC on the Yakatizma is actually just basically a joke at the expense of AC freaks, I'd go with the SoS simply because FT 5 is far better than 30 raw AC on anyone who isn't sitting at less than 1k buffed. I seriously doubt anyone jacking Vulak or dropping any named in Ssra is going to have that low an AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tenoq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I wouldnt call shield of wurms garbage simply because it's free upgrade that I wouldn't have had otherwise. I was using a shield of the green dragon and then one day I was the only shaman in ntov who needed a shield. I'll take 30 more hp than i had plus wis and ac without wasting merit, thanks. I wouldnt say something is a piece of **** until I've had the opportunity to pass on it. I doubt folks saying a shield of crafting is a lame have seen it drop and said &quot;no thank you, that thing sucks.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I passed on the Shield of Wurms everytime it dropped until all guild shaman were equipped and I got one by default.<br />
<br />
It's not a bad shield (although I wish the hitpoints were consistent with the cleric shield) but it wasn't a huge enough upgrade from my OOiV to warrant winning one before a shaman that was really really excited about getting one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">To start with, the Yakatizma Shield has not dropped for some time. However, I can ignore that, what I can't ignore is the fact that there is an AC cap. Any shaman doing Vulak (or who was doing Vulak, since no one does Vulak anymore except, perhaps, for Yakatizma himself) easily breeched the AC cap for shamans, which many believe is around 1200 AC.<br />
<br />
So discounting the pointless AC on the Shield of Crafting, you have 5 points of stamina (15 HP, to those whose stamina isn't maxed with RH) five points of strength (shockingly pointless to a class that can buff their strength by over 100) and ten points of CR, FR and MR. A total of thirty less resists. Balanced by the fact that the Ssrae shield has fifteen more to PR and DR, a total of thirty more resists.<br />
<br />
And then Flowing Thought 6. 15 HP vs FT6. Hm.<br />
<br />
Just some food for flowing thought; FT 6 is like having Clarity 1 on you as a permanent effect. 15 HP is like having an Orc Fang Earring.</div></div><hr />

Anything above about 1150 AC is a waste...  While Vulak's Shield is Hoss.. it's because of the HP/Mana, not the AC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Shamangod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Yeah, but that is exactly what they are saying Jenamdar...Minimalas returns beyond a point ...aka soft cap. But it's a moot point anyway, since if you go for hp items anyway your ac is going to shoot up anyway, since the high end items have high ac and hp.</div></div><hr />
