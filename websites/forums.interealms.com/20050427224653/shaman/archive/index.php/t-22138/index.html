<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bajen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted old familiar settings before I ventured in tho Old Paineel. I simply do not like diving with only one EB item on two chars in unfamiliar settings. *wimp*<br />
<br />
Well since my pally rules supreme in LGuk and almost all mobs have greened out to lvl 65 I tried my luck there. While moving down to safe hall and doing some pulls I had my shammy attacked only once and she made 30% on that short trip!<br />
<br />
I decided that putting up shop in short corridor at Arch Magus was the ticket. So I did that and logged for the day. Next time I logged on there was two people faction farming. I asked them if it was ok for my shammy to leech XP and having my pally sitting close as backup.<br />
<br />
They said yes. In a short while my shammy dinged 44. I decided that was enough. I gated shammy and memmed the new fancy spell including Stoism.<br />
<br />
Time for Hole. It was as fast as reported. I had to pull further in than ZI because kills were so fast. I just left when I wanted to sell and refresh KEI. The Loam Encrusted drops sell ok in Bazaar. :)<br />
<br />
After ding 45 I moved to PoK for KEI for both and lo and behold Brells stick at 45! :D I shopped JBB in bazaar. That was a good move!<br />
<br />
I have tried SolB for change. I can move slowly toward Efreeti but my pallys DPS is to slow to my liking so we left. When my shammy was 30% we relocated to Veksar since I love the zone. The XP is so so for shammy since the mobs at ZI is lb to paladin.<br />
<br />
I will however hang there since a mate and I like to hunt there. I bet a necro 59 with new pet will speed things up.<br />
<br />
It is amazing how augmented my pally gets by lvl 44 spells. What I do is pull warrior bloodgills and run to corner at stairs hitting attack.<br />
<br />
When mob wails on pally I sic dog on mob and follow up with Malot and slow. I then follow up with JBB clicks and Canni II to wear mob down and get mana to 100%.<br />
<br />
After fight I toss Stoism on pally and start all over. It is so easy. I can not wait until 49! My pally will be a killer machine in there. When we hunt deeper in with necro slowing and delivering DPS I expect XP to roll in. 8D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bajen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The XP for my shammy in a group with several elders was not good at all. It was however fun. At 45 she did stopped being useful at the fisrt undeads due to slow resists.<br />
<br />
Back to SolB it will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bajen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have been doing SolB mostly, some Ykesha Harbor and Nadox as well.<br />
<br />
Back in SolB my shammy dinged 47. Currently we are in Velks lab and 49% in the level.<br />
<br />
The spiders are way easier to handle than the imps/elementals in SolB. All in all I prefer the lab over the bats at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might want to think about starting the prayershawl quest; might as well put the silk drops to use :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bajen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh I dont know about that. My 55 chanter is currently waiting to get tooth and shell from SG for 7th leg of the shawl. I do not enjoy the skilling up involved. I only need to raise the smithing for the armor in 8th leg.</div></div><hr />
