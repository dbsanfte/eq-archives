<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Axcell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
My guild recently noticed myself and a monk puller splitting mobs by &quot;peeling&quot;. They volunteered her and I for a pulling/peeling workshop this weekend. Honestly I'd like some advice from fellow rangers or someone to point me to a guide somewhere if there is one. Basically she pulls, FD, when all but one mob is wandering off I shoot the one that has not started leaving. Is there more to it than this? I occassionaly still end up pulling two or more. Does range have anything to do with it? I would seriously love for someone with more experience to discuss this in a thread so I can give only good info to my guild this weekend instead of just lucky observations from my own trial and error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What affects there are to consider?<br />
<br />
Range<br />
Aggro/frenzy/assist range (ie social or not).<br />
pathing<br />
Level of puller/splitter<br />
<br />
There are a few others but with HoN's fast cast/recast time, that may definitely help on splitting mobs, esp the social ones.<br />
<br />
Edited:  I will be watching this thread too, since a ranger that does continue to learn and improve is a live ranger :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Axcell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Assuming ya mean Harmony of Nature. Yep that is a good point and I have used it in this instance to help with splitting. However, what my guild wants is for us to sort of teach a class that everyone can use. I'll demonstrate HoN for the Rangers and Druids cuz it does help greatly when peeling from the Monk. I also have to help the Pallies/SKs/Warriors learn to peel, so that will be out for them although pallies get Pacify right? <br />
<br />
You seem to be saying that it may be more dependent on the MoB than anything else? I need to run out and try this in the Gray - I know the social/help range of the mobs there is unbelievable. The places I have had the most success are Maiden's Eye and Kael Drakkel, where you can usually easily peel the one left standing after the others have started wandering off. hmm off to do some tests. I'll get back to ya on the Gray (TRAIN TO Mons!!!!!!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, historically, Harmony was changed from: <br />
10-21 11:05 Changed Slot 2 from &quot;Reaction Radius(15)&quot; to &quot;Reaction Radius(15/40)&quot; <br />
10-21 11:05 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Frenzy Radius(15)&quot; to &quot;Frenzy Radius(15/40)&quot;<br />
<br />
As noted above (Harmony effect that was changed) there is a reaction radius and frenzy radius.<br />
<br />
Level puller/splitter to lvl of mob has an effect too.<br />
<br />
Take pulling the Chief camp in ME.<br />
<br />
A lvl 60 can single pull if at full spawn (without use of HoN), but take a lvl 55 and he will get adds.<br />
<br />
Thus the splitter should be the lvl 63sk instead of the lvl 55 warrior (still dependent on lvl of mob and type of mob status).  Some zones can be worse than others.</div></div><hr />
