<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey fellow shammies,<br />
<br />
Just wanted to post to tell everyone of the crappy day I had last week playing.  Then it dawned on me, is this the norm?  Doubt it, but i'm not completely convinced.<br />
<br />
1.  9:00 am.  Cazic thule, i'm 2 boxxing with my cleric.  No-one else in the zone, a 63 rogue comes in and shouts 63 rogue LFG.  Knowing he's a rogue, I straffe around the mob i'm fighting to watch him.  He must of been pick pocketing, because he kept gettting close to the back of the mob.  I tell him that i'm powerleveling my cleric and please don't pick pocket my mobs.  He then decides to start picking from all the mobs in the courtyard, even though he knows i'm fighting them.  Next thing I know is, about 20 mobs are chasing him to the zone,  both my 2 characters die.  After sending him a tell, he swears at me, calling me names.<br />
<br />
2.  3:00 pm  Karnors Castle.  I get called to a raid to do Venril Sathir.  We do a number of camp checks, no one claims him, so we claim him.  As we are forming groups, a number of people from a different guild are entering the zone.  We do more camp checks and reply that we have venril.  We move to the room to fight sathir.  As we drop into the room, 8 people from that guild I mentioned earlier pulls and kills the mob.  <br />
<br />
3.  10:00 pm  Ice Clad.  I get called to a 8th shawl raid.  21 people in the zone, 18 of which were in our raid and standing around the general guy by the water.  We were within 5 minutes or less of starting the quest.  A person from a know ass hole guild on our server walks up and starts the quest, then agro's the general and starts kiting him around.  Make a long story short, we killed the general, and nobody got there shawl that night.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it just me or does it seem that the ethics in the game are either gone or used to justify others poor actions.  ie. I think 99% of eq players would agree that there is an unwritten rule about camp, or camping mobs.  However, you won't see anything about camps in the eula.  <br />
<br />
Enough venting,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its part of the game. <br />
<br />
Karma is also part of the game. **** happens ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really hate people like that. Fortunatly I don't run into them too often.<br />
<br />
It sucks how they seem to be able to get away with any thing they want but if you do something back the GM's would be all over you. I hope you petitioned and reported them. And do it every day until something is done about it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Come to Vallon Zek. That sort of behaviour is not something that you can get away with ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As bad as its sounds there are some people out there who actually get pleasure by ruining other peoples fun.  What you describe happens all the time on almost every server, and although prexus is lucky to have decent people, crap still happens.<br />
<br />
However, like was said earlier karma has a way of evening things out.  Yesterday me and my guild beat a rival guild down to the High Priest area in Ssra temple.  The rival guild seeing that we had the numbers first decided to go look for another target.  After killing the high priest on our first ever attemp and still weary from our 30 minute fight we head to kael for our next target which was the AoW, only to find our rival guild already massing the numbers there.  We talked with them to confirm that they were indeed after the AoW so we went on our way.  At the same time there was  guild B  in the zone, a guild that has a reputation for ksing, cockblocking, and leapfrogging , massed their forces at the arean with the guild A.  When guild &quot;A&quot; had finally cleared out the arena and had killed the statue guild &quot;B&quot; decided to pull over them the idol.  What they didnt know was that a gm was in the zone observing the entire thing and after guild &quot;b' wiped, the gm casually walked the idol over to guild &quot;A's force whereas they killed it and soon afterward the AoW</div></div><hr />

You mean like this:<br />
<br />
A person from a know ass hole guild on our server walks up and starts the quest, then agro's the general and starts kiting him around.  Make a long story short, we killed the general, and nobody got there shawl that night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well said, Jaradis.<br />
<br />
Some things aren't acceptable under any circumstances, unless you want to contribute to your server's slide into honorless anarchy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Over the years I've noticed people in EQ getting worse and worse in this regard.  Its hard to point a finger and say for sure what's at fault.. .I think a big part of it is that more children are playing.  Reason I think this is its common to say u, ur, pst, plz, thx, and other such things, whereas a few years ago nobody would put up with that.  I also think that the average player these days is more of an addict.  I'll be the first person to admit that I'm addicted to EQ, although I am an honorable person.  Most people without some sort of addiction to this game or other have left by now, due to SOE's actions.  I know I want to, but just can't bring myself to do it.  I think people addicted to something are more likely to be less honorable people.. take a look at crackheads, alcoholics, etc..  /rant off  /flame-retardant suit on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Vivala,<br />
      By reading your timeline, it looked as though you were playing EQ for over 13 hours in one sitting !!??!!  Is that true?  How common is that for the people on this forum?  All I can say is WOW!!</div></div><hr />

And until you see what you are doing wrong here the cycle will continue. More than half of everquest is interacting with others. Some are good at it. Some arent. <br />
<br />
Most aren't actually ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just a bad day I'm thinking.  Just yesterday, I logged on and did the ultimate sin.  I popped into the FoB, saw a shaman also at the PoK book, and immediately begged for sow.  I was playing my twink cleric at the time.  By the time I got the question off he had already run off some ways, but still came back and hooked me up.  Good shaman that.  Maybe trying to make up for the fact that he was a frog (just kidding)!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Stuff like that has happened forever, from the AC in South Ro for the Jboots to Dragon steeling.  Remember the manaburn nerf?  Remember the changes made to the cleric epic for just that reason?<br />
<br />
I regularly get buffs that I don't ask for, and get healed by passing strangers when I'm doing my canni dance.  I'll worry about everything going to hell in a hand basket that kind of thing stops happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for all the replies,<br />
<br />
2 things i'd like to respond too.<br />
<br />
1.  No I didn't play for 13 hours straight,  hehe,  I was on and off all day.<br />
<br />
2.  I defense of our raid killing the general, I do understand that 2 wrongs don't make a right.  Our raid at first was attempting to mem-blur the general, but the guy that was kiting him kept attacking him.  This brought the general down fairly low on health.  I actually never casted/attacked the general.  I wrote the original post not so much as a complaint but more of a question.  I didn't really care that we got ks'd in KC, I did enjoy sitting there listening to everyone argue afterwards.  <br />
