<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I keep seeing people post about soloing with no downtime with a JBB.  I'm curious about the methods used in that, as it seems like it would be difficult to channel an 8 second cast time often enough to be worthwhile.  <br />
<br />
I have a runed etched icewurm fang (12/19 81pt DD), so I'm also wondering if my current method of just meleeing with a pet  biting his backside is just as efficient.  I generally only use a slow and maybe a low level disease dot in addition to my self buffs.  <br />
<br />
Lastly, I'm curious if my ability to solo without using many offensive spells will decrease as I level up (currently 46).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From my memories of melee/dot/pet soloing, the rate at which the JBB does damage blows melee and dots away.  The JBB should do about as much damage per second as two of our 49 poison dots stacked together, and its free.  It is actually quite easy to channel through hits with a JBB, much easier than channeling an actual spell it seems.<br />
<br />
The JBB will be even more useful at level 51 when you get the highest level slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My method (and it seemed to work well for me):<br />
<br />
Go into tank mode.  This includes going for AC/HP gear more so than WIS gear, but a good balance is fine.  But most importantly is that you will need to buff yourself to your best abilities so that you can take the hits.<br />
<br />
The JBB is very easy to channel through, almost surprisingly easy.  It's not rare for me to take 3-4 very hard hits and still channel through a cast of it.<br />
<br />
Basically, you'll use the same strategy you are now, only that instead of meleeing, you'll just be constantly clicking your JBB.  The pet is still a breathing DOT, and you still tank for him, only difference being that your primary damage output is now the JBB instead of your melee.<br />
<br />
One thing, though: the REIF is still a great weapon to use for this, just because it likes to proc quite often when your DEX is high.  Keep auto attack on and you'll get in a hit after every JBB cast.  Sometimes, the hit will also be a proc of the REIF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soloing with a JBB is much easier with much less downtime than the melee/dot/pet strategy at my level (48). I had a REIF until recently and while I loved that spear, I can solo so much better using the JBB as my main weapon (adding in dots as the situation demands). I find that I can channel through quite a bit and am interrupted only rarely. I do use the pet and I make sure to slow the mobs as it makes getting off a JBB-blast easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lichtbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">can anyone please tell me what a JBB is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A Jaundiced Bone Bracer, it has a right clicky that does a 250pt DD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anng</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hunting with a JBB,  it became apparent that it wasnt the perfect tool for  soloing.<br />
<br />
it has a great  DD,  but it will almost always break your root and cause the mob to rush you.<br />
<br />
A JBB  is best used as additional free blasting when you are in a raid or with a group of healers and one tank with good agro control.  most fights will last about 1 min and you should be able to do about 1k- 1500 dmg in that time.<br />
<br />
a Shamans best weapon would be  Slow, root and probably the BLIGHT hammer.. which will do a small DD and proc a nice DoT. Using it,  you can pull with slow,  smack it until you get it to proc, then root,  back off and Cann and med ( never cann below 2 bubs of health while fighting mobs in groups.. it will cause agro right to you).<br />
<br />
Using this method.. you are really using your mana for heals and root.. and slow if you need it again.  full health?   hit him with your JBB.  it takes about 9 seconds to cast, and I have generally found that halfway thru my cast,  the root breaks and the mob is in my face.<br />
<br />
to sum this up..  a JBB is best used with a melee partner + pet. cant beat it, you stay whole and your meat shield does the work.<br />
<br />
NOTE: if you like melee while in group... get a Barb Spiritists Hammer, and a JBB and go to town..  NOTHING.. beats blasting with your JBB and then getting 2 procs right after with your hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">JBB is best used with high ac and a regen BP (Iksar or Fungi.)<br />
<br />
Just slow a mob. Back up against a wall so you don't get pushed from hits and blast the mob with JBB. Heal yourself if it's really needed. Your pet will deal about one third to half the damage you do with JBB. The mobs dies fast and you use little mana. Keep a regen buff on yourself all the time. Canni between JBB blasts if you regen faster than the mob can hit you for.<br />
<br />
Wisdom is not going to help you much in this kind of soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your ac is decently high and you keep regen on yourself, it doesn't really matter that the jbb breaks root. You can still channel through quite a few hits, especially if you slow the mob,  and if your ac is good, you won't take that much damage. A high damage weapon, regardless of delay, is better in this situation as the cast time for the jbb is so long. You can still root mobs, of course, and heal yourself if you're taking too much damage or getting too many interrupts, but for the most part, stand your ground and cast between hits. A pet is still nice to have, in my opinion, but not always necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To the person saying JBB is only useful when in groups and raids,I'm afraid you're completely mistaken.<br />

Pull the mob with slow and chain nuke with JBB,let him beat on ya it doesn't matter.I get interrupted about 1 in 10 shots,if that.Even on bad interrupt streaks,like 3 in a row,its no big deal.<br />
<br />
I end most fights against med / low blues at around 4 bubbs of life and mana . SOmetimes,if the fight went exceptionally well,full health =) .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tweadle, why would you buff with Harness and not just tuna?  Tuna is a few hundred mana less and for what you are doing, provides no benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">True,but i have to flip to like page 30 in my spell book to mem Tuna =),faster to cann back the mana and regen while im lookin for my next target =) . I do group quite a bit too so i keep HoS near the front of my book =)<br />
<br />
In additon , the str from HoS is nice when im hunting HG's,as i have been doing lately . Lots of fine steel adds up quick in weight .<br />
<br />
The dex buff is'nt totally useless either  ,as my auto-attack is on and my howling harpoon may proc between JBB blasts =) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mukka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Save money and buy a horse, even the cheapest one is ok. U'll be in a medding mode while u r clicking the JBB. I always end up with full mana after a battle :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I buff myself with HoS, agility for JB boots, regrowth and horse. I give pet alacrity.<br />
<br />
I pull out horse<br />
<br />
Pull with slow tank and click JBB<br />
<br />
On good xp giving mobs I med up the mana before the fight is over.  (I.e I barely even look at mana or canni and I can spare buffs to passer-bys)<br />
<br />
On tough mobs (I haven;t done many but will use corrupted seafury as an example) I do the same thing and just heal myself with sup heal when needed. Hopefully I will med mana back before next heal is needed. Meanwhile pet and JBB do mana-free damage.<br />
<br />
I soloed the corrupted at 52 when he was white (not that great I know) but it was easy with horse and JBB, and considering he summons I doubt I could have done the same with root rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The JBB makes soloing incredibly easy :)  Channelling through the hits is not at all bad either.<br />
<br />
Since Harness has been nerfed, I've been experimenting with Shroud and Kragg instead, for the higher hp and ac.  I have a Hammer of the Dragonborn, which means I don't buff agi but I have +20 to the physical stats from it.  <br />
<br />
On top of that, I use JB armour buffs, which offsets the mana cost of Shroud and Kragg.<br />
<br />
The result is that downtime is quite low, although I like to keep 60 mana just in case something unexpected needs to be rooted or fled from :)<br />
<br />
Once you get your epic, you likely won't be using that REIF, so no more proc, unless you have fetish for changing out weapons.  The stats are just too good to put down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">don't forget to press auto attack on while click the toy, you will do free attack from weapon between swing, that is not much but fun to watch you little melee damage<br />
<br />
when you have 49 pet, I ususlly use pet tank and free JBB with good distance, and pet usually can hold whole agro and have half hp left and regen back very fast, just  make sure it is good pet (hit 49,51) and alway put haste on for pet agro, JBB really make solo left big difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i always equip a 2hb when I JBB for the extra damage between blasts. i picked up a 28/41 hammer from CT (Heavy Stone Greathammer) which drops all the time and was free.</div></div><hr />
