<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see off the main forum index, there are forums for other upcoming games, like WoW, but none for EQ2.<br />
<br />
Can one be added?<br />
<br />
I know the EQ2 is a hot/cold issue with some people, all the more reason to talk about it, though.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EQ2 isn't in beta yet, thats why theres no forum i think.</div></div><hr />

It is in beta, but only at the 'friends and family' stage.<br />
<br />
Zethrir</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it is in beta, but its closed. The most recent article I read said there were about 600 people in it right now, all invited.<br />
<br />
Anyway, lots of the other class boards, Druids and Enchanters, I know of particularly, have forums, so I thought I'd suggest it, thats all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Should have a section for it regardless of how many &quot;I wont ever play another Sony game&quot; people there are. Otherwise we'd be as close minded as some of the EQ1 devs are to new ideas for class balance. It's in closed beta now and character creation discs have been handed out already for those who preordered from select retailers.</div></div><hr />

Well, then, we probably need a new forum just so those who don't want to hear about it can avoid those topics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amen to that.  <br />
<br />
We can call it the &quot;I * WILL * get fooled again,&quot; forum. (Apolgies to The Who)</div></div><hr />
