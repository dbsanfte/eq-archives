<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been meaning to post this here for a long time, and just read a comment about invis that reminded me.<br />
<br />
Up until about 3 months ago invis for me was a bitch, it would drop every time, every single time well before 30 secs was up and if it it did last longer it would drop without warning. Basically...incredibly unreliable...to the point I became paranoid when using it.<br />
<br />
I am sure I was not alone in that opinion.<br />
<br />
Then I made a Ceramic Shield (forget the name) and popped in my range slot when buffing.<br />
<br />
Immediatley I noticed invis was not dropping as often, and lasting longer  (doh) but not just 25% longer I am takling maybe 300-500% longer (simply due to the improved 'stability' of the spell IMO)<br />
<br />
At the time I put it down to a combination of luck, co-incidence and the EE foci on the shield.<br />
<br />
But like I said above, its been 3 or more months, and this is still happening....everytime, to the point that I only EVER cast invis with the shield equipped.<br />
<br />
For example I invis on the hill outside Droga, run in and do a full loop of EVERY named in there (takes I guess 3 mins, maybe more) and I'm not rushing.....it never drops 9 times out of 10 I end up breaking it when I set up camp.<br />
<br />
Another example, in POTactics last night, I cast invis before zone in, zone in, run the the left room, stop chat to a Necro kiting in there for a minute, drop into the pit (already had lev up) do 2 laps of the Pit looking for named, scope out the wanderers in the pre-pig-pen room, chat again to the Necro, at this point I'm guessing 2 mins have passed.<br />
I wander into the pen, nose around slowly conn-ing mobs watching for the see-invis ones, work all the way back to the Split Blade guy but no further cause he is up, work my way back out, chat to the guy some more, do another lap of the pit (at this point I am starting to get nervous that maybe I am becoming to carefree) and run back to the pig-pen and go in again to target the Split Blade guy so I can %T the name in guild chat for a friend. Easily 5 mins +, no re-invis.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand there are often times when I forget to put the shield in the range slot, and it seems almost everytime I get in trouble, and if I dont I have to refresh every minute or so.<br />
<br />
This is the norm for me now, I am wondering do other people with EE items have the same experiences?<br />
<br />
I would hav to say to those that dont already have a Ceramic Shield (or War?) ... get one, even if its for Invis alone, but maybe someone can show us (I hope ) that this happens with all EE items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use the Crown of Ambivlance and does it help with invis? <br />
Well it sparkles, and invis sure can last a long time. But it still just as likely drops when you least expect it to..I've  had it drop before I ever made it into HoHB. I've had it drop before making it through Castle 1 in PoF. <br />
<br />
In short, our invis still sucks. It CAN last a long time, but is also CAN drop at any given moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I bet level 14 invis is really unreliable...because I didn't get invis until level 29 :p In all honesty, though, I don't have any problems with invis...works quite well for me. :: knock on wood ::</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My EE3 item does jack-all for invis. :mad:  I'll see if I can dig up some logs with my invis dropping a few seconds after cast with my EE focus glowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i have noticed it lasting longer too, w/ scrm, and 20% belt.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are only three times that invis will drop.<br />
1. after the third tick, aka 18 seconds<br />
2. after the 2 minute mark, or 20 ticks.<br />
3. as the spell timer exprisers.<br />
<br />
The only thing that will drop invis barring those 3 things is pc casting/attacking, or a mob that sees through invis.<br />
<br />
Once you know this Invis becomes really reliable...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Icky I find that very hard to beleive do you have any log files to show that. I know for sure that there have been times that I have had invis drop on what would seem to be the first tick. Well it gives you the warning and actually drops 3 ticks later but the failed check is on the initial point you get the warning. Personally I have noticed that invis does seem more reliable since i've gotten extension aa/focus effects. Not sure why but it does seem to have improved things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had it drop as soon as it was on before.<br />
<br />
Most of the time though it works fine for me, seems to be very unreliable when casting it on other people though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ask all my melee friends who are needlessly slaughtered by shaman invis week-in week-out, I'm sure they will all heartilty agree with you :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">8th shawl flashes on invis too.  Seems to make a difference.  It still is based on the old 20/2/20 rule though imho.  Invis lasts either 20 seconds, 2 minutes, or 20 minutes  (This I have not tested, but I read about it here a couple years ago and have not found it to be glaringly inaccurate).  Add the appropriate % for your extension item.  <br />
<br />
I still think its dumb that we never get an invis upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">20/2/20 is 100% wrong.  All I can say is I was running into the HoH Trials area and I invis at zone line.... run past the first group of guards (MIGHT have been 20 I'll admit the first time might have made it 20 but I honestly dont think it did) and it starts to wear... so I find a nice quiet spot and cast invis.  Take two steps and it is fading... Recast invis.  Take two steps and it's fading... Recast invis.  Run to the trial area and it drops as I run in the room.<br />
<br />
4 drops in one charge to the Trials area.  2 of those times were instant drops.  I wasn't getting hit, I wasn't attacking and it certainly wasn't 20 seconds, 2 minutes or 20 Minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This one's a bit stranger due to the zoning in between the &quot;starting to wear off&quot; and appearing... one minute and 27 seconds, would have been one minute 33 seconds total (invis always seems to wear off six seconds after the warning).<br />
<br />
18sec/2min is a myth... if I wanted to go through my logs some more, I'm sure I could find a lot more like these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Revulsion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The most logical explanation of how it works, based on other EQ functions, is that it makes a check every tick.<br />
<br />
That would explain the above 6 seconds and 60 seconds (the 7 and 62 being due to the log not noting exactly when the server started &quot;counting&quot;).<br />
<br />
Everything else in the EQ universe (dots, buffs, regens, root breaking) happens on ticks, and its very likely that invis makes a check on the tick mark as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">its a completely UNRELIABLE spell no matter how much extended enhancement you have on your shaman.  I wish I had a log of the day i cast invis and had it IMMEDIATELY wear off for no good reason THREE times in a row.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feelings&quot; and &quot;seems-to's&quot; or other examples with nothing to back them up (no proof) say nothing about this.  Yes, the spell will last longer (assuming it doesnt break first) with an extended enhancement item or SCR/SCRM, but this has nothing at all to do with its reliability in a pinch.<br />
<br />
It sure would be nice if they made regular invisibility a fixed duration spell of ~10-20 minutes and improved invisibility ~20-40 minutes (or whatever seems balancing), but thats just my opinion.  I don't know why it isn't this way already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I couldn't agree more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've had it start to fasde before the spell gem has refreshed.  This is with SCRM and Zephyr of Brell.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly sure on 2 points;<br />
<br />
Invis checks every tick whether it'll fade or not.<br />
<br />
Invis is a complete pain in the arse due to its instability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I still don't think I have ever had an invis that lasted past 2 minutes and faded before the buff timed out.  Could be a myth, but it is a happy, comforting myth.<br />
<br />
Anything that happens within the first few ticks will be affected by lag and when, during a given tick, the spell went off, so all times will be +/- 6 seconds plus lag effects that are not really quantifyable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">[lol...was bored the other day and tried to check this in PoK.  Cast Invis on myself four times.  Three lasted approx 2 mins, one lasted approx 1 min.  Cursed several times about &quot;Why the hell does it last so long up here, but when I am someplace I need it, danged spell drops so fast?&quot;  Go figure.  I agree with most others, spell reliability sucks.  Wish they would give us an upgrade that is more reliable for a set period of time.  <br />
<br />
And BTW....is it just me or does other classes invis seem to last longer than ours?  Prolly just seems that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gather shadows (necro/SK) seems much more reliable than plain old invis, in my experience (have a 52 necro with insta clicky CoS).  Also seems like the check is based on your divination skill somehow, because it seemed to get much, much more reliable after I capped divination.  With div in the 150s, it rarely lasted more than 30 secs or so; now I fearlessly use it in all sorts of places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I, too, have seen invis wear off almost instantly, i.e. on the first tick after casting.  I have two EE items, the Crown of Ambivalence and the 8th shawl.</div></div><hr />

I read somewhere a long time ago that invis was more reliable for the enchanter class.  <br />

No data to back it up though :-)</div></div><hr />
