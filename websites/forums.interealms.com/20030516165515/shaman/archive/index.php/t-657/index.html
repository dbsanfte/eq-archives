<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Paludal Caves on Luclin...mobs range from lvl 6 to lvl 20ish.  Massive XP bonus in this zone.<br />
<br />
I started at lvl 9 soloing near the shadeweavers thicket area...each mob was giving me 2 blue bubbles of xp.  At lvl 12 it's 1.5 blues per mob...<br />
<br />
At level 19, soloing 1 mob = 1 blue of xp.  Easily gain 2 - 3 levels a night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korhad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What sort of gear are you using, might I ask? Just pulling with slow, and then beating on them, melee style? Heh, right now, I'm level 15, and looking for somewhere nicer than Oasis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did my adventuring in Paludal as a bard...my Shaman was already too high level when I discovered this place.  My bard was untwinked, so no special equipment needed.<br />
<br />
I don't have any tactics, but I know that from lvl 9 a single blue mob was giving 2 blues of xp...by lvl 22 the blue mobs were still giving more than 1 blue each.<br />
<br />
The fungal fiends have a really nasty disease proc...lasts for hours and is 2 dmg per tick...so basically if you get hit with disease you have to stop soloing until it's healed.  Because of this a lot of soloing classes have a hard time.<br />
<br />
You should be able to find a hunting partner no problems...just /ooc that you can cure disease and heal and they should love you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">shamns can cure disease :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I too was happy to discover the great experience that you get from the Pauldal Caverns....I have been grouping with various others over by Yelloweyes and the bandit camp near the ShadowHaven zone.  In one night (about 4 hours of play) I went from level 19 to 21!  I couldn't believe all the experience we were raking in.  This is definitely a place that I will recommend for exp grinding!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tehh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I always seem to miss the posts about new xp spots by about 2-3 levels :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>starrz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I usually partner with one other when fighting the fungal fiends to allow time for me to back off from the mob and cure disease.  And remember it takes three doses of the spell to actually cure the disease. :)</div></div><hr />
