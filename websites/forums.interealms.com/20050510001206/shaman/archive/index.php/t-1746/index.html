<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After a 9 month break, I think I might be coming back to eq..hehe!<br />
<br />
I've always loved playing a shaman and wish I still had mine, but that's neither here nor there.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what's out now in regards to gear, but I have a buddy of mine that's going to help me get started again.  He's loaning me 15k, but I've been beating my head in on what I should buy to get my little troll shaman started out.  <br />
<br />
I definately know I want 2 of the 6ac 65hps rings, but does anyone have any other suggestions?  I'm not looking for gear that I can use for the first 20 lvls, then trash.  If I'm gonna buy it, I want it to last me a while.<br />
<br />
Wasn't sure if most shaman wear totemic now, rygorr or some of the new armor that's come out with Luclin.<br />
<br />
Guess really I'm looking for suggestions on what I could get with my 15k.  The economy on The Tribunal server was going to crap when I left, so I can only imagine what it's like now.  <br />
<br />
I DO NOT look forward to spending time in EC...but I guess I'll just have to suck it up.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to posting here again and relearning the ways of the shaman.  Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sure, lemme think for 15K (and you said troll, right?)<br />
Keep in mind I'm not totally up to date on nice, mid level SoL shaman drops.<br />
<br />
Iksar regen bp - 4-5K<br />
ivory collar from Chardok - 1K<br />
Enshrouded veil - 1K<br />
Flayed turmoil skin belt, smited girdle (from Scarlet Desert), spider belt  - 500 plat (smited girdle might be more, unsure)<br />
JB helm, gloves, arms, boots - no more than 500 each<br />
Shield - SBS 3K (do shield of falsehood quest, free!)<br />
Jade prod, howling harpoon, slimey spear - very cheap (howler is great for range item, 40 mana) I'm not really good with melee weapons, so hopefully some other shaman will chime in with advice<br />
Gloves - CC gloves 4K (very nice, high AC, mana...coldain skin are also great but might be a little pricey, not sure what they are going for these days)<br />
<br />
Trouble items:<br />
<br />
pants - are there any good droppable pants? I know the no drop ones from Kael arena are nice, and there is a semi-nice pair of pants from a GD quest<br />
<br />
Cloak - anything new out of SoL? I remember I wore a mammoth cloak until 59</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lets see, these are my server price, not sure about yours but cant be that much in difference<br />
<br />
Ears = Forest Loops = 250p<br />
Fingers = 6ac 65hp rings = 500p<br />
Face - Arctic Wyvern Mask = 300p<br />
Helm = JB Helm = 600-800p<br />
Neck = Ivory Imbued Collar = 1k or if your a Troll do the Regeant Symbol quest.<br />
Wrists = Pair of Rygorr Bracers = 100-200p Nathsar Bracers 400p<br />
Arms = JB Arms = 600-800p<br />
Hand = JB Gaunts = 600-800p<br />
Shoulders = Tattered Mantle =300-400p<br />
Belt = Flayed tumolskin(sp) belt for 600-700 or get a straw spun belt cheap for 30-50p.<br />
Feet = JB Boots = 600-800p<br />
Legs = Rygorr = 200-400p<br />
Back = Cloak of Rygorr Orcle = 300p or Mammoth hide cloak = 600p<br />
Shield = Clay Gaurdian Shield = 400p<br />
Weapon = Lots of choices here - Slime coated harpoon is nice 500p and howling harpoon for 1k, either go in range, also Jade Prod about 800p and for 1hb wraith bone hammer is decent - 200p<br />
<br />
Chest, now you should have plenty left over for Iksar Cernonial Chestplate.<br />
<br />
This gear should last awhile, I would save what ever you have left for spells personally, maybe upgrade face to crystal spider eyes 1k and your JB gear for Crystal chitin gear but big price difference from JB to CC.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is just what I was looking for Gloriana and Scurg.  Thank you very much.  I'll write all that down and see if I can get those prices on Tribunal.  Thanks again for the help.  Really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">for earings you can also get some 25 mana 35 hp 2 ac earings that are jewler made.  Also for secondary you can get that one idol of Gsomething, its in my profile, along with alot of the other stuff mentioned here.  I would look and write down the correct name, but the school computers dont like magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah..the HP gear would be very beneficial in the early levels...as well as later on.  Wis seems to be very easy to raise with some of the gear that comes later, so I might see if I can pick up a pair of those earrings rather than the forest loops.<br />
<br />
Thanks again! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">be sure to come back and post a magelo when you get all your stuff, i wanna see what you decided on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe..sure will.  <br />
<br />
I think I'll probably have to spend the next couple of hours/days in EC :/<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help!</div></div><hr />
