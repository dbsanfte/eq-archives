<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I may as well kick this off. <br />
<br />
Reading the live chat someone asked about Zing and Acumen. They said &quot;We're removing the old Invigor type effects for now. It's possible we'll be adding Endurance regen abillities later on but for now we don't want melee to be an(sic?) more dependant on getting buffs to make use of the new system.&quot;<br />
&quot;We decided to do that because it's really an entirely new system, and has very little to do with how the old stamina bar worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was also mentioned that jumping will cause a small decrease in Endurance so IMO this is STA.<br />
<br />
I asked if this meant a nerf to Acumen but I was not answered. <br />
<br />
Kind of odd that they would wipe out Invigor entirely. It is used on some items no? Lets at least hope they give us the spell for Endurnace regen if it ever sees the light. If it went to enchanters after taking it from us (if that is indeed the case) that would suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It really would make the most sense to have the best endurance line of spells go to the shaman. Melee stats are our forte. I'd say shamans first off, then druids, then clerics maybe. <br />
<br />
But definitely shamans first. I definitely see why they're taking the spells out though, not only would it be a bit overpowering.. it'd also take up precious buff slot real-estate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">considering the old stamina bar meant absolutely nothing, I will shed no tears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the only reason for them to take that line of spells out would be that they were not going to add an entirely new Endurance bar, but instead use what we call the Stamina Bar today.  I just hope that they do implement something for the classes that they will take this ability away from.  The line of spells are nearly useless in their current form, but they would actually have a purpose in the planned form.  Also, they will have to completely remove the only song bards get at level 3, and remove the effect from several other bard songs if they plan on removing this line of spells.   <br />
<br />
I know they are doing it because in their current form they can keep anyone at full Endurance indefinitely, but the easy way to remedy this would be to increase the capacity of the Endurance bar to be equivalent to that of mana and hitpoints for casters and melee classes, and set the usage for the new abilities so they use massive chunks equivalent to spells and their mana cost.  This would allow Shaman and Bards to have the melee form of clarity and not be overpowering and priests could still use their lower level stamina replenishment spells to help some in emergencies.<br />
<br />
I guess I just don't see a reason to take these spells out of the game the second they would have actually been useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Please no buffs of any kind for the new endurance bar. I don't have the desire or the spell gems to &quot;twitch&quot; melees with endurance. Ask necros how much they enjoy giving mana to clerics. At least a group only usually has one cleric...with 4 melees? Screw that. They can get their own endurance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they still need test it alot im guessing<br />
i was mainly just worried about buff slot realestate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd like to see some form of long, slow over time endurance regen spell that is equivalent to KEI. This way we would not have to cast it every 2 secs (we already have avatar!) and give acumen a bit of a role. (not to mention more pp for us).<br />
<br />
&lt;rbarker&gt; We're removing the old invigor type effects that restored stamina entirely for now. It's possible we'll be adding endurance regen abilties later on but for now we don't want melee to be an more dependant on getting buffs to make use of the new system. <br />
<br />
I would expect some form of acumen spell eventually... since all casters are dependent on enchanters why not make melee dependent on shaman? We always have been the melee support class...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh well the only reason i still have Zing in my spellbook is when Pleveling Those low Sta Gnome warriors:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They'll probably just add an endurance regen spell with a recast time of 3 minutes and a duration of 6 minutes.  Oh, and it will use a blue diamond as a reagent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i'm not worried about it because they'll probably screw it up several times before they even rememer to &quot;fix&quot; the spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hope we see Acumen turn into a KEI like buff and the lower lines similar to clarity, I don't mind Bards having a slower sta regen song like their mana song (though at level 3 would be nearly pointless as the abilities don't show up till level 20)  however, if they drop the spells completely I think we should have Acumen turn into something new - loosing a level 50+ spell (for true sight :-P bleh no thanks) is huge.  not to mention  I want a new effect on my quest boot from Thurgadin, sure the boots aren't great but I got them so I didn't have to mem a spell for the stupid melees who thought sta did something, and wouldn't shut up without a &quot;zing&quot;  but augment and other similar enchanter spells better not trump us by any remotely close amount.  Unless we get SOME mana regen buff (being the only casting class with out one of any kind - and I did say buff not kill myself or twitch myself to carpal tunnel (don't get me wrong I love canni))<br />

<br />
Edit: There should be no Endurance regen added to the original Avatar spell in order to not increase the desireablity of &quot;Primal weapons&quot; over current weapons again. <br />
Just start with Primal Avatar and increase the Endurance regen for Feral and Ferine Avatar accordingly.</div></div><hr />

Not surprising, most groups don't look for a shaman if they have a chanter in it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wulfbane-i try not to go into ldon with chanters..most of them are to sissy to charm and i don't see any other point in takeing them with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I actually have had this discussion within my own guild and a couple friends. I was all excited that Acumen might be the new kei. Now, it won't and that just bites. <br />
<br />
Personally, I'm a barbarian shaman, which means I have acumen up alot anyways...I'm blind you know :) and it lasts twice as much as Ultravision...which is what acumen always was, except for extremely rare lawnmowing twinks using heavy weapons for the stam regen part. I guess my dreams of /ooc Casting Acumen for donations. in PoK has died. /rude SOE. On the other hand...I won't have to cast it on every melee class in group. Yay. <br />
<br />
I'm working on trying to get an Ultravision aug and free up a buff slot. Yay me. Then acumen will only be used on groupies that are blind or need seeinvis. /yawn<br />
<br />
Chanters in Ldon? Really? Are you sure? I haven't seen it. Think I have been on one Adventure with a chanter...<br />
<br />
I've seen groups with chanters, groups without in LDoN. Big deal :) I like chanters, love having VoQ when I'm in there, but I can root CC one of the usual incoming 3 mobs, root maybe another, and then slow the lot...taking hits here and there, and rarely die with a good group. Chanters are fantastic CC, true...but if that mezz breaks they'll die far faster than I will. Each class has their pros and cons, like always.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[21:22] &lt;rbarker&gt; The new abilities will be acquired by taking a &quot;skill tome&quot; to your guild master and he'll teach you the skill. Most of the basic skill swill be available on vendors, while a few high level ones will be drops. Right now we're planning on giving almost all of the sub 60 skills on merchants and having the 60+ skills using a system similar to the parchments quests in Planes of Power. From there on out we'll most likely make use of the same m<br />
[21:23] &lt;rbarker&gt; From there on out we'll most likely make use of the same methods that you already use to acquire any other type of item.<br />
<br />
<br />
All I can do is laugh my ass off at this.  Its gonna be funny to see the frustration that warriors, monks , and rogues have when they recieve the SAME skills from parch turn ins that have plagued caster classes from the beginning (And even back to Kunark and the train wreck that was spell exchange then).<br />
<br />
Of course, Sony will probably make it easier for them and have the 'skill tomes' add an AA like point that can be used to purchase the next desired zskill.  But MAN Im hoping it goes the other way.  Share the love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Very VERY longtime reader of this Board . Havent ever posted anything though untill now . Allways wanted too but never really got around too regestering . This Issue though made me wanna post .<br />
Pretty much what I wanna say is that I feel its pretty crappy that I have put up with melee requests for Acumen forever eventhough its mostly a useless buff . Just so that the melee's could feel happy about there full yellow bar . Then the very moment that it looks like the spell MIGHT be usefull in some way ... THEN SoE decides too Remove the Spell !!! <br />
BS in my Opinion ... and if the KEE &quot;Sta regen&quot; line of spells goes live and they give them too enchanters how BOGUS would that be ?<br />
I feel like regening Sta has been a part of our class , not just with the insta Invigor type spells but with KEI like Sta over time ones &quot;IE Acumen&quot;<br />
Its been an ability that we have had , regardless of how usefull it was it was ours . But now that it might be a usefull ability ... They remove it ... Smacks of BS IMO .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'll have to agree with Grimbear. After years of getting bugged for acumen, the minute they make the spell useful it's nerfed. Knowing SOE, it's gonna be replaced by something that lasts 15 minutes and is single target only. Group acumen, at least, wasn't a hassle to keep up if whatever new spell we get is different, there's gonna be at least one pissed of shaman here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Anyone have the link to the site where the new changes were told? Can't seem to find it...</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I realise this, yet if Avatar had a Endurance regen component that would allow the tank to use /disc defensive for a longer period or just more often, he would probably feel inclined to lose some of his ATK in favor of enhanced tanking ability.<br />
So to prevent any sort of inflation due to this, i suggestedto jus leave the original Avatar spell alone(which is the one on primal weapons).<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: This would obviously only matter for groups without a Shaman to cast a spell version(i.e. one that doesn't count toward the worn ATK cap of 250).</div></div><hr />

I don't want a stamina regen buff, unless it's insanely long-lasting (read: KEI-like duration), or a (gods forbid)stamina heal.  I already don't have enough spell gems:<br />

1. Tnarg's &lt;--- never unmemmed<br />
2. Torpor (soon to be Q) &lt;--- ditto<br />
3. Malo &lt;--- ditto<br />
4. Turgur's &lt;--- ditto<br />
5. A DD, DoT, Tigir's, or Grummus, depending on situation<br />
6. Petrifying Earth &lt;--- never unmemmed<br />
7. Can IV &lt;--- never ever ever unmemmed<br />
8. My current swap-out slot, hopefully soon to be permanently occupied by FA, making me swap out slot 5 to buff or malosinia...<br />

Point taken but the refernce was not about solo'ing.. it was about LDoN.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see any chanties charm anything duing LDoN adventure and i've done over 125 of them now..  Granted i've only had chanty in group about 20% of that time, but still none of them have even thought or said anthing about charming mobs in LDoN..  (I don't play a chanty or druid or any other charmable class so i have NO idea what mobs are or are not DC/charmable)<br />
<br />
Spin Off....  If this is possible, i'm sure it is, is there a list of Charmable mobs in LDoN?  Regualar, Hard?<br />

<br />
Imagine if they do yank the STA regen component of Acumen. These spells still cost something. I just think we should voice a little concern in case they want to try and do it to a line we actually care a lot about someday. And yes I would even feel this way about group CHA :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you sure. I can certain I have seen all sorts of stuff charmed in LDoN in the last week: twisters in MM, crystal rock thingies in Tak for example. And yes charmed mobs do insane dps. They also killed our chanter 3 times in one mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">You're not gonna see a STA Cheal chain.  For one- the melees would have to have enough &quot;opportunities&quot; to bottom out their stamina fast enough to require one.  And second the abilities would have to take enough endurance to do that.  If they are gonna take enough endurance to do that its gonna be similar to a wizard nuking something to the ground.  I don't see something like that going down.  They were talking about +mana items adding to a melee stamina - or so I interpolated, so I feel it will be more like *mana* and not like Stamina, so a regen buff - akin to KEI - is what someone will get if they get anything.  As- that wouldn't be buff dependant per sea - any more than a caster *needs* a clarity.  Maybe they'll have FT for endurance heh heh heh....   By the way... did anyone notice the other side a shaman has in this endurance debacle?  Iendurace will be based on melee stats... not melee *stat*  Str Sta possibly Dex or Agi?  what do you think will stat buffs come into their own more now?</div></div><hr />

I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks this.  I can easily spend 50-66% of my time during raids buffing rezzed (cause someone always dies) or newly arrived people, amongst other duties I'm trying to do (debuffs, heals).   I do not have the gem space as is for more crap.   Of all the other classes that buff, I fail to see why shamans have to be so overburdened with more than the others.  But, it seems many here from reading past threads, just love to buff, buff, buff.  Buffing is not challenging nor fun, but can easily result in a headache.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">porgy maybe it will be based on charisma, that will be good for a laugh.<br />
it don't see nurfing the stamina regen on acumen anything of significance for anyone that doesn't want to jump.  as it stands now the stamina bar is worthless for anything but jumping...<br />
<br />
little more thread highjack.  in my experiance 99% of chanters don't use charm in ldon, that is why i don't bother with them.  i saw a chanter with bought and 1 groupable gear (with the 1 item of raid gearing being his worst item), who is about 6k hp raid buffed, tank his charm break pets in normal till he recharmed (these were hasted pets).  then again the guy 4 boxes hard mode useing the pets to clear whole rooms without bothering to have his SK tank until charm breaks(i would be willing to wager a hasted duel weilding hard pet is at least 1k to 1.5k dps).<br />
imo anyone that doesn't know about charm needs to do some research on the most overpowered and broken skill in the game, then watch charm applied by a good chanter...</div></div><hr />

Any chanter that is not charming a pet at the first opportunity is kicked from our groups. Chanter (and to a lesser extend Necro/mage/druid) charm makes missions so easy and fast it is insane.</div></div><hr />

Too that I would say this . How much crap would chanters raise if KEI had its mana regen componant removed ? Would they be pleased becase then noone would ask them for KEI ?<br />
The reson people would want acumen &quot;was it not going too be nerfed&quot; It becase it would be USEFULL . By saying yourselves that people would want it you are admiting yourselves that it would be desired and usefull.<br />
So basicly you didnt mind having the spell when it was useless .. but should it become usefull youd prefer it be removed ... /boggle .</div></div><hr />

- So was mine.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see any chanties charm anything duing LDoN adventure and i've done over 125 of them now.. <br />
- Nothing is more beautiful to watch than a chanter or necro charmed pet tearing up mobs like there is no tommorow. Maybe you group with incompetent enchanters?<br />
<br />
Spin Off....  If this is possible, i'm sure it is, is there a list of Charmable mobs in LDoN?  Regualar, Hard?<br />
- Mummies in Mistmore, Wolves in Rujak, Stone guy thingies in Takish, Eyes (I think) in Guk and ugh ... something in Miragul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Grim, not only will it be a big pain in the ass it won't really be USEFULL at all.<br />
<br />
They are going to balance the new abilities based on melee characters getting x END per tick.  They have 2 options to implement this (correctly, they could go the ole' lets make way too powerful or way underpowered route):<br />
<br />
(a) give melee a regen of x END per tick<br />
or<br />
(b) give melee a regen of (x-y) END per tick and then give us yet another annoying ass buff that increases a melee's regeneration by y per tick and eats up yet another buff slot.  Preferably with fun stacking issues, a short duration and maybe for extra shrink-like fun, make it group only!<br />
<br />
Maybe if it had a huge duration like KEI (fat chance even SoE will make that mistake again) and you wanted to whore yourself out in PoK like a crackdealing chanter it would be a benefit to the shaman class.  Otherwise, it would just be another pain in the ass IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Tokaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I'd prefer not to have a long KEI duration Endurance regen spell.  Why?  Well, I already know a good number of people who used to be of the mind that a Shaman was an essential part of a group, for buffs and debuffs.  That's changed, there are more and more people who would rather get buffs from a Shaman and then go with a BST in the group, especially in LDoN.<br />
<br />
BST and Enchanter slows are viable in xp groups, and BST's can bring some nice melee DPS to the table. In situations where charmed pets are involved I often don't have a chance to get full effect out of a DoT after debuffing the mob, so Shaman DPS isn't great when mobs are lasting under 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't sell buffs anyway, so it isn't like I'd stand to rake in the plat from hawking a melee version of C3.  It would just reduce our roll in non-raid grouping to have an Endurance regen with a 2+ hour duration.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts, I guess we'll see how it plays out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Ok. Sitting from a caster point of veiw who plays a fair amount of mellee.  2 warriors past 50, twink monk blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
KEI works great for casters, BUT IT IS NOT ESSENTIAL ( yea, time for flames from the crackheads ).<br />
<br />
I personally think that haveing a 2hour+ endurance regen spell castable by us would be NICE, being able to increase endurance pool would be NICE.  Not only would those things be NICE they may be vital for gameplay imo.  <br />
<br />
No, I'm not going to sit and ho myself for PP in PoK, not going to ho a bot either, don't care to, but if they are going to put in endurance regen it better last a buttload of time so it doesn't make us absolutly essential, and the abilities should not be geared around there always being someone around to buff endurance regen, but there should be a way for it to be enhanced, cause it would be NICE to have done.  Anyone here remember the time before clarity?  From what I hear, it sucked, cause sometimes you just want your mana bar to increase abit faster.  <br />
<br />
Of course you know this cause your shamans, I don't suppose any of you bought cann5 with your 173rd AA?  No you bought it with your 23rd or so because you want more control over how quickly you regain mana, not just for effectiveness, but really, for the control of it.<br />
<br />
Now, should there only be some uber lvl 65 3 hour buff? Of course not, it should be gradiated from bout lvl 30 probably, single only blah blah blah breeze, clarity, group clarity, clarity 2, blah blah blah, you get the picture.  <br />
<br />
Anyway you want to look at it what they are doing is adding spells and mana to mellee, they should of course learn from their mistakes, haveing no mana regen spells was a mistake.  Makeing it available to only one class was a mistake.  blah blah blah chanters, bards, necro, beastlord, blah blah blah, we should of course end up in the chanter spot for quality of buff overall, bards should be same, clerics should get in on this perhaps shareing with druid in a necro kinda of twitch way, and beastlord being a  beastlord.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Clarity has been in the game since I started my first character, and that was December of 99 if I remember correctly.  I know that it was at least a few months before Kunark because I managed to get level 35 on my first character before Kunark came out.  Was there ever a time without clarity?  Besides the period of time when not many enchanters had made it to level 29?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference is that the mana regen in KEI provides a tangible benefit. The stamina bar regen in Acumen doesn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">As far as I am concerned.. I don't care if they remove Zing spells as such, but they better not mess up Acumen. I personally think that the Acumen should get the END regen bonus, sort of melee KEI (heck, melee VoQ even). Would make this spell worth the mana, and not be just a group UV buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Acumen should work like the Enchanter Spell, Augmentation, anyway. Give a little boost to everything. After all, &quot;acumen&quot; is a synomym for &quot;prowess&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">If Acumen really stays in the game it would be really bad. I would have to go back to Ssra and farm group acumen!!!<br />
<br />
On the other hand: If there will be new buff for endurance regen then either only the berserker will have it (to make sure that 98% of the EQ players make one) or everyone and his gnome pet has a spell or click item with it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Are you sure. I can certain I have seen all sorts of stuff charmed in LDoN in the last week: twisters in MM, crystal rock thingies in Tak for example. And yes charmed mobs do insane dps. They also killed our chanter 3 times in one mission.<br />
<br />
The limitations on what can be charmed don't kick in until higher levels. I know my chanter has been able to charm anything he's tried in LDoN at 55, but the posted list of charmable mobs is accurate in a level 65 group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">If and when they add a new endurance regen to the game, I for one would like to see them add it to our Talisman and focus spells.  These have a pretty good duration anyway, so its win/win.  I dont think the addition of new spells is totally necessary, but I do think that if they are added there will be a good duration to them.  A 15 minute duration spell is NOT a good idea and for all their other faults I do thik that SOE realizes that. I dont think that it will be the 2+ hour durations simmilar to KEI, but it would be nice to get into the 90-100 minute range.<br />
<br />
And don't think I would be above sitting in PoK for an hour or two every once in awhile to get money for spells/gear.  If the opportunity arises to make a little plat, count me in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">It would make sense that if they're implementing a new system for the endurance bars that they'd also implement some equivalent of the clarity line that would work for endurance instead. Shaman seems the logical choice to cast it. <br />
<br />
I'd love a new usefull buff as long as it lasts a while and there's a group version in there somewhere. Maybe they'll extend acumen into a line of spells with lower level versions with the endurance regen scaled appropriately. Would also be a nice trademark to differentiate us from the beastlords and chanters in the utility department.</div></div><hr />

Totally illthoughtout and useless comparison. Sta regen does NOTHING. MANA regen does.  Oh wait..I guess if I wanted to jump up and down for hours on end, then I'd need sta.  Stamina has been known to effect NOTHING in battle if it's at 0. It's stupid. That's why you see prior posts of people saying they hate &quot;zinging&quot;, because it's a waste of time. And if you'd actually read the news, you'd know that they are not going to be using stamina as the basis for the new abilites, but ENDURANCE. A new one. It will work differently than stamina and the stamina bar. They've already said that stamina regen will have no affect on it, so why whine? This just verifies to all the dip****s out there that they can quit asking for acumen &amp; zing to make that little bar go up. Move on.</div></div><hr />
