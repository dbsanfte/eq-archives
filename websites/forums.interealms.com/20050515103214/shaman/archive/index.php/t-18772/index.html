<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day I clicked on the Epic Walkthrough link on this forum. The add at the top of the page was for Yantis. I thought what the heck, &quot;wonder what they're selling plat for, how many characters from my server are up for sale, etc...&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of something funny/mean to do and was wondering if anyone knows someone that may have done this or what you think. I guess I wouldn't because I wouldn't sell my character.<br />
<br />
Anyway before you sell it to Yantis, say if you're a good race you would go around and ruin your faction with all the other good races. I don't think there is a faction in PoK and I'm not about to find out but that would be something else to add. That would be crazy to spend $500 on a character and not be able to go anywhere. A new player would have no clue what to do.<br />
<br />
I guess I would feel bad for the person that bought the character but that would be like feeling sorry for the guy that bought your stolen DVD player only to find out that it idn't work when they got it home. Or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm KoS to most cities, or some factions in cities.  It really doesn't make that much of a difference.   I think the only cities I'm not KoS to someone is Halas, Shadowhaven, and PoK.  I might not be KoS to gnomes or dwarves but I never ever need to go there so I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Problem with the way the faction system is in EQ is that no matter how many people you kill, you almost always gain faction with someone else.   Right now the dragons in Velious don't seem to care at all that I slaughtered their kind for over a year solid, including killing Yelinak and all the Ladies/Lords of NToV for months on end.  Just because I knocked off Tormax, Statue, and Avatar of War couple dozen times after killing their kind off, all is forgiven and I'm considered their bestest buddy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can kill NPCs in PoK (or.. could? this was months and months ago), but i cant remember if they have a faction or not.. i doubt it though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The importance of faction has dwindled to almost nothing, I agree that pre-PoP it'd have been pretty amusing, but now it really doesn't matter.  I disagree with &quot;I guess I would feel bad for the person that bought the character&quot; - people that create the demand are the reason scuzb.. er, 'people' like Yantis are around.  The whole deal with him selling plat &amp; hiring Chinese labor to farm it and 65's who know not what they're doing really kills the spirit of the game, and while I blame him as well, there are two sides to the coin and he wouldn't sell a single platinum piece if there weren't people buying.  Plat / character buyers can rot in hell as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, if I were ever to sell my char (which I wouldn't) first thing to go would be everything in my spellbook.<br />

Then  I would take my guild down someplace fun, kill some big bad-ass mob, and bind at the spawn-point and camp.<br />
<br />
screw faction hits, the guy/gal who buys my character (if they are very lucky and very quick) is getting a lvl 15 gearless-spelless-homeless troll, with nothing to show for their money except some maxed skills that they can't use yet.</div></div><hr />

1. You can't delete dropped spells. So anthing that you could delete would be replaced with ease...<br />
2. Since the original release of EQ you can no longer bind in any of the dungeons. This started with Kunark and has continued on... Sorry, the worst you could do is bind under Naggy or Vox... But If your toon is over 53 they will simple be banished out of the zone any way... Which nets you zero...<br />
<br />
Sorry for the bad news...:)</div></div><hr />

Actually, you couldn't.  Sorry, but the law student in me just wouldn't let me pass this up.  Since SOE retains posession of all characters and merely licenses the use of the software to each of us, we have no legal right to sell them.  Since the original player of the character has no legal claim to the characters, a breach of contract suit (such as false advertising as indicated above) against him would be tossed out at the complaint level before even making it to a courtroom.  This just goes to reinforce the age old, but still very true phrase, &quot;caveat emptor,&quot; buyer beware.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yea, Humlaor is right. Even if you made it to court, only judge that would care would prolly be one that plays an MMORPG, giving you maybe a 1 in 100000000000 chance of finding someone who cares.</div></div><hr />

you're an idiot.  you'd be an ass once for selling your character against your principles for a fast buck.  you'd be an ass doubly over for not having the balls or integrity to deliver what you promised in a financial transaction.  for the record, there's really nothing wrong with ebaying... but if you do have a problem with it just dont do it, getting off on &quot;revenge fantasies&quot; involving yantis... lol<br />
<br />

hmm, yeah this is the stance that Microsoft and other large cooperations would like everyone to internalize.  these sorts of one-sided arrangements stand primarily because large corporations have more money to enforce them than small time users have to contest it.  once some fancy stepper figures out a means to a nice profit with a nice class action suit on behalf of users, these sorts of agreements will go the way of the dodo... this isn't even adressing the enforceabilty of these end-user licenses in other countries<br />
<br />
if you can't legally semantically &quot;sell&quot; your character, you certainly have the right to transfer the fruits of your time invested in the character, sublease &quot;access&quot; to the character etc.<br />
<br />
in any case, assuming a seller and buyer agree to a transaction (however it's semantically structured) you'd assume the same sort of consumer protections that you have for any transaction assuming of course the terms of the agreement can be confirmed.  it's not like you would sue someone for ****ing your faction and not telling you but widespread fraud on the part of yantis or eisgiest would certainly be actionable<br />
<br />
it's important to remember that intellectual property laws are a relatively new (and distinctly American) addition, go back 100 years and the concept doesn't even exist.  i think the general dork on the street assumes too great a leaning in principle of intellectual property statues towards protecting the rights of the creator, but really intellectual property is (like all laws) tuned to the general good of society.  the buyer/licensee has definite rights also.<br />
<br />
it's a GOOD thing that soe retains the legal ownership of the characters, otherwise the burden of proof involving banning a cheater or idiot would be almost insurmountable and soe would almost be precluded from banning anyone at all, but I think any good american would in the interest of fair play stand by the principle that a person has a right to do with their own character as they wish.  that's certainly where I net out... legal semantics of the EULA aside</div></div><hr />

Mmmm.  This is kind of a fun thought experiment.<br />
<br />
Yelinak's lair is bindable.  Not very certain death tho, he's dead a lot.  Getting out of skyshrine while KOS might be tricky.<br />
<br />
Amy temple... fear's still bindable right?<br />
<br />
Could bind in a KOS guild hall.  Use an illusion potion to avoid faction issues, it will fade when they log in, four or five guildmasters = splut.<br />
<br />
Apart from that - in the middle of the black ravagers in SoNH would be a good, fairly certain death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Never tried it or heard of anyone trying it, but couldn't you just levitate real high up somewhere and bind, then click levitate off and 20k.  Insta-deathloop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">you're an idiot.<br />

I'm an idiot? Maybe you should read the post again and think about it. If that's possible. <br />
<br />
you'd be an ass once for selling your character against your principles for a fast buck.<br />
<br />
Did I ever say I was actually considering selling a character?<br />
<br />
you'd be an ass doubly over for not having the balls or integrity to deliver what you promised in a financial transaction.<br />
<br />
Do you have to sign a contract or something saying your character has good faction with certain things? I wouldn't know.<br />
<br />
for the record, there's really nothing wrong with ebaying... but if you do have a problem with it just dont do it, getting off on &quot;revenge fantasies&quot; involving yantis... lol<br />
<br />
I never said I had a problem with it. I said I wouldn't do it. &quot;Revenge fantasies&quot;? Whatever.<br />
<br />
I thought it was pretty clear my post was just a passing thought and not to be taken seriously. But since I'm an idiot I may not have made that clear enough. Or maybe you were just unable to see that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>A AXE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So let me get this straight - you sell the char, take the money for it, but you ruin the character first.<br />
<br />
Yeah woo, you sure are not lame.</div></div><hr />
