<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was in 4c. A bit over 1% exp per kill and we had two rogues and a paladin for melee. Insanly good exp.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried juggs yet, they are almsot perma camped now :( least they are by asians.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Juggs are awsome AA xp with the right group.  i was with a 60 cleric/rogue/monk/shaman(me)/enchanter and a 59 necro.   most of the group was ubers though.  at any rate we kicked ass and pulled all the juggs including the protector to the bench before respawn.  we had zero down time and i almost got half an AA in 2 hours.   we did have a half hour break to clear up some lag issues though.  nice group xp, i would think that with another rogue instead of the necro we would have been really rocking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Small word of warning on Juggs.  If there is a Trakanon raid going on while you are there, it is possible to get some horrendous trains.<br />
<br />
Was there yesterday and a guild was raiding Trakanon.  Their MA got ported out by Trak, and he ran back to the raid.  Brought the biggest train of shrooms I have ever seen.  Wish I had taken a picture!<br />
<br />
The CR was a bit of a mess, but the guild raiding Trakanon basically did it for us, lost a few of their own in the process.<br />
<br />
But why, oh why, do I always leave with arms full of chanter, cleric, wiz and druid spells, and no sign of any shaman spells?!<br />
<br />
Oh, I tell a lie - Bane dropped on my first Juggs group, the day after I had paid like 4k for it in the bazaar.  The group wouldn't let me have it to sell and recoup my cost.  Buggers!</div></div><hr />
