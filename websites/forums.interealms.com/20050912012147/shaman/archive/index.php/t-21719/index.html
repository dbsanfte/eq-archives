<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So this Memorial Day weekend as I was avoiding the relatives, I decided to help one of my guildmates farm shards. It was for his son and he was doing his epic as a birthday present. So we are killing everything and end up killing some Chromadracs because there was nothing else to kill around us. I remember fighting in SF and these were the bane of the zone. Now they are a joke. Our LDoN dot bane and blood of saryrn with a nuke or two kills them. On them I find Essence of Sunlight and Chromadrac Wings. Sunlight was dropping every 1/5 mobs aprox and wings 1-2 per mob. I see the tradeskill thing on them and decide to check bazaar. Wings sell for 10-15pp per wings and 800-900 on sunlight. <br />
<br />
Although this money isn't as good as droga, you don't have to spend 2-3 hours to wait for a named to pop. A lot of times, I want a quick break and only have 30 mins tops. I hope this helps some people in search of quick pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, I did this a lot with my duo Shaman/Monk team around level 60.  The XP wasn't great but the Essence of Sunlight was very nice.  Found that I could only sell it for 400pp at max though.  Still, when I was able to get 30 in a day it really added to my spell funds.  ;)<br />
<br />
For those that don't know, these guys dispell.  If you get agro expect to lose all of your buffs eventually.  They don't start from the top either, the dispell will affect any buff.  With my duo I made sure my monk had agro so that I wouldn't lose KEI.<br />
<br />
The best place I found to hunt for them is near the wizzie/druid port in spot.  This is around the valley that leads to Burning Woods.  Keeping this area clear would spawn many Chrono's.  Also, the mature models spawn over near the VP entrance but the area is a bit more dangerous.  Near the ZI to the OT has some also; but all mobs are lite blue to green there.<br />
<br />
If you are near the VP entrance then you can also hunt the guardian wurms.  Hit for 500 a pop, but can be slowed and soloed by 65 shaman.  Drops some nice spells like Malo.  Prices have dropped dramatically, but would still expect a few thousand PP for these.<br />

Peace,<br />
