<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Just got loy and would like to color my chest slot.<br />
<br />
Can you color it the same color as plate (kind of silvery grey)<br />
<br />
If so does anyone know what color combination would be closest to this?<br />
<br />
Also how much roughly does it cost?<br />
<br />
Do I need any skill, or do I need a trades person?<br />
<br />
Is there a website or resource to help with color selections, how it looks when finished etc...<br />
<br />
and finally...<br />
<br />
if you yourself have done a dye job what did you find worked for colors vs doesn't work<br />
<br />
Thnks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dyes can be previewed, you can't change the graphic of a piece of armor (With dyes anyway), only the color, so don't expect to make chain look like plate.  Simplest way is to just go to the bazaar, buy some prismatic dye, use the /body command to bring up the dye menu and play about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the info provided at eqtraders.com is very very basic<br />
<br />
didn't find it very helpful at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It gives the recipes needed for making the dyes, and where those recipes are trivial...<br />
<br />
<br />
What else could you want?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you say trivial,<br />
<br />
So does that mean its a trade skill? <br />
<br />
What trade skill does it fall under?<br />
<br />
Man I looked all over the site and just seen some things that mentioned prismatic dye, some components and that was it. Must be looking in the wrong spot.<br />
<br />
Oh well<br />
<br />
I'll ask someone in my guild <br />
<br />
thks Sebazy for your answer much appreciated!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dye liquid (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8263)<br />
Dye Vial (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8262&amp;menustr=)<br />
<br />
Then stick those in a brew barrel or medicine bag, and boom, you've got yourself some dye.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  Odd, the links aren't working.  Oh well, I'll just leave them up and hope they magically start working later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are having trouble finding that just right color there is one trick to get the color close to what you’re looking for.  <br />
<br />
And that hint is ...<br />
1.   Open up Paint.  (Or try MS Paint but my very slightly)<br />
2.   Select Edit Colors<br />
3.   Select Define Custom Colors (Button Near the bottom)<br />
4.   Play with the different Red, Green, Blue (RGB) settings till you get near the color you like.<br />
5.   Record the numbers for Each RGB setting.<br />
6.   Open /body menu in EQ.<br />
7.   Insert the respective color in the corresponding color.<br />
8.   Preview your characters new look.<br />
9.   When you get the color you like write down the RGB setting for reference.<br />
10. Select Save when all colors are the way you want them.<br />
<br />
This enables you to use your mouse to scroll around to find those colors you want.  If you select one of the Basic Colors you can copy down the Red/Green/Blue RGB values to duplicate them in EQ.  Just remember some colors appear darker/lighter depending on what color is next to it so slight modifications might need to be made.  (Jeez too many art classes for me)<br />
<br />
**Note:  You do not have to have LoY to play with the custom colors.  You do NEED to have Loy to SAVE those settings though.</div></div><hr />
