<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering, because I tend to be a pack rat and save stuff for their sentimental value.  I know I shouldn't because bank space is at a premium, and, let's face it, I'm probably never going to wear this stuff again.<br />
Hey, maybe one day I'll have the gumption to up and delete it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Eh, I've got mules for some things.   One mule is just to hold random, droppable quest items (Oh neat, I'll have to make a bard to quest such-and-such....)<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I keep a set of backup gear in my bank.  It is also my tradeskills (wisdom) gear.  I only keep one item per slot, if that.  My bank space is at a premium.  <br />
<br />
That being said, I have about 15 mules.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Combination.<br />
<br />
I still have all the pieces to a full set of RE minus bp, one day, I will get a BP put all the pieces on, set the models to old and take fabulous screenshots.  Then, I will destroy it all.<br />
<br />
(of course, this scenario is under the understanding that no shaman that WANTS the RE would be denied, only if it were going to rot)<br />
<br />
I've destroyed all my thurg stuff, I had a full set minus the BP, but replaced it as I got SS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I only delete it if there's absolutly no use for it any longer. If it has more wis, resists, even AC on it, I tend to keep it for that slight chance that I'll use it again. heck, I even have some things in the bank only because I think they look kinda cool. I've gone through twice when I was in desperate need of space and deleted a bunch of things that I thought I could live without, things I miss the most are the keys to the ToFS. I only had 2, 3, 5 and 6 but a friend of mine was cancelling his account and giving me a ton of stuff and needed the space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tend to hang on to No Drop items for quite a while, but will delete them as it becomes apparent Iwill not ever wear them.  The Seal of the Coldain is probably the next to go (but it has WIS on it!  I could wear it to tradeskill!)  Right now I have 3 pairs of gloves - I hate to sell the JB gloves, as I like casting the cheap dex buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've never destroyed ANY of my old equipment. I have one twink I use to hold all my droppable equipment. Needless to say, my bank is 100% full on Gresgoth.<br />
<br />
I keep stuff like Spirit Weaver's BP/Legs/Gaunts, Spirit Caller's Legs/Bracer/Vambraces/Boots/Helm, Rune Etched Helm/Bracer ALL in my bank. I just can't bring myself to destroy this stuff.<br />
<br />
I'm VERY bad about keeping old weapons I've collected also. I think I have something like 15 weapons on me at all times. Mortificator Staff, Withered Totem of Widdershins, Blight, Jman's Walking Stick, Scepter of Rahotep, Spear of Fate, Sprinkler of the Spirits, Staff of the Elder Claws, Primal Spear, Sap Encrusted Branch, Worker's Sledgemallet, Hammer of the Dragonborn, Mace of Confusion, and others that I probably forgot to mention.<br />
<br />
I also carry Rune Etched Bp/Legs/Arms/Boots on me at all times. I always liked the look of the Rune Etched on old Ogre models. I'll put it on sometimes just to freak guildmates out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am a sentimental person in real life.  I keep old letters, pictures, emails, even logs of instant messages etc.  I do the same thing in EQ.  I hate to sell old equipment, and I can't bring myself to destroy it either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I keep a 2nd best set of armor in the bank (mostly Jarsath, some RE).  When it looks like I'll be sitting for quite a while waiting on CRs and/or resses, I'll go to a nearby zone and kill things for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well.. I should say that I do this if it's a zone I can't get to within a reasonable amount of time.  I've been told &quot;20 mins, just sit tight&quot; for a res, and ended up getting a decent amount of xp in the almost 2 hrs I ended up waiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The RE set I will keep.  But when I upgrade a Thurg piece, it's gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>zagal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i keep all my old RE stuff, i keep too many weaps i never use also. still got gator smash maul in the bank.  i would never delete my RE armor, never got the legs tho.  i almost feel like buying Jb pants back so i can have the full suit look when the feeling is right... full J bone&gt; kael in looks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wow!  Looks like I am not the only one who still hangs on to his old RE stuff hehe.<br />
<br />
Having my reg alchemy bag and bearskin bag taking up two bank slots doesn't help either :/  Course, I've found I can better conserve bank space by buying like 8 Trader's Satchels and putting them in place of reg backpacks.<br />
<br />
Oh and speaking of RE, I agree that that's one set of armor that looks better in old school graphics . . .  but I still refuse to go back to the icky old models, blech :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Soon if they dont add Foci's to it,<br />
i will be destroying ring of superiority, medal of deep thought, all my quest armor from Kael(cept bp for rebuffs), dragon tear earing, Onyx chain leggings, sprinkler of the spirits, orb of the crimson Bull, priceless spear, priceless hammer, shield of wurms, PoM BP, PoM boots and probably will sell cheap (give away) my bd gear and artificer's ringmail bracer. maybe make a big sale on my lodi shield pom cards and chaining of thurg plate pieces.<br />
<br />
I know ill always keep few of my first RE pieces, my black iron bracer, first greater lightstone (lv 4 booya!) some of my Jaundiced bone pieces, my Mort staff, ogre war maul, gatorsmash maul, howling harpoon, Ruined tier'dal mace, chardok neck (maybe the first one discovered in game and was submitted to eqlizer, go me!) and my Broken Arrow, still debating what to do with my extra child's tear or if there is any point in keeping my Noble's note from Kael.<br />
<br />
It really sucks they make some items no drop. <br />
<br />
I guess i should make a trip to bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I keep two sets of spare armor in the bank.  One is a full set of Jaundiced Bone . . . well actually I keep the bp in inventory for the clicky ac buff.  The other is a set of PoG armor, minus the bp.  The other crap in my bank really needs to be looked at hard.  Some RE pieces here and there, but no dam bp or legs so I can't put it on for the look.  <br />
<br />
I also should really get around to making my bank bags ten slot.  The 8 slot packs are really costing me room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm also a RE collector.  I destroyed one of the bracers but am keeping the other so I can still get the full look when the unthinkable happens and a bp and legs actually drop while I'm there (and no one who would actually use them is also there.)  Some day....<br />
<br />
I've also got a small collection of random sentimental items: gold carnelian wedding ring from marriage to eq hubby who long ago stopped playing, beloved turtleshell helm of a friend who also long ago stopped playing, blight (my very first dragon loot)...that sort of thing.  With some favorite items I, um, spend some quality time lingering over them before deleting or selling.  For no drop things I take some screenshots and then very ceremoniously click Delete.  For droppable things I very carefully screen applicants wishing to acquire it, making them promise to treat it well and to make sure that they pass it along to someone similarly respectful when the time comes for them to upgrade.  Ooooh it was hard to let go of that mammoth cloak after the great memories of acquiring it, and then 2 years and 30 levels of faithful service...*sigh*</div></div><hr />

I really hate the No Drop tag.  I wish I could give some of these items to twinks or friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ditto. My banks sports an assortment of thurg, RE and even my first peice of SS in the bank now. Plus, I can't part with scraps I picked up in GM events or limited duration events. The fear proc'ing shaman usable dagger from lfay, a hollowed pixie rib or sewn hide mantle from RM. Lastly, I have TONS of quest bits, odd discs from PoA, THAT STUPID EPIC ARROW, 3/4 of the strength of the elements, etc.<br />
<br />
Banks just need to be bigger :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Would love to see some of those NO DROP items become ONE DROP items.  <br />
In other words, they can exchange hands once or be sold to a vendor, so that you can still reap some kind of reward after their usefulness has expired, but become NO DROP afterwards to maintain any &quot;balance&quot; Verant wants.<br />
<br />
Probably be hard to code, but /shrug just an idea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've kept most of my NODROP stuff I don't use any more in the hopes that some day VI would wisen up and drop the NODROP from a lot of it.  There's no reason for Rune Etched armor to be NODROP anymore, you can easily find 3-4 better pieces for every slot for sale in the Bazaar today.  They really need to implement a way to hand off certain older things that are not what they used to be, and get rid of the NODROP flag on many things.  I mean really, why does the Bard/Rog Guise in Lower Guk need to be NODROP these days?  Is there any reason at all?  The same goes for a lot of things, when there are much, much better droppable alternatives available keeping the NODROP tag on items is just useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Landragon -<br />
<br />
Head to the bazaar, and swap out your bank bags with trader satchels. Only a little over a platinum, and the 25 lb weight doesn't matter in the bank.<br />
<br />
10 slot, giant sized. They are great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was a saver for a long time.  However, working on 8th shawl and Earring of Solstice changed me.  I ended up deleting all PoG and RE armor to make room.<br />
<br />
For some dumbass reason I still have a Pot of Gold in my bank from PoM.  I probably should have destroyed that instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have lotta MQ crap from VP key and PoA items etc.  Only ND armor that I keep is my RE and I wanna be buried in that :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I destroyed a few things when I was working on my Vex thal and Emporer Keys.  At one point I had a 4 slot bag (taskmaster pouch), 2 key parts, glowing orb of luclinite, and 9 shards...  way too much bank space being used up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I usually just forget about it in the bank and let it rot.  Eventually I need the bank space for something else, and *poof* it goes away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Frehya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've deleted most of my RE stuff and some PoG legs, a few Thurg peices.   With questing and alchemy taking up so much space these days, anything else I keep around for sentimental reasons that isnt no drop, is on an alt....or rotting in their bank.<br />
Still have my Runed Totem staff from when they were phat.  <br />
Blight hammer, ogre war maul, Observer staff  etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Interesting thread on NO DROP - the infamous Furor argues that the whole concept of NO DROP should be lifted- that at this point it only serves as a an additional timesink.<br />
<br />
His idea is to replace the NO DROP tag with level limits set by the zone where the item drops.  For instance, every NO DROP item that drops in Lower Guk might have a level limit of 40.<br />
<br />
http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=2101<br />
<br />
Not sure if I agree, but a neat idea... and he has a point that the whole idea of NO DROP is pretty stupid from a roleplaying perspective.</div></div><hr />
