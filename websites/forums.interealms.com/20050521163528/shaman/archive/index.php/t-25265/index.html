<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the current allowed level gap for a lower level toon to get exp from the level 70 killing stuff? Meaning at what level can someone group with a level 70 and get all the exp from the mobs they kill because they're green to the level 70? I know this is a power leveling technique at some point I just can't remember what the gap and levels are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
47 probably would be the level where someone could group with a 70 as its 1.5 times your level.<br />
Although as far as i know if the mobs are green to the 70 then the 47 wouldnt get any exp either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Confirmed as 47. My Rogue was 47 before she could get EXP in group with me and my friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I could definately be wrong but I was under the impression a good way to PL was to get a toon high enough to group with a high lvl character and fight things that the higher lvl guy didn't get exp on. This way the lower level got all the exp and didn't really have to contribute too much. <br />
<br />
Can someone with info actually pipe in here on if this works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AFAIK the lvl 70 still takes the full amount of xp - but the level 47 gets much better xp because if you fight in the right spots the lvl 70 should mow through lots more mobs than an equivalent lvl 47 duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>vageta31</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That sounds about right. What would be the prime level range of mobs to fight so that the level 47 gets the exp? I know that there are exp caps for deep reds so you'd want to find stuff right before the cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The con green trick works.  I use it to PL a friend's cleric, where mobs are green to me, but not to her.  I get no xp, she does.<br />
<br />
I did this primarily in OT, but now the mobs are getting LB to her, so I need to find a new spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I suspect that you could get xp at 46 with a level 70 toon.  Generally the formula was considered to be 1.5 times lower characters level round up. However I noticed a few oddities in it such as level 20 getting xp with a level 31 char.  I think the formula they use is 1.5 times level + 1 round down.  If anyone has a level 46 char to check this with we could make sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What Kevagron said is accurate.  Its not that the lv70 isnt getting exp, its just that he/she is not getting credit for it.  in other words the exp from the kill is split between everyone in the group, but the percent going to the lv70 is not applied to the lv70 person.  which means the lower level person isnt getting all the exp, just a faction of it.  but that fraction is more then they would be able to get solo or with a full group of the same level (if your fighting reds).<br />
<br />
its MUCH better to have the lv70 person outside the group and finish the mob off once its past the 50 percent mark.  that way the lower level person WILL get all the exp, not just a part of it.  yes it takes a little longer to kill things, but i have found it more then makes up for it in the exp gained per kill department.<br />
<br />
Another way is fight near a zone line and let the lv70 do most of the damage with the lower level doing a little damage (like a dot or a nuke).  Then just before the mob dies, the lv70 zones.  This takes them off the hate/exp for kill list for the mob and the lower level character gets the full exp for the kill.  When i was PL my warrior, i would leave a dot on the mob that i knew would kill it.  by the time i zoned out and back in, the mob would be dead or near dead.  There are LOTS of places where you can PL a character near a zone line.  <br />
<br />
past 50 or so, it becomes easier to just let them mass kill blues with the lv70 standing by to finish the mobs off and provide back up if more then 5 or so are pulled (depending on class of course).<br />
<br />
once past 60, it becomes rather moot.  most people cant kill blues fast enough or kill red mobs solo at that level, so it becomes easier to group with the lower level person.  but exp does slow down.  <br />
<br />
Unless of course they are a druid/wizard/insert favorite quad kiting class here, then they can PL themselves at that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Also let them fight till 45 percent health on target then send puppy in.<br />
That way they get credit for kill full exp but only have to giht till half health. Long as they do majority damage they get the exp. Just be careful to calculate for DS damage. that does not qualify for the majority damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree Joril, that's exactly what I have observed.<br />
<br />
Although I know it's more XP per kill to have the higher-level outside the group, it's also a PITA to deal with, and your PL'ee has to be capable of doing 50% of the damage.  So I usually take the moderate route, group with the PL'ee, and grind on low blues or light blues so the PL'er gets SOMETHING.  Don't stress too much on the rate of xp, just grind.  I got my druid from 44 to 54 effortlessly this way, grouped with my 65 shm.</div></div><hr />
