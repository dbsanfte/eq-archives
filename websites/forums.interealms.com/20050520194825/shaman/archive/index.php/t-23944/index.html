<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kibbleznbitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok say every mob 55+ summons, you can 2-box any 2 classes you want. Both the characters ure 2 boxxing are lvl 65 and have decent gear and....say 36AA's a peice. Which 2 classes would you choose? Keep in mind that every mob your going to encounter summons 55+ which will be every mob you battle. Pick your duo based on which combo can kill the biggest meanest mob. Remember ure picking based ure duo based on which duo can kill the nastiest biggest mob.</div></div><hr />

Heh, this so used to be the ultimate combo.  When Velious was new, and Lodizal was a raid encounter, or at the very least a very very hard one group fight, I had a friend who 2boxed a chanter and a druid to farm Lodi.<br />
<br />
Both classes seem to really wax and wane in power though, so even if they are a good duo today (and I don't think they are) they could be crappy tomorrow, depending on what SoE is doing with charms.  And to a lesser extent that's going to be true of any combo.  But as long as you can keep the &quot;holy trinity&quot; of powers (tank, slower, healer) you will have a solid duo.  Druid (or Cleric) + Chanter does this by having the charmed pet as the tank.  You can also have Beastlord + Druid or Cleric, as BL's pet can tank and they can slow.  Likewise, shaman + any melee works well as long as the shaman heals can keep up with the mob dujour.<br />
<br />
But duos are really a great time to think outside the box.  For instance, lately I've been randomly duoing with Int casters.  I couldn't root/rot with my wizard friend, but we found that if he snares and kites the mob while nuking, my SoW/slow/heals can make it a lot safer for him, and I can throw in DogDog, nukes and DoTs for more DPS.  I also duoed with a chanter in Drooga today.  At various points we root rotted, fought with dogdog + animation (she had that animation pet AA), and charmed mobs to tank for us.  All three methods had their pluses, though charming was the fastest.<br />
<br />
And then there was the mage.  DAMN.  Now I've been hearing lately about how mages are the new worst class, but in Drooga at least nothing could be father from the truth.  All I did was buff our pets, malos/slow, and throw in the very rare DoT or heal.  The rest of the time I was constantly pulling, because his new pet (looked like a mini goblin) was just tearing the mobs up.  I felt really guilty at first, but he pointed out that my slows freed up a lot of mana for nukes that he normally would need for pet heals, and that my buffs helped make the pet so burly.  Ultimately, we were both killing about three times as many mobs as we could have soloing, and it was damn good exp for Drooga.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying is that you can min/max all you want today, but remember that monks used to be our greatest duo partner, then the nerf bat beat them unrecognizable and they are way down on the list.  So pick two classes that you enjoy, and just try to keep some semblance of the holy trinity.  Or throw the trinity out the window, and try something wacky like two necros who play fear ping pong.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, at this exact moment, for 2 chars having &quot;decent&quot; (whatever that means) equipment and 36 AAs that try to fight the toughtest summoing mobs they can find, I'd say enchanter + cleric is the mightiest.  Just send the charmed pet in, slow after it has agro, and keep the pet healed without doig anything else to draw agro.  With that combo you get the best tank in the game (PCs just can't compare to NPCs because the NPCs play by different rules), the best heals in the game, mez to stop adds, rez when things go wrong, both types of invis to help you get to your prey, two chars who can pacify to get single pulls, two chars that can stun to disable casters, and the two most popular buffs in the game (which as an added bonus can make you decent plat when sitting in PoK).  The only thing you are really missing that I can think of is sow and snare.<br />
<br />
But I promise you, the day the two characters hit 70 charm will have it's level cap lowered and it's resist rate tripled, cleric heals will be changed to no longer work on charmed pets, and mobs will begin VPing the tank and going after the healer ;-)</div></div><hr />
