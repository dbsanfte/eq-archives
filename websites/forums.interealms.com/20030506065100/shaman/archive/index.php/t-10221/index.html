Only cost me 35k, freakin bargain!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ornate molds are sellable, do the combine for it you've got a 95 hp 85 mana 13 wis, resists, eff: sltw BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Tae Ew Chain Tunic is definitely sweet. I'd say it's better than the SS bp. Of course, the ornate mold would be awesome to have, but probably costs like, 100k or something.. if not more. Any ideas what they sell for normally? I haven't seen any for sale, so I have no idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're willing to hunt up the components for the Tae Ew tunic, and know someone willing to do the combine for you, this is an excellent bp easily obtainable by many people.<br />
<br />
I have one on now, as well as the Tae Ew Shield, and am very pleased with them.  While the shield looks rather silly, the tunic is a very dark green; at first I thought it was black.<br />
<br />
Just remember that probably the most difficult part of collecting components for the combine will be getting iksar blood.  I had no aprticular problem getting people together to hunt drops in CT, but for no apparent reason nobody felt like doing Seb, so I ended up farming Dalnir's for the blood, and taking damn near forever.</div></div><hr />

would u mind putting a link to the tae ew chain recipe plz...as its far more accesible to  me )  bah can u just guess the price of the farwater one !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Found the recipe over at EQtraders.  Just a question, for the sheets of metal, are those just regular sheets of metal, or the lizardscale plate sheet?  I'm assuming the regular, the way they have it worded, but want to make sure before I start looking for components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To my knowledge (will be doing the combines this weekend) All you need is regular sheets (I posted same question at EQTRADERS and got this answer).<br />
<br />
Not sure why you need to farm in Seb or Dal's for the blood?  From my understanding you need the following:<br />
<br />
Sheet of Metal<br />
Tae Ew Blood<br />
Vial of Mana (need 2 saphires for combine) *<br />
* Vial and tae ew make the brew needed<br />
Tunic Mold<br />
<br />
and the ever important 250 SMITH heheh<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">bleh, on saryrn servers these bp's have flooded the market, theres at any given time around 3ppl selling em for 15-20k. its almost not worth making it anymore.. and by next week i'll be lucky to get 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A month ago I traded a Lodi shield and 5k for one (went on my ranger).  I got guild to do a CT run 2 weeks ago, came out w/ 10 blood.  Yesterday after about 5k in supplies and donations ended up with 3 tunics and a legs.  2 Tunics went to guild and my shaman got a Tunic/Leggs.  I'll tell you, a female barb wearing Tae Ew Tunic and Leggs is one sexy barb.  If I had a chnce at a SS Tunic, I dont know if I would use because next to the Tea Ew, the puke brown SS is just plain ugly.<br />
<br />
BTW, CT has been revamped now for what?  10 months?  The recipies have know for at least half that time.  But why is everyone discovering Tae Ew now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They upped the drop rate on the Tae Ew Blood significatnlty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">oh how VI works in mysterious ways.  They know one of a guilds bottleneck to advancement is BP Drops in ToV/HoT.  So what do they do?  Make a crafted armor primary ingrediant drop a lot more then before.  I would think that if a guild (with the right tradeskillers) farmed CT as much as HoT, they would be equiped in less time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">CT is pretty empty these days - maybe they're just trying to encourage a few people back to the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And as soon as they see people in the zone they'll down the drop rate again lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I snagged a tunic for 3k worth of blood ;).  Heheh bought 6 bloods for 3k and someone did combine for the leftovah blood. Now people are charging like 2k a blood bleargh.  Guess I'll head over to CT sometime =).<br />
<br />
I have the tunic and shield atm.. going for legs in a bit =).  The only blood you'll have to farm in seb or dalnir's is iksar blood for the shield and from what I hear it doesn't drop that often either =/.  i managed to snag 9 from a merchant though w00t.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The recipes were broken untill recently.  The books have been dropping (Bloody journal...something like that) since they revamped...but none of them combined.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How would the CT tunic be viewed against a Fungi tunic?  The fungi has lower ac and stats, but has the regen.  Or is Fungi just for Pling?<br />
<br />
Boleslav Forgehammer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Fungi IMO is worthless except for PLing..I mean, when you start getting the point that you are fighting the upper mobs..you need the stats off of the Tae Ew tunic alot more than the Fungi.<br />
<br />
Saw the blood for sale for 5k by someone the other day..a piece.  And I've only seen the shield for sale by someone...of course from what I can tell, only me and my ranger bud have farmed and gotten this nice stuff equipped.  But, I'm sure that it's getting out a bit more cause when I jumped in the zone yesterday there were a solid couple of people soloing the two entrance mobs.  <br />
<br />
Anyways I made an extra bp the other day and promply sold it and my own legs for 50k total..I didn't even plan on selling the legs, just the guy asked and gave me a good price and I did it....then went back and got a new set within an hour the next day hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kiegar Dar`Grunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">*kicks self*<br />
<br />
I sold 10 blood the other day for 200p each. They arent THAT rare in CT.. Me and a few buddies went there, stayed about 5 hours, just killing the crap at the entrance and in that little yard. We got about 15 bloods, died 4 times, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Unless Realy pressed for mana I use my Spiritweavers BP comparable to CT BP. If you are pressed fungi is much much better. Although if you have torpor the regen prolly doesnt matter. 63 and no torpor sucks./rude SoE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It is a nice BP, just sorry you paid 35k for it.<br />
<br />
BP and Shield both selling for 10k in bazaar, sometimes as low as 8k...<br />
<br />
I was still too cheap to buy it and simply got the blood from 2 CT sessions (grouped). Still working on blood for the shield, though ;).<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  This is on Xev Server btw... the curse of undercutting, once people see a low price, they will forever expect that low price or lower :( ... Oh well, good for the buyer I guess :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's much cheaper if you get all the parts yourself. I donated 5k to a 250 smith to make mine and absolutely love this thing.<br />
<br />
And all I did was drag two guildmates to CT where we rounded up 6 vials of blood in 2 hours. I'm a 147 brewer so I made the distilled lizard blood myself. Bought the 3 sheets of metal and 1 tunic mold and gave everything to the smith. The hard part about this is (a) finding a 250 smith (b) waiting patiently for him to get around to helping you since they are usually busy with requests.<br />
<br />
Don't settle for the 30k price tag, do a little work to save lots of moola.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've been tracking this for two weeks and in that time the price on the Tae Ew Bp has dropped from 29k to 15k.<br />
<br />
Not sure what has caused the drop however I've seen a lot of crafted items depreciate rapidly in that time frame.  Dropped items seem to be holding their value better, although Boots of Flowing Slime have dropped from 85k to 70k in the same timeframe.<br />
<br />
I agree totally with the comment about low price setting the market these days.  I have done a fair amount of speculating in Bazaar over the last few months and I'm now conserving cash except for buys that clearly improve me.<br />
<br />
Last night I was shopping and saw an Arbitor's Combine Greatsword for 499pp!  All of the other ACG's were selling for 1500-2000pp.  Then I thought about it a bit, if this one was selling for 499pp there must have been another on the market for 500 recently.  So instead of snapping up the bargain to resell I passed.  Sure enough, 15 minutes later there was another ACG on the market for 475pp.<br />
<br />
Buyer beware...<br />
<br />
Editing to say:  My guess is that the price of an ACG on Bertox has just moved from 2000pp two weeks ago to 475pp now.  That's a *huge* deflationary move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Its kind of funny, but sometimes it's easier to move an item if it has a higher price tag.   For instance the other week I was trying to sell a Staff of the Peacekeeper and the Tribunal Loyalists Spear.  Started out at a price of about 800 - 1k each and didnt get any sales for a few days, upped the prices to 2k each and bam they sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think a lot of people sort by price to weed out all the garbage items.  Depending on how many things are in the list, they may never make it down to the lower priced items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">either that or they just decide that something under a cirtain price isn't work even searching and make that a parameter to leave out of the search.<br />
<br />
I think it is kind of fun to watch the bazaar. I bought a wakizashi of the frozen skies for 200pp, it was the only one available, next day there were 4 of them, and each one for 300pp, yesterday there were still 3 left and each had moved their price lower, one was at 249 the other two were at 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The Tae Ew rocks, I currently have one, 15k on Rodcet Nife, when it had started in the 40's.  But after seeing the Farwater, I'm drooling.  Gonna see if GM smith friend can get this made for me! :)</div></div><hr />

I'd sacrifie the  couple of AC points, for the stats and resists.  But like I said, I have the Tae EW, and am gonna work on getting the FarWater.
