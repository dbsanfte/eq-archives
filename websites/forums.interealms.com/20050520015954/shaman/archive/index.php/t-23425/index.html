<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How does one become a developer in this game?  In all seriousness, I'm curious.  Must they have serious programming skills, or can they be college types with normal computer skills but with bright ideas?  And if anybody has experience, is it actually fun, or quite mindnumbing?</div></div><hr />

This is were they get there developers.<br />
<br />
Sigh...... I just blew any chance of me getting into a beta didn't I. :p<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
I'm sorry I couldn't help it.  I am quite sure you have to at least have a B.S.(yea that's Bachelor of Science). Then some experiance behind you. I am no programmer I am just trying to learn it at the moment, and while looking to see what kind of jobs were available everyone I saw requires a college degree. Now I hear you can get certified in a certain language, something to prove you know a bit about it perhaps get your foot in the door, but a college degree is pretty damn powerfull.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
I also wanted to add, that I do enjoy coding.. I am sure it varies from person to person alot of it is still very new to me maybe after so long it does get numbing, not yet though</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In all seriousness, I'd suspect that you'd need a university degree (or equivalent) plus a minimum of 2 years experience in the area that you are a developer for. For example, if you want to work on the graphics engine, you'll need a solid grounding in DirectX 9 in a realtime environment, or if you want to build zones, you'll need experience with a 3D modeller and game level design (e.g. creating Quake or HL levels). <br />
<br />
If you want to become a designer, someone who works on game balance, encounter design, etc you'll probably need previous industry experience in a similar role or have been a developer in the industry for a long time. Familiarity with lots of different games and game styles, including anything from other computer games and pen and paper RPGs through to board games and card games. You need the ability to create challenging but achievable goals out of a rule set that you have a limited ability to modify. <br />
<br />
For both roles you'll need to be a good communicator, be able to work under pressure and handle long working hours. However, realise the one thing that can destroy something you love is total immersion in it. We play EQ because we enjoy it but being forced to work on it hour after hour can ruin it for you. Also realise that, no matter how hard you work on something, someone somewhere will hate it and make his or her opinion known, so a thick skin would be beneficial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depends on which part of the Devteam you are thinking of.  If you want to be a programmer then you need programming skills, maths and physics.<br />
<br />
Designers are different. I seem to remember reading that some of the designers in the EQ Devteam were simply recruited from uberguilds.  And now I hear that Furor is a quest designer on WoW.</div></div><hr />

and for ito pass the interview stage you need to prove an ability to customer liason at comp games shows.......eg u demonstarte how many banannas u can juggle at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But , they use the hampsters to pick the names for the new zones. They just let them run across the keyboard and any letters that show up before the critter jumps off is the new name :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Become a GM there and work your way up.  I know a guy who did just that (he helped add the maps feature of LoY).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Saruddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also, if you are more &quot;arty&quot; you can be a 3D Graphics artist or animator. For that, you'll need some kind of art qualification and probably need to dye your hair :)<br />
<br />
I did animations and models for 7 years and it was great fun for a while, then crap politics and overtime became too much and I left the industry.</div></div><hr />

I was a long time guildie with Zorlac so I'm sure he won't mind me quoting a tidbit from his goodbye post for nostalgias sake  ;) <br />
<br />
&quot;For the last month I was debating to play and buy GoD or thrown in the towel. Since the shaman class is being ignored for 5+ expansions now, it made the decission so much easier. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There are many career paths in game development.<br />
<br />
None of them should be taken seriously unless you know that this is what will REALLY make you happy.  Programmers can perform much the same work for a large corporation for 50-100% more money, fewer working hours, and infinitely better job security.  You can start your own consulting or development firm and have a better chance of success than at a game company.  Other work areas may be slightly different, but programmer is the one I'm most familiar with.<br />
<br />
My background: worked as a corporate programmer, then a C/C++ compiler developer (anyone remember SAS/C for the Amiga?), then on MPEG video software (player and editing software), then on a game development environment and several games culminating in a gig as lead programmer and co-designer of Wild Wild West: The Steel Assassin, a game significantly better (IMO) than the lame-ass Will Smith movie franchise it was supposedly based on.  Moved on to working on networking stuff for PlayStation 2 (when that was new) and now doing distributed computing work.<br />
<br />
Career paths in the gaming industry fall into one of five basic areas and two smaller areas, or at least that's how I am going to divide them.  Programmers, Artists, Designers, Producers, Testers.  Audio and writing are smaller fields (not because they are not important but because far fewer of these people are required).  The team I worked on for WWW:TSA had at its peak around 6 programmers working on the game, one more programmer on tools liason with the art team, 2 programmers working on tools, 10 artists, two producer types (producer and production assistant), two game designers, one writer, and three audio guys who were also doing other projects (net about 1.5 audio people devoted to the project).  Some of these jobs were held by the same person (i.e. I was lead programmer and a game designer; the other game designer was also the writer - IMO we would have been better off with full-time game designers but that's not the mandate we were given by management).  An MMP would skew these numbers somewhat - my guess is it would require a higher proportion of game designers and writers, since you're leveraging the same programming/art work over a much bigger set of content.  (That is, you need the kobold model and the code to make him fight you, but then you also need dozens of quests and questlets giving you something to do with the drops and so forth.)<br />
<br />
No matter what area of the field you want to work in, PLAY GAMES.  I don't mean play Everquest for 40 hours a week.  I mean play around: get a copy of Asheron's Call 2 and notice what impresses you and what doesn't, talk to some of the people playing and find out what the hell keeps them in THAT game, discover 10 good things about it and discover why it's a dying game.  Talk to people around you who play first-person shooters and find out what they like about them (it may be different than what you like!) and what annoys them.  Think about what is going on behind the scenes that causes that game to be good or bad.<br />
<br />
My field is programming, with secondary strengths in game design and project management.  There are programmers who have fought and won real-world experience without the college degree.  They face challenges that you could easily avoid by getting the degree.  It takes longer to face these challenges and overcome them than it does to get the degree, and it's harder to boot.  Unless you are a total coding genious, good enough that people are willing to work with you just to ferry your nuggets of wisdom out to the real world and allow you to live in a cave, you should get that college degree.<br />
<br />
No, you don't need a degree from a &quot;gaming&quot; program, just get a regular computer science degree.  However, WHILE you are in school, use whatever computers and tools you have access to to WRITE GAMES.  On your own time, for fun.  Even if it's not complete games, write SOMETHING related: a scrolling map.  An AI that makes intelligent combat choices and prints them on the screen in text.  A plug-in for a 3D modeling tool.  Keep your source code and a demo (runnable if possible, videotape otherwise).  If you have the choice of subject matter for a senior project or whatever, choose a game or something related.  It all adds to your &quot;portfolio&quot;.<br />
<br />
As far as art goes - there are two main types of game art, either 2D (painting, basically) or 3D (models).  The 2D artists do backdrops, textures, and interfaces; the 3D artists do models and animations.  It's nice to be able to do some of both, but in my experience people usually specialize.  I am not the person to talk about for this, but it is a field with a lot of activity.  It may be that an art degree from one of the gaming programs would be more useful than a traditional art degree, I don't know.  Artists are generally paid a bit less than programmers, although good ones with lots of experience should be able to make a comparable amount (again, in my limited experience).<br />
<br />
Producers often work their way up through the ranks as Testers or designers, or even Tester-&gt;Designer-&gt;Producer.  A formal background in project management/business (PMP certification, MBA, business degree) helps but is not absolutely necessary.  A producer needs to be able to set and meet a schedule, rein in the development team when it tries to increase the size of the project, inspire the team to meet that next deadline, deal with the interested parties outside the development team (management, publishers, etc) and lots of other relatively boring duties that don't have that much to do with the fun parts.  Producers can be paid fairly well, but they have to spend a LOT of time working their way up through the ranks to get the job in the first place.  Assistant producers are paid diddly.<br />
<br />
Designers get to decide what the game mechanics are like - how hard should a warrior hit versus a monk, how much loot should a given mob drop, what effects will be on a given piece of loot, how best to screw the shaman in the next expansion, etc.  This is what most people traditionally think the programmers do, but they have much more mundane jobs most of the time.  Designers are paid crap compared to the programmers, and even the artists - they pretty much do it for love, not money.<br />
<br />
Testers.  I wouldn't take a game tester job if you paid me, which typically game companies don't do a very good job of.  It sounds fun, right?  Sit down and play the game for hours?  What you don't realize is that the tester can't just PLAY the game, the tester has to exercise all portions of the game, even the crap that you try once and decide never to do again.  And then tomorrow there's a new build of the game and they have to do it all AGAIN.  And again the next day. And the next day.  And the next day.  And... you get the idea.  Testing is a boring, crappy job that doesn't pay for squat, with lousy hours and bad job security.<br />
<br />
All that said, the work environment is generally kind of fun and the people will generally share interests with you (you nerd), so it can be an entertaining way to waste a year or two of your life.  You WILL gain some insight into the game development industry.  So just because I wouldn't do it doesn't mean you don't have to.<br />
<br />
Different game companies work different ways, so take all these descriptions with a grain of salt.  In some companies, the designer is God and everyone else is a support person.  In others, there's no strong design team and the programmers/artists sort of collectively decide what's going to go into the game (recipe for disaster, IMO).  In some companies the programmers are just grunts and their input is not needed or wanted; in others, they come up with almost as many ideas as the designers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Oh, and I forgot, Level Designers.  These guys are sort of halfway game designers and halfway programmers, usually.  They don't make the overarching game design decisions like the amount of damage a warrior does versus a monk, but they do the smaller decisions about how each encounter would work within the bigger framework of the game.  We didn't use them where I work, but they can be pretty important depending on the type of game.  They get paid about like game designers, I believe.</div></div><hr />
