<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As our guild now has decent numbers Sol Ro flagged I was wondering if anyone can point to an order of difficulty for these mini's and what sort of raid force are needed for each of them?<br />
<br />
We took down Protector of Dresolik last night with 18 people, only healers being 2 clerics and 2 shaman amongst the three groups. We were pretty happy about that but was wondering how other mini's compare.<br />
<br />
We (semi) wiped once on Xuzl with 22 but pretty sure if we'd had time we could have done him on a second attempt with better puller :), killed off guards but no rezzers left alive :(.<br />
<br />
So, asking for advice really, estimated difficulty on a 1-10 scale and estimated numbers of people for each mini - guild is mainly NToV gear with a fair amount of ornate and a small amount of loot from mobs like MM, Saryn, Bertie and lower tier stuff (BoT, Grummus, MB etc). <br />
<br />
Please don't suggest one MT, 2 clerics + 3 dps all in Time gear, it won't happen in our guild :)<br />
<br />
Protector of Dresolik<br />
Xuzl<br />
Jiva<br />
Arlyxir<br />
Rizlona<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help<br />

It does depend a bit on the tactic you use but it should not give any major problems.</div></div><hr />

If you can do PoD with 18, and handle the hard part of Xuzl with 22, you are good to go for all 5 - these are easily the hardest 2 of the lot.  Jiva needs some crowd control ... Ary and Riz mostly just need some dps.  All 5 Sol Ro minis can be done with 18 folks.  Arylxir could probably be done with 9 if you *really* tried.<br />
<br />
Happy farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for replies - someone said Protector &amp; Xuzl were the easiest and I was wondering on others :)<br />
<br />
Next step mini's and RZ, we tried RZ twice now and once wiped to some train that seemed to come from nowhere on the fake tz/vz kills, once wiped because a caster got aggro and the AE guy (never remember which one that is, aggro'd into casters :( )<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas where the train could have come from? Are there any mobs around could be hit by AE spells/songs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My bet would be A) repops or B) incomplete clearing before pulling the fakes.<br />
Let the bards handle them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they dont hit particulary hard, about 500 or so with defensive. a decent 7-8 k warrior with his defensive aas should be able to be held up by about 3 clerics and a bit of spam healing. avoid the one without the adds though. for a guild of your level id say about 24 - 30 should be safe.<br />
<br />
the minis suck for RvR though. although if your lucky you can get a fair amount of ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you killed dreso with 18, you can kill them all.  I have personally MT'd xuxl and arylixir, so they aren't extremely hard :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Jiva was the hardest for my guild until we figured out how to manage the crowd control, just gets the adds nicely mezzed and kill Jiva as fast as you can, then kill the mezzed adds one by one. What worked for us is to assign mezzers to a set of two adds, first two adds the first mezzer gets, next two for the next mezzer in line etc. Like others here have said, if you did Dreso with 18, you should be fine on all the others.<br />
<br />
As a shaman note, all Minis are magic slowable and not that hard to get slowed.</div></div><hr />
