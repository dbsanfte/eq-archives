<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't mean to add fuel to a fire, but isn't releasing an expansion in EQ's current state a bad idea?  That kind of seems to be a slap in the face to many that have spent money on the last expansion.  People asked for things to be fixed and finally we have some communication and than they release another expansion.  <br />
 <br />
People don't want more levels, more gear requirements, or AA requirements.  People wanted things fixed in the last expansion. People want to have velious sized raids with some originality.  <br />
<br />
Offering a new level cap will only make people realize that the grind may go on forever.  I mean really trash mobs that hit for 1300 with AE's in GoD zones is kind of retarded.  What are they going to do with this expansion, include mobs that quad for 4k and AE mana drain you.  Who knows maybe this already exists in high level GoD.  Who would want to find this out though?? I don't see this being a step in the right direction.  Just a larger gap that people who want to be end game need to get.  It will spread a further gap between the casual and end game raider.  <br />
<br />
You have old school high level guilds leaving. People with character played times of 500 days or more leaving.  That is a lot of invested time and I am sure they were not easy decisions to make.  I saw many good players leave guilds cause they were so far behind the curve in flags.  Why would they release a new expansion in the current state EQ is in??? <br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe that people want to try to find new spells when the ones that already exist are rare at best.  People have pretty much had enough and I think this might be a devastating blow to the game. <br />
<br />
I really hope that the expansion doesn't break me away from the shaman I enjoy playing, but I don't look forward to getting additional xp that is a waste.  Give us something of interest to keep us playing.  I am sure people that log in after 500 AA points and realize that only 100 of them or worth a damn, say wow this is a joke.  If the retiring shaman are a glimpse into my future, all I can say is that its a sad way to end it. <br />
<br />
The shaman community has handled things pretty well, I am proud of the class and how we handled the request for changes.  People did amazing jobs and for it to end in such a manner is disheartening.  I really hope that this release might add to the game and not take away more of some of the best players in the community. <br />
<br />
The communcation has been made and we were promised a difference. This is the most frustrating thing to me.  Most class boards have been lit up with complaints.  The everquest dev boards have been flooded and things seemed like they were going to be fixed.  What more can the average player do? And now they release an expansion in the midst of &quot;changes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just had to express these points so that maybe someone reads it and will respond.  I am getting frustrated with the promises to pay and the checks in the mail type of answers.  I can deal with the shaman problems, but don't want to see bigger problems form after the communication we have done.  Everything has been discussed, outlined, and planned.  Now releasing an expansion basically negates everything that people spent time documenting.  Its like we did all this ranting and petitioning for attention and have nothing to show for it.  That would be whining and personally I don't believe we are spouting out BS for attention.  Give me a break already....<br />
<br />
Why this now??  Yeah, call me captain obvious, but maybe it needs to be in print for them to read.  How many more people need to get off this short yellow bus you call Airforce One?  IF I wanted to parse stupidity, I could find a million other ways to do it.  Looking up into the sun comes to mind....<br />

Pls give us teh monies so yu can hit L70 and so we can possibly drag off our competitors profits when they release.  This is our last gasp....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
let me get this straight right off the bat, as your righting this, your already WAY ahead of thinking about quiting, your porbably wondering IF your guild/friends will be there when/if you come back.<br />
<br />
im at that stage, the game is down hill, my guild is falling apart at the seems, recruitment is grasping at straws, and all the hardcore guys are dropping like flys, drinal was OVER populated, 4k+ people on during peak hours, you know what that like ? having 170+ in the pok ? 50+ in BoT and so forth, now when i go into the PoK its, 20-40  so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
this game screwed too many people, too many times, they had enough, seriously my class died once i hit GoD tipt trial, i was a smart ass who thought i could solo it all, i watched as i spent 50+ hours trying to farm GoD spells get sucked out of my hands because SoE ninja nerfed the Fly.<br />
<br />
now the shaman class is one of the more major issues as to why people are quitting, one druid said to me &quot;bro, you guys got hit hard in GoD, i hope the next expansion im not the next &quot;shaman&quot; ..&quot;<br />
they are expecting the Axe fall , and with good reason, someone has to get crushed, and it sure ass hell can't be shamans or monks, pick one of the other 13 classes.<br />
<br />
me, i would probably give sony 3 months worth of membership fee's just to see brenlo fired over, and over again... that asshat and his snot nosed comments, if he was CS at a shopping mall, i would have beaten him like a 9 year old with a book of matches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">graphics look good.........<br />
<br />
think about 30% of the player base (if that) will rush out an buy it the rest..........burnt by g.o.d  will wait and get the feedback first.<br />
<br />
Possibly this expansion might have some content for 40+ follk and not all highend stuff.  If so then it might work better than g.o.d.<br />
<br />
The story line has potential too........however i trust soe to bugger up something promising !!<br />
<br />
theres no doubt that eq is in its deaf throes.......more and more development, less and less interest in its player base.  Tho argueably eq been like this since luclin.<br />
<br />
seems were set for 2 expansions a year, until someone shoots the ugly beast........-EQ- lyin  twitchin in the dirt but but not yet dead and burried.<br />
<br />
i can see folk buyin OOW and not buying g.o.d..(i mean me at least)......if its not more of the same crap, somehow i guess the developers dont get to hear negative feedback tho (<br />
So i not really expecting anything hopeful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From my perspective every expansion has been a step in the wrong direction.<br />
<br />
From the smallest step to the largest step.<br />
<br />
My point of view is ofcourse largely based on PVP.<br />
<br />
There have been a few really good things in expansions but those things have been like double-edged swords that have unbalanced something else.<br />
<br />
That ofcourse is quite a pessimistic point of view, but when i think back it seems EQ has become less and less fun for each year - but that might be because one tires of a game after a while. I dont know how much each expansion has added or taken away from the sum of the tiredness.<br />
<br />
Things i really liked with the expansions though are: The zone design of Kunark. The raid-o-rama that was Kael and ToV. AA points (wich was a barely acceptable way to cover for the lack of things to do when at level 60 with full spellbook in Kunark and Velious).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's simple. At some point, some dude in SOE comfy office thought: &quot;What a crap, we actually went and gave Dx9 to players for free... And all the new graphics what we promised has yet to be added and what not else.. Wait! I got idea! Let's sell all that promised new Dx9 stuff as a NEW EXPANSION! Rack in cash and in the end, the suckers (thats' us, customers) have paid for Dx9 after all! Yeah!&quot; That 'bright&quot; guy now probably is sitting in board of directors in SOE, got promotion for his great idea.<br />
<br />
Frankly, that new expansion announcement pissed off a lot of people I saw. Some of them quit EQ, they were thinking of doing it soon anyway, but seeing SOE crank out yet another expansion without taking care of the existing stuff - guess that was a last straw. Can't blame them.. Some are about to cancel soon anyway, they've simply lost any interest whatsoever in the product, about what the producer doesn't care other then just getting the money. Personally, june month is a month where more beta slots will be added to few new titles and hopefully I will get a spot in at least one of them, then screw EQ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wouldnt buy another EQ expansion after the GoD screwing, even if my left nut was on fire and it came with a free bucket of water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seems to me that making OoW a free expansion would be a step in the right direction.  I am one of the lucky people who didn't buy GoD, and I will probably be late to the store on OoW too (read as never).  Not buying an EQ expansion just seems wierd to me, but if GoD type expansions are the future of EQ, I will be just as happy hanging out in the older zones w/o LVL 70 or the new spells and AAs.<br />
<br />
The power gamers in EQ are jumping ship, and SOE doesn't have a response other than another expansion?!?!  Like everyone else, if they want more of my money, fix what I have already paid for (I...read as the poor people that ran out and bought GoD).  That includes the numerous bugs that have nothing to do with GoD.<br />
<br />
If the SOE reps haven't been trolling numerous boards looking for reactions to OoW, they are going to be real surprised at the lack of revenue it brings in from the reactions I have seen.  I hardly expect SOE to give a crap, but it really is looking desperate for the future of this game IMO.<br />

Testers will be ignored as per usual.  Previous broken content will remain broken as more broken content is added.   SOE will get smoe $$ from the sale of OoW just because people will buy it.  I finally quit EQ because I was tired of the constant broken expansions, pisspoor fixes implemented months later (hello..SOE...the testers generally identify those bugs before release...try listening to them) and the fact I hate paying for anything that is broken.  <br />
<br />
Glad I left EQ and ye gods OoW will just be another SNAFU of SOE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at it: same storyline, same mobs, same models (oh, wait, they threw in a new rat and a new bat, wooptiifarkingdoo), same everything.<br />
<br />
Two things happened at SOE: the Devs didn't meet deadline on a lot of stuff, and some marketing genius spoke up in a meeting one day....&quot;Hey, I bet we could ship out the stuff that is already done, charge 30 bucks for it, and then ship the rest 5 months later, and charge ANOTHER 30 bucks for it!&quot; No real new development time needed, since models, settings, everything is already in the works, and just way way behind schedule, but SOE gets twice the money for it.<br />

I distinctly remember posting somewhere that there were rumors of a 2nd expansion planned a few months after GoD with a level cap increase.  Of course, posting rumors isn't the same as posting a definitive statement from SoE, but this expansion is no surprise to me.  The closest thing to a surprise is that they didn't push Omens back and bit and concentrate on fixing GoD first.<br />

Wait....Hold on.....Possibly..........no, for a minute there I thought I gave a rats ass. Automakers have quotas too, but they dont (99.9% of the time) keep pumping cars off the assembly line if something, or a majority of the product is faulty, broken, or unfinished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah and automakers are forced to recall and fix for free what is faulty.  <br />
<br />
Intentionally serving up a broken expansion and then offering to fix it with another expansion that we have to pay for is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">GoD is a horrible expansion.  They are taking steps to remedy that, but it is not good.   If you are not relatively high end than forget about even buying it.  I regularly duo with my ranger and I haven't been able to XP at a decent rate in GoD.  Maybe once the revamp is done it will be possible.  <br />
<br />
If Omens of War is a progressive expansion in the vein of Kunark, Velious, Luclin then it will be worth the money.  If it is just like Gates and POP then I feel that my days of regularly duoing with my ranger will be over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Not interested in owning GoD and probably not going to buy OoW.

This is because a fault on a car can cause the driver, or other people to die. I don't believe that a bug in EQ will have the same effect. Safety standards are in place for auto-manufacturers to protect the public.<br />

That's the difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Offering a new level cap will only make people realize that the grind may go on forever.  <br />
<br />
Well...I do want more levels, gear, AA, zones, etc.  I don't want them to ever stop adding new things to this game because as soon as that happens the game dies.<br />
<br />
Yes, I want a product with reasonable quality (better then what's there since DX9, but not bug free), but I don't want SoE to take their entire development staff and have them work solely on bug fixes.  <br />
<br />
As to the &quot;grind&quot;...yep, hopefully it will go on forever because when it ends, so does the game (I know it won't last forever, but hey, I can hope.)  If the point of the game to  you is to &quot;win&quot;, I think you will always be disappointed in any MMORPG.  (lifes a journey not a destination)<br />
<br />
When the expansions and the grind stops, that's when the game dies.  <br />
<br />
A good company will always attempt to strike a balance between quality and features.  It's a balancing act and sometimes you get it right (the recent warrior changes) and sometimes you don't (shaman and knights in GoD.)  If you don't get it right, then you try again - which is what SoE is doing.<br />
<br />
I know I'm getting off topic, but I had to post this somewhere on this site...you need to be realistic with your expectations about what SoE can and can't do.  SoE cannot go back in time and make it so shaman never became unbalanced for new content.  That's not going to happen.  But, they are doing something about it.  They have assigned resources to talk to the player communities.  These resources have been at least reading non-SoE message boards.  They created SoE run message boards to centralize class discussions.  The have already announced plans to change the latest expansion based on feedback they've received.  They have even posted a post from this message board on the SoE board to try and solicit discussion and find out if the SC views are consistent with the views of people that don't post here.<br />
<br />
If you think SoE doesn't care about it's customers you are grossly mistaken.  They may not care how Tommy does in school today, but they do care whether or not Tommy likes EQ enough to continue paying the monthly subscription fee.  They also realize if the content and quality are not what their customers (and potential customers) demand, they will lose money.  This means they can't focus on one thing only.  They must split their resources between maintenance (fixing bugs) and development (new features/releases.)  If they don't do this, they go out of business and we all lose.<br />
<br />
Yes, they screwed the pooch with GoD.  Get over it and help solve the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">As a player that hasnt logged into EQ in about 2 weeks, and who felt severely burned by the GoD expansion, Im interested in this one.  Unlike some of the extremely high end players, Im in a casual guild that does well to get 3 full groups together when it comes time to raid.  BoT tower bosses, Mid-Range Velious is about where we are in power.  To advance much further, we need to either ally with other guilds (which is problematic at best) or mass-recruit.  However, if this expansion does as stated, and increases the max level, then the guild will be able to grow in power without growing significantly in numbers.  That will significantly open up the world for the casual players.  If done well enough, it could even be used as an opportunity to narrow the equipment gap (read character difference) between casual players and power-players.  <br />

Oh, and before you flame me as just another noob with p***s envy, dont.  I have no illision of ever being some uber geared, PoT and Deep GoD equipped shaman.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Esquel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I cannot find the post to back this up, so I may have read it on another board or heard it at a Fan Faire, or heck it could just have been my imagination, but I thought lvl 70 was mentioned as their ultimate planned level cap a couple years ago (after PoP release?).  I suspect that Gates of Discord and Omens of War were originally planned as a single expansion, but due to release requirements it was decided to break it in half and market it as two.  It certainly seems like GoD was originally balanced around lvl 70 PC's, don't you think?<br />
<br />
One thing I saw posted on Monkly-Business was a graph showing release dates of Everquest and its expansions showing a 5-6 month gap for the latest four titles.<br />
<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~demitri/exps.gif<br />
<br />
I have not taken the time to personally verify the release dates and compare to this chart, as I am at work.  If someone finds it in error please post a correct timeline.  It does seem to suggest that 6 months is enough time for them to produce an expansion, irregardless of quality.<br />
<br />
I for one did not buy GoD as I heard it was not for the sub-elemental crowd.  Perhaps if I buy OoW and get lvl 70 and Epic 2.0 and whatever opportunaties exist, I can go back and order GoD and stand a fair chance of surviving.  Although I have also read that they plan on retuning GoD as it stands now in any case, in order to address some of the concerns the player base has expressed in terms of classes required and viability of hybrids, etc.</div></div><hr />

But, alot of people payed $30 or more to get it.  It makes SOE even look worse if this was the plan all along IMO.<br />

Where does it say that OoW is only for &quot;High End&quot; players? I am willing to bet that this &quot;Part 2&quot; of Gates IS the &quot;content for everyone&quot; portion of the expansion. The whole thing makes perfect sense. They get to charge us 60 bucks for 1 expansion, gates is OBVIOUSLY tuned to level 70s, and maybe they stop the bleeding of accounts they have been seeing recently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seen the price of new games? How much do you think Half Life 2 is gonna cost? 60 bucks? <br />
<br />
Before EQ, I was probably buying a new game every month. Back then, 40-50 was the norm. Since EQ, I have bought 4-5 new games TOTAL (not counting EQ-Killers, heh). <br />
<br />
I dont mind paying the extra 30 for more game. Its why I play. More game. Honestly, I wish they had just held it all and put it out as one 50 buck exapnsion, but I think they felt they HAD to do something to get the &quot;Top 3&quot; guilds on each server out of Time and the EPs and give them something else to do. That opened up the EPs for guilds 4-8, which in turn opened up the lower POP zones for guild 9-15, etc etc. Trickle down server economy. My guild is a classic case-in-point. We have gotten 4 times the EP mold droppers since Gates was released and the &quot;Top 4&quot; stopped farming them for &quot;guild_alt_bot_156&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, I think I summed it up real well, right here...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">What SOE lost in bucketloads with GoD was, simply, credibility. To be honest, SOE has lost credibility with each expansion but they actually came back and adjusted/readjusted content eventually to make it playable.<br />
<br />
How many recall the farce that was Skyshrinne with mobs that were totally MR ... and this was way, way back in Velious.<br />
<br />
The formula is the same. Put out buggy, unfinished expansions and then &quot;balance&quot; it based on the classes whining/screaming the most. This has been the business model year after year, expansion after expansion. Name an expansion where the highest level of that expansion was complete on release - can't be done.<br />
<br />
Others have pointed out the obvious - OoW is GoD Part 2. This is a new low for SOE. It isn't just that they provided us with another incomplete expansion but that they are following up with another one that is what GoD should of been.<br />
<br />
With the exudus of top-tier guilds, I hope SOE gets a clue. The business model is no longer viable. Customers are not going to accept buggy, incomplete product. Times have changed. SOE is not the only kid on the block anymore - frankly, to say it correctly, SOE is the only &quot;kid&quot; left. Other companies have learned from SOE and it is reflected in their products.<br />
<br />
We are seeing knee-jerk reactions as SOE is finally realizing (or at least doing a PR job of seeming to realize) its player base is no longer tolerant with their mistakes. SOE reps are 'talking' with players on boards. They are asking for player input. So far all I am seeing from the majority of this approach is a smoke screen. Changes resulting from this community meeting approach has been minimal ... for many it is &quot;too little, too late.&quot;<br />
<br />
The SOE reps have a long way to go to establish credibility with the players. First they have to learn the game and the characters. Brenlo received kudos for his post on SOE boards asking if the &quot;shaman letter&quot; addressed shaman concerns. My first reaction was pity. The letter was sent months ago ... months. Brenlo's post regarding it was sad ... sad that after all this time, he acknowledged a community letter sent to him months ago and did so in manner that was just ... PR. &quot;See, we are paying attention ...&quot;<br />
<br />
But ... I ... digress ...<br />
<br />
SOE has a hard road ahead of them. Or they will step back, say the hell-with-it and realize they can keep EQ going for another year (maybe two) before they have alienated everyone. It is so easy not to do this ... and stupid if they do. In commiting a self-deathtouch to EQ SOE will have kill many ventures into their game market. They already have the track record of poor games with the exception of EQ - ironically, EQ is the best game they have ever done. Losing credibility here will finish them. There is too much out there that will easily replace this obsession.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Getting level 70 sounds like it will do sooo many wrong things for me that it doesn't sound like something to look forward to at all.<br />
<br />
My best guess is:<br />
<br />
It will make the excellent experience of the elemental zones turn to crap.  (And if they open up elemental zones, then you can compete with hundreds more players in zones that have suddenly become extremely laggy for exp that has turned to crap.)<br />
<br />
It will make my focus effects, hard won and paid for with an amount of hours that it took borderline insanity to spend on a game, obsolete, which will be a crushing setback.<br />
<br />
It will offer little of actual concrete value in return, especially to a broken class.<br />
<br />
They will probably have new spells to compensate, but if they are done as in the PoP turn-in fashion, then in the proud shaman tradition, they will probably be the rarest and most expensive spells in the game.  <br />
<br />
If things are done on that basis, then if spells are found at all, they will first go out to every cleric and cleric alt so healers are set up, then chanters and druids, then MAYBE us.   Wasting runes on a class with heavily mitigated slows when, to make it worse, content has so many unslowable mobs in the first place, is a complete waste of time.  <br />
<br />
Most or all of the spells will likely not be on a vendor, but be rare drops, so the effective rarity of those spells to shamans will be vastly greater than the drop rate would suggest.<br />
<br />
If the spells drop as class-only spells, then many  will rot like they do in GoD even as people need them, and people putting together groups without shamans and knights since they were nerfed so hard will not have shamans and knights around to loot those spells.  So the spells will remain effectively out of the hands of all but a tiny portion of the shaman class.  Just as they are in GoD now.<br />
<br />
Either way, we're screwed.<br />
<br />
And if we do get spells, none of our prized armor focuses will work on it!<br />
<br />
Gee, this all sounds like such a great idea...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I truly hope they do NOT open the EPs to the general public without having to work for it, via a quest similar to the Tactics back door that is doable by a single group. <br />
<br />
BoT is BoT and Tactics is NOT BoT, and I think the quest is a BIG part of the reason. Tactics has DOZENS of good places to camp solid XP and loot mobs with PHs that spawn at the zone regular rate. But its mostly empty, why? Cause the KC crowd went to BoT, where they can get in for free.</div></div><hr />
