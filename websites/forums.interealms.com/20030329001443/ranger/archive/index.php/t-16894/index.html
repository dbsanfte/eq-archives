<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arbas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know where to get the new spells?<br />
<br />
Always assuming they were introduced of course ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you mean Burning Arrow and Flaming Arrow, they're sold by the Pathfinders in the library in PoK.  If you mean Strength of Tuna and Call of the Rathe, then you'll have to get spectral parchments to turn in, or buy them in the bazaar for about 800 each.<br />
<br />
If you mean the 44 DoT and 52 ice nuke, it is believed they are not actually dropped/sold/quested in-game yet, despite being &quot;live.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arbas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Should have said - it's the 44 dot and ice nuke :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So far the dot/dd hasn't been found to be vendored. If it's quested, all I can say is &quot;Ye, gods&quot; we're all going to be running around hailing just about every npc we see for a good long while. If it's dropped, well, it should have dropped by now considering that it's been a few days already. I'm just hoping that its not like the Call of Flame (?) quest spell where you can only start on the quest at 51 and it's a 50 spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skaw Falk'venn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This was posted on Paladins of Norrath and is allegedly a response from SoE/Verant to people asking about the new spells. (I have no way to verify the source however.)<br />
<br />
The spells are still being tested/modified and are not actually live despite being in the live spell data file. The means to aquire them has not been finalized and put into the game yet. They might not even go truly live, or they may do so in substantially different forms.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Verno of Regia Antiquus on EMarr for finding the post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arbas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good grief - a pre live nerf !!!!<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We freaking need some ice nukes dammit, and not just one rare level 63 one either...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaffis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Picking them ol' nits, Az, one can quest Call of Flames at 50, but it's a 49 spell. Decrement your quoted levels by one. :)<br />
<br />
And Elured, of course you're right about needing save cold stuff other than a rare level 63 spell. That's why they're planning to add this rare 52 spell. I predict a drop rate of 3 per month per server, off of the Broodmother in Great Divide. Assuming she doesn't bug and despawn/get stuck someplace. And for the record, if she does, GMs won't reset her as it could be used to exploit the Kromriff Military Leggings quest, of course.<br />
<br />
Hmm. Better yet. Maybe they'll add it to a buggy mob in one of the ring/shawl quests, and then refuse to reset it so as not to alter the drop rates of our new spell. Boy, that would get us some love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malychi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My guess is that they will go live with the Legacy of Ykesha extension that is coming out..might be wrong though *shrug*<br />
<br />

lvl 55 Outrider</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually its gonna drop in um... whats the name of the ToV-like zone from Kunark? Where orc-pawn loot drops... the one where the key quest is harder then the VT key quest... the zone no one goes to... bah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Veeshan's Peak?<br />
<br />
<br />
Nah.  Probably Veksar (the city under LOIO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No, no, it will drop in the Dragon's Clutch.  Y'know, the zone north of Everfrost that doesn't exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arbas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dragon's Clutch DOES exist - but you can only zone into it when a patch shifts the Burning Woods zone in point to the end of the secret passage under Emperor Crush's throneroom ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gawd Arbas, what ran through your mind !!!!<br />
<br />
now you spilled the beans and the zone soon gonna be overcrowded. <br />
<br />
Well at least we still are the only ones knowing that zoning out requires a sacrifice of 3 gnomes. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Beronhelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Where is burnt wood today?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mercusio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Heard about them, got excited, joined some boards, saw a couple of posts, then everyone just dropped it, spells still showing up as live, no one knows where, Sony is being quiet, anyone have any clues?<br />
<br />
WTB some punctuation, but cant afford more than commas and two question marks till i get my new spells? (&lt;-- just pretend it is a period)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Banen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the spell will emerge it's true destiny in time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arbas, that was a great spin from the &quot;ebay newbie story&quot;<br />
<br />
I havn't seen that one in a long time, boy is it funny. <br />
<br />
&quot;um I died and need to get to my corpse give me a sow&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Arbas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO <br />
<br />
Sharidann, you've let the gnome out of the bag, I was planning on setting up a gnome trading post to allow the 'visitors' to escape - just think of it ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, what was that? Oh you'd like to borrow my trained homing gnomes ..... OK just leave all your worldly goods on that table there .....&quot;<br />
<br />
heheheh</div></div><hr />
