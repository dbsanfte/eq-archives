<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Re:  Jade Reaver<br />
<br />
I hate this stupid zone.<br />
<br />
4 clearings in the last 5 days, 8 overall (or maybe 7, I don't remember) - all for little old me.  No one else has needed one, just me.  And nothing.  Last few runs we've had *nothing* of value drop, so I can't even compensate my friends and guildies who show to help me.  Not that it's necessary, but it would be nice.<br />
<br />
Yes I know people have had worse luck than me.  Yes, I know I'm very fortunate to have a guild/friends who will go there and kill this crap with me.  I know I'm lucky to not have to cross my fingers and /random if one drops.<br />
<br />
I have my alt parked there now, so I can log him in and check to see if they're camped before taking my group there.  He's a monk, and if I wanted to I could probably finish his epic before I get this stupid thing to drop (he's 48).  That makes me sad.  <br />
<br />
And this is all for the easier of our epics.  Then I get to drag my guild to the boredom that is PoH and try for an emerald...I have yet to kill very many mini's since they never seem to be up for long at all.<br />
<br />
Noob00 is looking at your equipment...<br />
Noob00 tells you, &quot;you're 60 why don't you have your epic yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm so sick of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've spent hours, days, in CoM... and I've seen a bunch drop. I always lose the damn rolls. The ONE time it was a raid specifically to get ME a reaver, not a damn one dropped all day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">38 dead reavers and i still havent seen a drop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hate to say this, but I have been to CoM 4 times and seen Jade reavers drop every time.  My turn was on the third visit, and we had cleared all the reavers to spawn the lord for the shami quest.  sadly no JR.  Then the severs crashed and we logged back in to a full spawn.  After retaking the room and then pulling all the black reavers from upstairs to spawn the lord again, the last one both spawned him and droped my JR.<br />
<br />
Last raid I did was another shammie raid and we had 3 JRs drop.  So I guess it is really just a matter of luck. We were able to supply two druids who were on the raid and one ranger who wasn't even there :) <br />
<br />
I hope you have better luck next time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xeratul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry Oats, didn't mean to piss you off.<br />
<br />
-Xera</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No no X, it wasn't you at all, trust me :)<br />
<br />
I'm talking mostly about the random gfay mules and strangers I've never talked to before giving me crap about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keeril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey bro, next time you do the reavers I would be more than happy to help. Call it a learning experience(have only done reavers once, and that wasnt very organized). Just drop me a tell ingame. Us Povar Rangers gotta stick together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I stay away from CoM.<br />
<br />
Every time I have raided CoM, not one reaver drops.  When I leave, or I dont go, 1-2 reavers drop.  So I am not allowed in CoM anymore :( (tis the only way the guild was able to obtain a reaver for me too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just led a 5 hour CoM raid not 2 weekends ago.  After camping my wife's reaver for many many weekends (and 49 unsuccessful black reaver kills), I got the -lucky- title of &quot;Guild CoM Leader&quot; :p  I have to admit, it is a fun raid and helps our lower level members cut their teeth.<br />
<br />
We cleared the first reaver (had no additional reavers spawn), the 4 lift reavers (6 total out of that bunch), Neh's reaver (and 1 more spawned out of him).  Then we went back down.  Cleared the first house out again (a total of 5 reavers), went to the top, killed that reaver (no additional pops), and then killed the very first one again (out of which 3 popped).<br />
<br />
17 Black Reavers dead.  No Jade Reaver :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got mine :)<br />
<br />
Full reaver raid wipe-out... the monk was feigned, got up to loot the reaver, and was promptly obliterated. Didn't tell us the Jade Reaver had dropped so we wouldnt get our hopes up since we were expecting a server crash during CR. They gave it to me without the need to roll because they thought I was pathetic. I can live with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well since my last post, I cleared the reavers 2 more times.  A 3rd time our whole guild was in the zone after just finishing the last fight for the SK epic and I convinced about 15 of us to just maul/AE our way through the reavers.  The 3rd one we pulled finally had one.<br />
<br />
I still hate this zone though, make no mistake about it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Congrats Oats!! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dober</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gratz Oats, Taamar.  Now for the horror that is Hate.  I have listened to a friend that sees a stone drop almost every time there, and at this point I lost track of the number of visists and haven't seen a stone drop yet.  Thought my best chance was recently when we did Innoruk instead of just the mini's, but just had 2 eye's of innoruk and other stuff.  I can't stand to look at the walls up there anymore!!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tirunedeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">60+ reavers I've seen 5 JRs and lost the roll every time. **** the epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ronarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My dead reaver count is well in excess of 100.  In that time I've seen exactly TWO yes TWO Jade Reavers drop both defaulted to druids who were on the last piece of thier epics.  Just to add insult to injury in killing the 100+ black reavers I've also participated in killing Neh'Ashiir 11 times.  In the 11 kills she has had 7 ORS, 4 Mage Torches, no Woodsman Staff. &gt;:-(<br />
<br />
I have come to hate that zone with a passion but I can't leave until we finish getting reavers for our guild. :-/</div></div><hr />
