That looks superb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">BAH!  it took me YEARS to get my spell book to look like it does today!  (so messed up that even I'M not sure where my spells are, all the time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OMG... that is sweet.<br />
<br />
I would likely still use my spellbook, as I know where every one of my spells are... I type /book 20 click the icon in the lower right and drop focus of souls into spell slot 5, then rebuff the freshly rezzed tank :)  It would take me a bit to get used to navigating a menu to mem spells. <br />
<br />
When I play a friends character it would be a lot easier than trying to figure out where they put what spell...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm... I wonder if you will be able to actually classify your spell yourself or if there will be a default classification going on. After all, we got a LOT of old stat buffs to wade through...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know about the rest of you, but I set my spells up the same every time (Slot 1 = inner Fire, slot 2 = Burst of Flame, Slot 3 = Spirit of Whupass, etc...). and when I switch out spells the replacement always goes in the same slot (Every time I load Gate it goes in slot 8).  <br />
<br />
I wonder if the interface will be configureable enough to allow that kind of setup.  More precisely, will I be able to set up seperate spell menus for each slot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yay!  If this can be customed, it would be so excellent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This new spell memorization feature simply rocks.  This thing is most usful when you have to swap spells in battle.  Imo it's damn nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It looks sharp. I would really like to more about how it works and such. Still need to sit, or can spell swap on the fly? Pick the spell you want, and it automatically sits you down and swaps the spells around? More info on this please.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You have to have the spell slot empty, right click and run through the slide out menus, and click your spell.  She flops you on your tukkus, pops the book open, mem's the spell, and stands you back up.<br />
<br />
I thought I was quick swappin spells before but this is just sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If it's customizable  :D <br />
<br />
If not  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is nice.<br />
<br />
A feature I'd love to see would be a &quot;configuration&quot; set up to let one completely change the spell line up quickly. Some way to lay out your whole spell list at once. Like how our hotkeys are banked.<br />
<br />
I (like most people) have a different lineup soloing vs duoing vs grouping vs raiding. Every time I switch from one mode to the other, I have to remember to put what spell in what slot so all my hotkeys work correctly. Minor issue, but it would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just want to have my 'default' spell line-up memmed when I respawn at bind point.  Re-memorizing is a pain in the ass.  If they want to keep PvP'ers from zerg'ing then make the gems grey out for a while like for VoB.<br />
<br />
edit: Although this WOULD be cool...I couldn't find my 'cancel magic' spell in my book last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't want to spoil anyone's fun so I'll just give you the steps to find it yourself.  Quite literally the /ooc in PoK last night was just &quot;Wow!&quot; over and over.<br />
<br />
Log into test, create a new character if you don't have one.   The /testbuff command will outfit you with some average equipment, max out your skills and level you up to 25 (no, that's not the neat thing).<br />
<br />
Be certain to use a caster or hybrid for this, monks &amp; warriors lose out :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, right click on an empty spell gem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is cool!!!  I will, however, spoil it for the lazy people.  If you right click on an empty spell gem, it opens a menu where your spells are sorted by type and function, as seen below:<br />
<br />

<br />
Once you click on a spell, you sit down, mem it, and get back in automatically.  Very cool!  Thanks for sharing, tala.  This is something I look forward too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why it's on test. =D Though, they still havent worked out the whole /testbuff thing. Shamans dont get canni, beastlords dont get their pets, and clerics dont get that spell that makes spells cast faster, blessing of piety I think it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Woops, mis-understood you. Thought you meant you couldnt find cancel magic on the test server. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm. Those menus do look somewhat painful to use for a lot of spells, especially if you are like me and have your spell book organised so you are 1 click away from the spell you need.<br />
<br />
If they could use shortcut keys for the different options it would be nice too :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Not to hijack and take away from this wonderful new mod (I have about 9 different characters on test now, all 25 to 27) but<br />
<br />
 Though, they still havent worked out the whole /testbuff thing. Shamans dont get canni, beastlords dont get their pets, and clerics dont get that spell that makes spells cast faster, blessing of piety I think it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sony said they gave the spells that were most beneficial (or necessary) to the class.  I always considered canni a perk.  I can regen mana like every other caster can, by sitting on my duff.  Canni just makes it faster and easier.  <br />
<br />
Now, BL's not getting a pet I think was a serious oversight by Sony.  The BL class is not even half as good without the warder.  I also didnt see greater heal or celestial healing on my cleric there, but after zoning they showed up.  Kinda of an annoying bug, but oh well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the re-rail this thread, its a damn fine feature.  I just got finished playing with it a little and I was impressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hrothgar, that's exactly what I thought when I looked at the screenshot.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">:confused:  stacking dots = sPaM  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You mean sitting on your duff with KEI on?  Cause I was raised Pre-KEI and Canniblize was AWESOME!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yeah, but how hard will it be to go wack up some pp to finish off spellbook when you /testbuf to lv 25, go wack a few wisps and you will be able to affore canni in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I just checked this out with a few different caster classes and it seems they missed a lot. For instance - Shamans dont get a regen menu. Rangers dont have a camo area, or snare, stuff like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Yes, it will be spam, but it will be our spam.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">As long as the spam can be sent to some other window, like melee damage can, I think I can live with it :)<br />
<br />
Ideally they'd create a new category in the filters for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Now if they could only fix the serverfilter....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Just logged in to test new DoT spammage, and sadly there is no filter on it, so you have to watch as it spams the window you have all your spell info going to. You can't even change the color to have DoT stand out, as it is all based on your current spell dialogue color. <br />
<br />
If it remains in this state it will be horrible. /sue VI for the spam!<br />
<br />
As per the new mem spell feature, shamans have a regen menu. It seems to be based off of what spells you actually have mem'd in your book. So if someone didn't get the regen spell with the /testbuff option, then it wouldn't show up on a menu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Now if they could only fix the serverfilter....<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure server filter has been fixed for ages. But it's not quite the same as it was.<br />
<br />
As I understand it, the /serverfilter command is now redundant. The &quot;filter&quot; pane of the options window (Alt O) now controls all the filtering, and it's all done server side.<br />
<br />
It should be easy to test this - get into a melee heavy situation, and turn on &quot;others hits&quot;. Watch the far right number on the &quot;lag meter&quot;. This is the amount of data per second being sent to your machine by the server. Now turn off &quot;others hits&quot; and see if the number reduces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Love the spell change, but hope they allow you the ability to somehow customize the menus.<br />
<br />
DoT damage coming up is nice, but they need to include it in the filter options so you can send it to a seperate window.</div></div><hr />
