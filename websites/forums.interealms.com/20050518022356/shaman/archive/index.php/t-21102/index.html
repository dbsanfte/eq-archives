<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(WARNING: Read whole post please :))<br />
<br />
Lately atleast half the stuff on here i read is about complaining how we need upgrades and shamans are useless in GoD. I thought to myself, bah bunch of whining shamans need to just be queit and use what they have. After all, i think i do quite fine in groups and raids (my guild is raiding EP). Lots of people that box me say they wish their class was as balanced as shamans and find out that we can easily make or break a group. But......!<br />
<br />
A few nights ago i got a group with some friends and we decided to do the Tipt trial in GoD. It was a druid, cleric, chanter, paladin, warrior, and me. We get in there and invis past a few mobs then get to a bridge and kill a few. I was thinking this is nice, i slow them around 80% and do some decent dps with a bane and VS added in. Then the chanter charmed a pet...<br />
<br />
Everything changed, the druid was now chain pulling and things died in a matter of 10 seconds. I found myself sitting there absolutely useless.. The cleric had all the heals covered, and if not still the druid there to back up. When i tried to slow it would either land on the mob at 60% health and get me aggro (with one of the best warriors in my guild tanking) or land at 20% and be pointless. Maybe if i was lucky i could get a spear of torment to land on a mob. Wheeeee ph33r my whole 650 dmg total on that mob when the pet is quading for 1k hasted.. Only point in me being there was to be a loot whore and focus for a few extra hp which im sure wasnt even needed.<br />
<br />
Just saying all the shamans complaining I now see your point of view completely. You have every right to do so and hopefully they'll listen. Thought i'd share my experiences..</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that out of the way.. I agree having done Tipt runs myself with other guilds and.. if there's no chanter, we're(or I felt I was) still very useful and could have made or broke the group since It was generally me, clr, pally, wiz/mag, pally, and a bard.  Sure the pallies could have probably served as a backup healer but screw that, I was doing backup heals and slows, granted we weren't there trying to finish the trial.  I do think we are useful when chanters arent around, and even useful when that chanter IS around(until charm pops ehehe), and we watch charm pop, chanter splats instantly, and the group either wipes, or scrambles to get things in order.  Times like that we are handy to make attempts at root parking the pet/slowing it/etc, plus healing.  Im not as far into the elementals or GoD as shaved is though....just my useless 2cp heh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The enchanter was boxing the paladin. So the second the charm broke it was stuned hehe. Not once did the chanter even get hit on the 7-10 charm breaks we had. Yeah i malosinia'd the pet so that might of helped a bit... I'm not really sure what they could do to balance this though. I like how it's fast paced and you get it done quick if your good but they would have to give us some kinda fast dps to make this stay in place which i highly doubt it going to happen. The only way really to make it more so shaman can make a bigger difference is to take away charm pets (nooo :() or make the things have more hp...<br />
<br />
But if there wasn't an enchanter i would probably be pretty helpful, although i doubt we could of killed the named fast enough without that extra dps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Charmed pets are risky, but a good enchanter with a charmed pet is massive DPS. In those situations, it's not just shamans that feel useless, it's all the dps classes too.<br />
<br />
At the point where an enchanter charms a pooka, all other classes are only there to support the enchanter and pet, to debuff/buff it, to bring it mobs to kill, to hold agro to keep the mobs off the enchanter and to keep the enchanter alive when charm breaks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the KEY to the whole scenario. All other classes are support. Most are useless support. How do you think the Wizard feels with his 3K nukes being a drop in the bucket compared to 2 rounds of a Pooka's quad? Why would a Rogue even bother hitting the BS button? Monks, SK, Pallys, BLs, Zerkers, these classes need not even bother applying, without a powerful debuff or a way to heal or do BIGTIME fast DPS, they are less worthwhile than us. Sure, a PAL or SK can possibly sub-tank with a charmer, but unless they have some BIG time hp's they are gonna struggle on the nameds, baddly. Chanters dont live long when the MA goes down, honestly. Heck nothing does.<br />
<br />
SOE is bound to be fixing this soon. I imagine there will be some code that reduces the DPS of charmed mobs to rogue level, or below. They just have too, this is ridiculous. However, at the same time, I hope they adjust these mobs and these encounters accordingly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First, DC was overpowered in Luclin.  Haste on a pet that is usually the same kind of mob as the stuff you're killing, combined with slow, led to about a 10% loss of life on your pet per kill if the ench isn't using runes.<br />
<br />
Then, CoD was overpowered in PoP.  Charmers recieved an exp nerf so that instead of being the best exp in the game by a ridiculously huge margin, it was only the best exp in the game by a large margin.<br />
<br />
In LDoN, CoD pets were overpowered in hard missions.  A pet quadding for 900 trivializes any mission, and a group made up of multiple chanters with heavy healing backup made hard missions a joke.<br />
<br />
In GoD, the trend continues and a charmed pet is going several times as much damage as the rest of the group combined.<br />
<br />
4 expansions in a row of overpowered charm.  Will SOE ever learn?  I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

What good will healing the enchanter do?<br />
Hasted duel wielding pets have roughly 3k dps.<br />
Your heal is just a bad idea.<br />
What you SHOULD be doing is keeping the pet targetted and cast root the moment charm breaks.  (yes, &quot;root&quot; not any other kind of root, so the pet isn't rooted for the next 3 minutes when recharmed).</div></div><hr />

Typically 1 round will punch through the enchanter's rune and then some. if I'm going to  root the pet I'd use VP since I can cure it off. but I usually don't try to root because 1) It is snared, and easy to control assuming the chanter survives the break long enough to get out of melee range, and 2) waiting for root to drop on the pet cuts into  time on the charm, and time you could be killing stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kanati</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm really a bit baffled that anyone would think charm needs to be left alone. From my experiences with it, the danger is minimal at best. For starters, no one in the group has much to do but watch the enchanter's health bar and to try and aid him if something goes wrong. Moreover, the worst that usually happens is the enchanter dies, the group kills the mob, the chanter gets rezed by the cleric, and we repeat the cycle again. I've honestly not seen that many deaths of the enchanter in a charm group. It happens, but a smart group can avoid it. Regardless, a single death can be such a trivial thing in EQ these days  I'm not sure it being an occasional by-product of charming is an appropriate justification for the ability's insane power.<br />
<br />
All in all my exprience with charm has been that it tends to trivialize a group environment. Pretty much everyone ends up feeling useless because of it. Tanks aren't really needed, healing isn't really needed, dps classes are useless compared to the charmed mob... Moreover, its boring as all get out for everyone but the enchanter who is cackling all the way about how superior they are to every other class as they dominate a given zone or instance.<br />
<br />
And I'd add in response to the earlier comment, that it does seem to at least marginally affect us as well. What's the point in bringing a shaman along to cover the slowing if you can grab a chanter that can slow as well as quadrouple the group's dps?<br />
<br />
Charm is the most overpowered ability in the game. It trivializes far too much content and steps on the feet of far too many classes.  It should be dramatically nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, so wrong. An unlucky resist, an unlucky round of hits, and you have a dead chanter. Great, if the group and prevent all this stuff from happening, but it takes aware and quick acting people to do it. There are many people I wouldn't trust to look after my pet when I play my chanter, when I am distracted by multiple pulls in Ldon hard.<br />
<br />
Having not bought GoD, i'll hold back any comments related to it, but for Ldon hard references 2 quite severe penalties have been imposed;<br />
<br />
Only ONE type of mob can be charmed in a 65 adventure. (EF-Holgresh, Ruj-Slave Slayer, MM-Mummies, Guk and Tak I don't remember off the top of my head)<br />
They is unrootable.<br />
<br />
In my eyes, that is quite sufficient trouble for a chanter to deal with, which has resulted in my personal death a number of times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It was a druid, cleric, chanter, paladin, warrior, and me.

<br />
<br />
If you ask the enchanter, who's doing around 1000dps with a pet, who HE wants in the group out of a shaman, druid, cleric, paladin and warrior.  He'll most likely pick you.  Enchanters who charm love shamans in their group.  You can drop their pet's MR by 70 and that reduces charm breaks quite a bit.  You can also heal, root their pet or slow it if it breaks.<br />
<br />
Other than that, they'd probably take the druid to snare.  I know several enchanters who ask for shamans to be in the group when they charm, simply because it makes their life easier.<br />
<br />
I don't like going on Vxed trials unless there's an enchanter in the group because it takes twice as long otherwise.  I'm also the puller in Vxed which is the second key to making Vxed fast: fast pulling.<br />
<br />
You're only as useless as you let yourself be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If the pet is snared, there is no risk of death on charm breaks.  If your chanter is awake he should be standing far enough away from his pet to mez and redebuff it on breaks.<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO RISK WHEN CHARMING.  How any of you can say otherwise amazes me.  I've seen some really intelligent analysis of all sorts of things, and people saying that the benefits of charm are balanced by the risk are simply wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well just don't make the mistake of standing next to said charmed hasted, mage equiped pooka when mr chanter_01 decides to go LD.</div></div><hr />

Or fighting the named when the pet decides to break charm  :eek: (we had charm break 6 times in two minutes just prior to engaging the named at the top of Tipt once when we were working out strats for the encounter - a real confidence builder)<br />
<br />
A large number of losses in mountian trials stem from charm breaking (btw, charm breaking when you are moving and the snared pet falls behind makes for some very nice trains ;).<br />
<br />
Yup, there is no risk in charming  :p</div></div><hr />

Snare alone is usually plenty of safety in GoD. If you have something else then the pet tanking it is not hard to keep it above summoning health and snare gives you more then ample time to recharm.<br />
<br />
At least in LDoN the charm pets were unsnareable and there was not as much place to run.</div></div><hr />

Well, maybe I'm being bitter, but like Jinheim said, after 4 expansions, SOE has re-tooled charm.  I believe SOE mentioned they will look into GoD soonish.  Which brings to the point that SOE keeps GIVING chanters powerful charm spells with expansions... whereas for shamans with our oh-so-powerful Turgur's, has been stale from eons ago with a couple lackluster disease slows, along with having crap balanced around it, like poor healing and slow mitigation.  <br />
<br />
If a chanter's or even a druid's charm is going to have that much impact on a trial or any place else (I've been involved in them), then there's no reason for our (shamans)  situation to be improved.   I'm just glad B. of Nihil is finally getting a needed facelift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well for the people saying there is no risk in charming there is one small detail i forgot to mention. We lost the trial. And you know why? The second we pulled the named, charm broke and killed the enchanter since she had one resist and the cleric was to busy healing the warrior from the named to stun it. Chanter goes down, next goes me and then the warrior. After that druid evaced (not sure why...  :p ) and we called it a night. <br />
<br />
There wasn't any risk in charming just doing the normal mobs really unless we some how got 3 adds or something incrediblely stupid happened but during the named if charm breaks there's a pretty high chance that you're done. Anyway i do believe it is overpowering... but i like grouping with chanters and letting them destroy through the trials so much :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Whether charm is dangerous or not is really beside the point.

Heh, we have one rule in our Gates farm groups. The cleric lives at all costs. 1 evacer is essential. 2 is even better. Even if the other group members have to throw themselves into the fire to save the cleric, you save the cleric. It sucks to start asking random other guilds &quot;Hey, you all happen to have a cleric outside Vxed&quot; heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enchanter definitely didn't suck, she was one of the best i ever grouped with. We were on the last boss for Tipt, there was no room to run 50 feet, there was no time to run 50 feet. It was snared but like i said one unlucky resist and a cleric to busy healing the tank and Smooshed enchanter with a hasted mob running around. It was all in a tight corner and it all happened so fast. We probably could of cleared more mobs so there was room but we thought we could do this easy. Afterall, there wasn't a single problem getting up to the last fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I dont know why everyone is makeing a big deal out of charm anyhow, it cant be used past Vxed and Tipt (Unless your just exping in other zones).  <br />
You have to think of the chanters as well, they have a whole line of charm spells, which is one of the main things that make their class.  Its bad enough their charm is useless in KoD trials and beyond, but takeing it away all together will make things unbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Drinnar, you're vastly over-simplifying.  There are a lot of things that can go wrong in a charm group.  Right now, with the current state of charm, if you have a group of 4+, the monster will summon the chanter--no pet tanking anymore in a full group.<br />
<br />
That means you have to have a tank on the mob.  If your tank gets a spike of dps as charm breaks, the pet will turn on him and kill him in an instant.  Then the mob will summon the enchanter 9 times out of ten and suddenly you're evaccing or wiping.<br />
<br />
Of course, you might have a summoning pet, too. . .<br />
<br />
Even really good groups can still wipe on charmed killing.  What about if you get an add on inc?  One resisted mez (if you have no offtank) and the same thing can happen.<br />
<br />
What about areas where you don't have much room to move?  Tight quarters make charming much more dangerous.  What about root hitting just as the mob moves and suddenly the cleric or someone is just barely inside the mob melee range, etc.<br />
<br />
If you plan on charming a pet like that, plan on the group wiping once or twice every few hours.  May not always happen, and the exp more than makes up for it, but chances are good you WILL be wiping out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I understand why people wouldn't want charm to be nerfed since having it working for you is so powerfull. However If anyone remembers when the Wake the dead AA came out, it presented exactly the same problems and it was nerfed to hell.... People could walk into the arena, kill Vindi and statue, then Wtd both of them onto AoW and sit back while they did the job because they used to retain their original DPS and abilities. Not surprisingly it was nerfed to hell, people bitched but it was a fix and they eventually got used to the new format.<br />
<br />
The solution ? Soe Capped Wtd pet damage at about 80 per hit and BAM ! Problem solved. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to be making any friends saying this but charm is essentially a brokenly overpowered game mechanic and if they'd had the guts to Cap the damage to something reasonable like 200-250/hit back when they pretended to fix it, they could have compensated by reducing the charm break and resist risk (give it a fixed duration for example) and making it more accessible in the higher end zones leaving chanters with a balanced and reliable pet that has a ton of hp as well as the possibility of useing charm as an alternate form of crowd control (the way they do now, charm one to have it offtank another mob in camp).<br />
<br />
Why is it broken ? Simple, It's stupidly overpowered enough to make 2 thirds of the classes in EQ feel useless. And It's also stupidly overpowered enough that a lot of people won't even consider doing the trials unless they have someone to charm. What boggles me is that they didn't do this in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">When you worry more about a charmed pet wiping the group rather than the mobs in the zone, there is something wrong.<br />

Admittedly, it's nice to have a charmed pet that can cut down the time to kill a mob, but one mob doing more DPS than the rest of the group combined is just wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">So far I saw one enchanter death and zero group wipes due to charm in maybe 10 charming runs in Tipt/Vexd. And once I saw the enchanter single-handedly locking down and killing a pull of 5 by the time the cleric had rezzed the 4 dead back in.<br />
<br />
I seem to remember that GoD was supposed to have a system were MOBs lost some of their power (presumably damage) when charmed. That seems like the way to go to me. Does anyone know what happened to that system?</div></div><hr />

For the most part it's easy to get singles, and if you get two just root the one you tagged with malos ;) <br />
<br />
And if I get a pull that i think will wipe grp, I just stand in a cleared spot and die can be CR'd rezzed and pulling again in 2mins or so ;)</div></div><hr />

A cleric and I were simply not able to keep a warrior alive through the final fight.  The DPS was simply more then we could cover in the long run.  Having to choose between spell haste and improved healing doesn't realy improve matter either :(.  Haven't felt so useless in a long time.</div></div><hr />

For those saying they don't want to &quot;support the Enchanter's pet,&quot; well how is that paradigm different than 5 support classes backing a Warrior?<br />

And to those whining about Enchanters out-DPS'ing the rest of the party - umm hello? Where have you been? Enchanters have ALWAYS been able to crank out serious DPS, but it's only now that the clue bird has awaken you to this &quot;over-powered ability?&quot;<br />

<br />
First off, as a shaman, finding a group has never been a much more complicated than going to the bank and scratching my ass.... my OPINION is that charm is an overpowered game mechanic that needs to be adjusted for the good of the game because as long as it's there encounters must either take it into account or be trivialised by this ability and this means that the classes without the superoverpowered abilities are put at a disadvantage. Having it on your side may make the game easier. It doesn't make it more fun, if anything it takes away from the experience.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if this offends your sensibilities and this OMG don't say the &quot;N&quot; word taboo. There's still a lot of things I think could use some adjusting in this game. The main problem with SoE &quot;fixes&quot; is their habit of overcompensating and rendering whatever they adjust useless instead of balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">What bothers me is not the fact that this ability is in the game. I'm sure if I had it, I would have a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
What bothers me is when the opportunity is there for us to have some fun with our own abilities such as rabid bear, but it's considered somehow overpowering to add another 500 attack and maybe a spot of melee style mitigation to make it worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Any time that one character (an enchanter with a hasted, mage item equipped pooka) can do 2300 DPS, well in excess of what any other 6 characters can do without charm, it's going to be unbalancing.  As to what can be done to curb it without removing the charm ability in the first 6 trials, I'm not sure.  Perhaps they could add mobs that hit for 300 DPS specifically for enchanters to use.  I don't know.<br />
<br />
I think that SOE has painted themselves into a corner with EQ and some of the decisions they've let stand for so long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I cannot believe that I missed most of this discussion!  Since I play both a shaman and an enchanter, I have insight on both sides of the equation.<br />
<br />
First, as a shaman, how do I feel about GoD?  Useless.  Completely, utterly, useless.  The only value a shaman has in GoD is the ability to cast malosinia.  Know who else can cast malosinia?  Our friends, the magicians.  They can also cast mod rods, and summon pet weapons (which more than double the DPS of your charmed pet), do call-of-hero, AND dish out some pretty serious damage on the named.  It doesn't take einstein to see which class is going to get grouped in a GoD trial if the choice is between a magician and a shaman.  Slow is meaningless.  When I'm using my enchanter in a group to charm, I never slow.  Why would I?  If the slow lands before the mob is dead (which is doubtful) I might pull agro off the enchanter-pet.  And thats NEVER good.<br />
<br />
As an enchanter, GoD is wonderful.  Enchanters have returned to the days where they were needed for every group and desired for something other than clarity and haste.  Not only do you get to actually participate in a meaningful way in the group, you are the SOLE FOCUS of the group.  Everyone is there to serve your needs.  Charm just borke?  You can be darn sure that that pet is about to be stunned, your about to be healed (whether you need it or not) and everyone in the group from the toughest warrior on down is going to be throwing theirselves in harms way for you, even if it means them dying.<br />
<br />
Is charm too powerful?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  There are HUGE risks involved when charming; especially in GoD because of the tight quarters and the high mob concentrtion.  There are some areas where its easy (the entrance to tipt and vxed come to mind) to recharm a pet over and over again.  When you get up to the gates, the short corners, the mob-towns, and the steep hills though it gets exciting.  True, your pet is mowing down mobs as fast as they can be pulled, but when charm breaks it will mow you down just as fast if it catches you.<br />
<br />
Whether or not its overpowered, though, right now its the reality that its needed.  A vxed group with no enchanter would take -forever- to get anything done.  Just keeping up with the respawns would be very hard, and dealing with multiple pulls would flat out suck.<br />
<br />
Right now, the ideal vxed group is cleric, druid, ranger, magician, warrior, and enchanter.  The warrior &quot;tanks&quot; (stands there and gets hit) so that the various poison DoTs, snare DoTs, and other nasty procs hit him instead of the pet.  The cleric heals the warrior.  The ranger snares.  The magician casts malosinia.  The enchanter presses his /pet attack key, and his &quot;OMG IM DOING TO DIE&quot; key.  On the really tough named, the ranger weaponshields, the warrior uses riposte disc if necessary.  Thats vxed in a nutshell right now.  If you get adds, either let them hit the pet, or mezz them.<br />
<br />
If charm were t obe changed, I doubt the enchanters would be happy (and rightfully so -- they're enchanters, after all; charm is what they excel at).  If that did happen, though, they would need to drastically change GoD mobs to be much, much easier.  Would you do vxed if you had to spend an hour just to get to chavoor, the easiest named to get to?  I sure wouldn't.  At least not if I knew he might drop only loot that my entire group already has, and probably won't drop a spell at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Very well put.<br />
<br />
I too, understand both sides.  I have an enchanter as well.  But, I don't like the idea that to increase the value of my enchanter, they had to destroy the value of my shaman.<br />
<br />
A middle ground needs to be reached here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Would you do vxed if you had to spend an hour just to get to chavoor, the easiest named to get to?

<br />
If it takes you an hour to get to Chavoor without an enchanter in the group, you may as well just leave. That bad a group doesn't belong in Vxed.<br />
<br />
Or were you just over-exagerrating?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Just wanted to say...never ask for another class to be nerfed.  Always ask to be raised to the same lvl of usefulness as said class.  I have no idea what GoD is like but sounds rough for my elderly brothers and sisters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Deria hit on exactly what's WRONG with the enchanter role in GoD, though, from the perspective of everyone that's not an enchanter.  When people consider it unthinkable to do a trial without a specific class, something's broken IMO.  While I think it's necessary that all primary ROLES be filled for challenging content, I abhor the need for specific classes.<br />
<br />
Frankly, GoD has this problem in spades.  Can't do a trial without at least one, sometimes two clerics.  Can't do many of the boss mobs without a warrior tanking, cannot do some of the trials without an enchanter (and the ones you can do without an enchanter are 3x faster with one).  I miss the days that you just needed &quot;a healer&quot;, &quot;some crowd control (FD puller OR mezzer)&quot;, and &quot;tank&quot; and the classes all more or less worked.</div></div><hr />

/nods agreement<br />
<br />
Even though my main is a warrior (one of the 3 &quot;required&quot; classes for named in GoD), I still think the GoD class requirements are screwed.  <br />
<br />
As to chanter charming...nerf it!!  Since Sony has a need to account for this one ability, the rest of us pay the price.  What happens if you have a group of friends and one isn't a chanter?  Oops, sorry you bought this expansion...go create another twink chanter so you can play here??  That's an absurd game design approach imho.<br />
<br />
By the way, chanters bring a lot more to the table other than charming, kei, and haste.  Crowd control is huge - and used to be their primary role.</div></div><hr />
