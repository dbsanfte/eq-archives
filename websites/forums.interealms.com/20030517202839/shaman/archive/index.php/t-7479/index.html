<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pacman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">PoP is quite crowded and I usually only have 2-3 hours of playtime a night.  Any good spots for a 61 shaman to solo in Luclin for xp ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">UP is still good exp for 60+ as many mobs are 55+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">was in CT sewers for AA today with a group, it really sucked, I dunno when it got nerfed (everyone in group said it used to be much better), but I no longer see CT as a viable spot... /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope, none. Go to PoV and see for your self. After 63 got to Halls of Honor (Assuming by now you are smart enough to join a capable guild) and get 64 and 65. Once in 65 go to AA's. In a 6 man group in HoH i receive 2% AA exp per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">UP seemed suckoid to me after I hit 61 - but maybe I was ready to leave - had been there 3 weeks and acquired 3 complete sets of moktor armour in that time - too bad no good shaman stuff there.<br />
