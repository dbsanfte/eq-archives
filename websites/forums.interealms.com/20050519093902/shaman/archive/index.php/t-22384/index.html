<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Paradime</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been having a great time playing my Shaman! But, I have also read quite a few of the post here, and it seems to me that a lot of you are not happy with what is going on in the Shaman world. For me, I’m just starting out so I don’t see the “end game” SOE  Neftz to the Shaman. I’ll cut to the chase and ask my question.<br />
<br />
Is there still hope??? *Are you guys and ladies ;-) still happy or having fun playing your Shamans any more? Or is there a place in the “end game” for the Shaman class? <br />
<br />
<br />
Have a outstanding weekend, and hey if EQ has you down go play a game of Bocce !!!</div></div><hr />

If you enjoy your shaman thats the only important thing to hold onto nevermind what others think if you are having fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah I love my Shaman too, but I'm only level 50.  From what I've read, it seems you can only complain about being a Shaman when your 65.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is there still hope?  Yes, about 1.5 months' worth if the release to OoW isn't pushed back.  Currently a number of our spells have yet to be finalized, and supposedly our heals are, &quot;under review&quot; by Rytan.  (That and a dollar may get you a cup of coffee at a convenience store.)<br />
<br />
Do I still have fun.  Honestly?  Not really.  I'm a hinderance to most good groups.  That sticks in my craw, because I know they could be better without me.  I don't like doing that to people.<br />
<br />
Right now, no, there isn't much of a place for end game shaman.  I suspect, if they publish what I think they're going to publish for OoW, I'll be retiring.  We'll see.<br />
<br />
At any rate, it's not anything you'll be running into for a good long while.  You may reap the benefits of all the other shaman quitting with OoW, and they might have instituted some changes by the time you get to where we are.<br />

Seen enough I will be in Uqua and the Qvic and maybe then I will be able to complain about it.  <br />
<br />
But to answer your question I have a blast playing my shaman still.  If I were to ever not have fun playing him I would simply quit EQ.  Seems pretty simple to me.  Pay for a game and enjoy it keep paying.  Pay for a game and no longer enjoy it, stop paying for it and find another form of enjoyment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yedra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes there is hope. I am a firm believer in you are what you make of it. I read everyday how the class is this or that but to be honest I dont see it when I log in.<br />
<br />
Without a guild it could be a problem but with a guild I get groups anytime I log in and we field 4 or 5 Shaman every raid and all of us are busy.<br />
<br />
Are there things I wish were fixed? Sure. Are we the ultimate EQ class...thank god no. I log in each day and have fun, that is ultimately hope because if you don't have fun why are you playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The truth of the matter, as I see it, is that whether or not there is hope for the Shaman totally depends on how you like to play and who your adventuring buddies are.<br />
<br />
I love my Shammy.  I admit that I inherited him when he was 54 so I don't have the &quot;full experience&quot; of being a Shaman but I still love him more than my 65 Paladin, Enchanter, or mage.  In fact, my Shaman, crappy heals and all, is the primary healer for the above mentioned 4 boxing crew.  <br />
<br />
Now, while it's true I don't do very well as the solo healer on a hard LDoN or can't take on any Tier 3/Tier 4 mini's by myself I still love the utility of my Shaman.   I can heal, slow, nuke, DoT, and steal aggro when necessary. <br />
<br />
If you like the class now, you'll probably continue to like it at least through the EP's and into Time.  It seems when you reach the ULTRA-High End that people get disconent with the Shaman's abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I still love my shaman in the majority of EQ content. Its just some newer stuff (and the thought that the game might evolve to include more GoD style content) that has me worried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Anyone noticing a trend?<br />
<br />
More and more (mostly new)people are content with their Shaman lately. Rytan's and SoE's way to not adress things and just wait till the &quot;whining&quot; settles down, because we, the whiners, got tired of it, is paying off finally.<br />
<br />
Keep it up and see ya in 3 years, when the next generation of Shamans, which is you, is going to complain about the lack of any real upgrade in the past 7 years.</div></div><hr />

Depending on your race (Vanilla, Hairball, Suitcase, Fat-O, Fly-Eater, Fat-T) you have yet to hit your peak.  Wait until you load up with all the toys and some great spells circa 51.<br />
<br />
Even before then your slows, pets, heals, etc make a HUGE difference in groups.<br />
<br />
Adjust ! Adjust ! Adjust !<br />
<br />
Group is killing too fast to slow?  WOOT ! Time to practice those melee and nuke skills.<br />
<br />
Nobody to group with? WOOT ! Time for you and DogDog(tm) to solo some.<br />
<br />
Wait until you do LDONs.  Even at 65 you can slow AND heal no problem in a normal.  Shoot - there's two slots filled by one person.  WOOT !<br />
<br />
Explore the big old world of Norrath, do some quests, but most importantly - <br />

HAVE FUN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Of course there is hope.<br />
<br />
But at the end of the day shaman need a little work. Or more specificly the gameplay of the sprint fights needs to go away except as a lark now and again. <br />
<br />
Shaman are an over time class. We heal over time. Damage over time. And are efficient over time. But the one thing the game has done since the departure of McQuaid and crew is shortened the time for anything except loot drops. <br />
<br />
When fights last under a minute. We are pretty much dead last in all the areas needed.  <br />
<br />
If the design and gameplay paradigm switch to longer fights. We will start to shine again. What really needs to happen is EQ needs to run the gamut of all fights Some sprint fights some Long endurance fights and all the variables between. But to do so they really need to be able to randomise more of the monster spawns to give  a balanced group a role in adventuring rather than a specialized role only group. (As In the holy Trinity)<br />
<br />
There is certainly hope and you can play for a long while and enjoy yourself. But as it stands at this moment. Shaman are in the end game more useful as a bot you log on. Or Hot box. while playing some other class that offers more specialized roles for the encounters rather than the gameworld.<br />

That being said, I was invited by a rather uber druidess to join her and some of her guild in Vxed to farm spells (well attempt to anyway, but thats another rant entirely). I literally was just a Malos whore for the chanter pet. I was told to stand there Malos, spot heal if needed and to stay off the hate list. I got to slow the big lizard (Utimbi?) and that was it. The only time I felt useful is when the chanters pet went wild (and boy when the fecal matter hits the fan there it goes hard and fast) on a 2 pull, I got to root/rot a mob while the paladin kited another and the druid burned the other.<br />
I have literally never felt so useless in my entire life in this game. I am hoping that this isnt a trend I will be seeing in the future, its very discouraging to stand there and get free exp. <br />
If you stay outta GoD, dont look at it, and you will enjoy what you can offer, dont stress what you cant, it will cause you less heartache. Me and a tank and 4 DPS OWNZ in a LDON, I can main heal in BoT and Tactics (although named do give me a lot of trouble) and if I LFG in the local /plane or /ldon its a rare rare day that I dont get a group very fast. Enjoy that, embrace it, cause if you leave it, your just a Ferine or Malos whore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you hit the nail on the head. Some of the more disgruntled people have already crashed and are cynical/disgruntled/ticked off/[place adjective of frustration here], while the majority of non-high end types haven't and many still enjoy the class.<br />
<br />
I don't believe SoE is as naive as to not listen to the voices of people from both sides of that wall. However, what they choose to do about it is anybody's guess. At least there is dialogue going on. If nothing else, that dangles a glimmer of hope for those still on the fence. Some grasp for that hope, others dismiss it as smoke and mirrors, yet others assume a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to do what you like to do. If you like playing your shaman, then by all means do. Do what you enjoy. If you'd rather find fun elsewhere (tank, caster, or even bocce), then do what ultimately brings the smile to the face and the warm fuzzies to the heart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">There is not a dialouge going on.<br />
<br />
A dialouge is a conversation between two people (Or in this case two groups of people)<br />
<br />
They don't talk to us. They hand down pronouncements from high above. <br />
<br />
It is almost like seeing a bunker mentality. Or tossing Meat to the wolves. And sadly it isnt going to change anytime soon. They will make the changes they want to. And shaman will be stuck where we are until enough people quit that it raises a res flag. But since Shamanbot is so effective we may never get that red flag. <br />
<br />
They care about the game sure. As in the whole game. But they can't care about the individual experiances that each player has about the game. Too many people playing and to few working to make the game for all those people. The only time idividuals matter in the framework of descisions at SOE is when a collective amount cancle billing.<br />
<br />
It is a great way to run a buisness for profit. But a ****ty way to make a game fun or to engender trust and goodwill towards your company. And they lost sight of that. This is supposed to be fun.<br />
<br />
Hey SOE Many many shaman are not having fun. To allow us to have fun again. We need the tools that were given to us before. And the proper environment to use those tools. Also at the end of the day when all the other classes are given new tools and we are left with the same ones. We feel neglected and unloved. Fix this and you will have many many more accounts and new accounts because as a whole shaman are people who talk to other people. And your best salesman and worst enemy are the same people. The people who play your game.<br />
<br />
Give us the tools and the environment please. Is it so much to ask.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I think the big problem is GoD as long as you don't go there you should enjoy the shaman experince and feel like a useful entegral member of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">My personal opinion is there Shamans arent the only class who is being hung out to dry therefore, as Snoww mentioned, the problems arent TOTALLY about the class, but about the content. <br />
<br />
Lets face it, if you want guarentees, make a &quot;Big 3&quot;. Thats all your gonna get. And even then, Chanters become less useful in the CURRENT end-game than people think (nothing charmable in KT and beyond). But EQ is about Warriors and Clerics, and the rest of us basically support that. Given the current state of the content, and the strength of other classes who share the abilities we have, Shaman are well below average. A couple tweaks would put them to a level where people wont &quot;pass over&quot; us as much, but I really dont EVER see Shamans re-gaining that &quot;Godlike&quot; status we enjoyed during Kunark, Velious and somewhat in Luclin and early POP. <br />
<br />
I think SOE is listening. I think they are trying to make adjustments that will not be too unbalancing. In that regard, I have to give them some props. Afterall, the &quot;old way&quot; was to TOTALLY overnerf thiings then creep it back up to par. This time, they didnt overnerf, they over-adjusted the CONTENT, which has left our strengths behind in the evolution of the game. <br />
<br />
The problem, as has been descibed many times, is that specialization trivializes other classes. If a Knight can tank it, its trivial for a Warrior to do so. If a Shaman can heal for it, its trivial for a Cleric to do so. If they make TOO many adjustments toward a middle, they risk pissing off the classes that are the most abundant in the game (looking at my guilds roster, we have more clerics and warriors than any other 3 classes combined). Lets face it, a Cleric &quot;sit-in&quot; would grind the game to a complete halt. I am not sure that will EVER be fixable. <br />
<br />
Play whats fun. Of the 200ish days played on my Shaman, I am guessing 190 of em were a BLAST and I was extremely powerful and dominating in almost any group I was in. Even today, in everyday places like LDoN normal, I dominate. I can litterally take on a pack of 6 of those buggers and slay em all. <br />
<br />
The big question now lies in the hands of SOE. What will OoW be like. OoW, and its 5 levels, will make Gates FAR easier and Shaman will again be able to function with effectiveness in the places we now suck (trials, etc). But how will shaman fit into the overall scheme of THAT expansion. <br />
<br />
Guess we wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I loved playing my shaman all the way to 55... then this began (gradually mind yu) to decline, the higher the lvl the more it seemd to get worse, now im 65 and so ticked off with the state of shaman. i havent logged in the big furball in a while.<br />
<br />
Tho i found exploring old content and taking on big things in the old world a BLAST, i just not feeling the love.<br />
<br />
For a fact, we all LOVE the shaman class, we wouldnt be so passionate about it if we didnt. Were just reaching the end of our teathers TBH.<br />
<br />
For all yu younger shaman, yu'll love it i did and so did most if not all of the others  - lets just hope that the current Generation of shaman (thats the old crew) get the job done and fix us before yu younger ones get yur paws dirty in the fight and get disgrunted too - i would seriously hate for yu guys to feel useless in a group, etc. cos it a bad feeling.<br />
<br />
*sigh* i feel like ive gone on a bit much, but all i can say if yu want a single sentance... Yes play him/her all yu can cos yu will enjoy it theres no doubt about it, dont get PL'd up to high lvls ENJOY the lvling  and take yur time to learn the class because its a joy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A truer thing has not been said...All of the joys and pains associated with making you a good shaman come from leveling the &quot;old&quot; way.<br />
<br />
Would I level another class to 65 again....NOPE!  I don't wanna go thru all the flagging or AA requirements.  If I moved my Warrior onto a seperate account I might. Hmmmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Would I level another class to 65 again....NOPE!  I don't wanna go thru all the flagging or AA requirements.  If I moved my Warrior onto a seperate account I might. Hmmmmm<br />
The ONLY thing I would consider &quot;Powerlevling&quot; is a Warrior or Cleric. I have a 52 cleric and a 46 warrior. I &quot;played&quot; them both, mostly, and to be honest, those classes bore me to tears. <br />
<br />
Any other twink I make I like to play. I will PL past the lower levels where you get couple buffs and your basically invincible, etc, but once I hit the 30s with a guy, I like to take him to places I skipped along the way with other characters, especially newer expansions. I had my fill of most of Kunark, but I havent actually played in a lot of Luclin zones. I did Nadox with my shaman when LoY came out, but not much in Gunthak or Dulak, so I go there sometimes. <br />
<br />
I guess a lot of the answers revolve around WHY you play EQ. For me, multiple characters help answer multiple playstyles that I enjoy. <br />
<br />
If someone came here and said &quot;I am making a guy who will be PLed to 65 + 50 aa to play at the very cutting edge of the game, what class should I pick&quot;, my answer wouldnt be Shaman. But other than that, Shamans are a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I have been having a great time playing my Shaman! <br />
<br />
You answered your own question ... pretty much. Enjoy it. At the high end there is still much to enjoy about playing a shaman. There are also - currently - areas in the game where what you could do as a shaman elsewhere can't be done.<br />
<br />
When I was leveling up I avoided undead areas. They are poison/disease immune critters for the most part. My best and most powerful tools for dmg were resisted way too much - totally resisted in some places. So I didn't go there - alone.<br />
<br />
With every class I have played (and I have quite a few 65 and 60+ classes - played toons) there are places they are not effective. So, those classes don't go there. Each goes to the places they can be most effective (solo) or at the least significant contributors (groups.)<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with shaman and GoD is the 'raid' or 'group raid' enounters are where we feel the bite this time. This has happened to other classes in other expansions and time cured it. The zones were changed, abilities were added to compensate, or the classes adapted. Time will tell how this works out with GoD zones-high end.<br />
<br />
As others mentioned ... don't sweat the problems 65's are having now. It isn't your problem. Don't race to 65 just to get there. You are having fun now - continue to do so. Don't powerlevel. The journey will teach you many things you have yet to even guess about and you will see many parts of the game a lot of 65's have never experienced. See as much as you can. Play in all the zones you can find to play in. Challenge yourself against content you are at now and work, slowly, up the xp chain.<br />

By the time you get to where the problems are today they will likely be history. Old-farts will be saying things like: &quot;yeah, well GoD used to suck for shaman, uphill and down in a 100 degree snowstorm. You got it lucky, kid.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Shamans up all through GoD and into early GoD are awesome.<br />
<br />
They aren't as good later, but they are still a great fun class.<br />
<br />
Every week or two the cut-off for where Shaman are magically &quot;no good anymore&quot; gets pushed further and further into the progression line.<br />
<br />
Two or so months ago it was end-game PoP.. then it was all of GoD, now it's mid-GOD (I assume Ikkinz and beyond?)<br />
<br />
To be honest, I've only done Ikkinz 1-3, but in all sincerity I STILL didn't notice any problems, especially once they bumped up Balance of the Nihil to 75% and thus blocked enchanters from overwriting my slow.  That was my sole complaint.  Not healing.<br />
<br />
Also in all honesty, I felt like Shaman were pretty balanced and that I was pretty powerful until I got bogged down in the Crucible's doldrums.  I've never felt like or been a hinderance to a group.  Ever.  Then I started reading these forums, and all these well-formulated and justified arguments about how Shaman are getting the shaft in EQ, and my outlook changed.. I suddenly wasn't happy with the shaman anymore.  This was aided by the fact that I used to be in a channel with one of the server's best-known whiners concerning shaman topics (Hi, Griz)<br />
<br />
Then one day I took a step back, and said, hey, am I having fun?  Am I fulfilling the role Shaman are expected to fulfill in the game, i.e. buffing and slowing?  Yeah?  Ok cool.<br />
<br />
I think that if you are unhappy playing your shaman, quit reading the Crucible for a week.  It'll improve your game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Zunayn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">only once ive felt useless in GoD is 1 group ikkinz trial, the first one with DD, as u need an enc for cc on end boss<br />
<br />
other than that im very happy with the GoD expansion and happy with the current state of my class :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Do I feel useless? No, far from it. Even little heals make a difference, slow is still a nice spell and more HPs are more HPs.<br />
<br />
Do I feel like I contribute my share? No, far from it. I do ok in oddball low DPS groups where MOBs still die somewhat slow. I do fine on the few raids that are specifically tailored for shaman curing. But overall I feel like I contribute less then any other class, except possibly berserkers.<br />
<br />
Back In Kunark and Velious I knew I was playing a powerful class. Ok, maybe that was a little too powerful. In PoP I got to know the joy of slow mitigation but I still did not feel weak - far from it. I was happy for some neglected classes to get to my level of power but I did not feel bad in comparison to other classes, except some of the more broken applications of charm.<br />
<br />
Come LDoN I felt like I was the worst choice for a group for an entire expansion. I crunched some numbers and they confirmed my feelings. That trend continued in GoD.<br />
<br />
Some may still feel useful contributing 50% of another class. Some may scream bloody murder when they drop to 90%. But you can not deny shamans have gotten a lot less powerful over the course of the last expansions. In my opinion SOE went too far in balancing the Kunark syndrome and they do not seem to be listening to us.<br />
<br />
So, is there hope left? Sure, there always is. But if OoW does not give the shaman class some substantial upgrades I will probably quit. Not because I burned out. Not because RL forces me to. Not because a better game came long. I will quit because SOE has actively made the game no fun to play for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Yup, some people would be happy playing their class at only 10% of its former power.  That doesn't change that basically shamans are balanced for slower content than we have now at the top end and will, by the developers' own assertion, never have again.<br />
<br />
If you like a toon, you like it, and that's good enough.  <br />
<br />
But the shaman is a more energy-intensive class to play than most, what with all the canni'ing and so many different things you can do(maybe not do well, but DO), which cuts down on the ability to socialize a lot and just gets wearying sometimes.  For the value they are going to be bringing to future groups and guilds compared to the effort required to play shamans, it's pretty easy to recommend other classes instead, if you were just starting up now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>littuljohn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Hey everyone!<br />
<br />
I have a few chars that ive played over the years, started with a war, then a sk, then a shammy, then a bard, now im lookin back at my shammy. Maybe i missed it but why is everyone asking if there is still hope for shammys? Dont you always need someone to slow mobs? I never got very high but i was talkin with a friend of mine and he was like you always need a slower. And why is it that they become usless at GoD? Sorry im confused and would like to knwo what everyones talkin about before i spend 15k worth on my 31 shammy. Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Velkoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">To get some things straight,the high end raiding shaman is pretty much unbalanced...all you do in raids is mgb/buff fallen members/debuff/slow main targets/FA melee's and maybe toss a heal every now and then...in some zones like txevu and on Potime encounters we use our cures a lot wich really put us on &quot;wanted&quot; list,but the most unbalancing thing is shamans dont have some short of group heal (Hot or DD) That would easily put shammys in front of many classes as in what is comming to raiding.specially GoD end zones have some nasty AE going on and only classes than can contribute to group healing are paladins,since usually clerics are too busy in CH rot.If shamans would get even a small group heal it would help greatly,apart from raiding soloing and grouping seems fine for me as it is except some minor bugs like recast time when using aa (Canni/SC/VP)....i wouldnt whine about shamans specially since there are some reaaally unbalanced classes (hint* bards)<br />

With only an hour or so to play, and even then maybe needing to be afk at a moment's notice for a minute or 5 makes a shammy great fun. I solo a ton and if a mob's slowed, and dotted, my pet and me on autoattack can kill most mobs even if I'm not at the keyboard. Plus, with pet taunting, in a pinch I can step back and gate if I need to leave the game.  Gotta love the flexibility.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.<br />

I've soloed from Lvl 1 to 60.<br />
Pet taunt doesnt work;does it?<br />
Especially once the mob is dotted, the mob sticks on me like super glue.<br />
Its always me tanking and the pet backstab away.<br />
I like my Vah Shir shaman too. But i also think its not a good idea to start a shaman now. Better to go with a BST or ENC. My 2c.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Is there still hope??? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At one time, a long, long time ago, when the world was peaceful and the evils we now know did not exist, there was a box.  Everybody was told not to open this box.  Some chick named Pandora was an ubern00b and opened it anyway.<br />
<br />
Out from the box flew all the evils we know today, pain, jealousy, suffering, greed, malice, etc.<br />
<br />
After all of them had fled, and begun to infect the world, there remained at the bottom of the dark and empty box a small, shining light.  This was a ray of what we now know as HOPE.<br />
<br />
Then a beastlord came by and looted it.<br />
<br />
So the answer is, probably not.</div></div><hr />
