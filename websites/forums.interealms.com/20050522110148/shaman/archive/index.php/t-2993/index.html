<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, i'm level 44, and have been helping my cousin farm things for his smithing in Tenebrous mountains in the grimling mines.<br />
<br />
I usually make a pet, and if I slow one of the warrior type grimlings, he can solo it no problem (when buffed).<br />
<br />
Anyway, the pathing in there is horrible, and find I often have to summon my pet back to me (ala: Summon Companion)<br />
<br />
But I've noticed something odd, usually about the 3rd or fourth cycle through the mines, I see my pet wonder off (not chasing, just walks away) I try and summon, but says I no longer have a pet? Any ideas? I've checked and he's not being dot'd by the geomancers (only casters in there) and I never see the pet taunting attacker message either. He's usually at full health too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've noticed that too in Velks a few times, mostly when my pet is walking back to his spot after a fight, or I tell him to auto follow.  Very annoying to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've noticed that there are spots in zones where, if the pet tries to walk through one of these spots, the pet simply dies for no reason at all.  These spots can be in the strangest of places: for example, in Crystal Caverns in the room with the broken bridge, if the pet walks across the walkway on the far side of the bridge from the dorf city, he dies.  In the middle of the room, in plain sight with no visible obstacles at all.  There's a spot in Kurn's Tower also, and in Field of Bone as well.  I presume these are bugs and exist in almost every zone, though whether it's just me who's bugged or whether it's a general problem, I've no idea.<br />
<br />
And yeah, it's very very annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">do you get the death message or just a poof?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just poofs for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yah this was happening to me in CC also in the broken bridge room. I would tell him to follow or guard and he would just poof and next command I gives me the message that I dont have a pet to comman. Kinda annoying after awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This happened a lot when I was hunting in echo caverns. Very annoying. Nothing like blowing ~500 mana. I did bug reports, but I don't know if anything has changed there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The pet just makes the yelping noise and... just poofs like it does when you tell the pet to get lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some weird pathing issues kill pets and even mobs. If you go into velks and turn left to the single spider spawn under the ramp up and set up camp there. Every time i summoned a pet it insta killed itself and when pulling mobs down to there they often poofed as they jumped down.<br />
<br />
A pain when the 55 pet costs rather a lot of mana :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">TM has pathing issues - especially in the mines.  I ended up just not using a pet in there.  If you use a pet you are going to have to park and pull to outside the caves.  Dogdog will path under the world and poof if you let him walk into either cave I think.<br />
<br />
Edit: tpying is hrad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have had my pet poof in quite a few places.  there used to be a time when he would poof and &quot;yelp&quot; but lately I dont even get the &quot;yelp&quot; he just disappears.<br />
<br />
To combat this I've take to issuing the /pet sit and just summoning him where ever I go.  That way he will never wander.  (Of course there are drawbacks to this method, like being uble to call him back from combat.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I believe this to be a pathing issue.  I have noticed it in dawnshroud where I could see my pet clearly.  He just got stuck in a pathing loop and couldn't get out until I came and stood right next to him.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My pet has been poofing like crazy in ssra and in Vex Thal too. no AE and no riposte killed him. It seems when i /pet kill  on a target, i get the dog yelp and poof, pet is gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kellk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've been having problems like this for awhile now...and ranting to my wife about it across the room doesn't seem to help.<br />
I've lost the damn dog in most every indoor zone.  I've witnessed the mysterious &quot;yelp - poof&quot; phenomenon in Kurn's and Chardok.  I've also just had the pet simply wander off.  He's been instructed to guard, goes to kill something, and after it's dead, he just leisurely walks away...sometimes right through a wall.  Sometimes I frantically try to issue the &quot;pet follow me&quot; hotkey, sometimes I just sit and watch him go. <br />
<br />
I'm not so upset about the mana, I'm more upset about having to have the summon companion spell taking up a slot all the time.  <br />
<br />
I'm glad other people are having this problem as I thought it was just me and my lag or something.  Well...I'm not *glad* people are having it...I'm just glad it's not just me.<br />
<br />
Somebody complain to Absor on our behalf please!  heheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The exact same thing is happened to me in Kurns, Nurga, Droga and Kaesora.  After numerous petitions/pleas for help, I was contacted by our server GM.  I was told it was known and confirmed bug... but this is the part that kills me.  She said, &quot;You should do a /bug report and maybe they'll fix it.&quot;  Classic.  I replied, why do I have to do a bug report if its a known bug?  She said volume doesn't hurt.  So...... it's /bug time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">All of the current Pet poofing problems (and some of the pathing crap) happened with the Luclin graphics change.<br />
<br />
When they changed the graphics they made the pets Z axis too low. (as in to close to the ground) In chardok if you summon a pet and move through the place to The exit ramp, you can watch a real pain in the ass bug that is reproduciable and no dev wants to look at. <br />
<br />
Pet will get stuck on the steps and will go under the world and &quot;warp&quot; to his bind point (the location where you summoned him originally) <br />
<br />
When pet cannot path to you he does one of two things. Poof (as in 32K himself) or warp to spawn point. Sadly with the damn graphics change to our pets this happens a hell of alot.<br />
<br />
Watch your pets closely and beware of steps, mutt was made alot more stupid with luclin.<br />
