Our DoTs are useless. I see no way in which the Devs can physically implement (coding) our dots into fights that last only about 30 seconds. I see no change with our DD in the future. Our rain spell must resist at least 1 out of 3 times or the world will come to an end. How about this;<br />
<br />
Lets contribute our dps, by buffing the melees in the group with an &quot;Offensive Buff Proc&quot;. For instance, we would cast this &quot;Buff Proc&quot; on a melee character that would proc some sort of DD/DoT,  2 or 3 times a minute.  (Example =  A &quot;DoT Proc&quot; with an initial 500DD followed by 4 ticks of 233dmg.  800mana/6 min. duration)<br />
 <br />
- Now, this would resolve and be a substitute (in GoD)  for our DD and DoT problem.  Which Would;<br />
a) let all of our attention on debuffing the mob and healing , instead of getting frustrated, trying to land some<br />
damage on the mob, with the little bit of time left in which the mob has to live.<br />
b) Totaly resolve all of our problems when it comes to adding DPS to the group.<br />
c) Make shaman become the &quot;King of Buffs&quot; once again.<br />
<br />
I think it's an interesting idea. At 2 procs a minute it would be 56 DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think its a nice idea, and in a way its kinda more obvious the influence of the shaman in the group more than ferine avatar I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DoT procs are a bad idea. Ripostes making MOBs unmezzable is not a good thing. Change it to a pure DD though and it would be a good spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then why not have a few different versions of &quot;Offensive Proc Buffs&quot;.  For instance, DD/Stun, or perhaps Just a DD proc. <br />
When people post ideas, Its always better to just &quot;work off of that idea&quot;, instead of takeing it for what it Exactly is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can't proc on a riposte.<br />
<br />
The idea is still useless unless you change it to a DD(would have to be higher than 500 obviously). The problem of DoTs is that they take too long to do their full damage and 0.1 to 5.9 seconds to actually &quot;start&quot; doing damage. <br />
<br />
Coupled with the randomness of procs the DPS contribution would be low and the hate generation way too high to use it on all melees. If you proc'ed 3 times back to back the DoT damage wouldn't add up, just the DD portion would.<br />
With 305 Dex you'd proc 2 times per minute on average, but in 30 second fights, you'd proc 15.5 seconds into the fight(once every 30 seconds) <br />
In numbers that would mean that in a 30 second fight you'd provide 500 direct damage and between 466 and 699 damage over time through this buff. That's 1083 damage per mob(30 sec fight) on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interesting idea, but the mana cost proposed is twice as high as it should be.  Why oh why does every shaman idea come coupled with an insane mana cost?  2K mana HoT, 800 mana buff procs...where does it end?

Pressing Can4 is just stupid.  The first time I have to replace my keyboard because my 8 key is broken I'm sending the bill to Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Interesting idea...my initial reaction is I like it.  Also, in addition to dps it could be a great &quot;hate increaser&quot; for tanks - similar to the SK voice line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Proc Buff&quot; <br />
<br />
Average dmg per mob       = 1000 (being very modest)<br />
Average kill in 6 min.(GoD) = 8<br />
Total average dmg           = 8000<br />
Total mana used              = 800<br />
<br />
Total efficiency               = 10<br />
<br />
So an 8000dmg / 800mana damage spell costs too much mana ?<br />
(This is more mana efficient then any of our poison / Bane DoT spells)<br />
<br />
And the nice part about this, It doesnt matter how many mobs you kill per min.  As long as the person you give this buff to is doing his job, it will always put out a good amount of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Efficiency isnt important anymore.<br />
<br />
The point is that who the h#&amp;@ wants to keep up buffs that last 6 minutes?  I'd say the bare minimum is 20 minutes base time.  At that point, it's almost worth keeping up.  With SCRM &amp; EE you could prolly push it out to 30-35 minutes . . . making it a strong buff, but leaving you time to do something other than Can back mana to recast the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Problem would be that it probably wouldn't stack with pestillence shock or Shroud of Chaos/Pious Might and whatever the ranger one is. And I'm sure clerics would complain because we could cast it on ourselves! ^_^</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah.<br />
<br />
Clerics complain just to hear the sound of their voice.  Ignore them.<br />
<br />
Anyone who rolled a Cleric did so knowing they were a healer.  Clerics are currently the best healers in the game by such a large margin that it takes *two* of the second best healer to even come close.<br />
<br />
In short, they really have nothing to b*&amp;$@ about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Semi agree. I really don't want another type of FA buff where you have to redo it every 6 or so minutes. That would be insane trying to keep that on everyone that melees. BUT if you make it to long people can just easily ask for the buff then go group without ever needing a shaman... I guess what i'm saying is i don't like the idea at all *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Which is why I said 20 minutes base.  Even pushed out to 30-35 with AA's it's not really enough that it becomes a &quot;Shaman optional&quot; group.<br />
<br />
30 minutes isn't really enough time to get anywhere and kill anything.  That Shaman needs to be there to keep the buff fresh, but it's long enough that if there is a Shaman present he isn't annoyed to high hades at having to keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Me thinks they should include include some Combat Effects and Strikethrough and other high level melee focus effect enhancements in FA.

Another buff = another buffslot. Thats why enhancing FA would be even better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is, it's very obvious when your nuke is done working, because the damage hits the mob. a DoT gives you a &quot;Worn Off&quot; message. buffs on other people do not do this. Maybe they could implement it? like give a message &quot;Bobthefighter's Focus of the Seventh spell has worn off&quot; and make it on a toggle so if people don't like it they can lose it :)<br />
<br />
the other thing is, passive damage isn't very exciting, even less so when it dominates a spell slot. If they implement this spell, they could make it have no recast, but be group only and last a while so that you couldn't cast it on too many people on raids, but it wouldn't be horrendus to maintain the upkeep on.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I agree that we should have &quot;Worn Off&quot; messages for our buffs.  But if I remeber right, there was already discussion about this.  And nothing was done.<br />
<br />
Seems like most of you just dont like the idea of buffing more.  Well, how about just adding it to an existing buff then.  Perhaps FA would be the best choice.  Take out the useless stat buffs and add a DD proc to it.   What ya think ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference is that any 2 boxed / bot'ed Shaman can keep buffs up.  It takes thought, experience and involvement to know when to cast what type of spell when you are doing DD/DoT/Rain.<br />
<br />
I don't want to be a buff bot.  Yes, I want to buff, that's part of what Shaman do, but I don't want to be doing nothing but buffing.  If I wanted to be a one trick pony I'd have rolled a Cleric and never again worried about getting a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with most shaman when I say, I don't want another short term buff.  <br />
<br />
My vision of the shaman has always been:<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman prime roles:<br />
<br />
1. Increase the damage a mob receives:<br />
----a) Buffing the player<br />
..........i. melee buffs: attack, str, dex, strikethrough, etc..<br />
..........ii. caster buffs: focus type effects (mental strength, chance to crit, etc..)<br />
----b) Weakening defense<br />
..........i. help melee hit: reducing AC, agility, etc..<br />
..........ii. help casters hit: reducing resists<br />
<br />
2. Damaging the mob:<br />
----a) Dots: Need a complete overhaul.<br />
..........i. Aggro: Dots should be less aggro than nukes. period.<br />
..........ii. Duration: Suggestion 1) Dots burn mana as they tick, and can run forever if you can keep mana up. Suggestion 2) Dots &quot;splurt&quot; backwards. 800, 500, 200, 100 etc..<br />
----b) Rains/AE: Let this be our &quot;specialty&quot;.<br />
..........i. Reduce the resist rate<br />
..........ii. Increase Variety<br />
__________1) Reintroduce our fire line as a single target 3 wave &quot;nuke&quot; type rain. Highest resist rate, similar to our poison now.<br />
__________2) Buff our poison line. Give it -50pr, increase dmg. 4 target like now.<br />
__________3) Reintroduce disease cloud. True AE, but lower damage, however easiest to land.<br />
----c) Nukes: Bah, let the druids have them<br />
<br />
3. Complimentary healers:<br />
----a) Heal over time<br />
..........i. Largest single target heal over time of any priest.<br />
..........ii. Group Quiessence<br />
----b) Wave healing<br />
..........i. AE Heal in a rain form<br />
..........ii. Single target rain heal.<br />
----c) Weakest direct heals of any priest.<br />

In terms of redefining our existing dot line to be more meaningful, I've always thought we could do that in one of two ways.  Backwards splurts, or mana burned only per tick.  Either way would allow us to use dots more effectively in shorter battles.</div></div><hr />

LOL, look you cannot consider this as a &quot;short duration buff &quot;.  This is more less an &quot;indirrect damage spell&quot;.  This has pracitically everything that our DoTs are lacking.  You have to consider this as a substiute to our dots.....<br />
<br />
Proc Buff<br />
<br />
- Can cast before the mob comes<br />
- Increase ago on Tank, not on self<br />
- Just, if not more efficient then our best dot (seems to proc at an average of every 6 seconds)<br />
- can contribute more dps to the group then we ever can with our dots<br />
- has a 300 resist modifier<br />
<br />
 DoTs<br />
<br />
- Can only cast after the mob is slowed (which leaves us with about 45 seconds for our DoT(s) to run)<br />
- DoTs have high agro, in which we can only land about 2 (or 1 poison dot), unless good tank is in group.<br />
- Our DoTs have no resist modifier, in which our magic based dot (the only 1 that has the capability to last its full duration) seems to resist heavilly.<br />
<br />
Other then not knowing when the buff fades (which can be changed at any time), what would the reason be to cast DoTs over this ??????</div></div><hr />

The proc every 6 seconds would make this much more...interesting.  However, if it is the same as a weapon proc so 3 a minute or so..not so great.  We shall see, but if this thing fires 8+ times a minute on each person using it...we have a winner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess the Devs did like the idea.  <br />
I love the idea! Not sure if I'd waste mana casting it on the melees though, as it would go off only twice or three times a minute. No, I'd cast it on my wolf instead, as if you've ever seen a beastlord pet proccing away - they must go off 10 times a minute or more.<br />
<br />
I for one hope they don't make any changes at all to this superb spell, but as I can't see them let us have a pet with higher DPS than a beastlord warder I guess alterations are inevitable.</div></div><hr />

I think this Proc might be time based not skill based.  Kind of like some of the other procs that are on weapons, that have been proven to be time based, no matter how fast or slow you hit.</div></div><hr />

parsing shows that all procs are over time, but a proc can only be activated on a swing. haste has been shown to decrease proc rate.<br />
<br />
you can increase proc rate by reaching a higher skill and an optimum dexterity level.<br />
<br />
parsing shows that proc rate is dependant on 3 factors.<br />
<br />
skill<br />
dexterity<br />
the proc itself.<br />
<br />
proc rate will softcap w/ maxed weapon skill and 255 dex.<br />
the weapon's proc rate is variable by proc. some weapons have a proc rate modifier on them.<br />
<br />
Pile Driver has a 200% proc rate mod on it. (no wonder it's so valued!)<br />
<br />
as for proc buffs, the proc rate will be dependant upon what it is coded as, because I don't believe &quot;proc buffs&quot; have been parsed on special weapons.</div></div><hr />

How about &quot;Combat effect&quot; focus on items ??  I have +25 totall &quot;combat effects&quot; on all of my wears. Not sure if this spell is effected by that, but im getting 1 proc every 6 seconds from that spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">well, I wasn't really working with &quot;combat effects&quot;, as many of the people I encounter don't have it.<br />
<br />
but generally proc rate is dependant on those three factors.<br />
<br />
to see how &quot;combat effects&quot; affect proc rate, I'd need to see more parsing data. some effects have been parsed to be marginal at best. (have seen several people claim some effects to be effective to a great degree, but when parsed out, have a 0.7% difference)<br />
<br />
not saying this is, because I don't know, yet.<br />
<br />
gathered information: no real definition of combat effects, speculation, opinion, and out of the blue ideas. (graffe's has a guy who says he read somewhere that it increases proc rate by....you guessed it, 0.7% per point)<br />
<br />
simple, personal assumptions and ideas:<br />
I would guess that &quot;combat effects&quot; will have an impact on proc rate, but it really sounds to me like a more direct effect to &quot;Cleave&quot;, &quot;Ferocity&quot;, and other combat &quot;Focus Effects&quot;</div></div><hr />

I guess it all comes down to how often this thing procs.  2-3 times a min, they can shove it up their asses for 600 mana and 1 minute duration.  6-10..I'll like it.</div></div><hr />

If you're in beta, copy your character over or /betabuff a 65 to at least test the lower version of the spell.<br />
<br />
/spell will give you every spell in the game, including the new one (two).</div></div><hr />

Well, in the past mediocre spells have gone live just as they were when the NDA was lifted. I really hope that the same is true this time!  ;) <br />
