<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My coldain wrist (EAIII) is currently working on level 64 and 65 DoTs....what gives?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they might have done the whole scaling thing with all the focus levels.. does it give the full focus effect on 65 dots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its probably a bug.<br />
<br />
Untill very recently, there was a bug that allowed the wizard Spell Iceflame of E'ci to work with spells up to 65, even though it was designed since PoP to only work on level 60 spells.  It was fixed after about a week or so.<br />
<br />
IF it concerns you, /bug it.  Otherwise, be happy with it and use it till its fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Coldain wrist (focusIII) was working with Blood of Saryn and Breath of Ulthor, and as far as i could tell, it was giving full effects (haven't parsed tho'). My SK pal was telling me that his focusIV was working on his level 66 spells too.<br />
<br />
I won't be /bug or /petitioning it any time soon! I wasn't complaining, just wondering if anyone else had noticed the same thing? Its nice to get a mistake working in our favor for a change....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Leez-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On a similar nore, I use Tribute Burning Affliction cause I no longer have a BA4 item, and I see the msg when I click my rosraks greaves, but not when I cast BoS, didnt experiment with other DoT's, anyone else getting this too? Or is there a limit to how many effect msg's you see per cast? cause I have several that go off each cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wristguard is working on BoS andBoU for me too :-) I ain't tellin :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Developer's Corner: Focus Effects after level 65 (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63311) -- &quot;All existing foci are having their effects changed to scale down at 10% effectiveness per level past their previously explicit level cap.&quot;<br />
<br />
That means focus III items will work on spells up to level 69 now, but at reduced effectiveness per spell level above 60. It's not a secret, to the developers anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ahah - excellent. Thanks for the explanation Nytmare.</div></div><hr />

Ain't that the truth, brother! Ask him about tanking Radir - he will get all embarrassed when he admits he died in about 40 seconds and then I tanked the mofo for the next 15 minutes...hahaha</div></div><hr />
