<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, after i was late to my own party... Arb got us going and I got a couple more dorf traitor heads.  But, after the hand in to Peffin, she poofed and ran to the river... very strange, however Arb found her pulled her back... and she did not drop anything.  Petitioned, to which the guide responded he/she would pass it on but as it was the 3rd anniversary, GMs were not on and to re-petition Monday.  Arb would have none of that and went to try another avalance ale (which he brewed sucessfully!).  <br />
Meanwhile we began the 7th ring for Neverflee.  After Arb and friends returned we almost completed the 7th, but the last NPC, Dobbin, would not finish the quest!  He petitioned that, as well as Arb.  Long story short... after a few guides and GMs, finally Saiphos showed up and returned the shackle key to Neverflee and the Note for Peffin to me.  Saiphos rocks... as do all you KoE and friends who hung out as long as you did with us!  Thanks for allowing me to get closer to the ninth ring :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meiyo Shiryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Always glad to help my guild friends.<br />
Especially my hero ARSECN. (you sexy troll you)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good to hear.  Our new GM is pretty cool, the guy showed up once in dreadlands and gave me and my group Beer and Gnome Sandwiches, and just hung out with us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gotta say this was a very frustrating night for me.  I very much wanted to complete the 9th Ring Quest for Arse.  He has helped on more Ring Quests than about anyone else in guild and is incredibly deserving.<br />
<br />
When I petitioned the Guide that replied told me that, in all probability, if we respawned Peffin the results would be the same.  That it was a result of all the extra mobs up in zone (Giants Left over from failed/exploited 8th quests).  I do not understand why they won't repop when a quest properly executed will fail because of zone condition, but apparently if the situation was created by player characters they will not repop.<br />
<br />
I do appreciate the support of all the KoE members and petitioners on this Raid...We rocked and executed and accomplished both of those quests...I just feel like we deserve more than replacement of the item turned in so that we can do it again when we get the time...<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone for showing and performing flawlessly...:)<br />
<br />
Arse...You will have that ring, and soon...</div></div><hr />
