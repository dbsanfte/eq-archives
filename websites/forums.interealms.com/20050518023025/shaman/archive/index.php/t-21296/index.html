<br />
Yes, of course I will. <br />
<br />
30 bucks isnt much compared to the price of new games. Even broken content USUALLY eventually gets fixed. 5 more levels and spells and more zones isnt a BAD thing, in concept, its just going to depend how it goes execution-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to agree with Blazz.  Besides I got this condition that once I start something I can't stop.  For instance I was bored and everything was closed except the movie theatre that just happened to be playing Harry Potter.  So I watched it, was disappointed, and when the second came out I saw that too and was also disappointed.  I can't stop what I start so I look for excuses to keep going.  Herminy (spelled wrong) is looking better each film huh???? DOH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">5 levels more and more spells ARE a problem imo.<br />
i mean, we are the class that always hears &quot;giving you an upgrade to your slow would outbalance older content&quot; ... ok, now the question is, what will 5 more levels do to PoP and/or GoD?<br />
<br />
sorry if dozends other threads already said that, but dont have much time reading everything today :)<br />
<br />
p.s. i bet the fights will become even more high-dps-low-hp-12 secs fights</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a distinct possibility. I wonder which direction SOE will push us, improved healing, dps, or debuffing. We will have to see. My bet is they push us to be better healers, but whatever comes, I will adapt, and probably whine a little, and keep plugging away. <br />
<br />
Til something better comes along. As I look up on top of my bookcase, I see 4 or 5 other &quot;something betters&quot; so far, LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I will bitch about SOE and complain but bottom line is there is no other game that i would rather play at the moment. I did not buy GOD though really there is no point at the moment im not in Time and until i can get there .. there is no real point in me starting GoD. i will check out implementation hopefully snag a beta spot and check it out for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unless the fix the problems in EQ now (GoD, all class concerns/bugs/problems) then I won't be buying crap from SOE ever again.  That includes EQ2.<br />

And i mean really fix, not just throw a cheap bone or two at the problems.</div></div><hr />

at the pace i play, even at 65 and 40 spent AA's, i could spend a year in LDoN and the Planes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would not buy the expansion, but it should be free to anyone who purchased GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dsalcedo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I will buy the new expansion just to hit level 70.  I have liked all of the previous expansions minus GoD which I despise.  I must be one of the only people who regularly XPs in Hates Fury.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Extraor Dinary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I look at it this way.  I'm more of the casual gamer that does the whole pick me up group with people I don't really know.  When I was level 50 I enjoyed going to Hate/Fear but hated the fact we needed 18+ people to even attempt it.  Kunark comes out, 10 levels later with new spells and better gear you can now do hate with 12, even less if you're good.  Throw in a few more expansions with better gear, AA's, and 5 more levels I can head up to hate and solo there.  For me, increasing the high end game makes lower end stuff trivial, which gives me a better chance at experiencing it without the need of a raid force.  To be able to do stuff by myself when I only have a few hours or don't feel like dragging some friends to an outdated zone is great for me.  Give us 5 more levels, throw in some better bazaar gear for me to buy, drop me a few upgrades to my spells and I'll be happy with the expansion because it gives me a little bit more edge to venture solo into more places I've always wanted to go.  <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I know we have some major issues raiding, buffing, healing, slowing, dd'ing, and such which do need to be addressed.  I'm just answering the question as to whether or not I'll buy the expansion and why.<br />

(shhhh, don't tell SOE)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At this time, it's looking like &quot;I do not will buy.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I will buy the new expansion because I do see some benefits to it.<br />
I think the shamans that will benefit from it, actually, will be the &quot;casual&quot; shaman.  With 5 more levels, much of the older content will become trivial- some even soloable.  Some ideas that comes to mind:<br />
<br />
- Spirit Wracked Cord quest will easily become soloable.<br />
- Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancient should be soloable with 5 more levels.<br />
- most of the Marsinger's quest gem should be soloable.<br />
- Temple of Veeshan's Halls of Testing should become soloable for shamans with the new levels. (May even hear of shamans soloing Dozeker)<br />
- Higher levels will probably come with a higher point count from LDoN making equipment purchases faster.<br />
- More shamans soloing Kunark dragons (will probably be eaiser to land slow with 5 more levels.)<br />
- Smaller raid forces needed for Ssra/VT/NToV/Velious boss mobs making equipment upgrades easier to get for shamans.<br />
- PoFear may become a new farming playground for shamans<br />
- Soloing Epic/8th Prayer Shawl<br />
<br />
   The list goes on, and I am sure there are other camps that I am not thinking of.  Your casual shaman will probably be around 4.5-5k hitpoints with what becomes available with an increase in the level cap, so I am buying it.  The only way SOE can foul that up is by nerfing drop rates or reworking encounters, and the chances of that happening immediately is unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I ended billing, so unless things change and there is something amazing in this expansion, then no.<br />
<br />
Maybe if Epic 2.0 is only for that expansion, which would be ultra lame, i would. I mean the whole reason i quit EQ was cause i have nothign to do, if its done right and i can do most of it alone or with 1 group and it doesnt take a 12 hour camp of some mob that is in a zone where no loot or cash drops so no one will go, then maybe.<br />
<br />
I dont know, its not like i wanted to quit EQ, i just couldnt take it anymore, so like i said, they have ALOT to fix before i will even consider it. I also will wait for everyone else to buy it and the hype to die down and the problems to surface before i buy it. I knew i should have done it with GoD, but my hopes ran high.<br />
<br />
Ive learned my lesson.<br />
<br />

<br />
You know i didnt think of that, this could indirectly benifiet casual players. Hmm, might be a good thing after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I ended billing as well. I don't plan on it. I felt I hit the casual player glass ceiling for my shaman. Ldon is really too time consuming after putting together a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
     If they raise the content in LDoN to work for levels 70's, I expect the point awards will be 100+.  The reasons for this will probably be due to your &quot;high-enders&quot; who at 65 could get 105 points for a hard ldon.  Your lvl 70 normal LDoN will probably be on the same line of difficulty- hence an equal or better point count.  That cuts gear purchase time from 28 wins for Incorporeal to 14 or less- not bad.<br />
<br />
     Currently 10-12 elemental geared peeps can clear a decent amount of NToV.  I expect with 5 more levels your average &quot;bazaar character&quot; will be able to conquer NToV with the same amount of peeps or even less.  Same goes for a majority of Ssra content outside of DT'ing mobs.  Granted, I am sure the raid quality gear will increase as well, but lvl 70 trivializes a lot of old raid content from a 30 man raid to 12-16 friends.  I think this is something that SOE is &quot;trying&quot; to do.  72 man raids were a bad idea on zone stabilty issues, and I think the programmers realize this.  We are seeing in content outside of PoP requiring or allowing less people, and lvl 70 will trivialize enough PoP content to where 72 players will not be mandatory.  I expect to see a lot of super-guilds either splinter into factions or shrivel up with players leaving the game.  I am interested in seeing what is going to happen.<br />
<br />
P.S. As far as Epic 2.0 goes, don't expect to get it unless you are in one of the top guilds.  I believe a read somewhere that it will be for &quot;upper-end players&quot;, so the rarity of an epic will be similar to the rarity of Epic 1.0 with the release of content.  People may complain about this, but how cool is an epic if everyone has one?</div></div><hr />
