<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All:<br />
<br />
Not exactly sure where this post should go so I am sticking it in General.<br />
<br />
I can field two groups of 58+. Key roles (Tank, Cleric, Shaman and FD Puller all over 60).<br />
<br />
We are trying to determine what the best zone to hit would be for lvl 60 spells.  I.E. Malo, Torpor, etc...  Obviously Juggs and Emp Room in seb is out since we have no rogue...<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i bet you can do the old world dragons like sev talen gore they drop rare  60 spells or what not</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is always gw's inside vp if you want to do the key quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Guardian Wurms in skyfire.  Ain't exactly exciting, but at least a couple chances per hour if you track and kill every Elder Wyvern (almost positive that's the name of the Wyverns at the VP entrace, they are PHs for G wurms).  G wurms are easy to slow, just get malosini in first if you want to be safe (since no chanter tash there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If all these people can get their Veeshan's Peak keys, I've heard you can get up to 3 copies of any relevant Kunark shaman spell in a good night in VP.  At that rate, getting spells for everyone in those 2 groups shouldn't take more than a few nights at most.  In other words, most of the work will be for you guys to get the keys, and then learn how to do VP.  Once you do all that, actually farming the spells will be a walk in the park.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild just did VP for their first time last sunday. They fielded 4-5 groups (not sure I didn't have my key done yet) and were getting owned by the first named the first few tries. There were a lot of spell drops though. In about 6 hours they got 2 Torpors, 2 Word of Redepemtion, 2 Sunstrikes and several other rare spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, the only way out of VP without clearing it (which you need a lot of firepower and a rouge to do) is die in vp. Die outside of VP. Get rez'd into vp and loot that corpse, then get your other corpse rez'd to get out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can do juggs/jumpy/protector without a rogue.  At level 58 the jugg area is probably one of the last places in the old world that gives decent xp as compared to PoP (Although it is still crappy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yah um, one thing about hunting in VP that I found out the hard way.  If you are just there to pharm the guardian wurm at the entrance . . pull him waaay back like over the lava n stuff cuz Hoshkar paths fairly close and will add and wipe you all out if you're not careful.  I don't think u can kill Hosh with only two groups unless you have a couple manaburn wizzies in there or other high DPS non-melee people of high level and high DR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Definitely do not need a rogue to do Juggs, as there is a wanderer that opens the door to the main area where most of them reside.  Just have your fd'er feign at the door and let you know when it's ok to rush past into the hallway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Or just click the flower pot to the right of the door :)<br />
<br />
Getting out requires the trick of waiting for the jugg to open the door for you, getting in does not.  But you ought to have a wizard along for TLs anyway at the end of the night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey Land, didn't they change Hosh's pathign ages ago?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It says here http://eqlive.station.sony.com/comm...ew.jsp?id=55816  that Sony/VI are going to allow gating out of VP.  I hope that extends to TL and TP as well, so that melee have a way out without the &quot;corpse outside&quot; routine.</div></div><hr />
