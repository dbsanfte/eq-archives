<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OKay here is the story(I know this is a repeat post for the most part but I am boogled).  I started dating this new girl awhile back like 8 months ago.  After 2 months of dating she could not stand the way I played EQ since I was still playing like I was a single college student at a liberal arts school = lots of play time.  I liked her a lot so I decided to give up EQ.  I did not know when or if I was going to be back, so I decided to pass on my hard work to others so that they do not have to work as hard as I did and I was in a good mood that night(got some the night before).  I gave all of my best stuff away about 60kpp in price at the prices when I left.  <br />
<br />
Well now that we have gotten a chance to get used to each other I am now trying to play EQ again but more sanely than before, as she puts so well.  When I got my character back from deletion I was amazed to find what I did find, I forgot about my no drop gear.  <br />
<br />
Well I am level 55 and have almost all my spells up to my level, DAMN PRIMAL ESSENCE AND BLOOD OF NADOX!!!  I am not that shabby of a player but rusty for being out for so long.  I am just now catching up to all of the new features that have been added over the past 6 months.  Also, some very nice 65 necro gave me a Crypt Robber's Chestplate that he said he has been unable to sell and it would help me out a lot.  I have aquired some of the basic stuff that is cheap.  <br />
<br />
Now that you know the story of me here are my questions for you?<br />
<br />
Should I still try to solo or would it better for me to group till I get my gear in order?<br />
<br />
What are some safe solo spots for a not very well equiped shaman to farm some decent cash?<br />
<br />
What are some safe solo spots for a not very well equiped shaman to get exp?<br />
<br />
What do you think of just doing LDoN Missions for the exp, cash, and Adventure points?<br />
<br />
Even though I do miss my old gear I do like the new challenge of getting it all back and what seems to be at cheaper prices than before.  <br />
Thanks for the information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The boats in dulak are the safest XP at 55, plus you get a few pp, weapons you can sell, &amp; roughly one mob in fifteen will drop a gem. I've had a few BD's. Some of Stormwave &amp; Lady D will be ltblue, but Dando is still solid dkblue. the other 2 boats need groups.</div></div><hr />

If you need pp then dulak boats are going to be a great bet for you. At our level LDoN nets about 150-200pp per session and a chance at some loots, and the AP of course. I would switch between the 2. The boats will get booring :)<br />

You still have your drogmor, you can hunt at any regular solo xp spots no worries  ;)</div></div><hr />
