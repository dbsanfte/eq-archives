<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious, since this is the only multi-server board I read, as to how many wins the LDoN leaders have on your server.<br />
<br />
Bertoxx- we have a guy in the mid 200's, 250ish last I checked. He is the MA in the only Time-enabled guild on the server. He 2-boxxes a cleric full time in LDoN (exactly equal wins). Next closest is a few people from the same guild in the 190's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On venril sathir there is a guy with 160ish, then one person with like 20ish less then him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">last night was a person on Rodcet that had 247ish wins, 7 losses.  97% or so.  <br />
<br />
Next was a 199 wins, 2 or 3 losses</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dairuin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Prexus has this guy (http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=8186) with 378 wins pretty interesting</div></div><hr />

<br />
mother of god, how is that even possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Think TM's leader is at around 336wins, zero losses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
378 * 30 minutes = 189 RL hours... roughly 7.9 elapsed days in LDoN assuming it takes 27 minutes to finish each mission and 3 minutes to get a new mission and rush back into the dungeon... how many elapsed days has it been since LDoN release?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well you only need 80 wins per camp to max out charm, ill take my time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
176(ish) is #1 on E. Marr today iirc.  #2 has only one one less.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, Cladnin just went nuts when LDoN came out.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Iustus on Tarew Marr is at 376 wins and 0 losses<br />
<br />
Im only at 8 and 2 so far :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Top on torv is at 193, need to have 100 wins to break the top 20. <br />
<br />
I'm ranked 400th with 26 wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My husband is 4th on Torv at 148, top is 193. He stopped playing chasing the leader 2 days ago as he's busy with our sons upcoming birthday. I asked him how many adventures a day and he said generally 2-3 a night and that they get assassinate or kill x number quests most the time and often complete them in half an hour. He goes with one guild group (time-capable guild) and they just do 2 or 3 in a row so don't spend alot of lost time reforming for each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not much raiding with the guild with scores like those...<br />
<br />
I adventured some with a few friends, sometimes we do it with a Cleric who was #2 on VZ a few days ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I thought LDoN was designed for causual gamers  :D <br />
Did you try to imagine the RL of the guys racing the top...<br />
<br />
Leaderboard or Loserboard ? uh ? seriously ?  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thing is all the top people on server are in the top guild because they can blitz the adventures much faster then everyone else. <br />
<br />
I think it pretty much breaks down like this (assuming something simple like slaughter):<br />
<br />
65 little or no AA takes &gt;=75 minutes<br />
65 with NToV/Ssra gear (my level) 50-60 minutes<br />
65 with elemental/time gear 25-40 minutes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Top on the Nameless is 256:14.  Shaman from LoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That would be me Ugzug, thanks for the post.</div></div><hr />
