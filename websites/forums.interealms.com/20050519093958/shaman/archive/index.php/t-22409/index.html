<br />
Posted by Kyth on the SoE live boards ..<br />
<br />
<br />
Before I post your updated list I would like to give you a little bit of information on the notes I have made on each item.<br />
<br />
 Currently being evaluated – This means that a few of the development team members are looking into ways to implement the item.  This does not guarantee that the item will be implemented; however we may see changes made in the future.  The Community Team plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, even if it’s just a “no change since the last update”<br />
<br />
 Currently being discussed – This is almost just like being evaluated however these items the development team is totally undecided if they want to implement or how to do so.  The Community Team plans to give updates on these types of items every 2 weeks, even if it’s just a “no change since the last update”<br />
<br />
 Done – This means that the development team has implemented this item and it’s currently on live servers.<br />
<br />
 Currently on Test server – This means that the development team has implement this item and it’s currently on test server, watch for future updates for implementation on the live servers.<br />
<br />
 Waiting for community feedback – This means we don’t have enough information to make any type of decision on how to implement.  Threads will be started by me to get your feedback.<br />
<br />
 No changes planned at this time – This means that the development team has decided at this time not to implement this item.<br />
<br />
 Items that are marked done will be removed from the top 10 issues lists and you as a class will be able to replace those with new issues.  Watch for posts on this in the next week, your class correspondents will be helping SOE update your top 10 issues lists with these new items.  If your top issues list was less then 10 issues to begin with you will be able to add more issues.<br />
<br />
 You as a class will have the option to replace items that are marked as “no changes planned at this time” with new items or leave them on the list.  Please understand that leaving them on the list does not mean that they will eventually be implemented however it does mean that the class as a whole still feels that these are valid issues and would like implementation eventually.  One thing to note, we will not be responding to requests as to why something is classified the way it is.<br />
<br />
This post will be locked and updated bi-weekly.<br />
