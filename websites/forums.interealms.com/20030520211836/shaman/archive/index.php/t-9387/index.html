<br />
How can you tell a shaman? What are the real clues? How might you know you're a shaman? <br />
<br />
1. You might be a shaman if you've begged for a rez after killing yourself with cannibalize.<br />
<br />
2. You might be a shaman if you are only fast when slow is needed.<br />
<br />
3. You just got 3 buff begs within 5 seconds of landing naked in Nexus.<br />
<br />
4. You have to restrain yourself when any other class whines about their spells being rare or expensive.<br />
<br />
5. You have carpel tunnel syndrome from clicking the cani icon.<br />
<br />
6. You hear &quot;SOW PLZ&quot; in your sleep.<br />
<br />
7. When for no apparent reason you stand up and sit down for a minute<br />
<br />
8. When you show up after a raid has started and ask in raid &quot;Send TELLS to Tarthug for Focus, Stam, and PE!&quot; and suddenly your chat window turns purple.<br />
<br />
9. If you no longer announce slows because the tanks know you cast it when they lost aggro.<br />
<br />
10. If you're the only person in your group with more than 80% mana after a tough pull. <br />
<br />
11. If you're the only caster rolling for HP/AC loot that some tank claims is melee first item.<br />
<br />
12. You are the only one that never ever sits down or goes OOM.<br />
<br />
13. You lose ground generating mana by chatting, and you are not a bard. <br />
<br />
14. You mumble about Project Alpha and blow up Infected Paw at least once a week for the whips and daggers.<br />
<br />
15. You might be a shaman if you look at 60 health and zero mana as GTG for a single.<br />
<br />
16. Puller brings too many mobs.. the group freaks out and wants to evac and you ask 'are they slowable?.. Yes..... We got this.' and then ***** when the group evacs.<br />
<br />
17. you pride yourself on stealing agro from the MT and being able to tank the mob just as well as he can.<br />
<br />
18. You might be a Shaman if you're the last one standing...but you were first to be aggro'd.<br />
<br />
19. You were just as upset about the monk nerf as they were.<br />
<br />
20. You're just as happy to get an aego as a KEI for soloing.<br />
<br />
21. You see a very nice high HP piece of mellee only gear drop and say it sucks because its not shaman wearable.<br />
<br />
22. You'd rather stick out the odds in a bad fight, than zone and lose your pet.<br />
<br />
23. You see a named blue mob and before any other questions, the first thing that comes to your mind is whether or not you can take him.<br />
<br />
24. You know what I mean when I mention &quot;eating dogdogburn.&quot; <br />
<br />
25. You get an uneasy feeling with you have a full health bar (must... canni...). <br />
<br />
26. You cannot cast any spells quickly because your enormous regen/someone healing you/torpor keeps bringing you to full health and you need to canni first before doing anything else (see #5). <br />
<br />
27. You think wisdom is the devil compared to hp/mana.<br />
<br />
28. You get angry at all the people who sell torpor for 100k and make sure everyone knows how torpor should no longer be worth that much because of PoP, yet you would trade your right arm and left foot for it.<br />
<br />
29. You have no alts or have retired all your alts. <br />
<br />
30. You make an impossible fight incredibly managable. <br />
<br />
31. You love when chanters join your group because then you don't have to answer to &quot;haste plz&quot; <br />
<br />
32. You like saying &quot;Focus inc&quot; and watching to see which casters run off to avoid the buff. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just thought it was funny :P<br />
<br />
