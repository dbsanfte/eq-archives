<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Would you care to elaborate on the textures? Where do you see this? How much memory do you have? What kind of video card do you have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sarconus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i have 320 megs of ram and geforce 2 card it says you have to have old textures installed to run sol, im having all kinds of installation problems with xp. corrupted files etc tired of this crap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cidman Viciouss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the reason you got that message is because you did not install the whole patch.<br />
<br />
I am guessing 30k people are trying to access EQ right now. That would slam any log on server..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm on  xp also. my install was clean it seems. only error i get on patch is freezes and lost connect, so far.<br />
<br />
If you are on win 98, it dosn't know what to do with more tHAN 128 MEG TILL YOU TELL IT, BUT i DON'T KNOW HOW.<br />
<br />
my machine is 3 days old and has issues, I think most problems ATM are 200,000 ppl on patch server.<br />
<br />
<br />
but it seems most the patch size is textures. thx content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galdraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, according to this there are a few ways to tell your W98 to use more RAM.  I'm sure there are better sources, this is just the one I found so far!<br />
