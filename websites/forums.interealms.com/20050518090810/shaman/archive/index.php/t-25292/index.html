By Patch History <br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Headlines ***<br />
<br />
- Tons of new quests, mostly for solo players!<br />
- New Character Differentiation option: Training!<br />
- Lots of artisan recipe and ability fixes!<br />
- Eat healthy! New examine information to explain the benefits of food and drink!<br />
- Brawlers get built-in shields!<br />
- Guild followers can spend the status they earn at city merchants!<br />
- Now easier to equip rings, wrist items, and weapons!<br />
- Slash that dot! Maps now show your current heading!<br />
- Lots of UI tweaks and enhancements!<br />
- More bug fixes than you can shake a moss snake at!<br />
<br />
*** Training ***<br />
<br />
- Characters now receive a new character differentiation option every ten adventure levels: Training!<br />
- Training allows you to choose one of four new abilities. Each of these spells or arts builds off abilities you've been using but substantially increases their effectiveness and benefit.<br />
- The choice is yours whether you prefer a stronger attack, a more potent buff, a heartier heal, or a handier utility function. Training allows you to enhance specific aspects of your character and be a bit unique.<br />
- These Training abilities have a longer span of effectiveness than most common spells and arts, so they'll prove very useful to you.<br />
- Note: Characters who reach levels 10 and 20 will not be prompted to make their Training selections until they leave their current zone and enter another. This is a known issue that will be corrected in a future update.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT!<br />
- You will not be able to receive quest rewards until you make any pending character differentiation choices available to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
*** Gameplay ***<br />
<br />
- Group members can now join other group members in a specific instance of a zone even if that zone has reached its capacity.<br />
- If a character dies and is given the option to be revived in a different zone, the revive window will allow the player to choose from multiple instances if they are available.<br />
- Harvesting quests can no longer be completed by purchasing the items from a broker.<br />
- Spells that debuff the target's maximum health or power now work appropriately.<br />
- Fixed a bug that could cause you to fall under the world while swimming.<br />
- Removed the restriction that only guild patrons can spend status points.<br />
- You are no longer able to swap bags into your shared bank if one of the bags contains a lore or no-trade item.<br />
- You are no longer able to drag lore items from your overflow slot into the shared bank.<br />
