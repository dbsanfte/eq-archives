<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gogi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi everybody.<br />
<br />
Finally I gave up with this trails. I am shaman 62 have 28 aa so far, pretty good gear and all spells but Malo. I lived several weeks in POJ with LFG tag. And I have to tell you NO WAY! <br />
<br />
I saw many 57 - 59 lvls peeps who came with guild support and made it from first shot. Yeah, I fogrtta say that Im guildless.<br />
<br />
So I am thinking of paying for help with it. Did anybody do this way? How much does it cost? How difficult to find people for it.<br />
<br />
/thanks</div></div><hr />

If you can't get into a group, MAKE one. :)<br />
It's not that hard, just watch for people LFG as well, and scoop in what damage you can.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen, DS+Good melee&gt;all.<br />
If you can get a mage or 2, a wiz, good warrior/sk, chanter, you should be good as gold.<br />
No slowing, just DS everyone and let the fists fly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yah you don't do slowing.  You do healing.  And nuking.  And pray everyone holds it together until the end.  When the boss spawns, have a ranger, druid or someone with non damaging snare kite it around until you have enuf mana to malo/slow it.  It can be a resistant bitch at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">don't forget, use 50% slow or weaker, last time I did exec it was still bugged, had to kill an unslowed exec cause I used turgurs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">and put a mage in that group!  they're the best in exe!   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Make sure to have a mage summoned bracer and ring. All I did was DD and spot heal when the cleric needed to recoup some mana. Having a horse makes this too easy because you are medding the entire time you are doing DPS. Don't dot. because you wont get the full use from the spell. Just DD. Only time I slowed was for the boss and I landed malosini and turgurs first try. I was 59 at the time.<br />
<br />
Oh almost forgot, have a pet focus'd, haste'd, and wielding two weapons. Serious upping to your dps right there. If you are 61 and have the pet, then you are a dps machine.</div></div><hr />

Unless things have changed, any slow over 50% says it lands, but doesn't actually do anything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The trick to getting through the poj trials is:  having friends.  More specifically, friends that don't suck.  If you have no friends, then yes, you might end up having to bribe someone to get you through trials.  If you are relying on a pickup group of unflagged people to get you through, then you've got a lot more frustration and failure ahead of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Umm, do you like pay girls to talk to you?<br />
<br />
No? Then show some self respect and heal / nuke / dog dog your way through the trials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things have changed.<br />
<br />
Use turgur's on the executioner. It will be mitigated, but it is a better choice than any other slow.  Don't bother slowing the rest of the trash, nuke or heal instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gumdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Which trial are you trying to do? If Execution trial on your server has a huge line, grab some lfg people of the proper classes and do the Torture trial. As easy as Execution IMHO and no line.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Use your disease based slow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tank, Healer, you, Mage, Mage, Mage.  Make that group, and it's damn near impossible for you NOT to succeed at the trial of execution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well this is how i do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
65 cleric  65 mage 65 shaman ( me)  any anyone , any class , any level 60-65 .. Have the mage arm doggy. Grop regen before going in. <br />
<br />
Now this is the Key imho , some poeple say slow , some say dont.  Well i wait till the melee has been beat down to about 40%  ( depending on HP , im talking around a 7k tank )  Cast  AoE  slow .. If you did it right you will get no aggro cause of the DS the mage puts on , might get 1 or 2 which is cool cause your taking the pressure off the MA , just Turg slow them. Now while you do this , make sure you use a hotkey for  <br />
<br />
/assist johan<br />
/pet attack<br />
<br />
 keep that pet on whatever mob they are on. After that its mana managment , make sure you drop the big heal when needed , make sure to nuke when NEEDED , make sure your ready for PE at the end. Once you do it a few times you will fall into your own groove and figure it out. <br />
<br />
This is how i do it every saturday morning as i sit in PoJ flaging guildies that wake up .<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as going solo.  Yes , you need to make your own , or ask people if they need a shaman. Trust me , i been there too and i feel your pain onthis. But if i can do it , you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
You specifically asked about paying to get flagged.<br />
<br />
Obviously from your post you've put some effort into getting flagged with friends, pick-ups, etc w/ no success.<br />
<br />
I paid to get flagged PoV/PoS.  <br />
But I didn't pay cash. ;)<br />
<br />
I was in PoI soloing (which before the flag was my favorite spot) when someone came in offering to pay to loot a block of Perilium.<br />
I'd had one in my bank for some time w/ no idea what it was for, so I asked.  He told me it was for part of a key quest to get flagged for a Tier3 zone.  I said thanks and mentioned casually that mine won't be seeing use any time soon.<br />
<br />
He became very friendly all of a sudden (not that he wasn't before).  He wanted to buy the block MQ outright.  I at the time was rather flush with pp (I'm about broke now, w/ less than 2kpp), so cash wasn't an incentive for me.  I asked instead for some spells I was missing (VoTB, PE, &amp; Acumen of Dar Khura), but he didn't have anything I was looking for.  <br />
<br />
Eventually I mentioned that while he's anxious to get his girlfriend (or maybe it was sister) into Tier3 with him, I was still trying to get to Tier2.  At the time, only one or two of my guild family were flagged.<br />
<br />
We talked some more, and he was willing to get me through the Exec. Trial come hell or high water if I would chain the Block to him afterwards.  All I had to bring was any high level DPS friends I had (he gave me level/classes he wanted) and DS potions.<br />
<br />
Turns out I was able to bring in my good guild friend (62Mage) into our group, and he scrounged the rest pick-up from friends and contacts.  He borrowed a BoC for the trial. :D<br />
<br />
WE SHREDDED the Trials.  I think I could have sat down in a corner and played Gems the group was so good.  I was casting Torrent and Ice striking, and throwing in the occasional support heal.  Dogdog (55, NOT 61 PET) did some damage too.  So I felt I at least contributed a bit, but realistically they would have been fine without me.  (I even won a parchment too btw. :) )<br />
<br />
After I was flagged, I chained the Block to his girlfriend, who happened to be a 65 (seemed to be hotboxed alot) shaman! :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
A week or so later, mainly buoyed by the story of my mage friend and I, our guild finally started taking Trial attempts seriously and putting our people though.  We still don't have everyone flagged, but we're aiming for everyone 60+ to get theirs soon.  We don't need any help to do it either.  I was just impatient, and from reading here it didn't look like I'd have a chance in hell of getting flagged pick-up.<br />
<br />
A week or so later, I chained another Block for Acumen of Dar Khura.  I have MY block (not chaining anymore) now and am shooting to get that flag in the next month or two.  (I'm in no hurry for that one, as none of us are flagged Tier3 yet.)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">a good tank ,a cleric 62(because they get a 500hp HoT), 2 mage+ 2 people who need flag and you have a wining group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What Juujuu said.<br />
<br />
AOE rains plus mage pets own the trials, that group he mentioned will win every time as long as you replace one mage with an enchanter to chain cast stuns on the waves and the cleric is relatively competent.  Use torrent of poison to help the 4 waves die.  I'd use grummus to slow the Exe and then help heal the tank because clerics often go oom against him and then the tank needs to kite him around as the mage pets wear him down from behind.  <br />
<br />
In general I don't think you'll have much trouble recruiting a few mages to help, they can never get groups outside trials so they like to feel needed.  Recruiting the holy trinity will be more of a challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kaarmekieli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Our guild finally found the combination that suits us:<br />
<br />
Paladin (65, defence AAs...lr5 etc)<br />
Cleric (anything with CH)<br />
Ranger (65, am3m eq, bow AAs)<br />
Wizard (62, critt AAs)<br />
Druid (65, spirit of wood AA)<br />
any class (59+ which we keep as limit in our guild for flagging...for non-cleric class)<br />
<br />
Tactic: <br />
- Maximum DS (~70 -100) on paladin (druid/mage DS, DS potion).<br />
- No slowing in any form, which will result that 3rd and 4th mob in wave are almost dead when 2nd goes down due to DS.<br />
- Druid use Spirit of wood during 4th wave...adds more DS and gheal.<br />
- Ranger disc for 4 wave if needed...normally no need<br />
- Cleric uses only healing dots, if has and druid uses fast heal<br />
- when Exe becomes targettable ranger or paladin kites it, if mana low...normally no need.<br />
<br />
With this combination all casters have 80%+ mana after 4th wave and we can proceed to kill Exe immediately. Killing also goes so fast that have plenty of time to med between spawns.<br />
<br />
After this we found this combinastion 5/5 flawless victories in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">One thing that made all the difference in the world for me was avatar. I cast it on one person just before heading in then another as soon as I could then alternated back and forth throught the trial. <br />
<br />
Its makes a big enough difference in DPS that it was well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, I for one agree that paying is a good option.  I sat LFG in PoJ for over 60 hours.  I paid 10k, was thru in 20 minutes.  Had I just done that in the first place, I could have farmed 10k PP 3 times over easliy.  Even if you have friends, or a great guild, there's no guarantee that you'll get a flag for whatever reason.  There are just some situations where paying for it is smarter than doing it yourself, and to me, saving time is worth the PP.  Different people enjoy different aspects of the game.  I don't enjoy trials, so I'm glad that I could move on to different parts of the game that I DO enjoy.  This game is about fun, and it shouldn't seem like work.  Trials to me are work.</div></div><hr />
