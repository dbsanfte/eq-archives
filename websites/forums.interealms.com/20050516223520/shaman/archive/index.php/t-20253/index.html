<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As you will have noticed the mana cost chance went live today<br />
<br />
  <br />
Date Change <br />
03-10 09:47 Changed Mana cost from 220 to 285 <br />
02-10 11:16 Initial Entry <br />
  <br />
<br />
I asume this was a planned chance and has NOTHING to do with the statements from SoE about looking into shaman healing in GoD.<br />
<br />
So i would hope we do not get a big drama over SoE promised an upgrade and did nerf us etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FVDladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The change is completely senseless, regardless of looking into our issues.<br />
<br />
Why would anyone use BoT over Q now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quite, a completely insane change. and Brenlo wonders why we are mad?<br />
They never said they where gonna give us anything, they said they would look at some of our concerns only, even without that i would still see this as .. as  well i cant say anything good so i leave it unsaid.<br />
<br />
I still so glad i didnt buy GoD.<br />
I have issues with hard ldon and Elemental planes to short out before i even get to the problems GoD represents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That change is damm stupid why use BoTe when it is 5hp for 1 mana when the old spell is 6h. And 240 more hp with BoT compared to the old Qui is not much. And that hot spells is useless in god fights for healíng becouse of the dps mobs have.<br />
<br />
All the direct heal had a uppgrade druids is 2100 hp now for 3,8 sec was 1950 and 3,5 sec.<br />
<br />
Cleric got a 3275 heal for 650 mana was 3050 and 660 mana.<br />
Clerics HoT is 600 hp and 480 mana was 550 and 440 mana<br />
<br />
Paladin got 1000 heal for 430 mana was 935 and 440 mana.<br />
<br />
All other heals got a uppgrade but the shaman one. And i dont understand why they did not uppgrade the shm heal .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why the **** shouldn't we bitch about this stupid change???  It's completely ridiculous.  Every single heal got an UPGRADE except for one and that's acceptable?  <br />

I was somewhat unhappy before, but was willing to go through whatever nice channels were needed.  Now, I'm pissed.  If they're going to keep this change can we at least get a new spell from our geomancy stone turn in so I might be able to get a spell I might actually cast once in a while from this expansion?  /sigh  Why was I actually expecting that that change would not go live as was? :(</div></div><hr />

He's not baiting anyone, bright one.  <br />
<br />
Trushar (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4899&amp;source=Live) has had the mana cost increased, but not the heal per tick, nor even the cast/recast time.<br />
<br />
He's saying it got NERFED.  Which it did. <br />

<br />
SHAMAN HEALING IS BALANCED!!!<br />
Dare I say, &quot; working as intended?&quot;<br />
<br />
In Brenlo's defense, he did say he was only going to listen and pass our complaints on, but that it wouldn't mean we would get any concessions at all.<br />
<br />
I, too, would now like to know what a shaman is.  It isn't a healer, it isn't a damage dealer (if we are in a group, DOTs don't work worth a damn) and with slow mitigation, its hard to say whether we are a slower even.  What exactly is the shaman role in the high end game (or even low-end GoD where things hit for 1000+ and are immune to slow!)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>atana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bend over.  Basically, we just took it in the rear again.  I suppose we can send lots of emails to Brenlo, but doesn't appear to have done us much good so far.<br />

<br />
Ohh well, at least this time they whispered sweet nothings into our ears before having us bend over. But I hope next time they will at least use some lube.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I hope it's a mistake.  It gets somewhat disheartening to see how things have been going with shaman healing over the last few expansions - especially in regard to the lack of any increase in actual performance anywhere else in our abilities or spells lineup.<br />
<br />
And when we point to what other classes have gotten in regards to increased heals or faster heals, faster &amp; better efficiency - then it becomes class envy ??? /boggle<br />
<br />
I don't really think it's class envy so much as just - this is what we were able to bring to groups/solo'ing in comparison to the mobs and encounters we were seeing, and here's what we're seeing now vs. what we can bring/compensate for now.<br />
<br />
Nobody at the higher end of the game actually cares about stat buffs, and everyone and their brother has enough passive mana regen coupled with higher efficiency spells to avoid downtime. Paladins are out-healing us.  Literally - when a group with an enchanter can do BETTER by getting a paladin to cover backup heals (more ac/hp, and backup rezzing, LoH, stuns) and use him strictly as a healer / stunner and maybe contribute some minor DPS once things are swinging along, what does that say about shaman as a priest class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for their own purposes. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shamanic magic has two main focuses--enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman's arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly. A brutal line of crippling spells can slow a monster's attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations. An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, bolstering their allies while weakening their enemies significantly. The shaman is an excellent class for players who enjoy working in groups.<br />
<br />
Which begs the question... what is a shaman?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">the problem with the description is it isnt accurate any more, we have spells that increase stat,  but are ineffective, we can heal , but again it is ineffective, we have spells to do damage but again its ineffective. only thing still true about that is we can still debuff very well. we have nothing that enhances the mind.<br />

basically  apart from debuff  (malos and slow [btw cripples spells are a joke now])  we are ineffective at anything esle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't resist responding to the &quot;definition&quot; of a shaman from the character selection screen mentioned above ;)<br />
<br />
A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health..<br />
<br />
Stength &amp; Stamina capped out at high end game.<br />
Health buff (focus) lags massively behind clerics, druids and paladins, with beastlords very close behind.<br />
<br />
<br />
... and other physical aspects of the shaman's group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our attack buff (FA) is the one valuable buff left. Shame that many melees have weapons with similar procs or clickies, its duration is only 6 minutes, single cast, and 1 minute refresh time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans also are able to heal their allies <br />
Our heals have been discussed into the ground, clerics, druids and paladins are all much better at emergency heals, clerics and druids both much better at sustained healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
..and have excellent health regeneration spells.<br />
Health regen is matched by druids, outdone by bards, and is largely irrelevant in a game where mobs hit for so much so fast. I do like our regen but its not that big a deal.<br />
<br />
Ah well, so much for that definition once you hit the higher end of the game. Perhaps there is no SOE vision for what our role is once stats start maxing out, and that's the root of our troubles?</div></div><hr />

I'll let that sink in a minute.<br />
<br />
<br />
We need something real and significant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really,<br />
I am about as upset as most here about the fact that we got no healing upgrade.<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
I am realist enough to know that what will be patched is decided some time ago, and from that one can draw the conclusion that someone at SoE was not informed by someone else at SoE about this.<br />
<br />
And to be honest i think this will only help our cause, you see it will be hard for anyone at SoE to state now that we had a to powerful heal and that a nerf was in place to bring us back into line with other healers.<br />
I also think that brenlo will react to this and tell you just that (being that this was a mistake and that they are still looking into the shaman heal issue)<br />
<br />
That this post would come was no suprise, if I would not have started it someone else would but I had the hope that people would stay civil and understood this was no evil plot to &quot;punish&quot; us for daring to ask for a balance but a simple mistake caused by the burocratic processes that larger organisations tend to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Think of it in a positive light. This is obviously a mistake, and looking at the changes in mana to the other spells, slight increases, sometimes even decreases for overall improved healing. For +65 mana cost to BoT, you could roughly calculate a 100-150 per tick improvement to BoT<br />
<br />
Well thats how I see it :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hail, I talked with the &quot;Spell Guy&quot; and he was already looking at making some adjustments to healing including HoT and will let me know when he has something concrete. <br />
<br />
That's from Brenlo's reply about the fiasco with the Call of the Ancients error in the AA description.  Apparently the &quot;Spell Guy&quot; has made some adjustments...Looks like Brenlo is as out of the loop as we are.<br />
<br />
I'm really really hoping that there will be yet another adjustment that will take Breath of Trushar to 500hp per tick, which would make it viable again.  As it stands now, I have no desire to bust my bearbutt in GoD to get a spell that's a DOWNGRADE from ones that I already have.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

The healing adjustments that are in development on test will most likely include an increase in the power of shaman Heal over Time spells. The healing changes in general are aimed at significantly reducing the number of situations where a cleric is the only viable healer in 6 man group situations. While we certain maintain that clerics should be the best at healing, it is unfair to expect them to be the only adequate healer in a single group setting.</div></div><hr />

So they increased the power of our heal over time spell by increasing the mana. Simple really if you analyze it. <br />

<br />
BoTr sucked before... All it was good for was healing myself for CannV (overheal) and for healing freshly rezed people (who invariably get direct-healed right after Q or BoTr lands by the mana-overflowing cleric).<br />
<br />
All this nerf does will do is make me bring out Q again in it's place, for the better efficiency.  I still don't see the purpose of BoTr in it's prenerfed and now postnerfed state.</div></div><hr />

Brenlo said already they'll look into it, they need time to get to the problem, come up with a fix, then roll it out in patches.  Don't think this is a slap in the face after he says he'll pass info on.<br />
<br />
It seems like you got a lot of faith in SOE's way to do business.<br />
<br />
What you are missing is that this is hardly the first time they did a patch and its certainly not the first time they made a mistake. How long is such a sloppy way to do business acceptable? SOE needs competition! Pure and simple.<br />
<br />
If you ordered the biggest pizza with all the toppings at your local restaurant and when you got it it was a vegetarian pizza and kid-size too then would you just say &quot;ah well its a mistake I dont mind paying for something I didnt order&quot;? I dont think so. And if the restaurant insisted that you paid for it even if you didnt eat it because &quot;sometime in the future customers will get treated better&quot; that wouldnt work either Im sure.<br />
<br />
I cant come up with any other companies that get away with such poor service to their customers yet still manage to earn a ton of cash. Its very impressive and at the same time sad because I actually think they could earn lots more if they actually took advantage of all the free help they get on boards like this.<br />
<br />
The Trushar spell that went live today has been like that for a week on Test. This can mean two things:<br />
<br />
1. They dont know what is going on and dont test things before letting them go live.<br />
2. They have no idea what spells shamans wants or needs.<br />
<br />
It could be one or the other or it could be both. I know what I am voting for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Yes Tynne it does...however our HoT spells have always been more efficient than Clerics while healing less. To be in line with our former efficiency at 285 mana it would need to heal 427 a tick. Honestly however I would just as soon they turn the HoT spell into a direct heal as a HoT spell isn't going to do anything for us in the trials unless it was grossly inflated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Mistake?   Yes.  It was a mistake trusting them to keep their word that they were going to help us.<br />
<br />
I spotted this one coming and tried to give warning:<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20232<br />
<br />
As Brenlo said:  &quot;[we are] already looking at making some adjustments to healing including HoT&quot;<br />
<br />
Please remember... They are here to help us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Obviously, some cleric on staff whispered in Ryan's ear that this was &quot;Too Good&quot; for us shamans.  *NERF*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Oh... and just to add insult to injury...<br />
<br />
They LOWERED the cleric heal and RAISED it's healed HP.<br />
<br />
Holy Light (CLR/65) - mana from 660 down to 650<br />
Hitpoints from 3060 up to 3275<br />
<br />
and while the cleric HoT costs a bit more now, they get more healing quite a BIT more healing:<br />
<br />
Holy Elixir (CLR/65) - Mana from 440 to 480<br />
Hippoint from 550/tick to 600/tick<br />
<br />
Oh... and druids too.<br />
<br />
Sylvan Infusion (DRU/65) - Cast time from 3.5 up to 3.8<br />
Hitpoints from 1925 up to 2100<br />
<br />
Oh... wait... Paladins too!<br />
<br />
Light of Order (PAL/65) - Mana cost lowered from 440 to 430<br />
Hitpoints increased from 935 up to 1000<br />
<br />
So... Healers get better heals.  Clerics, Druids and Paladins are healers. But obviously...  Shamans are not healers.  So we get the opposite effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">It's gotta be a mistake.<br />
<br />
Its not a mistake.  Why would you think it was?   The change has been on test for some time now -- people had a big discussion about it -- and now it moved live.<br />
<br />
No matter what Brenlo says about them looking into our concerns, the bottom line is that there is currently someone at Sony who believes that we are overpowered for whatever reason and that our hal over time needed to be less effective.<br />
<br />
As for myself, if I see the spell drop, I'm not sure that I can be bothered to bend down and loot it.  I'll stick with Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">It has nothing to do with having faith in the way SOE does business.<br />

Why attribute malice to something that can be explained by ineptitude, or what I am supposing in this case, slow corporate bureaucracy.<br />
<br />
How many of you really think some dev is sitting there evilly grinning saying &quot;This will fix these shaman for good haa ha!!&quot;, as opposed to someone just ignoring the issues, and things getting passed up accidentally: &quot;Bob did get my email?&quot; &quot;wha??&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Hey, why not.

<br />
But as it stands now, we've got hybrid weakness without hybrid strengths (melee).<br />
<br />
So either way-- either make us pure casters again or send us the hybrid way please :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sigh.  My heart sure wants to believe it's a mistake.<br />
<br />
Logically though, what makes you think it isn't what was intended?  We've heard from more than one person at SOE more than once that Heals over Time were being looked into.  They had days to do that and there was no change made to Trushar.  <br />

2. Test Changes to Breath of Trushar.<br />
Bug or intentional?<br />
<br />
I am hoping these are just typos. I got my copy of<br />
Breath of Trushar last night and I would put it in the<br />
back of the book if the changes on test are put live.<br />
The reason that the shaman heal over time spells are<br />
still viable, despite their slow rate of healing is<br />
their strong mana efficiency. As I have said already,<br />
we desperately need to be able to heal more, faster,<br />
in GoD. <br />
<br />
Torpor (Kunark) = 300hp/200 mana. 6hp per mana.<br />
Quiescence (Planes of Power) = 300hp/200 mana. 6hp per<br />
mana.<br />
LIVE Breath of Trushar (Gates of Discord) = 360 hp/220<br />
mana. 6.5hp per mana.<br />
TEST Breath of Trushar (Gates of Discord) = 360hp/285<br />
mana. 5 hp per mana.<br />
<br />
With a patch comnig on the 10th, I beg you to please<br />
look into this. It will save your company time and<br />
money in the long run, if it is in fact a bug, to fix<br />
it before patching it. If it is not a bug, I would ask<br />
you to bring it up to the developers as being<br />
inconsistent with previous spells and a pretty severe<br />
downgrade to the spell. The mana efficiency of our<br />
heal over time spell is tied integrally with our mana<br />
regen abilities, so changing the ratio of hp per mana<br />
healed is also an indirect nerf to our mana<br />
regeneration abilities.<br />
<br />

Thanks very much for sending this to me.  I will definitely pass this<br />
along to our spell guy.  I am not sure what he has planned for the <br />
patch on the 10th regarding Shaman, if anything, but when and if he does have something to share, I will pass it along.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for writing this and sending it to me.  <br />

They knew about the problem with Trushar, I told them.  I assumed Brenlo's reply meant that someone would fix it.  I guess that was unrealistic and unfair of me to assume that passing it along to the spell guy would mean he would a) Look into it and b) decide it was a problem.  I can't even be angry anymore heh, just disappointed.  At any rate, don't kill the messanger... Brenlo is just the messanger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Oh.. I missed one.  Rangers also got an improvement to healing.</div></div><hr />

Brenlo posted this on another thread:<br />
<br />
&quot;Folks you already knew about this change as it showed up on Lucy before we began this dialogue. This is not part of the work that Rytan is looking into now for your healing. This was something already planned and locked in. It would have been far too soon to have implemented changes to your heals in the 2 days since Rytan visited. <br />
<br />
I know that it has been a long road for you, but I would like to ask you all for just a little more patience.<br />
<br />
Brenlo&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally I'd have thought that was obvious  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">However... what good does the Breath of Trushar change do for the rest of us shamans who are 65, not elemental, and either avoid Discord with our sanity, or just couldn't care-a-less?  The rest of us get Q and Tnarg's... yeah, that works well in Tier 2 PoP or hard LDoN real well ... /sarcasm off<br />
I don't know if you raid or not (I don't), but the player you describe (like my casual friends and I) does not figure into their ongoing design decisions much if at all.  Content is balanced around the high end raid game only.  I expect any changes to healing to only be available via rare drop GoD spells that only highend raiding shaman will see, despite the fact that the same problems exist outside GoD and for non-raiders as well.<br />
<br />
[Insert canned response: &quot;so join a raid guild and farm GoD, newb!&quot;]<br />
<br />
Personally, I only get to play Izmaill anymore on LDoN hards if our cleric friend joins us- otherwise I get to camp him and play the cleric myself.  Even when the cleric friend joins I feel like I'm leeching since we already have a chanter in the group.  But hey, Focus every 90 mins is the bomb, eh?<br />

yes.  the way it has been explained to me is that we are on the pure caster melee chart.  meaning we hit like a chanter.<br />
<br />
move me over to something like the ranger/bst melee chart, and i would have fun again in the game, even if i never make it to GoD.</div></div><hr />
