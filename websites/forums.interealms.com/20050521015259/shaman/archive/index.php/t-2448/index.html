<br />
I asked:<br />
<br />
How do I get my spells to work?<br />
<br />
The response:<br />
<br />
Official Verant Response: Spells the character problem they want to understand that we know that arent the same time to the models significantly after all that lore wrong. Significantly after we fixed on test server architecture including character files and no longer trade with the ideas that the reputation earned by a pretty much rather significant ideas or bad.<br />
<br />
Too, too funny<br />

&quot;Where is my copy of malo!!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Copy to the advantages of a community i just like to date some time to eat items listed for their time and that gms will be implemented. Advantages of that those eq players get to date some rather than the game construction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your question: Where is Verant? Is it a country? <br />
<br />
Official Verant Response: Is just makes it fair to gossipand id love to moderate a drum for enough ahead to bind in timorous deep went live in the fixes that cant be a player and refined. Gossipand id much the most part they get so invested in by a class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Asking the questions you have asked over the past few months:<br />
<br />
1) Your question: Are you on drugs and where can I get the same drugs? <br />
<br />
Official Verant Response: Same time and can put all that liked them over a rather than having the board so far tighter focus can be causing any rumors about us being a wise idea of these nifty npcs splitting pc spawns. Splitting pc spawns<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Your question: Why are you so stupid? <br />
<br />
Official Verant Response: You first come up comments for any changes as a natural thing too good old fashioned story telling. Fashioned story telling. <br />
<br />
<br />
3) Your question: How did you get to be so stupid? <br />
<br />
NO RESPONSE.<br />
<br />
4) Your question: How can I avoid getting as stupid as you? <br />
<br />
Official Verant Response: Stupid about us being able to pure caster balance thing for now if a message board so far enough stuff theyll get so far enough ahead to mention is far more damage we hope to us being able to us being finished with an idea we hire three people in fact its the hate reduction because they are the best changes weve seen to be obligated to npc and it playing around because npcs pay and casters to clear out the models significantly after all make further changes weve made a question that before some times when it is the real needs of a better story telling. Significantly after that only allows one of our endim not mean that get an npc and it in front of items to put into the time in production.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your question: How is caster balance going? <br />
<br />
Official Verant Response: Balance changes to drop. Changes to the time in and can put thought into it so stupid about hoops as i can be tougher or abilities etc. <br />
______________<br />
<br />
Your question: Are your programmers really circus monkeys? <br />
<br />
Official Verant Response: Really really think they shouldnt be too problematic. Shouldnt be examining other errors that becomes unwieldy. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Once and for all...<br />
<br />
Q: Why can't Iksar wear the JBB?<br />
<br />
Official Verant Response: Cant come out and all their old fashioned story or everyone sends a trade rather untested and asks people every day would reduce the way npcs ourselves and they were making some time is still going on caster balance thing until you to be weak or other errors that weve seen in the community has been made the trade with hybrids as i didnt want but have to read about laundry list of the npcs were given improved spell casters to suggest to use the resistances of value and unintended fashion. Resistances of the assumption that we expected to update you mean that the list of this is in a way slow spells or everyone sends a message boards and working perfectly and casters might indicate. <br />
<br />
Exactly ;)</div></div><hr />
