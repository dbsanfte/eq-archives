<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in PoJ today in a small group and we were pulling rats. They were incredibly easy, hit for in the hundreds and never resisted a slow even without Malo. So I was wondering at what level these really become soloable? I'm looking foward to taking advantage of the PoP exp bonus while soloing, but I havn't been able to yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was soloing them at 58.  I think they would be soloable at 56 with the new pet.  You just want to make sure you pull so you dont get adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo'd a little bit in POJ having just made 55 and got my new pet.  It was not hard, and was good mana/exp ratio, except that pulling the rats was a little bit difficult.  I'm not sure where the &quot;magic line&quot; is that keeps them from multiplying but I seemed to be ok if I pulled them all the way down the hall, but got terrible adds if dog engaged before they made it to the end.  They are really fast, so it was hard to make it out of harms way before I got hit, and as soon as I did, here comes dog to the rescue.  Since it was all pretty close range, sometimes dog would get to it before I could make him back off.  I'm sure with some practice I can make it work though.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking maybe I should park him all the way next to the zone-out door and that might help too.<br />
<br />
I think I could have solo'd lower than 55, but it would have been a lot harder and mana/exp ratio not as good and there would be a lot more down time.  (unless you have a JBB-which I don't)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After doing many/many hours on rats in PoJ, best thing to do is find a Ranger to duo w/.  You slow, heal, Dot and the ranger tanks em.  The 2 of you can do more rats/sentrys as a duo then soloing.</div></div><hr />
