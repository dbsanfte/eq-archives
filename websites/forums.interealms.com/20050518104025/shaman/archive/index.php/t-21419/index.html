<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried zoning into one of my favorite zones today, CT...<br />
<br />
I couldn't see myself, was stuck, couldn't duck to interrupt spellcasting, couldn't open spellbook.  I was past the zonein in the wrong direction.  If I sat down I zoned out.  Could use wood elf form and then I was unstuck and could move around and see myself but I was still behind the zoneline.<br />
<br />
The only way to get in was for me to zone out, go completely out of the tunnel, shrink or wood elf form myself (because an ogre can't stand up straight in the outside tunnel anymore either), get on a horse, and zone in-- this popped me in the correct spot but I still had to wood elf form myself while on a horse or I'd be stuck ducking.<br />
<br />
Very frustrating-- glad I figured out how to get in in a very circuitous fashion, but I really hope they fix this...<br />
<br />
Anyone else see anything funky like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OMG ty!! Here I thought it was only me and I was going crazy.  I had some friends zone into CT and they zoned in fine.  I zone in, clicked on my Swarm Orb to shrink and I could move, but when I went forward I ended up zoning back to Feerrott. <br />
<br />
And on top of that, prior to this last patch I was able to stand upright in tunnel leading from Feerrott to CT zone, but now I have to duck to get through.<br />
<br />
The question is, are Ogres taller, or are walls shorter? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CT is just buggy, now.  I went there a couple of weeks ago, and got stuck with both characters (Ogre SK) climbing up the ladder to the sewers.  SK was stuck up top, and Shaman halfway up.<br />
<br />
No duck, jumping, etc. worked.  I was able to gate the shaman.  SK couldn't even FD when invis wore off and wound up taking a death.<br />
<br />
I'll pass on this dungeon for awhile.  I like camping the sewers for loot, but not when it's this messed up right now.  Maybe rewind will help, but this is just another fu in the DX9 thing.<br />
<br />
Plenty of other dungeons to play in.<br />
<br />
Got 5 copper hammers, and 3 Swords of the Bloodsworn the other night, so not a big deal if I can't go to CT.  Damn boots are rare anyway.  I usually wind up with the ring, and then the earring off the mosquito if I'm lucky.</div></div><hr />
