<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Subject says it all, where do you get the fastest exp when soloing post-65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For consistancy I would say Fire (c2) is the best XP overall. Consistant 68th Level mobs.<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds is right behind it, only because some mobs are below 68 and some mobs break VP early. You can get higher xp/mob than Fire (c2), but it would mean hunting down the red cons only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mojoejojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PoF C2 is best I have found.  At 65, I was getting about 18 tics of AA exp for a solo kill.  Risk is high, but duoing with a snaring class makes it a lot lower risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Plane of Mischief is still a viable place from 65 to 67...maybe even all the way to 70, especially if you're not flagged for the elemental planes and want a change of scenery over HoH, etc. I've been hunting in the Alice in Wonderland area where all the mobs are lvls 62 to 65. Each mob can drop up to 20pp with occasional gems. I'm getting 1% regular XP every 2 kills in level 66. Sometimes I'll get 2% exp for every 3 kills. Certainly not bad XP. Mobs have low to average resists, root easily, and there's a ton of room (deeper in AiW you go, the more room you have) to maneuver. The zone is empty 90% of the time I go there, and is a safe, easy place to get experience for the casual player. Download a map from http://www.planeofmischief.com and learn your way around the zone (it's tricky the first time - but now I can do it almost blindfolded). I've been at this camp spot for probably 30 AAs and 2 levels. Nothing sees invis except for named mobs.<br />
<br />
For the daring shaman, I'd suggest the Theater camp, as 2 named there can spawn within easy reach - An Obsessed Patron and A Method Actor. The camp spot is on the back side of either of the staircases going up to the stage. The named here hit for ~600, are partially slowable, summon (that's the daring part), and have quite a few HP. I can take them down though with reasonable effort. The great thing about doing the named in the theater camp is the experience you get from the named. You see, where most mobs from the theater to Alice in Wonderland will net you around 5% to 7% AA per kill in lvl 65 to 67, all named in the zone will net you 4 to 5 times that amount. The named give me 26% AA (or 3% regular XP) per kill. It's wierd, but it's the truth. The named drop some mid-level gear which probably won't benefit you a lot (it's no drop except for on my server, Firiona Vie, where you can sell it). I prefer the Alice in Wonderland camp, as mobs are a tad higher and give a bit more consistent XP.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you want a quiet, safe place to experience that doesn't require elemental access, this is a good option.<br />

I prefer the cragbeasts as you need to use magic root on them and I can just click my pants without waiting for Virulent Paralysis to pop. Also I end the fights in about 3 minutes and full mana. Its a nice place to take it easy and still be able to chain pull since the cragbeasts aren't KoS you can use the bathroom or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not a great exp spot, but for the lower end 66+ shammy Drooga can be a decent hunting ground.  The key is to grab the task from overthere (I believe several taskmasters give it out) that asks you to kill 10 flame masters (I forget the name of the task, but the opening instructions tell you to go to frontier mountains and tell some NPC next to the BW zoneline that your codename is blue beetle or something).  With this taks in hand you can then run around Drooga hunting flame masters for so-so exp (3 or 4 kills per % point IIRC), and then once you've killed 10 you get an additional few % points of exp.  You also get an extra 100 plat for completing the task (for me this just covers the cost of buffs) and while you are in Drooga you can stop off at the spawn points of your favorite nameds to see if they are up (and possibly make some decent plat depending on what they drop).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I found an easy, really easy solo spot at lvl70, I also rate it is best spot(better than Fire) for follow reason :<br />
<br />
1, zone is Forgotten Hall,  GoD instance zone, you can start instance from Nedaria's Land by hail first NPC at 2nd dock, you can get instance with just one person, you can get instance at any level and get harder instance by start with higher people, you can ..... what else you want<br />
<br />
2, you will kill Rat/Bat here, there are 3 small room with full of not kos mob to kill, each room have like 10- 20 of them pack close together in a small room, a room smaller than PoK bank, nothing KOS in this zone, plus they don't assist each other so you can single pull forever without worry about add, also horse work here too !!!! you can't get better<br />
<br />
3, mob are fully slowable, hit low 400's (weaker than BoT Stormrider), they hit so weak that you almost forgot to cast Q/BoT; exp is 3% per kill solo, mob have like 15-20khp, drop 15-20pp most of time, plus some junk rat ear etc, I never loot them<br />
<br />
<br />
now, think about it, you can get here really quick, you can get the camp at any time, you can get some good exp for a small exp session, you can get some exp before raid, you can get some nice PP too, plus you can get some exp while LFG on. go and try out, you will suprise how easy is this zone, at lease for lvl70<br />
<br />
finally, only bad about this zone is dumn easy and boring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Where abouts the zone in to this instance? Is it 3% AA/kill? If so I don't see how its better than PoFire C2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the difference is the mobs are not kos, they don't assist and it's easy to get to and you don't need flags.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I tried this zone for first time today at level 69.  Easy but boring solo spot with what looks like decent solo xp.  Need to kill more to get accurate xp/kill.  They  don't seem to resist after malos, max hit I took was 622 when clicky root failed before i got malos and slow off.  Nicest thing is that I was able to summon mount there even though looks like an indoor zone. :=)  They have enough hit points that Breath of Wunshi is warth a cast.<br />

I'm 68, and the murkgliders are DB to me and all are pretty easy to single. VP lasts for full duration with rare resists, and they usually hit for 450's-ish. Chance to grab hold of a sporty Drakescale Shield or some slugworms, and a pretty decent priest belt drops there, as well. Bane, Ultor and Blood, plus perhaps the 1.0, and mobs die pretty quickly. It takes me perhaps 7-8 mobs to earn 1%, but the zone on my server is generally pretty empty and quiet, which to me makes up for it.<br />

I tried the rats in Forgotten Halls last night and was getting 4% AA/kill (I am currently level 67).  The murkgliders in the SE caves in WoS have a few more hps than the rats but are giving me 10% AA/kill, so definitely worth it.  And they are not usually too busy on my server so good to do while LFG :-)</div></div><hr />

Wow am I out of the loop....thought there was no solo instance content in EQ?<br />

I checked it out.  Kind of disappointed about the zone layout: no space and mobs literally on top of each other (at least the small amount of area I covered).<br />
<br />
Any place to hunt in this zone that has space?</div></div><hr />

If you had bothered to read the whole thread, you would have noticed that the mobs (except the rejects) there don't social agro.  Therefore, it doesn't matter how many are stacked on top of each other, you can still fight one at a time.  RTFM ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">On the nameless the first gully in from DS is definitely nice.

I did try the north east cave in WoS.  It is a bit harder but get 6% at 70 compared to 3% for the NC mobs.  The WoS murks are fast, hit fast, and seem to have a large aggro range, but otherwisw it is a good spot while LFG in WoS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first ditch from DS zone-in is often camped on Bristlebane too, but I've found if you just invis up and start running through the gulley areas you can find a new camp pretty easilly.  A lof of the time I do the one next to the WoS zone-in.  There's a single Bazu that could be an issue, but he's off to the left so if you just want murks you can veer right at the T.  As an added bonus, if you do this camp you can run in to WoS, yell &quot;Shaman LFG,&quot; and then run back to NC, whenever you are between mobs and waiting for CannV to refresh.<br />
<br />
As for the WoS murks, my advice is to stay away unless you are 70 or have good gear.  I'm 67, have bazaar level gear, and got my ass handed to me by them.  The first one I managed to kill (had speed bump, er dogdog, up, which let me get slow and root off) but then I accidentally agroed the second one (to re-emphasize what Ubex said, they have a LARGE agro range) and it was on me before I could cast anything.  VP got interrupted, then resisted, and then I was dead.  Then I ran back to get my corpse, and died again because the entrance murk was back, saw invis, and ran faster than SoW (or maybe just as fast but I hit a lag spike or something).  I ended up having to get a summon, and the moral of the story is don't mess with anything in WoS solo until you are on the high end of the power spectrum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Blaorfi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">/k I checked out forgotten halls 2day (09/11/04) and I went into the room with rat, bats and mini golems (cant remember the name) and no matter what mob I slowed they all assisted each other. <br />
<br />
So my question is this.<br />
<br />
Did I try the wrong room.<br />
<br />
Have the changed it since a patch.<br />
<br />
If I forget to check these boards 2morrow I will try the other rooms but just thought I would ask</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Tried it myself last night - set up camp in a pretty little room with a stepped floor and two exits containing nothing but rats. No roamers pathed through. Was getting visible movement on my blue bar on normal xp (I'm 66) and about a blue per kill when I went 100 pc AA.<br />
<br />
As mentioned before, the rats have a ton of hps (epic dot normally ran two full cycles) - was using epic, BoS, BoU and Bane. Low resists and some cash loot. A good place to hang out while I'm building a buffer into 66!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should be fine.  I did the part of 65, the first 25% of 66, and a few AAs on the rats in this zone.  I did die once during that time as I got interupted on VP 5 times in a row and stunned at least twice (still kicking myself from not just zoning when I got low on hp, stuborn and a bit thinck in the head, I guess).  So, while it is not completely idiot-proof at our level, it is about as safe as it possibly comes when soloing.</div></div><hr />

A duo with EP SK may be better but the damage output of Vxed mobs is quite high and you may find Root-Dot and aggro kiting on SK more mana efficient than healing SK.  At level 65 the solo AA xp was well worth the risk ~11% aa a kill on the pokas and Hynids.  With bonus for grouping may get about the same for duo.  I am curious how it goes.</div></div><hr />

Easily solo. I've got it down pat now solo and can kill (root-rot) without any breaks - takes just under 4 minutes per kill. A friend tried with his 68 BST and said he couldn't keep his pet alive tanking them, though, so don't know if you want to go 'in teh face' with your SK ... Stick to either the bat room or the rat room - you'll get no adds or roamers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">In the face is doable here for solo shaman if decently geared.
