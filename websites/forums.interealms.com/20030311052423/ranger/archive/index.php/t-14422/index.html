<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klegore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy folks,<br />
<br />
Couple of questions about this quest to get flagged to enter the Crypts of Terris Thule.<br />
<br />
Our guild is just starting to get folks flagged for the 2nd tier PoP zones and doing the raid &quot;quests&quot; in the 1st tier zones. So a few proceedural questions if I may..<br />
<br />
1. I spoke with NPC in PoT and received a character flag.  Does each group leader and/or raid participants need to be flagged as well....or does my receiving the flag just allow me to speak with the Thelin in PoN?  Is there some way for me to know what flags I have - some command that lists them?  <br />
<br />
I assume since I am flagged I can begin the conversation with Thelin then each group leader just says the magic line and *poof* we wind up in the maze.<br />
<br />
2.  What level of participants will we need to bring with us to win this encounter (i.e we have plenty 60+ in the guild, clickly sticks etc).  We were able to get a group of 24 to try Mujaki but since it was our first go round we failed-however was a lot of fun.  We failed since we only had an average level of 58 and just not enough DPS and all our clicky stick clerics were not on at the time we did this.<br />
<br />
I don't want too much info but just curious what ave. level, etc and such.  Tatics we can work out for ourselves.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lenas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1)  Yes, everyone in the event must be flagged from PoT or Thelin will not give them the PoNb (Lair of Terris Thule) flag.<br />
<br />
2)  You can only take 18 people up in this event.. and I'd say anyone 55+ would be fine.  But, have a couple good warriors and at least one enc / shaman (60+).. You'll find out why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's imperative that you have at least two good chanters with Apathy as their mez spell. GoK can not be used on Hedge mobs. I have done it with two chanters and three chanters was even easier.<br />
<br />
I think only one chanter would be asking for trouble unless you have some good add tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it can be done with 1 chanter, the 3 times my guild has done it so far we've only had 1, though one of the times we had a bard as well for mezing, one of if not the biggest help is a warrior with AE taunt, also an SK or two is very helpfull since they can grab argo fast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One chanter can do it if he's on the ball, but I'd second the idea of add-tanking as well.   Having extra tanks to tank-mez something really makes that enchanter's day easier, and ya, he's going to be busy.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw, I can confirm what Allakhazam says, <br />
the boss guy can drop these:  <br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16996&quot;&gt; Veteran's Chain Leggings &lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
grey/silver in appearance and a very nice upgrade over any mid-level legs and even a lot of high-end legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hedge quest is still a little buggy.  You do need EVERYONE to get flagged by the erudite in PoT first, or they won't get the TT lair flag after you kill the boss.  You can still enter the hedge to help, however.<br />
<br />
Entering the hedge is the real buggy part.  If you send up three groups and they all end up in the same hedge, consider yourself lucky.  Many times you will end up with 1 group in 1 hedge, and 2 in another hedge (there are three hedges, presumably the quest could be completed simultaneously by 3 sets of groups.)  Having a succorer in each group to return to zone &amp; try to reenter into same hedge as other groups can save some time &amp; frustration.<br />
<br />
As with pretty much anything, the more higher level (60+) people you have, the better.<br />
<br />
You said you lost Mujaki because of not enough DPS.  So I assume your clerics ran out of mana?  If not, DPS probably isn't the problem.  We've done Mujaki with 17, and we aren't uber, so he can certainly be done with less.<br />
<br />
From an HP perspective, I wouldn't wear those pants over Kael, SS, Thurg, or Dark Master greaves.  Nice upgrade over Dragonleg breeches though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The truely annoying thing about this quest is some people grind in this maze... And if you say the phrase to start this quest, and you happen to get the same maze they are grindin in, only 2 out of the 3 groups get in (Seems like more of a max of 3 groups than 18 peeps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elmarnieh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chan-ters?<br />
<br />
We had one chanter with us but there was no mezzing, just lots of off tanking, not that hard with 3 good warrs and some pally/sk's or ranga :)<br />
<br />
Its fun just gotta mow them down before the healers go lom from healing multiple people.</div></div><hr />
