<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AtcMickey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I have outgrown Paludal and need new place. I am very twinked, and would really appreciate advice on a good spot for MAX xp in Solo with no regard to PP or Loot.<br />
<br />
I hear HH keep basement is decent, but what do you all think?<br />

THANKS!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Feniix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I went and soloed in Solusek A at your level, I didn't have nearly as good as equipment as you, but I did pretty well. Exp is pretty nice, stayed there until around 30. Shame no one hunts there anymore, I remember pre-kunark, there were tons of pickup groups there =/. High Keep basement is also good exp, with my warrior, I was soloing all of the upper level, until some people complained and got a GM to come and made me share =P.</div></div><hr />

30-35 HHK guards (great XP for the lvl)<br />
35-45 DSP Zels, not alot per kill but look at my gear (similar) I can mow through em<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Panteroo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Marus Seru.... fast and easy exp from 24-28 .. starts slowing down at 28ish but that's when you go to DSP</div></div><hr />
