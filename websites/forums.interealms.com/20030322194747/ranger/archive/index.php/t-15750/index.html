<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greakan_VF</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mujaki the Devourer is an event in PoN that has a fixed number of participants. You can only take four groups in. Once you begin the event you begin killing waves of mobs until the main boss, Mujaki, becomes targetable then you kill him. <br />
<br />
It's a fun and challenging event when you are choked down to four groups. My question is; are there other multiple group events in PoP that have a limited number of participants like this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greakan_VF</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To the guilds that are on a dkp system; how are you guys handling dkp on events like this. Not awarding dkp or some modified system, or just full dkp to the ones that are selected to go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poorboy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think it would be fair to give out DKP on a raid that not everyone can attend...just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sorronn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The most critical aspect of DKP systems is that for whatever loot entering the system there has to be the same number of points entering the system (so expenditures = income).<br />
<br />
If DKP controlled loot drops from these events (and the loot from these events is good enough that most guilds will consider using points to award the loot) then points have to be awarded for attending.<br />
<br />
Whether it is &quot;fair&quot; has nothing to do with it. For the system to stay in balance requires that income = outgo. As soon as your point system fails to meet that criteria you will have either inflation or deflation and both of these are bad for your guild.<br />
<br />
Inflation will let a tiny minority of senior people sit on massive pools of DKP and swoop in for select items whenever they want (resulting in bitterness amongst the rest of the guild). Deflation will result in either massive rottage of drops or people going negative on DKP, depending on your guild's policy on negative DKP totals.<br />
<br />
In any case, with a point system the critical thing that keeps it fairest to everyone is to ensure that for every point entering the system there is an expense going out. In fact, some guilds won't even award fixed points for just raiding. They only award points if items are looted. They they take the total number of points looted, divided by the number of people present, and award each member present that many points.<br />
<br />
Your &quot;opinion&quot; doesn't matter alot because DKP is a completely quantified system of accounting for raid attendance and loot distribution. Properly administered, it works well.<br />
<br />
The only better system appears to be a single master loot dealer who knows every one's gear, keeps track of what has been dropped, and then awards it without any bias at all and with a goal of upgrading the entire guild. Since most master looters are not capable of both that level of knowledge and that level of selflessness, master loot systems frequently fail due to biases. Of course when they succeed they succeed spectacularly - look at FOH for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can anyone tell me the diffuculty level the the Muskja event?  Curious what kind of power level you need to complete it and what exactly it is like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arbok of Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mujaki event &gt; Vindi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">we did it with 12 or 14 people, in sure vindi would be hard with this many, we have done statue with 12 but thats alotless dps than vindi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kahla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My Guild is an HoT capable guild and I were preping for our first Vindi encounter which I'm positive we can take down.<br />
<br />
Could my guild do this event and if so, what type of encounter is it how many wave's? what kind of HP's on Musk, Does he AoE? ect..<br />
<br />
Looking for some details to propose this to my guildmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't know anything at all about your guild and what you've done so far, but Vindi is usually the start of a sharp raiding challenge curve. Maybe there's something in PoP that helps ease into this that I'm not aware of (geez, been over a year since I quit.. feels like yesterday (ahhh withdrawal symptoms, noo (sean: kill fennin so furor can update the website! ))<br />
<br />
Anyway, certainly during Velious.. and I can't think of anything in Luclin similar but easier than Vindi.. but Vindi was a lot tougher than anything we fought before him. :P The first time we tried him was pathetic. ;)<br />
<br />
Again read my disclaimer at the top of this post, I could be way off base here. I'm in my I-should-be-asleep-but-don't-feel-like-it mode now, so part of me finds stuff to fill time I normally wouldn't do. Sleeping is so boring. ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lenas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe Va`Dyn or Doomshade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hm, Doomshade perhaps, sounds about right from what I read about him. Va`Dyn is more of an endurance thing no? I only fought him once and we were just exploring as Luclin opened up, and were overpowered for him, but I seem to remember his damage output being not that much and hp being huge. I quit just a few weeks after Luclin came out, and I spent most of my time trying to figure out what the damned quest drops in ssra were for (I still have 2 of the 3 drops (3 of the 4 if the pouch is included :p) for emp key quest, never had a clue what they were when I played my enc :p) I don't think anyone even knew about Doomshade then..<br />
<br />
like I said, I'm not too sure what I'm talking about with tons of PoP mobs I don't know of, but the impression I've been getting would still put Vindi on a next-step-up kinda thing. He certainly was in velious.. died to him many times. ;) My Luclin isn't perfect either as can be seen, but all the mobs I thought of when making that post from Luclin were endurance fights. Doomshade seems to be an exception.. I just don't know if he's tougher or easier than Vindi though. ;)<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's time to go back to Metroid Fusion again, tough getting that hardest ending...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Talan Eaglestrike DoD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We did the Devourer event in PoN.. herm about 3 months ago. Thing that is different between any other fight and this one is you have a mlimited amount of people you can throw at the mob. You need to be extremely slective on who you take to the event. Slowers and Healers are a must. You must have some clicky stick clerics. You must have 1 main tank per group (not neccessarily a War either just make sure they good at getting and keeping agro.. I prefer Hybrid MT's over War's in this because of the taunt factor). Chanters are nice too. This event is about one thing. DPS. Kill the mobs wandering to the Devourer before they get there. The more of them you kill the fewer you have to face at the end. This was a really cool event, and my guild did it before hardly any of us were over 62 (think we did it 3rd day after PoP came out). Meaning you should be able to handle thiws if you have decent gear and abilities. <br />
<br />
One thing I suggest here. Have three groups spread out over the whole front... one group dedicated to the horses and filling in when somoene gets in trouble. Snare EVERYTHING. If yer not sure snare it again. Don't remember if they are snareble but I think they are... seem to remember kiting a few of these so either they are snareable or they move slow. <br />
<br />
Mujaki is cake. Way easier than Vindi... if you can keep all the other mobs off the platform.</div></div><hr />
