<br />
I really and truly looked for a post on this topic, but didn't see any.  <br />
<br />
I've been testing a theory on bear form and I was wondering if anyone has noticed the same mob behavior.  When in bearform I get hit by every friggin' mob that is pulled at least once.  Okay, that might be an exaggeration, but it's a slight one.  <br />
<br />
I group and duo regularly.  It happens in both situations.  I always stand up when the pull is on it's way and I don't cast on it until the main melee dude has started whomping it.  However, I'd estimate, 75% of the time, the mob does a &quot;drive by&quot; on me before it turns its attention to the puller.  I'm standing out of the way, I'm 80% health, and I'm the same level or higher as the rest of the group or my partner.  <br />
<br />
When I turn off bear form (and this is the first bear form spell we get) this doesn't happen anymore.  I'm gonna be doing some statistical analysis, but was wondering if anyone has noticed this behavior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd never noticed anything special about bear form and aggro. Far as i can tell ther is no faction changes at all with bear form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've had no problems with agro. I routinely dou at the gnoll caves in jaggedpine with my ranger and have had no agro issues even with multiple mob pulls. I don't even stand on pulls, I basically wait til ranger has it back, he snares, I sic doggy and then slow/heal til its dead.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only time I'm noticed something to this effect is when grouping in the Overthere.<br />
<br />
Sometimes a Sabretooth would just run at me from out of nowhere and start hitting me. And all I'd done was cast an itsy witsy bitsy slow on him.....the mofo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't remember exactly who posted this, its a regular here on the Crucible, but I found it amusing enough to save.<br />

You just have to think about it from the mob perspective. There's a big burly warrior type smashing you in the face with a sledgehammer. There's a white haired dark-elf stabbing you in the back. There's a few people in tin cans standing up periodically and pointing at the warrior and suddenly the warrior's wounds disappear. There are a bunch of people in robes that stand up periodically and mumble something, point at you, and suddenly you burn or freeze all over. There's a wolf or two - but you KNOW they're harmless. Occasionaly there's a skeleton or imp or elemental, too. <br />
<br />
Then there's this bear. He (you assume it's a he, but it's hard to tell) never appears to do anything - doesn't stand up or sit down, but every so often sparklies surround him (unless your spelleffects are off). He doesn't look threatening but he's ugly (edit: ***, I'm not ugly) and his lip pokes out. After a bit of time being near him, you apparently have the unresistable urge to just go beat the living snot out of him to see if you can shut his mouth. <br />
<br />
I've seen it happen too many times to dismiss the effect. This urge must be built into the gene's of most Norrathian mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have never noticed any difference being in bear form than not being in bear form. You sure your not exaggerating this some?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok, I think I'm starting to see it.  Mebbe everyone else just knows this already and it's taken me 51 levels to figure out.  If the puller veers to one side or the other and leaves me (who was standing behind him) in the mob's line of sight, the mob will 9 times out of 10 come to me first.  If I stand off to the side and end up behind the puller when he veers, or if the puller does not veer, he stays with the puller.  I know this sounds silly, but I have an SK I regularly duo with who is always saying &quot;WHY do they DO that?!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cuetzpali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Are you sending in your pet while sitting? <br />
I typically send in pet as soon as puller gets back, and notice if I'm sitting I get aggro quite often, before I've even thought of casting yet.<br />
Been in ME a little lately though, and sometimes get aggro sitting or standing, pet or no, without casting or even looking at a mob cross-eyed.  I doubt it's bear form though, I prefer to think that they are just scared of me.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I typically send in the pet as soon as the MT engages.  That way I know I'm not stopping the mob short of where the MT wants it to be.  By this time, I'm standing, because I do a slow immediately after I hit the Pet Attack hotkey.  Been doing some more expirementation with this lately, and staying out of the line of sight seems to help quite a bit.  Thanks for all the replies.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">go to chardock, clear the entrance, clear the exit so that there is only that castle thing. Pop on regular bear form and watch =]<br />
<br />
I was there we had not cleared the exit yet, i popped on (lvl 29) bear form and the whole area aggroed us. Just a theory have not tried greater bear form in there and I was level 53 at the time I tried it.<br />
<br />
So my 2cp is bear form = aggro in some places.<br />

Grouped at ZI/ZO before I got Greater Bear, no area wide agro.<br />

Solo-d at ZI/ZO after I got Greater Bear, no area wide agro.<br />
<br />
Hunted in Chardok alot and I have never noticed any strange agro from bear form, Greater or normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know for a FACT that the 4 arms in ME hate bearform with a passion!  Tested it out several times with several different shaman.  Even now at lvl 62, if there is a 4 arm within line of sight of me in bearform, it'll agro.   If I'm not in bearform it will stay in it's position until I'm in proper range (close enough to smack).  I learned this very quickly after a group I was in pulled one near Akheva and even with 3 melee smacking the snot out of it, that dang thing STILL beat me into the dirt without me casting a single spell on it or sitting down.  After that happened 3 times in a row, I decided to do a test.  Next 4 arm pull I waited until it headed for me and after it smacked me once, I clicked off bearform.  The bastage lost all interest in me and focused his attention on the tank.  Since that day I have not used bearform in ME except for testing purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think they're playing mind games with us.. every patch they change it just to keep us on our toes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There is no &quot;aggro&quot; associated with bearform.  NPC's will see through when it comes to faction and religion.  From Vex Thal to Ssraeshza Temple(I can spell that from memory now) to Tactics, all npc hate me in bearform.  Not as much as my guildmates before I shrink myself, but npcs hate me nonetheless :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've never seen this wide-area agro from bearform.  To date, I have yet to see an NPC that has conned differently when I do wear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Made my first visit to PoN last night.  I dropped bearform after 3 Mobs ran straight to me and started quading for 300+ damage.  One actually came from somewhere else in the zone.  We hadn't even pulled it.  (I'm sure it was a train) I'm posting another topic about managing aggro in the planes, but this is a lesson I learned quickly.  The spiders especially seem to really hate it.  The melee's had to fight to keep them off of me even before I did any casting and was at full health.  I turned off bearform and voila, I was back to just getting beat up when I slowed them. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Had the same thing happen to me in ME, Sunbur. Didn't happen with anything but the 4 arms tho, all other mobs behaved *shrug*<br />
<br />
ME is the only zone I've ever had any probs with, Chardok, PoN (group with a necro and another shaman and we all ping pong/root stuff here), and OT have never presented any abnormalty.<br />
