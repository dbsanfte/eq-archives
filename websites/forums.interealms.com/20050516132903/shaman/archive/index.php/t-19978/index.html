<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Dumb question, yes I know I'm an expansion behind.  I'm trying to produce a status report to measure who in my guild is flagged for what POP zones, and we are getting fairly close to elemental planes access.  I need to know what flags/mobs we need in the elementals.  For example, right now I track which Sol Ro minis people have so we'll know when we are ready to tackle Sol Ro... I need to do the same thing for the rest of the access mobs.<br />
<br />
So my questions are...<br />
<br />
1. What exactly do you have to kill in Erylsai: Kingdom of Wind (Plane of Air) to gain access to Xegony?  Every guide I can find just says &quot;the Avatars&quot; but doesn't say how many there are or what their names are.  I found references to the &quot;Avatar of Mist&quot;, &quot;Avatar of Dust&quot;, &quot;Avatar of Smoke&quot;, and &quot;Avatar of Wind&quot;, is that all or are there other mobs that you have to kill to get access to Xegony?  Are the Avatars something that only one person in the raid needs, one person in each group needs, or everyone needs?<br />
<br />
2. Also, I see that you have to kill the Mystical Arbitor to gain access to Plane of Earth B, then kill Rathe Council/Avatar of Earth in PoEB... are there other mobs first?  Is Rathe Council a seperate kill from Avatar of Earth?  If it's something you just always get together, I can list them as one entry, but if you could get one without the other I'd need to seperate them.<br />
<br />
3. Any pre-mobs for Coirnav or can you get him straight off?<br />
<br />
4. Any pre-mobs for Fennin Ro?  Might as well knock all these out at once in my spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. slay the four avatars, yes. each mob will drop one piece for xeg key, essence of mist or air or something along those lines.  only one person in raid really needs this key, most guilds summon corpses up to xeg island to cut prep/clear time down significantly. rogues/necros are good to key for xeg<br />
<br />
2. arbitor keys for poeb yep. slaying all 12 rathe councilmen spawns avatar of earth, slay him and get your time key woot<br />
<br />
3. nope coirnav event is up whenever guardian of coirnav is up, whole event takes like half an hour if you're quick about and have lots of wizards :)<br />
<br />
4. nope fro event is up whenever guardian of doomfire is up at tables. decent length clear for fro but minis drop good loot and are easy<br />
<br />
hurrah good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Each PoA avatar is its own mini event (dust being the hardest imo).  The key ports up only 1 group and there is a named waiting on the otherside of the portal.  Many guilds camp out a necrobot up top for ghettocohs (like posky, sorta).<br />
<br />
Arbitor of Earth requires killing all 4 poearth rings.  It is best to off the big croc first since arb is on a timer (something like 45minutes-1hr).  Killing all 12 members of rathe council within 7min of the first's death spawn Avatar of Earth (very easy).<br />
<br />
Coirnav is a timed 15minute event with lots of adds and some named.<br />
<br />
Fennin is a 6hr timed event with Doomfire guardian the trigger.  Lot of trash to clear, but at least the mini named all *can* drop loot, but don't hold your breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. There are four ring events in Air. If i recall correctly it goes Mist, Wind, Smoke, and Dust. To spawn these avatars you have to go through and clear their respective islands, then a mini named, which drops one piece of loot spawns. After you kill the mini names the Avatar will spawn off in one of the side buildings. It helps to have a ranger track these. Each avatar will drop 1-2 key pieces for xegony. You really only need 1 key, but more can't hurt too much, especially with how contested the other elemental plane zones seem to be.. at least on my server.<br />
<br />
2.  To get to the Mystical Arbitor of Earth, you have to complete all 4 Earth A rings within 24 hours. They can be with or without loot. After you have Earth B access you will need to clear down to the rathe, which involves two steps really. The first is you must clear the front area of mobs within ~30 minutes to unlock the front door. After that there's 3 mini Warchiefs, and one very Angry Warlord Gintolaken who you have to go through. After that you get to clear down to the Rathe prep area. This would be a good place to camp a coth mage. Fast forward a few days of beating your head against the rathe. After you get them all tank mezzed/mezzed, you have 7 minutes in which to kill them all. If you do this sucessfully the Avatar of Earth will spawn, and you'll be sincearly dissapointed with how lame he is.<br />
<br />
3. The trigger is Guardian of Coirnav. If it's not up, no Coirnav for you.<br />
<br />
4. See 3, just replace Coirnav with Doomfire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Without giving too much away and having my guild smoosh me.. ill try and help some.<br />
1. There are 4 rings.. smoke, mist, wind, and the final dust, you defeat all of them get the key that is for Xennys island. The rings are a bunch of mobs .. boring... kill them all it spawns avatar of ....... and then u kill the avatar, move to next rinse repeat till u get all down and get key to xenny... May be able to skip all but dust ring and still get access to Xenny island not sure on this. Once one person has key u can set up a necro, mage coh summon rezz chain and get everyone to Xenny island.<br />
Doing it this way takes along time but doing Dust ring 10 times is about insane!<br />
<br />
2. POEa has 4 rings you have to defeat all in a 24 hour period to spawn Mystical arbitor of earth then fight in and kill him for POEb access. You have to have a key to access MAOE from a entirely different mob.<br />
<br />
Rathe is a entirely different event, I cant say anything on Rathe except the Rathe counsel is seperate from the final flag mob.<br />
<br />
Corndog is a straight up 3 wave 15 min ae fest with 3 named then Corndog at the end.... no pre mobs except the guardian of corndog you have to kill to trigger the event<br />
<br />
FRo is a ring, you have to kill Guardian of FRo to start ring... kill alot of mobs to get to first couple of named then when they die it spawns a couple more then you get FRo spawned and kill him.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">By the way everyone MUST have the arbitor key, there are no piggies into POEB. You CAN piggy people into POEA and if they have key they can now zone into POEB but they will get booted from B if they drop raid and the raid itself must be in A to do the piggying.</div></div><hr />
