<br />
Don't let it happen again.  Make sure you go to the below site and update the latest security patch dated 9-10.  Tell your friends, help your mom and dad get the update installed.<br />
<br />
Description of the Issue:<br />
<br />

<br />
Link to the Update Site:<br />
<br />
http://v4.windowsupdate.microsoft.com/en/default.asp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This can't be stressed enough, this virus is almost as much of a nuisiance as Sobig, and for a fairly computer iliterate user it can pretty much write off there pc.<br />
<br />
Running windows update = 5 minutes.<br />
Getting nasty garbage like this off your pc = far worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since when did windows update ask you to lower your activex controls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have never had that experience on the Windows Update site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ommar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok after running the updates, Magelo will not come up??  I can get to the site but all it does is give me &quot;chicken scratch&quot;  see below, I am behind a firewall and using a proxy server from work, it worked before the update.  Tried installing Sun Java but that did not work either....any ideas.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the funny thing is that the &quot;fixes&quot; werent exactly fixes in this case.  they did not patch the code, they just closed the single port the original worm used.  later incarnations of the virus simply have the port attacked incremented by 1.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The following are mainly for broad band (cable/dsl) users, but dial-up users need to keep up to date, as well.<br />
<br />
On your home PC, there are 3 things you absolutely must have (and a couple optional) if it's connected to the Internet:<br />
1) Updated operating system<br />
2) Up to date Anti-Virus<br />
3) Firewall (hardware or software)<br />
optional:<br />
4) Ad-ware deleter/blocker<br />
5) popup blocker<br />
<br />
1) Microsoft had something like 72 critical updates in 2002.  You have to actively keep your operating system up to date.<br />
<br />
In 2000 or XP in your control panel, you should have an 'Automatic Updates' icon.  If you don't, go to windowsupdate.com, look in the optional updates, and get the automatic updates.  Set it to remind you (or even download) any critical updates.  When you see the little globe popup in your tray - it's time to update.<br />
<br />
You should still visit windowsupdate.com at least monthly to make sure you are getting all of the critical updates.<br />
<br />
2) Any anti-virus software will do, but you need it to be actively updated often.  Mcafee, Norton, Sophos, and others have decent product.<br />
<br />
3) There are several hardware firewalls that are $150 or less that work with cable or DSL.  They will keep the bad guys out and allow you to plug in multiple PCs to one incoming line and share an IP address.  Linksys/Cisco, Netgear, Belkin, D-Link all have 'cable/dsl routers' that do the job.<br />
<br />
Software firewalls are often complicated, but can do the job if you don't want an extra device to manage.  Zone-Alarm is pretty good and has a free version that should work for a lot of PCs.<br />
<br />
4) Ad-ware is software that gets installed stealthily (like a rogue) when you install something you really want.  These programs typically record information about your PC habits (browsing, etc) and send it off to someone else.  If you don't want your personal information or habits being sent without your permission, look for Ad-aware or spybot.<br />
<br />
5) Popups are not only annoying, but they can be dangerous.  Some of the exploits being fixed at windowsupdate exist on the Internet as popup ads.  There are several programs that block popups.<br />
<br />
You can also modify the hosts file on your computer so that it can't reach a lot of the ad based content out there.  Search for &quot;ad blocking hosts file&quot; for more information.<br />
<br />
We now return you to your regularly scheduled Shamminess.  Apologies to any that read the above and said: &quot;Well...duh&quot;.</div></div><hr />
