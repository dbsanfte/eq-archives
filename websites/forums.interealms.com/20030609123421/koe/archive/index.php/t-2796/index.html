<br />
I picked up some quest gems yesterday that are surplus to me so am looking to get rid of them. I would LOVE to be able to donate them to the guild but am really low on PP right now and need to get some more to progress in my trade skills. <br />
<br />
Here is what I have<br />
<br />
Crushed Black Marble<br />
Crushed Jaundice Gem<br />
Nephrite<br />
Crushed Onyx Sapphire<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me what the current market prices are for them? Also if any of the guild needs them I would be happy to take half or even a quarter of the market price for them. Its just right now I have maybe 30pp to my name and need to get this buffer up to continue to do what I would like.<br />
<br />
