<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beomahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for a few pieces of info about the PoA quest ring.  First, can anyone confirm that its rechargeable using a box of the void and mana batterys.  Also, if anyone happens to have one, whats the cast time on it? Thanks a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, rechargable. combine it and a class 5 mana battery (sold from keymaster on first isle of POA) in a box of a void (sold from keymaster and from gnomes in iceclad). after you recharge, you can purchase another box and mana battery to recharge it on the road, but you need to camp first to buy another. this means its 270pp per 4 charges, very worth it.<br />
<br />
and its instant cast, must equip. can fail on ocassion though (soandso has fallen to the ground).</div></div><hr />
