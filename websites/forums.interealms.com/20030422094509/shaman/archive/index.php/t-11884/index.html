Summarizing the quest, you need 6 pieces of luggald flesh, 3 from luggalds in the caverns in Dulak, and 3 from the luggalds in Nadox(the same ones that drop pure blood).  In Neriak commons, right by the waterfall, there is a new NPC, Fleshweaver T'soma.  Hailing him will get you a bag, in which you combine the 3 luggald flesh from Dulak.  Turn that in, and ask him &quot;what task?&quot;, and you get another bag for the Nadox flesh.  Combine and hand back.  This gives you a hidden character flag.  Now head to Tox.  In the NE corner of the mainland there is an NPC named Assistant T'so.  Hailing him will spawn a level 59 giant skele SK(provided you have the hidden character flag).  He will most likely HT you(about 1000 points).  After malo, I had no trouble landing slow.  Hit pretty hard, someone got hit for 490, but he only hit me for about 300.  No problem with a few friends though.  Loot the heart and return to T'soma for the ring.<br />
<br />
Not a bad ring for the difficulty involved.  Extra regen is always nice, even with torpor.  We had about 6 or so of the fecund luggald flesh drop while camping for my pure blood.  I got the flesh in Dulak from greens, fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
There is also a &quot;good&quot; version of this quest in Freeport, with very similar rewards.  Both versions have a somewhat crappy 1hs weapon as the reward for classes not listed on the ring(including poor beastlords :) )  I am planning to check to see if I could do the FP version, even as a troll.</div></div><hr />
