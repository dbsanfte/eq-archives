<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Started my shaman in Aug/99.  Found this site to be wonderfully helpful throughout my time in Norrath.  Thanks for all the fond memories.  I plan to still play occasionally with some RL friends, but for all intensive purporses, i am retiring from the game, and most definitely from my shaman (only high level char).  I think you need only read the waves of negativity to realize that stopping playing a shaman is not a mistake.  Shaman are broken, eq is broken, rl needs attention.  Take care to all and I hope you enjoy your time in game and out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Catch ya on the flipside or maybe WoW if it has the testicular fortitude.<br />
<br />
GL in RL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congrats, Naghite.  The choice whether or not to slap that end billing button is no doubt the hardest part of playing EQ.  Never look back!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, given that Naghite is in my guild and that I regard him as one of the top shaman ever, it's a bummer for sure.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully he'll change his mind.  It could be GoD is just the ticket for clever and intrepid shaman like Naghite.  <br />
<br />
Up to a certain point of course....<br />
<br />
It's like my guild blasted into the EP and then just decided that the EP suck.  Folks just stopped logging on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Where is FinalJustice in these times of hardship?  Sorry all these retiring veterans make me sad, I want you all to come back.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">See ya in the next incarnation.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well you are a true &quot;maven.&quot; Looks like SOE doesn't concern itself with the mavens any more. Look forward to seeing you with the mavens in WoW, and good luck in RL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Take care, see you in EQII!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lol, well that actually would be kinda perverse -- leaving EQ1 just to go to EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, not sure about the others, but I won't be doing EQ2 or WoW or any other one.  5 years of playing EQ with hundreds and hundreds or RL time spent on it, convinced me I need to do something different.  Exercise more, spend more time with my daughter, get a new wife, maybe a better job....you know, crap like that :)<br />
<br />
Thanks Gart, you're pretty good too ya know /wink.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I still haven't hit the cancel button yet...A RL couple and some of my best friends play occasionally together (like once a week), and we have a trio at lvls 25-26 after 2? years of occasional play.  I will still do that with them for little while anyway.</div></div><hr />
