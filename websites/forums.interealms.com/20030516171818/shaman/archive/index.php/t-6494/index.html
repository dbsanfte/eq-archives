<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well after Ash managed to solo one I set out to learn how to do it. I failed three times at first trying faulty strategies. Since then I've killed thirteen wurms and died three times on bad positioning. I've gotten two very rare spells, two empty wurms and a vast number of 500-5000pp spells.<br />
<br />
First I don't think you can do this without torpor or canni V. You'll also most likely need outside buffs. Get at the very least aego, KEI is probably needed too unless you have really great gear, BMB is a nice bonus for safety.<br />
<br />
They are regular spawns with any Elder Wyvern as placeholder. Forget anything you've heard of three hour fixed spawns and such. It's not true, just kill the wyverns and they'll spawn soon enough, they aren't even very rare.<br />
<br />
The best place to do this is at VP zone, plenty of wyverns and there's a safe spot where nothing ever roams just to the east of the big structure that leads to the zone.<br />
<br />
Once you've gotten one to spawn you'll need to prepare yourself for a different breed of fight. You do NOT need malo to do these, I've never had any usefull spells resists since I started doing this seriously. They do resist disease so simply don't use disease.<br />
<br />
Buff yourself and your pet up, make sure to reapply regen, haste and it may be a good idea to use VoTB, do this just before you pull. The spells I keep memed when doing battle are:<br />
<br />
1 Torpor<br />
2 Chloroblast<br />
3 Cripple<br />
4 Malosini<br />
5 Slow<br />
6 Bane<br />
7 Canni IV<br />
8 Kraggs<br />
<br />
Since they do not resist you can basically pull with any of the debuffs. I normally chose malosini, slow, cripple. Run just out of cast range, wait for it to enter and cast. Repeat this untill all debuffs are done.<br />
<br />
Now comes the tricky part, you have to get to your pet while doing two things. You can't run too far away from the wurm or it will aggro the pet and kill it. Best way to avoid this is if you've gotten hit to tell it to calm down, then it wont attack untill the wurm is at you again. The other thing you must do has to do with the wurms huge melee range. It will not quite run up to you. It'll start hitting you barely in range to epic it. This combined with it pushing you and the pet pushing it makes for weird movements.<br />
<br />
You need to stand somewhere relatively stable, I've found that interrupts are greatly affected by where I stand. So you'll need to find a good spot. Where you wont get pushed away and it wont be pushed away by the pet. The pet can't be riposted either or it'll die, make it either push the wurm on top of you or around you. Never away from you, it'll make the wurm summon you and it'll get riposted to death.<br />
<br />
You have to find a good spot right away because there will not be time to move later. Try to get torpor off before the wurm is upon you. In any even make sure you get torpored and fast.  Then you epic and bane it. It's a good idea to keep counting a tempo so you'll know when to recast torpor. Use Kraggs to stay above 4 bulbs of health at all times. They can spike viciously in damage output and interrupted torpors are not your friend, always keep a healthy supply of about a thousand mana so you can adapt to this with chloroblast and Kraggs. Even if this means you can't always bane. Once you get the outine in you'll be able to keep bane up and it'll get easier.<br />
<br />
Try to keep epic up on him, if you have some affliction focus I suggest using bane as primary damage dealer, if not Torrent may be better, remember these do not resist. Naturally you'll need to land a kraggs after each canni V but try to get that done as fast as possible regardless, you need mana bad in this fight. There will be times waiting to retorpor when you don't have to keep your health up or epic or bane, use these times either for canni IV if you need it or Winterstorm/JBB to deal extra damage.<br />
<br />
It's a good idea to reslow midfight, if you do not have extended affliction you might even wan to time reslow with a watch. First and foremost you must ALWAYS keep your hitpoints up, they can hit for 530 and they can double for it twice in a row and then you'll need to be at about 3000hp to get a Kraggs off in time. It will summon and hit you a few times while running, so keep your hitpoints above 3000 until it's dead, dead, dead.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting and do make sure your aego is not about to wear before engaging.<br />

But the guy who first did this had less hitpoints, armour class and Alternate Abilities.</div></div><hr />
