1 on 1? Shaman are great, no question. Row often does 1 on 1 happen on a pvp server? Rare, for every shaman out there there are two pallies + friends.<br />

Ok, as I mentioned in my weekly PvP thread, I'm only on a PvP server one evening a week.<br />
<br />
So far, up to lvl 27 my group has had a 10 - 12 PvP encounters, and most of them were against a single Alliance.  We did have a serious back and forth battle in the tunnels leading to Black Fathom Depths with a full group of Alliance, but that was the exception.  Throw in a couple of encounters with a pair of Elves and that's about it.<br />
<br />
So when should we expect to see mainly 4 or 5 people groups out exping?  On a PvE server the vast majority of people solo everything to 60, only grouping up for instances.  How different is a PvP server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMHO groups are smaller on a PvP server mostly.  I haven't been in many full groups and when I am, I'm too sure why this is as there is a safety in numbers.  As for myself, I almost always solo and the issue is I get jumped, a lot.  Usually by high lvls, groups or raids, although more alliance on my server are trying me 1v1 these days (like last night when I got jumped by an equal level rogue while fishing and my UI is pooched from the patch ... I bolted, buffed, swapped in weaps and went looking for him ... then he bolted).<br />
<br />
I don't expect that you'll see fuller groups till the mid-late 40's.  If you're looking for some fun PvP then as a horde party, then wait outside RFD and gank whole alliance parties as they race for the instance :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it is not that groups are exp'n together, so much as people get annoyed at ganking and usually group up to kill folks.<br />
<br />
at level 27, most spots won't be bad, but goodness, go to STV when you get a chance, absolutel carnage!<br />
