I am just kinda starting out and have played my shaman to lvl 27 and I am looking for something a little more &quot;hectic&quot; in group situations.

shaman or chanter or bard i'd hafta say. people notice when yer damn good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Id think running a good bard is about as hectic as you can get.  A good bard keeps 4 songs running.  A great bard keeps 4 songs running, runs CC, assists in melee and spell damage and does it all non stop.<br />
<br />
Playing a good bard can destroy your wrists though.  I have a guildmate that is an author.  She has sat at a computer and written for hours at a time for a decade.  In the last year, since she started playing a bard, she has developed a progressive carpul tunnel illness that keeps her in pain and requires wrist supports and excercises.  But shes a HELL of a bard.<br />
<br />
And dont kid yourself, an enchanter can be just as boring as a cleric if your group demands single pulls as a rule.  I have a level 40 chanter that I never play anymore because LDoN, his main source of grouping, is incredibly boring.  I play a haste and clarity bot that might toss a mezz once in 10 pulls, only to have it broken by offtanking.  Charming?  Groups are too afraid of it to allow me to do it, even though I can solo pretty well with just charming in places like DL.</div></div><hr />

Bard followed by chanter (no charm), with charm chanter is likely same as bard.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Mainly, what he said ^<br />
<br />
As for diffuculty, I'd rate bard at the top, due to the PITA known as twisting 4-5 songs, pulling, melee, and so forth. Not to mention the utter destruction of your wrists.<br />
<br />
But like Jentriken said, shamans are difficult to play if you are a GOOD/Excellent shaman. I never saw much excitement when I was in my 20's, but try upper 50's to 65.. and you'll find excitement. A good shaman *WILL* make or break that group.  Too many on a pull? Do that crowd control thing, slowem(dot the suckers too if they dont summon!), backup your cleric as needed - never know when he/she MIGHT go ld, keep dps/dots going avatar, haste... we are busy bees if we choose to be and your group will love you for it.<br />
<br />
Hell, my cleric went LD in kodtaz about 25% into a named mob(Hynid Howler) and I was the only healer left with an 8.8k tank.. kept that tank up for a decent amount of time til I finally could not keep up with the mob dps (hits for 1400ish, i heal for 1600-1800 with Tnargs, and up to 3500 on a crit, plus Trushar at 630/tick). Yes, the tank died, I died, and everyone but the bard, but i died cause of heal aggro and.. it goes downhill from there, and I died with it at 0%, bard finished it off heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jentriken you are correct as well.  I will give my shaman more of a chance.  I seem to get that from a lot of people.  That all glasses seem slightly boaring when they are low lvl.  Give them to 45 or so then you will see a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Give them to 45 or so then you will see a difference. <br />
<br />
I would say if you can, try to get 61 or higher. The game changes sooo much then. I have a 65 Shaman, Paladin, Ranger, Mage and a few other alts around 60ish. After hitting 61+ and getting all the new pop spells, its like playing a new game. So if you can give it a bit more time. <br />
<br />
However, I would have to agree bard seems to be the &quot;hardest&quot; to play due to the fact of what everyone was saying. You are expected to pull and cc while keeping 4 songs going and chatting with the group =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
A bard is by far the most attention-intensive class to play if you want to play them correctly.  I've played most classes except ranger and rogue.  Clerics can be exciting to play on raids, except when you're in a CH chain.  <br />
<br />
Clerics are boring when you have nothing go wrong.  Your job is to hit CH if the damage comes in slowly, SL/HL if the damage comes in faster, Div. Arb. if the tank loses 80% in one round then SR and hope you can help the tank survive off chain SL/HLs.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are not difficult to play at all if you're aware of the surroundings.  The have the same elements as shamans (debuff, slow, use a pet) except you have to pay more attention when you're charming.  Mez is like rooting for CC except resisted mezzes can get you dead and tanks who are too impatient and break mez without taunting/aggroing can get you dead also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Any class can be made harder if you stop cheating.  But then again here's my definition of cheating: (valid on EP/LDoN's normally)  clerics(healing)/druids(healing)/chantters(mezing)/single pulls.  If you don't use those it makes life a lot more fun.  But then again i like playing a sham becuas i can hurt myself...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bards are easy enough to play, but to play one well that's a different matter.<br />
<br />
A good player will always stand out regardless of class, but a good Bard they are few and far between. The only other class that really comes close when played well are Enchanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you decide to try a bard, don't plan on typing anything . You will be too busy. Agood bard is a quiet bard LOL <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm surprised that nobody mentioned Necro.  While I agree that the bard is probably the most difficult, I'd rank a good necro as second.  Its less so at 65 for a necro though.  At lower levels when screaming terror was working on mobs, necro's could provide direct CC via their mez.  Root, rez, FD, snare, group heals, awesome aggro for kiting mobs away, offtanking with their pet, FD splitting, etc..<br />
<br />
I remember when my alt necro first got his dark pact single target hot.  I was fighting in the great divide with a group, and the cleric got swamped and had to run for a bit, the MT was low life, I pact him, he fell down, boom it ticked, ihe stood back up hehe.  This went on for a while, the tanking falling over then popping back up, while I'm casting screaming terror on one mob, then poisoning another mob off the cleric, kiting that mob around, while casting root on additional adds.  <br />
<br />
Really, any utility casting class can be  intense if played well.  I group with a friend pally who is awesome.  He's constantly assisting the mob to see if it switches targets. One time, on a raid, a named mob pulled off him.  In that split second he targets me, heals me, regains aggro, all before the cleric or druid in the group could even think about healing me.  Saved my life more times than I can recall:)<br />
<br />
Actually, I don't think I'd define the bard as the hardest class to play, just maybe the most annoying.  The bard has such utility, that sure, there are ton's of things you can do for any given situation.  However, classes like necro's and shamans also have great utility.  The distinction is, necro/shaman/druid etc.. don't have so many specific tools to accomplish what a bard can do, so skill wise, I'd say a great necro is actually a more skillful player than a great bard.  Its providing an amazing benefit for a group, when its an actual difficult to provide that benefit, that separates the class knowledgeable player from the skillful player.  <br />
<br />
A great bard has to know his class well.  A great shaman has to know his class, AND how to improvise to make his class perform above average:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd have to say a bard, simply because it is the only class that requires anything approching timing or manual dexterity to be remotely approach its potential.

bards are hard not because they are hard to understand but because of the way they interact with the UI, the everquest UI is lame for bards and they arent kidding about carpple tunnel, I stopped playing my bard after sore wrists when he was about lvl 10 (I was pvping alot)<br />
<br />
a well played chanter is hard to play, you will die alot because the people you are grouped with are retards, you will die alot because charm will break, twice, when you are under 30%, and low mana, with 2 adds. you will die alot because you are a chanter and mobs just seem to like it better when you are not around to charm/mez/tash/slow them. but if you play the class well you will get noticed.<br />
<br />
its been a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONg time since I grouped with a  necro but they are a very powerful class indeed.<br />
<br />
a shaman thats played well is also capable of taking groups places where you really just dont belong.<br />
<br />
I think those are probably the top 4 most difficult classes to play in the game, but none of them are hard if you are unwilling to push your limits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wow, thank you all very much for your input. Bard looks like the way to go for more of a challenge. I better start practicing my proper posture.<br />

You are not playing the class well if you do not cast canni. Also, melee wont be much better, auto attack on, hit a disc every so often or something. You wont find a lot of diversity among the classes, but if you want a class that can do something a whole fight and impact the fight every moment of it, then I would say shaman can do that, but so can a lot of classes.<br />
<br />
As for more of a challenge and less repetitive, all classes at 50+ will start to seem repetative, its the game. Most groups will pull single mobs constantly until they are 65, so you wont have massive mob diverse fights, all classes will be repetative mobs.<br />
<br />
I play the shaman in some groups well, in others poor. It depends on how long ive been doing what i've been doing. Like if i've been sitting in earth for 3 and a half hours I will likely be just slowing and healing as needed, but not DoTing, not canni outside of canni 5 just because my mind begins to wander, and I dont want to mess something up. In BoT, if im not trying to solo or helping a friend kill some named, and I actually do get an xp group there I just malos and slow and space out. The monotony of the zone leaves me little choice because the stuff is just so easy. I dont ever have to do anything but cast two spells, and if I do more, it dosnt actually make it more exciting. Only fun I would get out of that situation would be pulling agro from the tank and out tanking him just because I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">In my opinion, the most specialized classes are the easiest to play. Clerics heal. Warriors hit autoattack and taunt. Wizzies wait until the mob is at x% health then nuke. I'm not saying that these classes cannot be challenging or enjoyable just that it is clearer how these classes can contribue well to a group. I've found that the less specialized a class is, the contribution to a group is more heavily influenced by player skill. The examples given above (e.g. bard, necro etc) are classes that have a wide breadth of abilitieslots of utility and they can influence the group immensely by the careful use of an ability. With regards bards, I have utmost respect for several people that I know who play bards but remember that being busy does not necessarily mean you are good at what you do. Anyone can sit there and mash keys. The question is, are they mashing the right ones at the right times?<br />
<br />
Rather than pick a class that is hard to play, I'd recommend picking one you think you will enjoy. Remember that, if a class is hard to play, chances are you will do a bad job initially and this may not be fun, particularly if the group suffers as a result of your mistake. Also take a look at your play style. If you like to solo often, for example, that removes a lot of classes from consideration. If you want to get a feel of different classes without investing the time to create a character and level it up, have a look at the other class sites and guides then have a scan of lucy to see what spells/disciplines they have. This should give you a bit of an idea. Do keep in mind that many classes don't get &quot;class defining&quot; abilities until well in to their progression and this may radically alter a classes play style at that level and beyond.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bard is the hardest to play really well, but give some of the biggest rewards if you do it well.<br />
I remember playing the shaman in Karnors castle, doing main healing and slowing and CCing for a group of 5 melees and having to handle pulls of 4 or 5 mobs at a time back in my mid 50s.  I remember being main healer and slower for all sorts of Sebilis groups too, crawling down to disco and back or whatever camp.  Those were fun times.<br />
I haven't had the fun of doing stuff like that until I started playing my bard again.<br />
Bards are very powerful, good for almost any group, and have access to some of most useful types of spells (songs) of all classes.<br />
When I'm in a group, like ldon, I'm playing puller, charming a mob for more dps, singing haste/proccing haste off epic, singing overhaste, singing mana regen, and directing the group where to move in the dungeon.<br />
Hunting in natimbi, I'm always running around with zero downtime usually.<br />
A fungal tunic and FT6 is enough to keep you charm killing almost non stop.<br />
I'll stop off in the bazaar to get some mage summoned weapons and haste mask, charm a mastruq in natimbi, equip him, and mow through about 15 hynids and turupa and stonemites before my pet is low enough health that it's worth it for me to kill him for more xp, and find a new pet to equip.<br />
I've also had some fun doing mass charm kiting in Dulak harbor, keeping about 5 or 6 mobs in camp at all times (aggro 5 mobs, charm one, send pet, the other 4 jump it, invis when pet low health, chant kite pet to death, find another add, charm, repeat...)<br />
It's fairly hectic, but rather fun.<br />
If you can type with any decent amount of speed, you can type some stuff out while still twisting.<br />
You basicly have 3 seconds to type something before the next song needs to be twisted in.<br />
If you are content with just twisting 3 songs, you get about 5 seconds to type stuff.<br />
So some of what you say is fragmented, but the group understands.  :)<br />
One of the best parts is bards don't take that much cash to twink up at the basic level.<br />
If you want to get into heavy charming of mobs, that's where the cash flow increases a lot (~100k for FT3 boots or ornate boots, ~50k for mask of contemplation, ~5k for earring of solstace), and having a fungi is always useful.<br />
Bards don't tank primarily though, so you can get by with substandard armor.<br />
Just make sure you have a decent haste item, and get some armor/weapons with instrument mods if you can.</div></div><hr />

ROFL, as a bard mod, I have to agree with many of you here that by far, a bard is the most intensive class to play well, and as for typing, a good TYPIST can get out 3 or so short words per song cast.  As for getting 4 songs going, it had little to nothing to do with manual dexterity or the skill of the player, but rather your computer and internet connection, plus any crowd lag.  A good bard can keep however many songs up their system/lag can handle, all the time. A great bard can keep up that many songs that are the best for that particular situation, changing the twist to fit the precise need of the group.  An insane bard pulls, melees, hastes, slows, DS's, snares and performs crowd control, all at the same time... Believe me, one LDoN of that and you log your cleric for an hour or two. hehe.  Oh yeah, and I've played every class but a chanter, but would have to say that a bard doing CC is much harder than a chanter, for many reasons.  As for playing a class well, I'd say necro's second hardest, but that's just personal opinion.<br />
<br />
Let me end with saying I love my shaman, he's awesome, fun to solo, not so fun to play MHealer, but great to play when I have only an hour or less to kill.  Thanks for the great forum!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Any shaman can hit malo then slow.  Then, when you get a couple extras in an easy PoP group, when they run around like fools screaming for heals instead of channeling root through turgur'd DPS and calmly backing aside... you know they aren't that great.  Had that happen with a 65 sham in group when I was leveling my warrior alt awhile back.  Was definitely annoying.<br />
<br />
There are a few things that indicate a good shaman, and the first and probably foremost is, as has been mentioned, they will always be casting a spell.  If they get to full mana, they should do something with it, and if not, they should be making more.<br />
<br />
A good shaman can run through a hectic situation on zero mana with canni/clickies/etc.  A bad shaman will shout oom and like, sit there and look pretty.<br />
<br />
Any class which deals with locking down mobs and controlling situations is a difficult class to play.  This lends more toward bards and enchanters, but can to a degree for shaman.  When things get hectic, you toss the slows, CC with VP/Root, toss a few Q's around and heal on top of those if needed.<br />
<br />
The problem is, in earlier content groups, that if, say, a cleric and an enc are in a group, you no longer are on main heals or crowd control, and also lose the ability to use rain.  At that point you're just a slower and third rate wizard wannabe.  Effective, but not exciting.<br />
<br />
I believe being good at any class is difficult.  It's just that some classes can be more forgiving when poorly played than others.  <br />
<br />
The thing is, it seems that some classes have a lot of tools with which to show skill.  As a shaman, if people go &quot;wow, he's a darn good shammy,&quot;  it's usually just because I stay calm and chain cast constantly during a situation that got out of control, slowing, maloing, rooting, HoT/Healing.  Those situations became rarer and rarer as I progressed further into content, where mobs would hit harder and were unrootable/unslowable.  I mean, when your duties are malo and slow, and nuke once and awhile, no matter how great you are, you'll hit a wall...<br />
<br />
You're canning and nuking constantly and still not breaking massive DPS, when a wizard with less skill can jabberjaw and then mash a key every once in awhile and ooh and aah the group more, as the beastlord pulls with awesome slows that are rarely resisted, splits off on one mob as his pet tanks the other, nukes, whatever.<br />
<br />
To answer your question, in my opinion, the hardest class to play effectively would be an enchanter, followed closely, if not tied with, bards, just because if you aren't a fast draw on mez, you can kill a lot of group members pretty fast.  Dealing with charm on high dps mobs also takes some skill as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I agree with bards, but you do have to be able to cope with the mechanism. Practice twisting three songs for a while and then imagine trying to do that for a couple of hours. Not for me, I know that.<br />
<br />
Enchanter is probably next. But they tend to alternate between extreme boredom and hectic activity. Being a chanter in a pickup grind group just looks dull beyond words.<br />
<br />
Tanks and clerics are actually not bad choices, though people joke about it. A good tank or cleric is always doing something in a group, always watching the environment and ready to respond. The problem with a cleric is that it's a very passive role which can become dispiriting. Not quite as passive as the primary healer shaman though, yawn (I only made it to 55). You can't solo, but at least you get to keep the use of your wrists.<br />
<br />
Basically if you play something which has a strong role then that will be reflected in stuff for you to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think being a main healer as a Shaman is VERY non passive... at least at 65 in harder content, just because it's so hard to keep up :) <br />

Main healing at 55 would also be very non passive because you're healing with chloroblast, which is basically one tick of the new quiescence, only you gotta cast it a ton and run dry on mana quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Practice twisting three songs for a while and then imagine trying to do that for a couple of hours. Not for me, I know that.<br />
Ya.   We should do something much less tedious like, say, cannidancing...   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I tried making a bard about a year ago.<br />
I didn't have my hotkeys in any particularly good setup, and so I hated the bard and deleted it after about 3 levels.<br />
I wanted to try it again a while later, and set up my hotkeys in a much different way, and now I've got a 57 bard that's quite fun to play.<br />
<br />
I've set up my 1-7 and 0 keypad numbers to cast spells 1-7 and 8 respectively.<br />
I have my fdse keys set up to control my movement as I do in all first person shooters.<br />
I've also got some really major wrist support happening because my wrists were hurting a lot from just playing a shaman, nevermind starting to play a bard.<br />
(I've got a towel rolled up and flattened out lying down in front of my keyboard that I rest my wrists on when I play so my wrists are completely straight when I'm at the keyboard and don't need to strain any muscles to be able to type or hit keys.)<br />
<br />
Once you have a decent hotkey setup, twisting songs isn't hard.<br />
It's pretty much just learning to count in pairs.<br />
My main songs I twist in combat when I'm not mezzing or charming or whatever is haste, overhaste, mana regen, and slow/snare which are songs 1 2 3 4 for me.<br />
When I'm meleeing stuff, I'm hitting keys 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 ... in succession whenever my song has finished casting.<br />
If I need to do something else, like mez an add, while still meleeing I'll probably change the pattern to 1 1 2 2 3 3 ~ 6 ~ 6 1 1 2 2 3 3 ~ 6 ~ ... in which 6 is my mez and ~ is my hotkey to change between last 2 targets.<br />
It's not really that difficult once you've tried it a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Wow, I totally disagree that bard is the most difficult class to play to perfection.  It's a soloing charming enchanter without a doubt.  And I'm not talking the aa charm.<br />
<br />
Purdypog<br />
<br />
I have a 65 chanter, so I can speak with experience here.  ;)<br />
<br />
Charm soloing is actually very easy.  Charm mob, guard, pull a victim, root it, do 1 point of damage, then back WAY away and let your pet kill it.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Charm soloing is actually kinda boring, and is made even more so with Total Domination AA, which makes it harder for charmed pets to break charm.  A wise charm soloing enchanter never allows herself to get into a position where the pet can kill her, usually by ensuring a quick escape route if things go sour.  This isn't always possible, but veterans always try to set things up so they have as much an &quot;out&quot; as possible.<br />
<br />
Charming in GROUPS is where charming suddenly becomes very complicated.  A chanter charming in group has to worry about the pet as well as performing all the normal tasks a chanter performs.  He can't devote his attention on his pet completely, and that's bad.  Pets have this nasty habit of breaking charm the instant you start slowing the mob in camp.  They have this &quot;radar sense&quot; that lets them know when it's the absolute most inconvenient time to break charm, and they go for it with gusto.<br />
<br />
Charming enchanters like my alt Auli are paranoids.  We believe that everyone is out to get us, including our own groups...because they ARE.  ;)<br />
<br />
Seriously, being a paranoid is the only way you'll ever get good at charming in groups.  Grizzled veteran charmers buff the pet out the wazoo and arm it, and this is where you get the monstrous charm DPS.  Vallon's Quickening on a charmed pet with mage proc weapons equipped is just brutal.  You have to respect your pet, and also respect the idea that your group isn't respecting your pet.  They're gonna do stupid #%#&amp; like break mezzes or just stand there like dorks when charm breaks and you spam the &quot;CHARM BROKEN&quot; hotkey to warn them that you're now dealing with a runaway pet.  The worst of them actually complain:  &quot;Why aren't you slowing the mob, you slacker?  Why aren't you mezzing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I'm trying to keep the pet from killing YOU by virtue of trying to keep it from killing ME, dorkwad!&quot;<br />
<br />
But not everyone's like this.  Many people in high-end guilds have experience with charming enchanters, and when I play Auli I much prefer having these people in my groups, lol.  A single well-timed snare or stun pulls agro off me and lets me recapture the pet.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, people who don't have much exposure to charming often don't let me do it.  Be it LDoN or grinding in PoP, more often than not I'm told no when I ask to charm.  I've even had people disband the group when I asked.<br />
<br />
You can't really blame them for being gun shy, though.  Charming in a group is one of those things that separates the good enchanters from the great enchanters...and there are WAY too many buff-bot-to-be Enchanters running around on Vazaelle, people way too high level for the skills they possess.<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
If you're looking for a challenging class to play, then I highly suggest sticking with your Shaman, or playing an Enchanter.  Shamans do a LOT with a LITTLE, pulling stunts that most other classes can't come close to duplicating because of the fact that we're &quot;kinda good&quot; at several different things, and our slow is very powerful.  Shamans are the toughest of all the casting classes, and bring to the table a varied array of spells that help them.  I have to agree with the others...there are shamans, then there are SHAMANS.  Those who are very good at playing the class find it the most challenging, because they push the envelope as it were, taking on things that others won't try, soloing in places few others dare to go.  The better a shaman you are, the more exciting and challenging the class becomes.<br />
<br />
But if shamans don't seem exciting enough, then try an Enchanter.  You get your first charm at level 12, and trust me, at level 12 charm is a spell that really pushes your adrenalin levels, because it's rather unreliable, lol.  Enchanters thrive in high-pressure situations, and a well played chanter can get groups through things that would kill them otherwise.<br />
<br />
But as it was pointed out, Enchanters can be boring if everything's going well.  It's only when you're in a group that pulls half the zone because there's an Enchanter in the group that makes them an utter blast to play.  Few things are as exciting as seeing 10 mobs come screaming into your camp and knowing that if your skills as an Enchanter aren't excellent, that train's gonna wipe your group.<br />
<br />
Those are the kinds of groups that Auli prefers, hehehe.  One of her favorite things to do is get the Lower Earth camp in BoT and kill off trains that comes boiling out of the other wings, except those rare ones that come out of Deep Earth and collect up just about every giant in the Earth wing...hehehe.  Not even she is that nuts.  If you don't have nerves of steel and aren't willing to take on trains, if the idea of pulling more than one mob at a time makes you wet your pants, then Auli doesn't like grouping with you.  :D<br />
<br />
Good shamans and enchanters are just that...good.  Well played Shamans and Enchanters are some of the most exciting classes in Everquest, because your skill is what pushes the envelope and makes it so exciting.</div></div><hr />

However its almost embarassing to be in a group with a clr and ench on mid range and up GoD, my heals are pathetic, my dps doesnt make a blind bit of difference compared to the insane charm pet, I'm just a 7k rune for the ench/clr when charm breaks or a mez resists at the best of times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I'd have to say that any class can be tough if played well.  Of course it all depends on the group makeup.  If you have a puller in the group, almost any role is simplified.  If you do a Guk LDoN and the warrior is pulling, it could get eventful!  I think if anything, crowd control is tough and this can be done by a number of classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">id have to say thats wrong.. people only notice when you dont do your job right, when you do it properly no one will ever notice until their buffs fade.<br />
<br />
Oh, I don't know, that one time when the puller brought 5 in camp in LDON when we didn't have CC and all casters went oom half way through the fight, leaving me on heals, slows, root parking and off tanking, I think they noticed :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, to go back to the original question, a lot of things in EQ are situational. If you are playing, say, a Cleric in a controlled environment, then yes, it can be as exciting as hitting the HoT button and the CH button once in a while. But if your group is trying to do something non-trivial, then you may find yourself juggling 5 different heals, root parking, stuns (if the mobs are stunnable), DA/DB (and when to click them off) and sometimes even off-tanking on low-damage unrootable mobs. Same deal with Wizards in non-trivial environemnts. They are easy to play as long as you know every mob's resists in every zone and can guess your MT's ability to hold agro 100% accurately - and if you are wrong, you get to tank a 1K hitter while wearing wet napkins for armor :)<br />
<br />
Generally, I would advise against picking a class based solely on the perceived difficulty of playing it. There are other considerations that may prove to be more important in the long run. For example, if you don't like playing a support class, then don't -- it just won't be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Most high end bards I know use game pads for twisting.<br />
<br />
As some have pointed out, how hard a class is can be situational.<br />
<br />
Soloing, Warriors, Rogues, Clerics have it hard.<br />
<br />
In a balanced group, I think all classes are about even.<br />
<br />
In Raid some classes are definately harder than others. Both Clerics and Chanters require a high degree of concentration when their skills are needed. AKA cheal chains and CC jails.<br />
<br />
I think the question should be what style of play do you find most fun. Some people love playing warriors others hate it. Same with Clerics, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Soloing, Warriors, Rogues, Clerics have it hard.<br />
<br />
Soloing a Cleric is not as hard as it may sound if you know your spells  and pick your fights carefully. It's just ... perverse :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Bards are fun and the ability to quad kite without downtime is sweet...]<br />
<br />
Bards don't quad kite really, they Ae kite, which means as many mobs as your video card/pc can handle without lag you too much.<br />
To do that it really require manual dexterity and timing or you will die way too often. Soloing with my Bard is been so far the most amazing experience I had with EQ, you can handle high reds/trains in a way that you would never do with any other class. High mobility and ability to track or outrun every mob let you scout about every outdoor zone. On the negative side, you will get burned out very fast because after a while,  playing will not be very relaxing having to twist songs constantly and if you group , to do something different, to be bossed around by people that don't know what they are doing or having to wait forever before they start pulling.<br />
Play an enchanter is not easy because of the frustration of dieing when people constantly break mezzes.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>mojoejojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'll have to go with Bard too, but I'll introduce another thought.  Paying a puller monk (at least in high level, raid content) requires a GREAT knowledge of the game, zones, mobs and puling tactics.  A good monk has the next mob waiting as the present mob dies.  A bad monk wipes the raid.  A so so monk just dies repeatedly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">&quot;Paying a puller monk (at least in high level, raid content) requires a GREAT knowledge of the game, zones, mobs and puling tactics&quot;<br />
<br />
I totally agree. Its very difficult to know when to pay a monk, via /split, that 50k in copper.  Sometimes you can't even see him, and you want to make sure that there are plenty of AE'ing mobs around, because him escaping by simply FD'ing is lame.  Takes a lot of pratice to pay him properly each time, but its well worth the effort:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">As a shaman become bard, I have to disagree with the people saying bards take the most 'skill'.  They are intensive, and due to the way songs work, you're often left with quite hard decisions as to what extra songs to have memmed, (aside from your core 4-5 songs)  because, even more so than a shaman, your versatility is both a blessing and a curse.  <br />
<br />
I've been in groups where I've been puller, CCer, slower, snarer, and haster. (thankfully, these are few and far between)  Shaman don't quite have the same utility, and the advantage is that most shaman spells last longer than only 18 seconds, giving you more breathing room.  In all honesty though, if you're not pulling, and not in charge of CC/slows, things can be quite boring and require very little skill. Sing your 4 songs. Melee the mob. Keep singing.  Repeat ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
It's really the situations, and how you handle them, that make a class difficult. (as people already stated)  It's much easier to say which are the least hard classes to play, because you can simply look at the more one-dimensional classes, where they don't have as many tools to deal with out-of-the ordinary situations. (wizards, warriors, mages, clerics?) Despite the many problems with shaman at the moment, they can still save the day when everything goes ass-up, and it all comes down to how 'good' you are at playing your class.  <br />
<br />
A good shaman/enchanter/bard/druid/etc can save the day, because you've just pushed your class to the limit.  A mediocre player might not even understand where to start in order to save the day, and this is where the 'skill' is.  It's all about knowing your class.<br />
<br />
P.S. Most bards don't use gamepad macros when it counts; macros are restrictive if you're in a fluid situation where you need to be constantly adjusting what you're doing.  This is the same reason I never actually use my horse on my shaman; it's a PITA to interrupt a spell.  On the other hand, I have a gamepad macro designed specifically for Rathe if I'm on keeper duty, or if I'm the 'clerics bitch' bard for a raid.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Most high end bards I know use game pads for twisting. <br />

Down with gamepads!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">IMO keep playing your shaman or start a enchanter. (optionaly a bard) While a cleric is also a pivotal class.. their healing is so powerfull its not much of a challenge to do their job... more of a PITA / snooze.<br />
<br />
I &lt;3 my Shaman. (despite our current issues)<br />
<br />
If being a shaman is not a challenge to you at your current level, go try to solo something that is not Level apropriate for you :D. It may take you 30-60 minutes but man will it be a feeling of acomplishment. I think it took me an hour of dotting and running with my head cutt off to solo an ice giant in everfrost. I belive I was ~29-30 and this was sometime around when the Veilous expansion released, so my gear was utter crap compared to what you get today in the Bazaar. It's one of my most fun times in EQ :D. BTW the exp and loot off of him was NOT worth the 1 hour it took, but feeling proud that I killed the bastard was.<br />
<br />
Or you could be more resonable and go solo mobs that are your level +- 3 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Exin Krup Gutkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The Bard and Necro both in my book rate as top.<br />
<br />
Problem is that for a Necro really to shine they need a group.  And the other problem is that you notice when a Bard isn't doing much...but it is all the things you don't see that a Necro does.<br />
<br />
Most people just think the life taps from the necro to group members are a dot from the enemy or just don't realize it is there.  They don't know the Necro is mezing because who knew they could?  They don't realize they have mobs atk tapped, hp tapped, are dotting, controling pet, mezzing, debuffing, possibly slowing, and possibly pulling.  Add in being careful of your diminishing HP from Lich and the fact that you have one of the smallest HP pools in the entire game, and a Necro becomes challenging and fun real quick.<br />
<br />
I think being a good Bard is difficult, but what they do is very visual due to the bard spell window and the fact that you can see them in there meleeing.<br />
<br />
Most people underestimate a Necro or plain simply don't know what they can do.<br />
<br />
My favorite moments have been with my Necro.  When you have 4 mobs in camp, no enchanter, and the cleric is dead, and everything is still flowing like normal it is nice.  After they realized that the Cleric was dead, no back up healer, and we didn't have a root enabled class in the group they were both amazed and frightened.  Who knew it was a Necro doing all that.</div></div><hr />
