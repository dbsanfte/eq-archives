<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I once read a nice guide here about buffing a raid, did some searching but didn't find it. Can anyone who has it post it again?<br />
<br />
It was more a guide for other peeps, how they should ask for buffs, where they should stand and what buffs they can expect ...<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, buffing on raids is quite complicated... generally, it consists of these steps:<br />
<br />
1).  Someone asking you for a buff.<br />
2).  You giving them that buff.<br />
<br />
Now although this process is quite difficult, do not expect to remember it exactly the first time.  Practice makes perfect, and eventually you too will be able to buff like a pro!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Awww Redspeed, be nice.  It can be a little more complex than that.  What if you have multiple shaman, or if at least one shaman has MGB?  And things changed a bit with the raid window, too.  Plus on a large raid I'd never wait for tells to do buffs, I want to get the buffage out of the way so I can clear my spell gem slots for combat spells.<br />
<br />
There are basically three raid buffs that shaman always provide:<br />
<br />
   1. Focus (or HoS, or Focus of Soul, etc)<br />
   2. STA<br />
   3. AGI<br />
<br />
Depending on the situation you may also be providing PR/DR in the form of Talisman of Epuration or a combination of PR/DR buffs.<br />
<br />
If there is at least one 60+ MGB shaman, he/she provides MGB Focus.  Duh.  Otherwise, Focus is one of the other buffs the shaman is responsible for.<br />
<br />
If there is exactly one buffing shaman on the raid, my suggestion is to go to the raid window, get a buff up, get a healer on you to heal your cannibalizes, and buff from the top down.  Then switch to a new buff and do it again.  Cann when you have to.<br />
<br />
If you have more, you have to decide whether to split the groups up or to split the buffs up.  Personally, I like splitting the buffs up;  I can keep my buff in a gem and recast on resurrected peeps easily, and everyone knows who to go to for a given buff.  However, if you have more than 3 shaman, that leaves some without anything to do, so you might choose to split up the groups, or some combination (i.e. ShamanA does Focus for groups 1-5, ShamanB does Focus for 6-10, ShamanC does AGI for all, ShamanD does STA for all, ShamanE does Epuration for all).<br />
<br />
After you think you are done, always inform the raid that you are done.  Usually a few people will come out of the woodwork who were LD, clearing lag, latecomers, changing groups, out of range, etc. and they'll have to be individual buffed.<br />
<br />
One other thing: if you are fighting a dispeller, you're going to want to lay on 4-5 junk buffs first, so you must announce to the raid that that's what you are doing and get them to click off the first 4-5 buffs in their list.  Usually I DO go with tells here - ask them to get 4-5 junks from within their group, and send tell if they can't get enough.  I like to use the group PR and DR spells as junks if PR and DR are not required, group Charisma, and individual Acumen (since it lasts a long time).  If you are in a junk-buff situation, ALWAYS buff AGI first, then STA, then Focus to put Focus higher up on the debuff list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keep one thing in mind:<br />
<br />
Melees are idiots.  You will have single people ask you for group buffs.  You will have people ask for buffs that they already have.  You will shout till you are hoarse asking for buffs while you're FM, but the second that mob is inc you're going to get 3 tells for focus.<br />
<br />
It never fails.  Get used to it early on, because as far as I've found, nothing can fix this type of stupidity, no matter how much I bitch at them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kargen Krimsonwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
*** Send tells with your request *** <br />
<br />
Ever wonder why none of the three Shamans react to you /shout /say /ooc &quot;Shammie bufs plz&quot; ? <br />
Maybe because every one of them thinks the other will buff you? <br />
Maybe because they are sick of wasting mana by casting that Focus at the same time at you as the other two Shamans? <br />
Shouts, oocs, says tend to get buried in all that other zone-spam. A tell-text not. <br />
<br />
*** Be selective *** <br />
<br />
It wont help you much sending tells for the same buff requests to each and every Shaman in the raid. They will detect this waste of mana soon and hunt you down. And sick their puppies at you. <br />
<br />
*** Be precise *** <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Gimme al ur Shammie buffz&quot; <br />
Some Shamans have 30 pages in their spellbooks full of interesting buffs. Some Shamans will react to that request by starting at the bottom of their spell books and buff you things like Invis to Animals, Ultravision, Inner Fire, Enduring Breath. Some will serve the more precise requests of the other tank first. <br />
<br />
*** Keep the request short *** <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Well it seems that the dust of the battle has settled down so please can you focus your attention bringing me up with riotous health buff but only if mana permits, if not then please take your time but remember me in 15 minutes if yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda......&quot; <br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Focus&quot; <br />
Two requests. Guess which one will be served first? <br />
People like to be polite. Shamans like politeness too. Shamans have also a lot to work to do at raids, and most of them like short precise requests over politeness. Hugs and kisses can be exchanged when that Dragon is dead. <br />
Note: I also like the short requests being written in capslock. Helps with recoginzing and reading them in all that other spam in the chat window. <br />
Note: I like to chat, but not at raids. Too busy. So i will reply rarely to a buff request other than by casting it on you. /bighug <br />
<br />
*** Learn the buffs *** <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Focus, Str, Dex&quot; <br />
Shaman sighs. <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Dex&quot; <br />
Shaman gets message: &quot;That spell wont have hold on the target&quot; <br />
Shaman sighs <br />
Tank tells you &quot;What is that Focus buff i have?&quot; <br />
<br />
Great news to you: Some buffs stack, some not. Some buffs have several effects blocking other buffs being casted on you. Example: Focus of Spirit not only adds HP but also Str and Dex. <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Talisman&quot; <br />
Shaman opens his spellbook: Talisman of Tnarg, Talisman of Altuna, Talisman of Kragg, Talisman of the Serpent, Talisman of the Raptor, Talisman of the Brute, Talisman of the Rhino, Talisman of the Cat, Talisman of Shadoo, Talisman of Jacinth <br />
Shaman has also Focus of Spirit in his spellbook, maybe the client wants this? <br />
<br />
*** Learn more of the buffs *** <br />
<br />
Did you know that Focus of Spirit is a L 60 spell? Ever wondered why that Luminary (L55-59 Shammie) wont talk with you anymore after you requested four times in a row a Focus from him? There are nice websites out there with spell lists. Or you even may *cough* ask a Shaman what level a certain spell is (please do this after the raid though). <br />
<br />
*** The Right-klick-check-mantra *** <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;STA&quot; <br />
Shaman gets message: &quot;That spell wont have hold on the target&quot; <br />
Tank tells you &quot;Oh i already have that buff from another Shaman&quot; <br />
<br />
Check your Buffs BEFORE sending a request to the Shaman. Its so easy. Right-klick your buffs and check them. <br />
Please all relax now, take a deeeeep breath and slowly repeat my mantra: <br />
&quot;Right-click-check!&quot;.&quot;Right-click-check!&quot;.&quot;Right-click-check!&quot; <br />
This can also be helpful in other situations and may prevent you one day from giving your Tranquil Staff to Ssolet Dnaas instead of the Burnished Wooden Staff. <br />
<br />
*** Request Buff-refreshs asap *** <br />
<br />
Raidleader shouts &quot;CHARGE&quot; <br />
SleepyTank_01 tells you &quot;can i have quick Focus and DR?&quot; <br />
SleepyTank_02 tells you &quot;Focus quick!&quot; <br />
SleepyTank_03 tells you &quot;I was rezzed 15 minutes ago and have no buffz&quot; <br />
Buff icons start blinking for 30 seconds before fading. Thats not to hypnotize you. Its a signal for you to wake up, check which buff fades and send tell to Shaman. Its your responsibility to be combat ready all the time; you never know what mob is around the corner or when the raid-leader calls charge. <br />
<br />
*** Sit down *** <br />
<br />
No joke. <br />
Spells have a certain range. If you are running around like a headless chicken you will probably out of range when the Shammie tries to buff you. Or you will miss that group buff. Or slip on a banana peel. <br />
Also asking for a buff and running away 10 seconds later to pull a mob wont help you much. Really. <br />
Note: I am aware that there are situation which forbid sitting down due to complicated aggro-thingies or such.Then try to reduce your movements to a minimum while the raid buffs up. You will help lots by NOT behaving like being intoxicated with 19 cups of coffee. <br />
<br />
*** The buff who wasnt there *** <br />
<br />
Hello Mr WW-Dragon! <br />
Good-bye Mr WW-Dragon! <br />
Doh! Where are all my buffs? <br />
/tell Shaman &quot;FOCUS, STA, ACUMEN&quot; <br />
Yes, dispell magic is a nice spell. We used it on that Iksar Necromancer to get rid of his damage shield. So some monsters decided to adapt our tactics. And the smart players decided to counteradapt. <br />
They noticed that monsters dispell one of their first 4 buffs. So its wise decision to bury the mana-expensive buffs deep deep deep. And then there are some instant-self-buff-casting items. They fill in nicely that just dispelled dummy buff and prevent nasty Mr. WW-Dragon from breathing deeper. <br />
So if you fight dispelling monsters, please take care of buff sequence. Grab some cheap buffs (see invis, Ultravision or such) first; THEN ask shammie for the big guns. And try to get hold of a shrunken goblin earring or another instant-casting item. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** The rogue who wasnt there *** <br />
<br />
I dont klick around to target players for buffin. Its too painful in small crowded places. I use /tar &lt;name&gt; or /rt to get hold of a target. Invisible hidden sneaking people cannot be targeted either by klicking nor /tar command. Invisible hidden sneaking people wont get buffs until stopping their David Copperfield show. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** This aint the commons tunnel *** <br />
<br />
So please DONT ask me for SoW. You wont get it. I am busy with other things. See that guy over there? That fragile green man with the funny hat which looks like spaceship? Thats a ranger. He will help you gladly with SoW. And it helps him to get the feeling that he is needed. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** Be patient *** <br />
<br />
You learned all the basics. An Icon is blinking. You checked your buffs. You sit down. You sent the Shaman a short precise tell : &quot;FOCUS, STA, ACUMEN&quot;. But nothing happens. A whole 60 seconds no reaction. He must be asleep! You have to take measures and inform the raidleader (who is just sitting around he whole time doing nothing) about this. <br />
<br />
Please dont get angry! Instead let me tell you a few things about my job so you understand the problems i face. <br />
<br />
- Mana pool <br />
The Shamans manapool is roughly around 2500-3000 mana. <br />
The best buffs eats lots of mana. <br />
Example: one casting of Focus of Spirit eats 500 mana. So after buffing 6 tanks with Focus the mana pool is empty. <br />
Even with cannibalizing and high regrowth-rate it will take a bit time to regain some mana. <br />
<br />
- Spell-slots <br />
8 Spell-slots. Thats not much. My standard raid setup claims 6 slots: Cannibalize4, Torpor, Turgurs, Malo, Malosini, Cripple. Thats 2 slots (maybe 3 if I kick cripple out) for memming buffs. There are far more Standard-raid-buffs: Focus, Riotous Health, Acumen, several group-stat/resist-buffs. Even more when the Shaman is not Focus-enabled. <br />
So the probability is high that I dont have that buff memmed you have requested and have to dememorize one buff and memorize your Focus. This takes time and klicking and rummaging my spellbook. And some buffs also have a certain time after being memmed during which they cant be casted. So sometimes i am not dreamily staring at you while scratching my butt. Instead I wait for that darn spell-Icon to be klickable. <br />
<br />
- Debuffing is also our job <br />
Shamans not only buff, they also debuff. Turgurs slows monsters down (250 mana). Malo debuffs resists (350 Mana). So during pulling many Shamans like to keep at least one blue bubble of mana for debuffing instead of going oom. A slowed Sebilite Protector is worth more than that one additional Focus on a tank. <br />
<br />
- Berserking makes silent <br />
There is that nice Berseker-line of self-only Shaman-buff spells. <br />
Example: Voice of the Berzerker (L 59) adds 84 Strength, 24 AC, 74 Dexterity, 74 Agility. <br />
I need theses additional stats because some monsters dont like being debuffed and beating the crap out of me and it helps me survive and channel through that Turgurs or Malo. <br />
The drawback: After going berserk the Shaman is silent for 30 seconds and cannot cast anything. Doh! Rumors are that the Shaman is not even able to send a tell or reply during this time. <br />
<br />
- The PE-Problem (Rant) <br />
Let me tell you about that nice toy from Veeshan Peak: Hammer of Dragonborne, SHM only. 2 HB, some stats. And it can cast a very nice Buff with high stackablity: Primal Essence. This adds 20 Str, Dex, Agi, Sta. Tanks love it. And request it often once the word has spread. <br />
Most Shammies love the hammer when they get it. <br />
And then they will get aware of the two major drawbacks: Casting time is insane 15 seconds. Hammer must be equipped for casting. <br />
So that what happens in that typical ToV-raid situation: Tanks tells you &quot;PE&quot;. <br />
Things i have to do now: <br />
- open inventory <br />
- open bag <br />
- de-equip Sarnak Battle Shield <br />
- de-equip Spear of Fate <br />
- equip Hammer <br />
- target tank <br />
- klick hammer <br />
- wait 15 seconds <br />
- deequip Hammer <br />
- equip Spear <br />
- equip Shield <br />
Yes i would keep the hammer equipped all the time. But I will lose tons of stats, AC, HP and resists because of that. I need AC and resists when that incoming Elder Drake has to be slowed. Sometimes i am thinking of deleting that hammer. <br />
<br />
- We are not perfect and tend to get tired after 6 hours <br />
There are rarely more than two Shamans at one raid. Often only one. <br />
There are often more than two tanks at a raid. Often 15-20. <br />
There are often more than two mobs to slow/malo. <br />
There is rarely more than two minutes pause for a Shaman. <br />
So after the sixth hour our shiny perfection starts to crumble and shatter and a buff request might slip our attention. <br />
So if you dont get your buffs even after waiting a certain time (i suggest 2-3 minutes) just refresh yor request. Its simple as that. <br />
<br />
I hope these ramblings help you all to understand a bit the role and work of a Shaman. And make you and your next raid a bit more efficient and rewarding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yeah, I forgot the standard rule in our guild.<br />
<br />
Only the group leaders may ask for buffs.<br />
<br />
When you're dealing with a large raid force (we maxed out the raid Sunday night with more than 12 groups present) this is essential.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Guess you were not looking for this one? :p <br />
<br />
I offer the following tips for working with the gate-inhibited: <br />
<br />
Melees are poor at math and don't understand that 20 mana is less than 100 mana, thus they keep pulling. You can help the tank visualize your mana bar by keeping his health bar at the same level. Some warriors cannot comprehend this either and pull anyway. This is called natural selection. <br />
<br />
Paladin get a very annoying ability called Lay of Hands that they carry around like a personal get out of death free card. They will happily pull Venril Sathir to your right courtyard group confident that LoH will save the day. It's imperative that you &quot;fizzle&quot; a few heals, forcing them to burn this right away. Now, your group is relatively safe from your pally for one game day. <br />
<br />
Monks get a similar ability called Mend. They tend to be more selfish in its use, so make a hotkey saying “Monk, please cast MEND on %t.” and click it every two minutes. If they try to claim they can’t, tell them your brother’s 16 monk can Group Mend. Then accuse them of being ebayed. <br />
<br />
Tanks think all casters med at something like 500 mana a tick. When you report your current mana they, despite being poor at math, mentally tack on another 30% to compensate for .003 second delay your message spent traversing the internet. To correct for this, subtract 30% from all mana reports. This is called the &quot;Scotty Principle”. <br />
<br />
Rogue twinks are your enemy. They join the group with 15 hit points left dual wielding 10/10 weapons that proc Insidious Taunt and immediately demand haste. You cannot afford to heal rogues. Give them something with a boot icon -- Scale of Wolf for instance. <br />
<br />
Many people do not understand the Ranger class and think they are like that dirty, unshaven guy from Lord of the Rings. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Rangers actually follow very strict principals of honor like Shaolin priests. Under their Bushido-like code, nothing brings more shame than being healed by another. Pat Morita explained this all at the last Fan Fair. He did say they were kinda dirty. <br />
<br />
Keep your pet alive over all other group members. You can justify this by explaining that your 55 pet costs 50 mana more than Reviviscence. Be warned, they will try to confuse the issue by pointing out that you can’t even cast Reviviscence. Go into a long dissertation regarding the concept of “community mana” and the respect thereof. <br />
<br />
If melees ask for strength say something like, &quot;Yeah, that would be sweet -- maybe this drolvarg will drop it?&quot; [Optional] Then cast Maniacal Strength on your pet. <br />
<br />
Some shaman suggest casting buffs on yourself or a pet as timers so you know when to refresh. While this may sound good on paper, it does not factor in the warrior who clicks off each buff every few minutes trying to check the names. <br />
<br />
Don't get angry at the tank who responds to your &quot;OOM&quot; with &quot;haste plz&quot;. What they really mean is, &quot;Hastily get thyself to the zone while I buy you precious second with my unworthy life's blood, Good Priest.&quot; It's just hard to type all that between the crunching sounds. Respect the dying request of this proud roleplayer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>atarak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since you asked, here's how -WE- operate (this may not work for others, very dependant on how many shaman you have, etc.)<br />
<br />
2 shaman AE stamina/focus<br />
1 shaman makes sure warriors have char.<br />
<br />
anyone who shows up late or dies sends a /tell for single target fos/stamina, no /tell, no buff, we're not going to try and keep track of who's dead or just showed up, thats THEIR responsability, not to mention there's no point in having 4 shaman buff the same person. Requests in /gu (excluding general requests like 'ok, we need tribunal for the next boss') get ignored.<br />
Every shaman has a simple hotkey:<br />
<br />
/# takeing %T<br />
where # = the chat channel for our shaman chat<br />
this is used to inform the other shaman that you're buffing (or in case of mobs, debuffing) your current target. This saved a lot of wasted mana in duplicated effort.<br />
<br />
anyone who asks for something like agility gets told to **** off, you want agility, ask a ranger, I'm not wasting my mana or time on it.<br />
<br />
about once every 1.5 hours, or after a large wipe, the other 2 shaman AE stamina/focus one everyone's res'd in.<br />
<br />
resists get done by raid group, anyone other than the puller who isn't in range when the buff gets done can go suck wind, we give plenty of warning (30+ seconds) so be close to your group leader, its not that tough.<br />
<br />
in some zones shrink is imperative because targetting already sucks ass and trying to target around some fatass makes it worse, no shrink, no buff, its a simple concept and easy to enforce, you tell dumbass, &quot;go to the bazaar, buy some shrink potions and carry them, or you're going to be buffless until you do.&quot; Most groups already have someone capable of casting shrink via spell or click item, if you're not in one of those groups, clue in and handle it yourself, expecting a shaman or bst to group hop just to shrink you is stupid and won't be tolerated.<br />
<br />
rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Above all else, COORDINATION, shaman in the same guild on the same raid who don't talk to eachother constantly are wasteing everyone else's time and effort. <br />
<br />
It may sound like we're *ssholes, and maybe we are, but you know, we also don't have spend our night babysitting people, they babysit themselves or they end up wondering why they don't have shaman buffs. Eventually, folks catch on and we end up with a lot less wasted mana, a lot less cussing, and generally have a much better evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A lot of it depends on the number of shaman you have at a raid.  For the most part we only buff sta / focus.  If anyone requests another buff I give it to them.  I have yet to get requested for str and dex on a raid.  Since runes are still pretty rare the group focus is still a myth to a lot of us.  That means single casting focus on ever melee on a raid.  Plus a lot of casters want it as well.  I sure hope you have a couple of shaman around to help out with that.<br />
<br />
Requests for buffs should be sent as tells.  If you are fast enough or you dont recieve all the requests at once you can use /rt to target the last person who sent you a tell.  Not as usefull when raid first starts out but I get to use it about 60% of the time.<br />
<br />
If the person who sent you the tell for a buff is out of range.  let them know and move on.  Unless you are in the wrong spot it is their responsibility to be near you to get a buff.<br />
<br />
Train your melee to go back to the same person they got a buff from for a refresh or to click it off.  Nothing is worse then wasting mana on a would not take hold message.<br />
<br />
The other buff (not really a buff) we do on raids is shrink.  Shrink everyone in your group.  Some raids have a shrink group with a shaman doing nothing but that as people arrive.  When you get 100 people all in the same place it will get crowded even it wide open places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since my guild can have up to 5 shaman on a raid, I decided to make the &quot;shaman&quot; channel. This is where we go to complain about the melees and lack of shaman drops. Oh, we also do slows and buffs too, but that is less important than the bitching of the melees.<br />
<br />
It has really kept us from stepping on each other's toes. Can't tell you all the times I would cast slow to have it &quot;not hold' because one shaman higher than me wouldn't announce. Worked pretty well so far. And all the other classes were envious that we had our own channel and made their own now too. So the clerics have their CH line channel, the melees have their, I don't know, tank channel.<br />
<br />
Might think of using that if you have more than 3 shaman at a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes requiring only group leaders to ask for buffs is a good idea, but refer back to rule #1:<br />
<br />
Melees are idiots.  Inevitably someone is going to come late, be ungrouped, or just plain ignore convention, and ask you for a group buff for himself.<br />
<br />
The new /raid feature is a godsend, you can quickly and easily see what group that person is in and whether you just buffed them (which you typically have).  And you can ignore anyone that doesn't have &quot;group leader&quot; next to their name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A good thing to keep in mind is that different classes love different buffs.  For example, a warrior isnt going to give a damn about dex, but rogues, rangers and bards love it.  Got a chanter/bard or 3 in your raid?  Give them your uber charisma buff to help with mezzing.<br />
<br />
Generally what I do is first take note of the different classes that are present, and then do a buff cycle of stat buffs before laying on FoS.<br />
<br />
ex:  I have 2 rogues, 2 rangers and a bard in the raid.  Buff dex cycle.  <br />
       I notice that there is lower level SK present, group buff STR on his group.<br />
       Then go ahead and group Focus all groups, group buff STA.  Sometimes agility if I feel like it.</div></div><hr />

OK.  I know this isn't entirely a joke because I've seen screenshots from Furor where he's CHA buffed, and it's got to have some reason to take up a buff slot.<br />
<br />
This can't just be for Death Pact kind of spells.<br />
<br />
So what deep magic lies within the CHA buff?  It's probably nothing I need to worry about for a long time, if ever, but it's driving me batty not to know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly? Its strictly for Divine Intervention, I haven't sat down and done 2-3 hours of testing with various people, but I've been around long enough to make a reasonable guess that yes, char does in fact, matter wrt DI fireing or not. Without char, our we end up doing a lot more tank transitions than with, good enough for me to make sure it happens even if its just a 'lucky charm'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Several of the posts above are fabulous examples of things everyone who raids with a Shaman should know, and what we as Shemans need to educate our guilds about.<br />
<br />
The one that I found funniest and yet most true is about asking a Ranger if you want SoW.  God knows I've been casting it on every roaming player who needed it since Level 9...it's someone else's turn to feel the pain...and as indicated, it might even make them feel useful. :)<br />
<br />
A couple things I would add for those who are asking for buffs during raids.<br />
<br />
- If you die, and you do not see buffs already on your screen when you stand up from looting your corpse, assume we missed your death and ask in tells for the buffs you need.  We try to buff people thruout the raid as they get ressed, but won't get everyone all the time.  Casters tend to get missed more than tanks.  The exception to this is on a wipeout.  When we've died along with everyone else, don't bother asking for buffs.  We know we have to rebuff the whole raid, and will be doing so in as efficient manner as our mana allows.<br />
<br />
- Please try to have some idea what you are asking for and form whom.  It was addressed above not to ask a 59 Shaman for Focus.  And trying to keep track of who has what buffs available is not really your job.  But how many raids do I need to respond to your &quot;PE Pls&quot; tell with a response that I don't have the spell before you realize I DON'T HAVE THE SPELL!  10? 20? 50? 100?  This after my counterpart has told the raid &quot;Tell for PE&quot; and I've said &quot;Tell for Foso/Boar&quot;.<br />
<br />
- PLEASE DO NOT SAY THANKS!  We know you are thankful for the buff we just gave you.  Unfortunately, your &quot;Thanks&quot; tell just made me lose my ability to /rt the last person who asked for a buff.  One big thanks to the Shamans at the end of the raid for a job well done would be greatly appreciated.  We don't need to hear it after every cast.<br />
<br />
Good buffing to all! :)<br />

So please DONT ask me for SoW. You wont get it. I am busy with other things. See that guy over there? That fragile green man with the funny hat which looks like spaceship? Thats a ranger. He will help you gladly with SoW. And it helps him to get the feeling that he is needed. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The most important thing I have introduced is: No buffing unless your group is in raid ('cause I can see who's in it)<br />
So I can see whom to blame when what I hate most about raid buffing happens:<br />
<br />
/rs buffing focus, please click off all old focus<br />
/cast khura's<br />
<br />
your spell did not take hold on your target x n (3&lt;n&lt;6)<br />
<br />
This is espcecially prevalent if you're not the highest shaman in your guild, and even worse if the high shaman did an mgb khura's 85 min ago, just before he left the raid.<br />
<br />
AHHHHHH<br />
<br />
So I did find that /shout 'xyz your group did have 4 people with old focus'  tends to get peoples attention. The third time in the same night at least.</div></div><hr />

Ancient Council - Shaman's Guide to Raiding<br />
Jaas (Oracle - Saryrn - Ancient Council)<br />
May 2002<br />
<br />
This guide provides information which should be useful for shaman's involved in a number of high level encounters as a raid participant.  There are many variations depending on equipment, spell availability, group makeup, and other members of the raiding party.  This guide is aimed at level 50 plus shaman.  At the end there is a FAQ for when the optimal raiding group is not present.<br />
<br />
Group Makeup<br />
<br />
A Shaman can contribute as a secondary in many roles on a raid.  Primary role is in buffing players and debuffing mobs and slowing, however, shaman's can play a valuable role in healing, damage (DOTS), and curing disease, poison or curse during and after the fight..  <br />
<br />
If you are in the position as the primary healer in the group, see if another shaman on the raid can perform buffs which are mana intensive.<br />
<br />
I would also recommend if you are on a raid to volunteer managing the groups several times.  This provide excellent insight into what works and does not work with groups as groups request different makeups.  <br />
<br />
Pre-fight, otherwise known as &quot;Suck Mana Dry&quot;<br />
<br />
The busiest time for a shaman is prior to the battle in order to help prepare the raiding party for engagements.  <br />
<br />
When there are more players on the raid than mana, you need to prioritize.  It does no good to have everyone buffed but no mana for debuffing when the mobs arrive.  If not doing group buffs, start with the highest players and work down, these should be the ones gaining agro and needing them most.  You can save yourself reading a lot of tells by announcing your intentions in the raid channel.<br />
<br />
This is when the shaman is doing all possible to acquire mana for the buffing which needs to be done.  There are some things which can help with mana:<br />
<br />
•	Get assigned to a group with a bard<br />
•	Use the secondary healers to heal you while you cann<br />
•	Have the necros dump mana into you	<br />
•	Have other classes do junk buffs if you are strapped for time<br />
•	If there are that many to buff and it's a single mob engagement, have people camp out after buffs and return on demand<br />
<br />
Make sure that the buffs are protected with junk buffs when fighting mobs that can removed buffs and that the correct buffs are protected.  For instance Resist Fire can be a junk one time but primary buffs for another engagement.<br />
<br />
If buffs are wearing off, let the raid leader know so that adjustments can be made.<br />
<br />
See Duty priority list for sequence of buffs.<br />
<br />
Mob Engagement, otherwise known as &quot;see how hard the mob hits&quot;<br />
<br />
The primary focus for the shaman during the initial part of the fight is sticking a slow on the mob as quickly as possible once engaged. This also makes you the focus of the mobs affections.  <br />
<br />
This has many benefits such as reducing the amount of healing required during the engagement, saving mana for all the healers, and reduces the number of deaths.  <br />
<br />
Of course, you want to wait until annul is complete and the Main Assist has acquired agro.  It may be required to do malo, tash, malosin and bard debuff before attempting slow.  If the mob resists frequently, having multiple shaman on slow duties can help here.<br />
<br />
For mobs which rampage, cripple is essential as well.  This is a spell which shaman and enchanters can cast.<br />
<br />
Battle Assignments<br />
<br />
One shaman on the raid should provide raid assignments to ensure that all critical debuffs are completed and prevent overlapping buffs.  Considerations should be made for what other duties have been assigned to the shaman for the raid or if the shaman is hydra'ing other characters who have primary raid duties.  <br />
<br />
Post Battle Activities<br />
<br />
After the battle or between pulls there may be players which have been rezzed, hopefully not you.  Rebuff these players and help heal them up if you have spare mana.<br />
<br />
Duty Priority List<br />
<br />
Buffs should be done in this order of priority.<br />
 <br />
Hit Points		Harness			Kragg			Focus<br />
Stamina					Righteous Health	Righteous Health<br />
Stength			Included in Harness	Strength		Included in Focus<br />
Dexterity		Included in Harness	Dexterity		Included in Focus<br />
Agility			Agility			Agility			Agility<br />
Regen			Regrowth		Regrowth		Regrowth<br />
Stamina Regain		Acumen		Acumen		Acumen<br />
<br />
Resists are specific to encounter and on encounters mobs which debuff should have the specific resist for the mob protected by junk buffs.<br />
<br />
Resist Poison 		(Trak, Sev)<br />
Resist Disease<br />
Resist Cold 		(Gore)<br />
Resist Fire		(RageFire, Keeper)<br />
<br />
Debuffs should be done in this order of priority<br />
<br />
Non-Rampage Mobs<br />
<br />
Annul			Enchanter<br />
Malo			Shaman<br />
Debuff			Bard<br />
Tash			Enchanter<br />
Malosini		Shaman<br />
Slow			Shaman<br />

<br />
Annul			Enchanter<br />
Malo			Shaman<br />
Insidious Decay		Shaman<br />
Tash			Enchanter<br />
Plague Insects		Shaman<br />
<br />
A shaman duty assignment person should list and track which buffs/debuffs are assigned to each person.<br />
<br />
Damage Spells<br />
<br />
Although a shaman’s damage spells take a long time to work, they can contribute during a raid, and stack nicely in the case there are more than one shaman on a raid.<br />
<br />
Damage over time<br />
<br />
Epic – Curse of Spirits			Sticks most of the time<br />
Pox – High mana cost, does a reasonable amount of damage					<br />
Bane of Nife – High mana cost, does a reasonable amount of damage<br />
Plague – low mana cost, slow acting<br />
Ebolt – low mana cost, fast acting<br />
Torrent of Poison – high damage, fast acting, good for helping to finish mobs<br />
<br />
Direct damage<br />
<br />
Direct damage spells, other than the free JBB are not particularly mana efficient.  You would do better with DoTs or keeping your melee classes alive.  If it comes down to you trying to Nuke the mob out of existence without other classes there, then the best bet is to move to a convenient place for corpse recovery or moving the mob(s) away from camping clerics.<br />
<br />
JBB – Winter’s Roar<br />
<br />
<br />
Engagement Mob Notes<br />
<br />
Trakanon		MA fight - Malo, Malosini (DR buff)<br />
Severillous		MA fight - Malo, Malosini, Slow, (PR Buff)<br />
Goreaneor		Caster fight - Malo, Malosini, Slow, (CR Buff)<br />
Gozzerem		MA fight - Malo, heal raid members, (FR Buff) <br />
Keeper			MA fight - Malo, <br />
Velkator		MA fight - Malo, JBB, heal raid members<br />

<br />
FAQ's <br />
<br />
Q1) I am the only healer in the group with five melee types, how can I keep the members alive?<br />
<br />
A1) Have the melee's back off when they reach 60 percent hit points, this give you an opportunity to heal them.  If you are relying on only chloroblast try and get a cleric to help, but since you have been assigned primary healer, chances are there are no spare clerics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q2) I can't keep up with the buffs for the whole raiding party, I am the only one.  How do I make this work?<br />
<br />
A2) Don't buff everyone, prioritize.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q3) Should I buff everyone with everything?<br />
<br />
A3) Only if you have the time and the mana.  Primarily you want to add HPs to all, focus/kragg/harness, and STA.  AGI can help melee classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q4) Why bother buffing a caster with stamina?<br />
<br />
A5) It provides hit points which gives the healers a little more time to keep the casters alive.  The Kael BP is particularly useful here, cast on all members of the raiding party between fights.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q5) How can Alchemy help in large encounters?<br />
<br />
A5) Damage Shield Potions are useful, so are heal potions.  By the time you get to raiding the large mobs most people should have the resists up with gear.  Gate is also useful in cases where melees are stranded at the end of the battle and the last porters have left.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q6) Why assign more than one shaman to the same duty, that would seem to waste mana?<br />
<br />
A6) Some mobs need many casts if resists are high.  Make sure that the secondary and tertiary shamans watch for the debuff tells before burning a cast (i.e., malo, tash, malosini) <br />
<br />
<br />
Q7) When the Main Assist has just died, how can I help?<br />
<br />
A7) Use /target mob to select the next player on the agro list and heal the next agro person immediately, this gives a small buffer while the cleric(s) re-acquire the new MA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q8) When should we not perform the debuffing duties?<br />
<br />
A8) If the mobs are dying within 30 seconds due to a larger than normal raiding party, don’t debuff mobs engaged.  Do however, debuffed mezzed mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q9) How can enchanters help keep me alive, I keep dying?<br />
<br />
A9) Enchanters can mem wipe, removing you (and them) from agro list.  The enchanters should already know this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q10) What effect does chain casting debuffs have on a mob?<br />
<br />
A10) Opportunity for Rez.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q11) People broadcast in raid channel for buffs, what do I do.<br />
<br />
A11) Ignore them, raid members needing buffs should do direct tells and for group buffs only the group leader, when present should do the tell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q12) High level mobs resist slow but the web indicates the mob should be slowable, what can I do?<br />
<br />
A12) Try lower level slows, progressing to higher level slows over time.  Careful not to chain cast, see A10.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q13) The same character dies every time and asks for full buffs after every fight, you are out of mana, what do you do?<br />
<br />
A13) Tell him you have no mana for buffs, change his fighting tactics or leave the raid till he acquires the required resist gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q14) What about pets?<br />
<br />
Q13) Only four pets can engage at any given time, make sure necros and mages get their pets in first.  Otherwise, even if it is only 1000pts of damage, every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q15) Some people carry coffins, what's the point of that if shamans cannot summon corpse?<br />
<br />
A15) CR typically happens at the end of a long night, if it is unlikely a rez is done at the camp and SC is required, get your butt back to the zone in with a coffin, there may be a SK or Necro there which can help you.  This can save an hour at the end of a long night.  If you want to help other members, carry a stack of small coffins to get them back faster if coffins are not enroute.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q16) I can tell that this is a lost cause and at least one cleric has camped, what should I do?<br />
<br />
A16) Remember, restarting the raid after CR takes a long time, you can help by camping with the cleric to get the raiding party going faster with heals after rez and buffs as the members are rezzed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q17) When mages are CoH for raid, how can I help?<br />
<br />
A17) Heal the mage, he/she is most likely using mana rods to gain mana for CoH.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q18) On normal plane raids there are multiple incoming, do I wait for MA to call assist?<br />
<br />
A18) No, get as many slows in as possible as mobs are incoming to help keep the enchanters alive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q19) When should I cast Avatar?<br />
<br />
A19) Due to it’s short lived nature, only immediately prior to the MA engaging the mob, and then on the secondary tank as the spell becomes available again.</div></div><hr />

Yes, buffing on raids is quite complicated... generally, it consists of these steps:<br />
<br />
1).  Someone asking you for a buff.<br />
2).  You giving them that buff.<br />
<br />
Now although this process is quite difficult, do not expect to remember it exactly the first time.  Practice makes perfect, and eventually you too will be able to buff like a pro! <br />
Redspeed, please ignore all advice ever given to you by your mother...  Take a bath with a plugged in hairdryer, stick your fingers in light sockets, play on the interstate during rush hour...  Anything so we don't have to read the useless drivel that spews out of your pie hole.<br />

Wow even I picked up a bit of info today - CHA on the MA affecting DI or Death Pact... maybe not totaly proven but it does make sence. <br />
<br />
There was, for a while, a misconception that it was char on the -caster- of the spell. This certain seems to have been proven unfounded. Casting char on the recepient of the DI/DP spell, well not wholly proven, does have the appearance of working, enough so that we make a point of doing it on all raids.<br />
<br />
Again, none of this is 100% proven, and we could be barking up a completely wrong tree, but general intutition over 1000+ raids tends to lead one to believe we're on the right track.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The new Raid feature makes buffing much easier than before. Here is how I can typically buff the whole raid without any issues. <br />
<br />
/mgb Focus of the Seventh<br />
<br />
Open raid window, target a member of first group and cast group stamina. Repeat this step on all groups in raid. <br />
<br />
There ya go, whole raid is now buffed. Then, for those that die and get ressed, we usually, at least in cleric channel, rebuff soon after folks get resssed back in. We each have a hotkey for this too so we avoid multiple people buffing same person. Target fresh ressed person, hit the /3 On %t! hotkey, then buff them. Works well for the shaman in my guild at least.</div></div><hr />
