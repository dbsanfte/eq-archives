<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I happened to loot one of these today and am about to make a shaman on another account to play with my monk later. Do you think it is worth me giving him since the AC seems very nice to me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi EQW user number one billion, just don't chuckle when you see folks LFGing while you just double box in this game of human interaction ... <br />
<br />
I still can't believe how much noise price of legends made when it came, now it seems everyone is double boxing. Everyone and their mom and dad and 9year old kid. And nobody has problems paying double price (for the double account). Sigh. I wish verant would see this fault in their forced view of &quot;let's force people to group they gonna like it&quot; ...<br />
<br />
Back to the original questio: Ummm yes? I mean it would make more sense to use ac 25 BP than have him run around naked (except if you make barb chick)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I still can't believe how much noise price of legends made when it came, now it seems everyone is double boxing<br />
<br />
<br />
Dual boxing is still half the price of legends.  I dual box, but only in those times when I cant find a group.  I only group with guildies these days anyway - just had too many problems with too many incompetant ninja looting idiots (and with the name change service this is only gonna get worse).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Between me and my wife we have three accounts.  Total cost is $39/month, very comparable to Legends.  However, if we were on Legends we'd have to share an account and could never play together, plus we'd have no way to transfer items or PL ourselves.  I believe we're getting more for our money this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wore a treeweave until level 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wore a treeweave until 55 as well. It's not one of the prettier pieces of equipment you can wear but the 25ac made me happy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dual-box *and* play Legends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Umm thanks for the answers but I do not use EQwin. I have 2 computers that I use 2 acounts on. I have no desire to even know how to use EQwin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&lt;---  Whole family plays.  $ go bye bye.  Only 2 EQ-able PCs, tho.  Thank goodness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hold on a sec Rumar, just because he uses 2 accounts doesnt mean he is a EQWin user, that comment is just a little out of line I think. I use 2 accounts on 2 count em 2 computers... no EQW for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ralahast, I remember from old days, when there was no EQW... those days persons with enough capital to have two computers able to run EQ and shared network etc where just as rare as are torpor/malo drops. Both still happen. I think amount of peeps with 2 puters has also increased bit, but EQW is defently having it's huge footprint stomped on the game as it is. The size of the print just keeps growing day by day...<br />
<br />
Actually I do the same as Kronenbourg. I always look to start groups for guildies, if I need help in that I load up other account till someone needs that spot. But I've seen a lot of cases when duo boxing eats up room from LFG folks and duos go take over camps in dungeons where amount of possible spots to hunt are limited. That sucks. Can you see what happens in OS when necro, discos and what not are all take by just one person duos. And 20 people stand at zone in LFG? Well maybe 10 of those figure out they need EQW too......<br />
<br />
But it's mostly VI's fault imo on making group forming and spot finding / travelling as timeconsuming as it, making duo boxing so damn popular thus. Not to mention that groups need bigger exp bonuses per size than what they now to balance the fact that best exp in this game from 1-60 is made in duos, max trios, by far not in full groups.<br />
<br />
None of this means that I have to like folks who take camps by themselves instead of offering others who go through LFG hell a spot... many of these duo folks are peeps who actually know really well LFG hell, yet they turn blind eye to ones in it not caring ... Mankind.<br />
<br />
I have to apologize for the original poster, cause I'm not sure how he plays. But given my experience.... I think I _might_ be correct too :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nisot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You know, I often read other boards and am always disappointed by them.  I play in an Asia time-zone and often its very hard to find groups so I two box myself.<br />
<br />
In the past I have come to this board to get much needed Shaman Info and have found it to be a great resource.<br />
<br />
Its a pity that Rumar had to hijack this thread and be extremely rude to the original poster.<br />
<br />
Way to foster community and reach out to a fellow Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
I go back to lurking again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye I'm out of line and will shut up. Sorry Sisthar for the highjack and rudness. Indeed erm treeweaver is good absolultely fabulous if you have nothing better :p I used rygorr to 52 or so.<br />
<br />
Never the less if you read my post Nisot, I was kindof hoping you'd get the point that I am just tired seeing duoboxer &quot;solo&quot; and end up leaving out those who don't want/know/can't and LFG. Sometimes duos just make situation worse for them.<br />
<br />
I am not saying you're a bad person for doubleboxing, I'm saying that like obviously you know yourself it's sometimes hard to find groups, so I just hope you use your duoboxing to offer others groups too, not just &quot;solo&quot; and turn the blind eye to folks who /ooc xyz LFG time after time till they get bored. I just hope you do that. Ofcourse you're entitled to do what ever you want.<br />
I hope you use that high moral of yours for good.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I just got fired up, I see many duos in game and tons of posts here. I guess shaman is _the_ pet class of duoboxes so we end up getting most all of these. Shaman puppets spawning to duoboxes.</div></div><hr />

I play Australiasian time zone as well. Finding a group can be hard, too poor/lazy to two box though ;)<br />
<br />
But in a guild 95% in my timezone and the core members are finally into the 50's so have now got regular grouping ;)</div></div><hr />
