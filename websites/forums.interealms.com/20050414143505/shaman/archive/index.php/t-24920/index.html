<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Muidem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok guys, here is the deal. One of my older machines stopped working the other day, and I can't for the life of me figure out why... heres the scoop.<br />
<br />
Was running fine, had been for several days straight, then all of a sudden during an internet surfing spree, the machine shuts off.<br />
I hit the power switch, it fires right back up... with no video signal at all.<br />
<br />
Not only was the monitor not displaying anything, it wasn't recieving any input at all. So I checked the video card/cables and tried again to the same end. <br />
<br />
Next I grabbed a 350w power supply out of a junk box and strapped it on. PRESTO, she came right on. So I went to the store and bought a new power supply (450w) and plugged her in and ran the machine fine for about 2 more days.<br />
<br />
Then BAM, it cuts off again. Hit the power switch, fans come on, no beeps of any kind. So I think power supply again. grab the 350w out of the junk box again, plug it up.. nothing. Fans come on, no video signal.<br />
<br />
So I grab another video card that I know works (radeon 9800 pro) drop it and the same thing happens. So I check and all the cables are snug. I grab out my memory and walk over to the memory tester, memory is working fine. So its not the power supply, video card or memory. <br />
<br />
My next thought is motherboard. I grab a spare that I know works, plug it all in, turn her on and the same thing happens. Im getting frustrated at this point. I unplug all the drives (CD/DVD, floppy, HD) hoping to at least get into bios, turn on the box and no signal.<br />
<br />
So at this point im really really confused and baffled.<br />
<br />
Anyone run into this before or can think of a possibility that I might have overlooked? Any info would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
