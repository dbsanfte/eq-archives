<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kodachi Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was really frustrated and confused by the new objects in the LDoN on my frist few adventures. It seemed no matter what we did the damn things blew up and nearly killed us ;P. So i did a little research and I thought id share the info with you.<br />
<br />
There are 3 types of chests/boxes in the dungons:<br />
<br />
1) Mechanical - these are boxes/chests that can be sensed by bards/rogues, disarmed using the bard/rogue disarm traps skills, and picked using the bard/rogue pick lock skill. <br />
<br />
2) Magical - These are boxes/chests that can be sensedl/disarmed/and unlocked using the Wuggan's spell set used by Necros Mages and Enchanters. Also by the Xalirilan's spell set which can be used by Wizards.<br />
<br />
3) Cursed - These are boxes/chests that can be sensed/disarmed/and unlocked using the Reebo's line of spells useable by Necros Mages Druids and Shamen. As well as the Iony's line of spells useable by Clerics.<br />
<br />
So how do you know what kinda box you have got?<br />
<br />
Here is a rundown of what you should do when you encounter a box:<br />
<br />
The bard/rogue if you have one should Sense Traps. If the message says something like &quot;You cannot tell if the -object- is trapped&quot; then its either a Magical or Cursed Box and the bard/rogue should now leave it alone :P. However if he/she gets a message &quot;You cannot sense any traps&quot; Keep trying to sense traps until you get a &quot;You are certain that an -object- is not trapped&quot; Or &quot;You sense that an -object- is trapped&quot; If you get any of these messages the box is mechanical and should ONLY be touched by a bard/rogue.<br />
<br />
The Cleric/Druid/Shaman/Mage/or Necro should use their Augury spell for sensing cursed traps. You target the object and try to cast your Augury spell. If you get a message &quot;This only works on the cursed&quot; then the box is not cursed and you can leave it alone. If you can cast the spell, find out if its trapped or not.<br />
<br />
The Mage/Necro/Wizard/Enchanter if you have one should use their Augury spell to sense magical traps. I dont have this spell so not sure how the messages work but i assume its similar to the cursed one above. Again if you can cast the spell the box is magical and you should determine if the box is trapped or not before continuing.<br />
<br />
Great now we know what kinda box it is, now what?<br />
<br />
Mechanical - The bard/rogue should try to disarm the trap if the sensed one using their Disarm Traps button. If they sucessfully achieve this then they should try to pick the lock. This is tricky as we were used to picking locks using lockpicks. However this doesn't work in LDoN, you have to make a Pick Lock button similar to the Sense Traps button using the abilities menu. Have the object targeted and hit the Pick Lock button, pretty sure you still need picklocks in your inventory although they can be in a bag. If sucessful at doing this, approach the box and type /open with the box targeted. If you succeeded at everything else this should open the box, give you the &quot;Your party gains experience&quot; message and you can now loot the box like a corpse.<br />
<br />
Cursed - If your Augury spell sensed a cursed trap, use your Remove cursed trap spell to remove it. This spell requires a scrying stone. These can be bought from the Magus in the wayfarer's camps. The Greater Scrying Stone is a little over 17 pp. If you sucessfully remove the trap, use your open cursed locks spell to unlock the chest. If you sucessfully unlock the chest you may approach it type /open with the chest targeted and then loot the chest like a corpse once open.<br />
<br />
Magical - This is the same as cursed boxes except only int casters can open magical chests. Untrapping a magical chest also requires a scrying stone. Make sure you use /open to open the chest after detrapping and unlocking it with spells. Do not ever hit a chest as it can destroy whats inside.<br />
<br />
Now you know how to open chests/boxes ect. Unfortunately there is a bug right now that may prevent some members of a group from opening a chest/box for some reason. It may give you the message &quot;You cannot loot this corpse at this time&quot;. If this happens to you, try logging out and logging back in, this fixed the problem for me.<br />
<br />
PS. /inspect will also give you information on what type of chest it is magical/cursed/or mechanical.  However /inspect has a chance of setting off any traps on the chest.  Also all spells and bard/rogue skills also have a chance of setting off traps when used except the Augury ones on chests that do not match the type of spell.  Clerics are the best at opening cursed chests, Wizards are the best at opening magical chests, and rogues the best at mechanical.<br />
<br />
Good Luck and have fun in LDoN!<br />

Great guide!  Sticky it so I don't have to look for it later!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice write up.  I learned most of this last nite the hard way.  Just wanted to add that if you have a lvl 60 bard in your group I found it wise to have him use group DA and inspect/sense traps/disarm traps while protected.  If a trap goes off, your whole party is 100% safe for about 12 seconds and the bard could use those skills while DA'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The chests etc... that Shaman are able to use their spells on must be few and far between.<br />
<br />
Out of roughly 10 adventures, all of the chests/barrels we have seen have only been castable on by INT versions.<br />
<br />
Every single one has given me the 'This only works on the cursed', while the INT caster in the group was able to cast on practically eveery one of them.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't bother with the spells right now unless you have 180 points to waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here is an easy solution to the boxes, chests, etc:<br />
<br />
Don't touch them until after the adventure. There is plenty of time to deal with them in the 30 minutes after you are done. You don't lose exp from trap deaths but you do lose time. I have yet to find anyting in a container useful besides coin.<br />
<br />
The moving ones are filled with weak bugs so those are ok to deal with. Makes things go faster when you are on a &quot;Kill XX mobs in 90 minutes&quot; adventure. I have gotten up to 3 bugs in a crate. The light blue experience is very poor, but that is 3 easy kills in one spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Now I'm embarassed.. my main is a 65 bard and I haven't thought to use my DA song when trying to disarm/open chests. Great idea, thanks!<br />
<br />
Incidentally, for the trivia buffs, the author of that guide is my wife.  Ah, the joys of an all-EQ family. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rar! i know you from somwhere, bet you cant guess.  Starts with a mac, and ends with an iver.  hmm wait a min....<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about monolith guys :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why are some classes better than others with opening/disarming?   I thought they were the same spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kodachi Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They are the same effect on the spells, but the wizards and clerics have their own private line of spells that only they can learn.  Wizards get a separate magic line from the other int casters, and clerics get a separate cursed line from other casters.<br />
<br />
Every time you cast one of these spells on a chest it has a chance to set off any traps that are on the chest.  Just as if you /inspect the chest you have a chance of setting off the trap.  Clerics have less chance of setting off cursed traps with thier spells, as Wizards have less failures with their magic spells.  Likewise Rogues have better skill in sense drap, disarm and pick locks, so they are less likely to set off a trap than a Bard using the same skills.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ANyone else notice that the only class who can open runes AND curses is necro?   I guess sony knows that people don't often group with em :P<br />
<br />
<br />
  BTW, what is the use of the augry spell?  do you HAVE to use it to disarm?   I figure just blow the pp and cast the disarm spell, save the 60 points of Augery...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I *THINK* you have to detect the spell before you can disarm it. 3 of the casters in my regular group all wanted to buy the spells so I've saved the points for now (can always buy them later), but their conversations would indicate that you need all three.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail,<br />
<br />
Quick supplement to Kodachi's guide...<br />
<br />
The Creaking Crates, while not in the same category as Orcish Chests,  Orcish Weapon Racks, etc, are easy to handle with a little forethought.<br />
<br />
The creaking crates have ~10hp, consider indifferently, and will not respond to the hotkeys OPEN or INSPECT.  <br />
<br />
Move your group away from the creaking crate and send in dogdog to attack the crate.  The most frequent outcomes I've observed so far in my Adventures:<br />
1)  The crate was empty.<br />
2)  The crate spawns one scavenger type mob.<br />
3)  The crate spawns three scavenger type mobs.<br />
4)  The crate spawns an NPC that will thank you for being freed from the crate.<br />
<br />
Dogdog will not aggro any of the hostile mobs spawned from creaking crates.  If you are on a &quot;Destroy XX number of mobs&quot;, the scavengers will count towards your total mob kill count.  Since the crate-spawned mobs are generally lower level than the rest of the standard LDoN mob, these make for easy kills.  If you are on any other type of mission, I personally recommend leaving them unaggroed in place.<br />
<br />
If you free an NPC, have a group member without a pet simply target him and type /say follow.  This works EVEN FOR MELEE classes (Warrior, Rogue, etc) normally not capable of having pets, and I recommend letting them have priority for these.  The NPC pet acts as an enchanter type mob.  They do not have a ton of hitpoints, but free extra DPS is nothing to scoff at.  :cool: <br />
<br />
If you do not have hotkeys for Open/Inspect yet, select an open or rarely used ability button (your old Fishing or Sense Heading buttons for example), and you can create one in about 2 seconds.  Typing /inspect or /open instead will not work on Orcish chests, but the hotkeys will (with varying success).   I would not recommend using these hotkeys until after you have followed the directions for sensing/disarming in the original post in this thread.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My group keeps coming across the problem of not being able to loot the chest once it's disarmed, unlocked and opened.  Everyone in the group gets the &quot;you may not loot this corpse at this time&quot; message.<br />
<br />
I've bugged it every time it happened.<br />
<br />
If one of your group mates camps out and comes right back, they will be able to loot the chest.<br />
<br />
PS...I agree with Vahnisia on waiting until your adventure is over to mess with the boxes. Most of the time the contents only just barely cover the cost of the scrying stone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">After doing 14 of the Rujark missions I am forever sold on the crates... THEY ROCK!<br />
<br />
<br />
   I quit opening with dog-dog because a couple of times I accidently hit them while the group was in range and LOVED the outcome.<br />
<br />
<br />
  The rarest result seems to be that the crate does nothing.<br />
<br />
  The second rarest result is a single scavenger.<br />
<br />
  Rather uncommonly did we get 3 scavengers.<br />
<br />
  Very often... we get free mana or health to everyone in range.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  So lately I have been forcing the groups to all get in range when we pop a crate.   If it is bugs, we can handle 3 easily, and they take a while to aggro, so healers have time to back up and avoid pulling first aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The moving ones are filled with weak bugs so those are ok to deal with.

<br />
<br />
This is actually false information, those bugs in the crates DO NOT COUNT as kills towards your total. <br />
<br />
Best thing to do with the 'creaking crate' is back up a bit, and send in your pet to pop the box.   If there's bug he won't aggro them, and you can then just continue without any hassles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The moving or creaking crates have given helpful things as well.  One mission I was on all the creaking crates were beneificial.  2 of them were heals one was mana.<br />

<br />
Has anyone been able to use their disarming spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>terilor zimorathe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ok 1 thing I have learned doing the LDoN creaking crates was is &gt; I targetted them with my pet and when everyone was out of the room into the next I sent my pet too attack it and he destroys it. Thus way if it explodes or anything my pet takes the heat and the group dont. No one dies or gets hurt except for my pet and their isnt any agro either. I did do a box in another dungeon (forgot which one) and the same thing happened he broke it and no one got hurt.  :D <br />
<br />
So why dont anyone who has a pet try that lil trick see if it works<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Izzymonger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Does the lvl of spell your using matter (lesser, normal, and greater)? It seems ridiculous that at lvl 28 I'm getting 2 points per success and the lvl 24 spells cost 48 APs each. By the time I get enough APs to buy 1 I will be lvl 34 and able to use the Greater line. <br />
<br />
Will the lesser line be successful on the traps I'm facing in my 30s and beyond?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Last night, after 2 group members went LD and were unable to return, I went back to try to open a barrel.<br />
<br />
I inspected and it gave me some text about glowing runes.<br />
<br />
No bard or rogue with us, so I simply pushed the Open button.  No trap, No lock, it just opened right up... coughed up the first item I have seen post-chest improvement patch, a +7 CR aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>TheSneakyGit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I was looking up something today for my Magician and thanks to the variety of classes I've played an interesting thing came to light about the new lines of spells for WIS and INT casters to Sense Traps, Disarm Traps and Pick Locks.<br />
<br />
As a recap...<br />
<br />
LDoN zones can have chests that when safely and successfully opened give XP and often money or items. These chests can be secured with Cursed, Magical or Mechanical traps and locks. Cursed and Magical mechanisms are each vulnerable to two lines of LDoN spells and Mechanical mechanisms are vulnerable to three Bard and Rogue skills.<br />
<br />
More clearly…<br />
<br />
Cursed:<br />
Druids, Shaman and Necromancers use the Reebo's line of LDoN spells<br />
Clerics use the Iony's line of LDoN spells<br />
<br />
Magical:<br />
Enchanters, Magicians and Necromancers use the Wuggan's line of LDoN spells<br />
Wizards use the Xalirilan's line of LDoN spells<br />
<br />
Mechanical:<br />
Bards and Rogues use Sense Traps, Disarm Traps and Pick Locks skills<br />
<br />
So one has to wonder...why two lines of spells? Well I didn't really wonder until I saw the spell definitions for the Wuggan's Greater line of LDoN spells. What caught my eye were the values of the SKILLMAX entries in the spell definitions.<br />
<br />
The values for the spells that Sense Traps and Disarm Traps are 120 and the value for the spell that Pick Locks is 125.<br />
<br />
Do those numbers ring any bells for any Bards out there? Well they did for me so I looked up the spell definitions for the Xalirilan's Greater line of LDoN spells. <br />
<br />
The values for the spells that Sense Traps and Disarm Traps are 200 and the value for the spell that Pick Locks is 210.<br />
<br />
Do those numbers ring any bells for any Rogues out there? Yup you all guessed it, it seems the differing lines of spells to Sense Traps, Disarm Traps and Pick Locks parallel the abilities of Bards and Rogues to do the same.<br />
<br />
So, when considering opening a Cursed or Magical chest in an LDoN zone pause and ask yourself...<br />
<br />
If this was a Mechanical chest would I be comfortable letting a Bard try instead of a Rogue?<br />
<br />
If the answer is no, then you best have a Cleric try to open a Cursed chest and a Wizard try to open a Magical chest because they are the Rogues of the Cursed and Magical chest world.<br />
<br />
Here's the information by spell:<br />
<br />
Druid, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer or Shaman<br />
<br />
Reebo's/Wuggan's Lesser = Sense Traps (69)<br />
Reebo's/Wuggan's Lesser = Disarm Traps (69)<br />
Reebo's/Wuggan's Lesser = Pick Locks (87)<br />
*Equivalent to a level 13-17 Rogue *<br />
<br />
Reebo's/Wuggan's = Sense Traps (72)<br />
Reebo's/Wuggan's = Disarm Traps (72)<br />
Reebo's/Wuggan's = Pick Locks (114)<br />
* Equivalent to a level 14-22 Rogue *<br />
<br />
Reebo's/Wuggan's Greater = Sense Traps (120)<br />
Reebo's/Wuggan's Greater = Disarm Traps (120)<br />
Reebo's/Wuggan's Greater = Pick Locks (125)<br />
* Equivalent to a level 23-24 Rogue and maximum unadjusted skills for a Bard *<br />
<br />
Cleric and Wizard<br />
<br />
Iony's/Xalirilan's Lesser =Sense Traps (115)<br />
Iony's/Xalirilan's Lesser = Disarm Traps (115)<br />
Iony's/Xalirilan's Lesser = Pick Locks (140)<br />
* Equivalent to a level 22-27 Rogue *<br />
<br />
Iony's/Xalirilan's = Sense Traps (165)<br />
Iony's/Xalirilan's = Disarm Traps (165)<br />
Iony's/Xalirilan's = Pick Locks (190)<br />
* Equivalent to a level 32-37 Rogue *<br />
<br />
Iony's/Xalirilan's Greater = Sense Traps (200)<br />
Iony's/Xalirilan's Greater = Disarm Traps (200)<br />
Iony's/Xalirilan's Greater = Pick Locks (210)<br />
* Equivalent to a level 39-55 Rogue and maximum unadjusted skills for a Rogue *<br />
<br />
So in review...A Cleric or Wizard has a significantly better chance to safely and successfully open a chest compared to a Druid, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer or Shaman. As a matter of fact those two classes have almost the same chance with their level 14 spells that the other five classes have with their level 34 spells and I imagine Clerics and Wizards are likely the only ones able to safely and successfully open a Cursed or Magical chest in a high-end dungeon or raid setting.<br />
<br />
I fully admit that these conclusions are drawn strictly from my analysis of the data I’ve found and I have not had a chance to verify my conclusion that Clerics and Wizards do a better job of safely and successfully opening Cursed and Magical chests.<br />
<br />
So if the conclusion bears out or falls flat on its face, please come back and post your successes or failures.<br />
