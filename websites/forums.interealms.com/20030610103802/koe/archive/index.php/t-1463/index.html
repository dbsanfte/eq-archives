<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings Norrathians!<br />
<br />
We have received many letters and emails asking what exactly exploitation<br />
is in light of the recent banning of the guild formerly known as Conquest.<br />
We have compiled a list of known exploits at www.everquest.com, but for your own convenience, here are a few simple rules to go by:<br />
<br />
1. Using the landscape to assist you in any way with the killing of a mob is an exploit.<br />
2. Using spells that do not stack with a mob?s spell line thus rendering the mob incapable of hitting you with his spell(s) is an exploit.<br />
3. Using CoH to clear agro is an exploit.<br />
4. Doing anything without the intended number of people for that encounter (see the list of expected participants in certain encounters at www.everquest.com) is considered an exploit.<br />
5. Agro management is an exploit.<br />
6. Battle rezzing is an exploit.<br />
7. Waiting until X amount of mob life is left before nuking is an exploit.<br />
8. Having casters stand further away than melees is an exploit.<br />
9. Binding and then nuking after death is an exploit.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are considering doing anything and are not sure if it is an exploit, please petition a GM. If the GM determines that what you are considering is an exploit, you will be suspended/banned without warning.<br />
<br />
This latest patch also contains several large changes that we hope will make your gaming experience better.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule and Innoruuk have been upgraded once more. They will now randomly summon and death touch any person in the zone every five minutes. Cazic Thule has been given a 1000 hp damage shield, and Innoruuk can now Lay on Hands three times in an EQ day. Both now wield a non-resistible area of effect disease/fear DOT that will kill those inflicted in under a minute. God levels have now been increased and melee damage upped appropriately. Upon initial agro of the god, all mobs will be respawned and instantly teleport to defend their god. Because we wish to maintain the current influx rate of planes gear and items, these respawned mobs will not have loot.<br />
<br />
The Sleeper will now do a zone wide death touch every five minutes, regardless of whether he is spawned. There are eight warders instead of four, and the warder levels and skills have been upped accordingly.<br />
<br />
All giants in Kael now see invis.<br />
<br />
All mobs in Skyshrine now see invis.<br />
<br />
It has come to our attention that there are Iksar who have actually managed to up their faction enough to be non-kos in cities other than Cabilis. These factions have been reset. Experience loss from death loops due to binds next to kos guards will not be reimbursed. Reversely, all Cabilis factions have been reset for non-iksar.<br />
<br />
In order to reduce camping in Lower Guk and Sebilis, all loot from these zones has been removed and may randomly drop off of any spawn in Norrath.<br />
<br />
All epic quests now require a drop off of either Innoruuk, or Cazic Thule.<br />
<br />
In order to keep variety among the classes, All beneficial spells are now self ONLY. Group spells such as pack regen have not been affected.<br />
<br />
In response to popular demand for rangers to have a once a day ability, rangers can now cast ?revive? on their corpses once an EQ day. We believe this ability follows our Vision for the ranger class. *note: because of this ability?s potential for being overpowered, clerics will no longer be able to resurrect rangers. Other classes abilities to be rezzed are not affected by this change.<br />
<br />
Call of the Hero has been changed. The magician and his target must be able to see each other for the spell to work. Agro wipe will no longer occur when successfully cast.<br />
<br />
The effect on the Singing Steel Gauntlets has been changed from Enduring Breath to Summon Wisp.<br />
<br />
There is now a confirmation box for all Evac spells. The evac will not occur for anyone unless all party members click yes.<br />
<br />
Your group members will now receive a message any time you automatically eat, or drink. A message will also be sent when you open or close a bag.<br />
<br />
If your avatar is standing in one place for more than a minute, any PC you are facing will receive the message ?Soandso is STARING at you?. If you are looking at their back, the message will read ?Soandso is STARING at your BUTT.?<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Wolf is now available to all classes to cast, but because of the power of this spell, a ruby is now required for each cast. This applies to all classes.<br />
<br />
The agro on the snare line has been increased.<br />
<br />
The agro on the Tashani line has been increased.<br />
<br />
The agro on all weapon procs has been decreased, unless you are a ranger.<br />
If you are a ranger, the agro on weapon procs has been tripled.<br />
<br />
Root is no longer available to rangers. This spell line has been replaced with Summon Wisp.<br />
<br />
Evade now has a 10 second ?casting time?.<br />
<br />
Mobs will no longer move away when a PC feigns death. They will stay next to the PC until either the PC gets up or the mobs are killed.<br />
<br />
Necromancers can no longer Feign Death. This spell has been replaced with Summon Wisp.<br />
<br />
Fear and Snare/Darkness no longer stack.<br />
<br />
Guild size is now limited to no more than 30 total accounts. If your guild has more than 30 accounts, it will be deleted in the next guild wipe.<br />
<br />
Our next guild wipe is tommorrow.<br />
<br />
Inspect messages are now more detailed. In addition to ?Soandso is inspecting your equipment?, a message will be sent for every item looked at. IE. ?Soandso is examining your Wurmslayer, Soandso is examining your Fine Plate Greaves.?<br />
<br />
The Clarity spell line has had its mana regen reduced.<br />
<br />
Mez will now break if any spell is cast on the mob.<br />
<br />
Lodizal can now spawn in any zone with a large body of water.<br />
<br />
Wandering Brownies have been added to Kithicor, Wakening Lands, Toxxulia Forest, Swamp of No hope, Trakanon?s Teeth, Emerald Jungle, Burning Woods, and Misty Thicket.<br />
<br />
Brownies now see invisible.<br />
<br />
Griffons of all kinds now see invisible.<br />
<br />
Shadow Guardians now see invisible.</div></div><hr />

i read this same post in another forum earlier this morning...  got to the &quot;All giants in Kael now see invis.&quot; and really began to panic...  Good reading, hehe.<br />
<br />
Rangers get hammered here too...  new revive spell and no ressurects and the triple aggro range for their procs!<br />
/em wonders if that would change Ransure's pulling strategies</div></div><hr />
