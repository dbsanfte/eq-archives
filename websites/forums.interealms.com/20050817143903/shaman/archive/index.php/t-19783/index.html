<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have info on the updated tribute points for items?  I'm not looking for guesses or comments on what Sony should/should not do...only hard numbers on specific items.  (ex:  GSoT now only 500 pts, etc.)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the opal encrusted steins are now worth 24 points instead of 1200.<br />
<br />
Other items I was handing in for 8000 are worth 36. <br />
<br />
I would say they have lowered them significantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It seems like they nerfed everything to make it more in line with their plat values.  For example, Weighty Polearms were giving like 12k points, now they're giving a few hundred.  Fungal Fiend Dewclaws were giving 921, now they're giving 2.  Just another example of Sony releasing an expansion with half baked ideas and zero planning.</div></div><hr />
