<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tatekei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild on Povar has atleast 3 level 65 necromancers 3 60+ Cleric (w/Epic) 1 65 Rogue, Now, my question is, my guild leader is a 65 Necro wo bots a 63 Cleric.  What are prime spots for him to take me to? In this assume that i will have just the Necromancer, no cleric.  I am having trouble narrow-down the places that are worth some alright xp, heres a list.<br />
<br />
Sebilis (crypt/king)<br />
Velketors (Anywhere except castle)<br />
Veksar (forget the room, one where some belt drops *shrug*)<br />
Karnors (Anywhere, except Venril)<br />
Kael (bank and arena area mostly)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on zones not in the list? now i have luclin and LoY but i am an old-school pre-luclin player, have all expansions. Not really afraid to explore a bit, but at the same time, i dont want to do a drastic jum quite yet.  My equipment isnt great (magelo costs money now-adays?!) But i have 208 WIS unbuffed.  W/Kei 233/234 depending on which spear I use (i never leave for anywhere without KEI).  I do not have epic yet (Hard to get the guild together for The Hole and PoF seeing as i am mostly out of the house at work). My HP unbuffed completely is 1307 (played last night, stripped self-and-other buffs)  Completely buffed i can get up to 3237 (Virtue, KEI, Focus of the Seventh, Stamina, Deliriously Nimble, Bramblecoat) and my AC can get to low-900's.  My gear mainly constists of my Jaundiced Bone Breastplate, Gatorscale Leggings, 4th Coldain Shawl, Sheild of Valor (Ranged Extended Enchancement IV), Epic Boots (Black Fur Shoes), , Thurgadin quested Helmet and Gauntlets, etc.  I think i can remember about what my stats are.<br />
<br />
STR 157 (Buffed)<br />
STA 160 (Buffed)<br />
AGI 160 (Buffed)<br />
DEX 180 (Buffed)<br />
WIS 234 (KEI, No Bearform)<br />
INT 120 (KEI, doesn't matter)<br />
CHA 107 (Buffed, WIS gear on)<br />
<br />
Resists- Equipment only<br />
All base +20 Except MR (+8)<br />
<br />
Resists- Equipment and Buffed)<br />
<br />
All Base +65 Except MR (+53)<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

First of all, give away all your gear to a nice Troll, the gear is just going to slow you down. Now, go and try to solo Ran Flamespinner in HHK, dont mem gate btw it is just going to take up spell slots.<br />
<br />
Aere, refugee troll with a grudge...<br />
<br />
<br />
(You need to drop Wis items and get HPs items seriously, I got 600 more hp then you unbuffed. And you should do nobles and bards camp in HHK until you hit 54 if you want to solo. Then head for Nadox in LOY for instance, I am a bit stuck myself on 54.)<br />
<br />
EDIT bit fast there, forget HHK as a duo, go to LOY instead, plenty of good spots and you can get some of your nice LOY spells here too.</div></div><hr />

Trolls are butt ugly - frogs ain't pretty but at least they have a cool casting animation!<br />

I'm not sure you need to drop wis but whenever you can you should do some upgrades to gear that have +sta/hp while keeping your wis up there.  I have 214 wisdom (14 from augs) and also have a high stamina and nearly 2k hp.<br />

You already have quite a list of places to duo - and many of those places should be pretty good.  Personally, I would prefer to duo with someone closer to my level.  From what I understand, xp is distributed according to level so a high level partner might take most of the xp - unless you're fighting greens to him.<br />
<br />
I duo Acrylia Caverns with a beastlord friend of mine.  It's pretty good xp and the loot isn't bad either - you get tons of lightweight sellables, the occasional crap drop that sells for nice plats, and boatloads of acrylia that probably sells well in the bazaar (depends on your server economy).  The only catch here is that the acrylia is heavy - so you need both carrying capacity and WR containers.<br />
<br />
You could check out eqatlas and look for zones with the level ranges you desire.</div></div><hr />
