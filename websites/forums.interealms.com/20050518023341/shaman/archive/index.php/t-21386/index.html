Says that the new expantion will tie your max lvl into how many aa you have.<br />
<br />
ie: you will have to have 100 aa to even be able to xp to 66 and 200aa to xp to 67 etc.. <br />
<br />
They were not sure of the exact amount of aa which opens up 1 more lvl but you all get the idea.<br />
<br />
If they do this, I might quit eq.<br />

I'm a bit confused by this. What do you mean by Paper Tigers? Such a plan could only hurt the more casual gamer. Any power gamer who would blow through the new levels anyway will have the necessary AA to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily Gloriana..... <br />
<br />
If you are talking hardcore gamer then yes, the type of person who is on 12 hours a day and grinds often when not raiding.....<br />
<br />
If you consider the average hardcore gamer who works for a living and uses the block of time they have in the evening to raid then you will see a hardcore gamer with a tight schedule. Unless I am in a particularly wierd guild, on a strangely unbalanced server there are a lot of folks like this. 100-200aa. I personally shudder to think how many aa I have NOT GOT because I spend the majority of my time raiding. :)<br />
<br />
If this were implemented it could strain guilds. Who wants a level 65 shaman if you can spend 1 week backflagging a set of level 70 shaman in a month or so. It could cause anarchy. lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, being in a hard core raid guild I spend most of my time &quot;not loosing experience&quot;.  Add to that the need to get through trials with lots of death, and you don't get much experience in your first 20 - 30 h of play a week.  And I at least rarely get much more then those in - still at 250 odd AA and raising very slowly.  So if that scheme comes through I'd be hard pressed to make 68 by fall. Now if they go 50 AA per level I'm fine :).</div></div><hr />

I'd heard the same thing, from a bard in my guild who is usually right on the money when it comes to the dividing line between rumors and truth. Quite honestly, I'm not sure how they'd do it. Lots of folks are already max AA, and, under the assumed system, would be able to blow right through to 70 and be done with it. Perhaps SOE will add a new set of AA abilities tacked onto the ones we already have, and say once you've got max original AA, you must have, say, 50 of the &quot;new&quot; AA in order to advance to 66, 50 more to advance to 67, etc.<br />
<br />
Does it matter? Meh. I'm not really concerned at this point. The rumor mill doesn't usually produce much I'm interested in anyway. I'm willing to wait and see what happens when the expansion is released.<br />

<br />
<br />
You just described me to a T.  141aa, when I am not traveling on business or spending the evening with my family, I'm in Time or GoD.  I spent last night killing Quarm, and I've been playing this game for four years, but a college kid with fewer playskills in a lower end guild can blow past me in AAs easily.  That has been my complaint for a while.  When I started, and I made 30, I was proud and that had some difficulty.  Now the game has little difficulty, just more time sinks.  <br />
<br />
This seems to me a symptom of the type of thought process that has led to changes in this game that I dislike, so I'd be REALLY unhappy if they implement it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Compare it to PoP, where 1 level in the 61-65 range is about the xp of 6 AA. Equating a level with 100 AA would be really out of whack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It might be necessary to have something like this to stop people leveling to 70 overnight and then finding that they have no content to xp for the purposes of making aa. That was the problem with PoP, everyone got herded into one or two zones. If they instituted something like this it would stop that sort of thing from happening, so it might well be true. I think that once you see past the &quot;need&quot; to level to 70, and focus more on playing the game and developing your character, a system like that seems more reasonable. The people who will be most disadvantaged of course will be the keen amateur raider, who spends a large part of their online time raiding. That will be offset to some extent by having access to high zem zones, and the equipment that allows them to be effective there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">keen amateur raider, who spends a large part of their online time raiding<br />
<br />
erm Tugela, you make it sound like anyone who spends the majority of their online time raiding and not grinding xp is an excitable semi-skilled raider. You missed the point. <br />
<br />
The raider who spends the majority of their time raiding is simply a person with a tight timeline whos playtime is mainly spent in pursuit of raiding with their guild. It has no bearing on their skill, or their keen-ness to play EQ.<br />
<br />
It is pretty arguable after 200aa that the rest are somewhat fluffy anyway. There aren't that many that will make you a better player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I understand a certain segment of the population really wanting something like this to be put in place, and I can even sympathize with it a bit - there are a lot of people at level 65, and they range from bazaar geared freshly minted Barons to the top end of the no-life but 9k hp unbuffed crowd.  :)  It's hard to know what you're getting when you invite a random 65 to your group.<br />
<br />
That sympathy aside, I'm writing this off to wishful thinking on some people's part, or to folks trying to stir up some angst before the expansion releases.  <br />
<br />
And I think I have the perfect paper tiger :)  I decided I wanted my warrior's Marshall title, so I spent 12 points in archetype and then the rest in class, with some points in PoP abilities that looked cool.<br />
<br />
So he may be a 65 AND a Marshall, but he's got almost NO defensive AAs - ND3, CS1, CA1, PE is it.  I'm working on those now, but until I get them up to par he'll LOOK a lot tougher than he really is.  :)</div></div><hr />

This would be a stupid idea if you ask me. First i had to get flags to exp with my friends and by the time i got them they moved on. So now i have to grind HOURS and HOURS of usless AA so i can reach 70 so i can EXP with my friends. <br />
<br />
Again, this is a rbad idea and would i think put the nail in my coffin. Right now i have canceled my billing. Im watching to see if there is a reason to start it up again. This would effectivly turn my attention from EQ and focus me on where im going next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is entirely my point Uggok. Those xp zones are still behind locked doors, the only difference is that this time we know that is the case, unless they release a ton of new zones with the expansion. So the problem experienced in PoP is likely to be repeated unless there is some mechanism to apply brakes to people leveling. And in any case, someone with 500 aaxp has obviously spent more time leveling than someone with 10, so there is no real reason why the latter should proceed to 70 at the same rate. A system like that would basically apply a retroactive recognition of work previously done.<br />
<br />
In any case, there is something to be said for leveling up being a rare experience to be savored, that you spend a lot of time working towards. Don't you remember the feeling of elation when you leveled between 50 and 60 in the Kunark/Velious era? It was something that was hard won and a measure of personal achievement. Going from 60 to 65 in PoP wasnt the same. People basically did that in a week, once they got past the exe trial. The only way to do that is to make these levels require a whackload of killing, and the only way to relieve the tedium of that is to allow sub-objectives in the form of aa skills to serve as carrots ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Yes, if they introduce an expansion that expands the level cap to 70 and do not include a significant number of xp zones for level 66+ characters that are relatively easy to gain access to, that would be bad.<br />
<br />
Also, water is wet.<br />
<br />
You are proceeding from the premise that the next expansion will have at best a zone or two for xp that is easily accessible.  I think that the fact that SoE unlocked a bunch of previously locked PoP zones (no, many of those zones are not still behind locked doors) indicates that they realized the PoP model was a mistake.  I think that even SoE is smart enough to look at the following facts:<br />
<br />
-We raised the level cap in Kunark and included a number of easily accessible xp zones for 51-60 and everything went pretty well on the crowding front<br />
<br />
-We raised the level cap in PoP and included a couple utterly ****ty 61-65 (especially 63+) xp zones that were easily accessible and we also tinkered with the xp curves to brutally punish xp'ing anywhere else and the result was possibly the single biggest cluster&amp;^%$ we have ever endured<br />
<br />
and NOT conclude &quot;hey, let's do the exact same thing we did in PoP!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Maybe I give them too much credit.  I certainly don't think that they will design any xp zones of a quality comparable to those released in Kunark.  The current team obviously lacks the time, talent, and/or desire to do so.  But I would be shocked if they did PoP all over again.  Especially since it seems that even the bleeding-edge raiders will not have completed GoD (or even that SoE will have finished GoD) when the expansion comes out, which means you can expect less of a raiding focus.  At the very least they'll have a number of shoddily thrown together LDoN style instanced zones for the expansion.</div></div><hr />

I myself do not want to stop AA's for a month just to get to 70.  I would like to kill two birds with one stone.<br />

On the other hand they cannot make it 100AA per level.  15-30AA is more reasonable.  <br />

<br />
Make the new AA part of the requirement for leveling. but do not have seperate XP pools. <br />
<br />
Or. You get 25 of the new aa you get the level. Then at 50 you get 68 Then at 75 you get 69 and 100 you get 70. Then any above are gravy.<br />
<br />
That would allow people to have the Incremental advancement of new aa. But also the sustained leveling curve as well that would not limit People to the best path.<br />
<br />
What do yall think. And any Proposed AA (Warning Tounge in cheek to follow.<br />
<br />
Like for 15 AA. We get <br />
<br />
Healing of the Devout.  With this AA you are More in tune with the healing energies of the Spirits. All direct heals and Heals over time get a 25% increase in effectiveness.<br />
<br />
For another 15 AA We could get <br />
<br />
Curse of the damned. With this AA your detrimental spells are so malicious and Focused that they have a innate -50 to thier Resist checks. And an increased 50% Duration.<br />
<br />
Then for 25 AA<br />
<br />
Spiritual Ferocity.<br />
<br />
With this AA the shaman are so In tune with the spirits of thier ancestors that they take combat advice from the long dead heroes of old. They gain double attack skills and a Bump to paladin Combat tables. but retain thier 200 WEapon skill. Also recived is the main hand damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Or for 25 AA <br />
<br />
Calling of the Heyokah. The shaman can call into being the Spirits of the Warders of the beastlords. They gain a Beastlords pet. With very slightly lessened ability. (Like maybe 10% Less. As comparable to our slow differance.)<br />
<br />
Or by far my Favorite. <br />
<br />
Shades of Heroes Return. In a fit of madness the shaman calls upon all the spirits of the dead. All the knowledge of the lords of the nether realms flows ******d, imbueing living allies with vigor and skills unmatched in this modern day. Not MGBable Gives you a group buff. It adds 200 Attk. +20 Strikethrough +20 avoidance +20 Cleave +20 Main hand damage bonus. Lasts 3 Minutes and is affected by Extension focuses and AA. Recharge 1 hour. <br />

<br />
Why would people who still don't have their GoD expansion flags and spells pay for more zones they can't get to and more spells they might not get for months, or even years?  If that's indeed how it's going to work?<br />
<br />
But maybe it will be more sensible.  They'd have to have SOMETHING to draw people in.  Besides false or misleading advertising, that is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  I still haven't figured out a &quot;must have&quot; reason to buy Gates, my problems w/ its continued reliance on denied content via flagging aside.  SOE's marketing machine is breaking down as well it seems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With regards to the paper tigers, I've experienced this many times in groups.  It probably doesn't happen much for those in raiding guilds, but I end up meeting these people often when grabbing bodies for adventures or groups.<br />
<br />
/who all 65 lfg doesn't show AA titles.  Guildtags used to give me a rough idea of what someone's gear ought to be, but lately even that has been off because of all the new recruits (invites/probies) to replace attrites.  You think you've built a good group, and then realize 2 of the Barons are in horrible gear w/ no AA's which means the rest of the group may end up carrying them through (until I can gracefully exit).<br />
<br />
395 AA's for me at the moment, so personally even if the rumor is true I doubt I'd be affected.  I think for the casual gamer this is actually a good plan to brake advancement until a player is ready, but for the semi-hardcore raider who doesn't grind much except to recover lost exp, this will be a major slap in the face if it happens depending on where they set the AA bars.<br />
<br />
I don't think 50 AA per level would be that bad really.  It means VERY few people (albeit alot of charmers) are going to be level 70 a week after release of the next expansion, giving it more longevity.  <br />
<br />
Though I can definitely see people with 100-150 aa's right nowwho have been raiding steadily (and not grinding) for 1-2 years becoming very angry when they learn they need to grind a TON just to get to the next level.   Especially with the dearth of really useful AA's above the ~250 mark, the anticipated timesink may cause even more people to leave in droves.<br />
<br />
I'll file this one in the &quot;weapons from velious are going to melt if you take them off the continent&quot; folder. <br />
LOL. Loved that. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

As long as it took me to get one character to 65 (my rogue), I'm not exactly enamored with the idea of raising the level cap again.  The hardcore gamers will want the extra 5 levels, but will also be using the zones.  The average casual gamer won't set foot in these zones anytime soon, and will probably also resist leveling to 70.  <br />
<br />
SOE will have to throw the casuals another bone if they want us to buy OoW.  Of course, I haven't purchased GoD yet either....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">They have dumbed down every single aspect of the game.  So now they are going to force you to have X amount of aa's to get to 70?  This is the most ludicrous thought I have ever heard.  There is NO, None, Zero percent chance that this will be true.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">If I have 350 AA (which I do) that doesnt necessarily make me a better shaman or more deserving of being level 66 that someone who has 150 AA.  It just means I had more time on my hands.<br />
<br />
<br />
My point exactly.  The shaman in my guild who is arguably the most skilled (and the best geared, because she raids ALL the time!) has less than 100 aa.  She could kick my butt and not even break a sweat. :D  Making it where she can't make 70 without cranking 415 aa is even more crazy than making me crank 350 aa to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Following the advice on these boards, I shot up to 65 with minimal AAs.  Let's say I was a surprise to pickup groups when I showed up with a baron's title and none of the level 65 spells because the cost was way over the top, and no canni 5.  <br />
<br />
Y'all were right though, leveling to 65 was still the best thing to do - the availability of high end spells outweighs all the AAs, even canni 5 (but not by much).<br />
<br />
I have no problem either way with this.  I still have not decided whether to go for levels or stick with getting the more essential AAs in any case - at least 'till I see what the higher levels buy me.</div></div><hr />

This reply has no meaning whatsoever, but I do find it hard to believe this would even be implemented, no logic or meaning behind my opinion but....we have seen a pattern of asinine stuff in the past from SoE, at least put some effort into fixing current bugs man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Hmm some peoples suggestions earlier in this thread about reducing the number of places you can exp, remember there should still be Ldon on top of that It will be interesting to see whether Ldon actually increases to account for level 70 players or caps at level 65 players. If the mobs provided is the same as those provided for level 65 players, it could make Ldon hard a viable option for casual players at level 70. Personally, I think this aa/level idea could be ok, if perhaps if it scaled like a previous poster suggested. It would at least then seperate the veteran players and the players who have just levelled up to 65 overnight.</div></div><hr />

When the planes were closed, uberguilds would xp in Bot and it was awesome xp.. but once it was opened suddenly &quot;we want elemental access xp here sucks why spend 1.5 hours getting an aa instead of 1&quot;..</div></div><hr />
